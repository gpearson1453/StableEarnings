Footnotes
HERE WEGO saved ground just off pace, rallied to the lead early stretch, drifted out through deep stretch and won under strong handling. THE MINIT I SEE
U raced five wide on the turn, split rivals in stretch and was just up for place. CASTLE CASANOVA came in and bumped HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS
leaving the gate, moved up between foes, closed well. MAJESTIC JAZZ alternated for command two wide and faded late. FLAT RATE saved ground while
never far back then weakened. DELINQUENT broke slowly then raced very wide and wasn't a threat. HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN dueled for command
inside then had little left. HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS, fractious in the gate, was bumped then bobbled after the start, saved ground, steadied when
bothered by loose horse near quarter pole. FRANK'S LEGACY had only brief speed. WON THE CASE broke in the air then unseated his rider. AFTER
SEVERAL INCIDENTS IN THE OPENER, THIS RACE WAS DELAYED SEVEN MINUTES.

Footnotes
MARCH SCREAMER broke slow, raced in the three path early, split rivals on the far turn, looped the field with a strong run approaching the stretch and won
going away. SARGEANT DRIVE was forced out leaving the gate and then was very wide early, moved in gradually, swung out again entering stretch and
gained place. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE saved ground just off the pace, swung out for stretch run but had no late kick. TU EXAGERES, in the four path early,
raced between foes through stretch and was too late. BEAU TRACE raced wide and challenged on the turn then gradually fell back. BIG BAD BUD came
out leaving the gate, vied three wide then tired. GRAN CAUSEWAY was two wide and not far back, drifted out through stretch and tired. IT'S PAZIBLE,
racing between foes dueling for command, tired. EL DULZURA was between rivals early and then was left with the rail on the turn and tired. KING'S
CASTLE raced wide and tired. BILL'S MAFIA had brief speed. OVERBOLD showed little.

CONFIRMED GENIUS bobbled at the break, stalked the leader, chased on the turn, rallied in upper stretch, finished well but second best. LEADER OF THE
BAND raced off the pace between rivals, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and earned the show spot. CHELSEA WALL broke outward, stalked
three wide, chased three wide on the turn, made a mild bid and weakened. H M HOLLYWOOD tracked inside, chased inside on the turn and tired. ELF'S
TUNE raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
LI'LBITO'CHARM was four then two wide, quickly took the lead leaving the quarter pole, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and extended while fully
extended. JAFFLE set the pace just off the rail, was no match for winner but was clearly best of the rest. LADY MISTRESS raced between rivals early,
swung out very wide into stretch and passed tiring foes. MRS. PHELPS, three wide and just off the early pace, tired. EZ ON THE EYES raced wide and
failed to be a serious threat. LIGHT OF HOPE was inside early, angled out on the turn and wasn't a factor. DRIVER'S LICENSE was never a serious threat.
ROCKFORD GIRL, who needed a shoe repair in the paddock, raced wide and was no factor. PABLO'S DREAM was extremely wide and showed little.
RISQUE'S TREASURE, two wide and just off the pace, tired. MISSING HOOVER saved ground dueling for the early lead then stopped. BEST SECRETS
KEPT broke slowly then stumbled soon after then trailed.

Footnotes
THE ROBERT drop back last entering the first turn, split rivals when rallying after a half mile, rallied very wide on the final turn and into stretch and was just
up. IN EQUALITY also split rivals on the far turn and then went wide, took the lead briefly in deep stretch but was outfinished, racing pretty much under his
own courage. HOLIDAY BONUS, bumped leaving the gate, split rivals nearing the three eighths marker, went three wide and challenged near the quarter
pole, took the lead in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MACHTREE saved ground in second flight and weakened late. KINGSVILLE stalked the pace
two wide then weakened late. ASPHALT PAVING saved ground dueling for command and faded through deep stretch. BOB'S MY UNCLE split rivals on the
far turn but failed to sustain his bid. FLAT BILL was never a serious threat. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ, a bit antsy in the starting gate, came out and bumped
HOLIDAY BONUS at the break, raced two wide in second flight then stopped. COLONIST showed nothing.

Footnotes
SALLY O'PRADO steadied after the start, raced in the four path while outrun early, split rivals on the turn then angled out for the stretch and took the lead in
deep stretch. CHEVY TO THE LEVY saved ground early, moved between foes on the turn then went back to rail, held a clear lead mid stretch but couldn't
last. RISQUE EXPRESS saved ground just off the pace, eased out leaving the turn and held on well. BON HEIR saved ground early, took up off heels far
turn, eased out for the stretch and was too late. SUPERLING, very wide early, moved to the rail and failed to menace. TRAPPE ME LATER was in the three
path dueling for the lead then tired. CONGRESSIONALSTORM broke in a tangle, raced outside winner on the turn then gave way. IF YOU ONLY KNEW
was very wide and no threat. PANSY was well placed while wide then tired. BEAUTIFUL SUCCESS was wide and had only brief speed. ENIGMATICA,
racing in the six path early, was finished after a half. TO THE FLAG broke in a tangle, recover to duel for the lead between rivals then stopped.
