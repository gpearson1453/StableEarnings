Footnotes
LIL HITCHHIKER chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead once
straightened then drew away. THIRST TRAP trailed into the far turn, continued to trail while moving from the two to the four path approaching the quarter
pole, swung into the lane from the six or seven path then moved up to be clear for the place spot. ORLEANS was in the two path through the far turn when
reserved, gained momentum into the lane while in the six path and moved up for the minor share. YES I'S A MILLER pressed the pace then settled back to
chase the leader through the turn, bid two wide into the lane then weakened after straightening. SPECIAL CONQUEST was in the two or thee path through
the far turn, came into the lane from the two path and never was a factor. SASSY ZEEMAN set the pace through the far turn while along the inside then
gave way once headed. ROLLOVER RISK was in the four path through the first turn, continued in the three or two path into the lane then tired.

Footnotes
ROUGHIN THE CITY chased the pace from the three path into the turn, made a quick move three wide near the three-eighths pole, cleared while under
minimal urging in late turn, was asked for more when straightening in the lane and drew off while being kept to the task under a strong hand ride.
FIFTYFIVE STRONG was squeezed back at the start, raced in the three path through the turns when never far back, came into the lane from the five or six
path and just got up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. BULL HOLLOW chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid two wide
near the three-eighths pole, was roused when being passed by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, continued under a drive into the lane then
chased the top one and just got nailed for the place spot. TREATIES trailed into the far turn while near the inside, came off the rail and into the two or three
path through the far turn, was roused into the lane while angling to the seven path and never was a factor. DRAW THE LINE was along the inside through
the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. COCKALORUM was never a factor while racing near the inside through the turns. DODGER set the pace
into mid-turn, was passed by two rivals near the three-eighths pole then was suddenly done approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
FIELD DAY gained the lead at once, raced on a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane, shook up and quickly extended the advantage to the
eighth pole and was ridden out. CUZ was along the inside through the turn and into the lane then was under a steady drive to gain the place spot. SPEND
BENJAMINS chased the winner through the turn and into the lane then weakened and lost the place spot. EL SEGUNDO raced in the two path through the
turn and into the lane, moved up and was no threat to the top ones. EVIE was never a factor while saving ground. LIGHTNING ROD CARL chased the pace
from the three path through the turn then tired in upper stretch. COACH HUDSON broke close to the others then was void of speed, raced in the three or
four path through the turn when far back then was asked for run through the lane while well behind.
