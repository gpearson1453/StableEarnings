MINDOFMYOWN pressed the pace four wide, assumed command on the turn, drew clear, was under pressure late and held well. PINK SKY pressed along
the inside, backed up on the turn, angled out in the upper stretch, closed willingly and gained late to narrow the gap. FLIGHT SONG pressed the pace
between horses, fell back on the turn, finished evenly and held safely for show. LET IT ROLL veered in at the start to be off slowly, trailed the field and
offered a mild bid to improve position. SKY VUE settled behind the pace, angled out on the turn, bid five wide and had little left for the drive. SHUG'S BEST
set a pressured pace to the turn, tired and gave way.

Footnotes
SEXY BIKINI MODEL led throughout, was under pressure late and held well. SHORT POCKETS raced close to the pace inside, bid along the rail, closed
steadily and couldn't get by the winner in a good effort. MOVIN ON pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back, continued willingly
to the wire and earned show. OROGRANDE moved up to press the pace three across, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back, bid and didn't have enough
late. HENNESSY EXPRESS bumped at the start, went five wide on the first turn, was never far back, went seven wide entering the stretch and lacked the
needed late rally. MOVIN' ON BYE bumped at the start, saved ground and failed to menace in a steady effort. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY was outrun.

Footnotes
LINE CALL raced close to the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to mid stretch and drew clear. SASSY GAL pressed the pace along the
inside, was steadied on the turn, fell back, angled out and finished well to get up for place. COMIC HOT TODDY set a pressured pace, responded when
challenged to duel, was unable to sustain her bid and settled for show. QUATRO pressed the pace three wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back,
weakened and faded from contention. ATHENA'S STORM saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid six wide and had little left for the drive. DESTINY WHO
was never far back, angled in on the turn, bid and came up empty. RAGTIME RYTHM broke slowly and was steadied at the start, checked on the turn and
gave way.
