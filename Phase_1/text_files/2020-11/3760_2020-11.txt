Footnotes
THURSDAY stalked the leader outside, bid to the front into the stretch and edged away under steady urging. MAVILUS outrun early, saved ground
throughout and closed well too late. FAST LANI hustled to a clear lead inside, was collared at the quarter pole and gradually weakened. ANGINETTI chased
outside, made a brief rally on the turn then flattened out. GOING GOING GONE bobbled at the start, raced wide and was no threat. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ
was urged just off the pace inside then began fading on the turn. COOL ENOUGH prompted the leader to the turn then stopped abruptly.

POLITY took the lead at once, ran freely in front in the three path, extended mid stretch and was under pressure to the wire. COURT SKY raced outside
chasing and was unable to keep pace. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL raced wide and passed tiring foes. SPARTAK failed to be a serious threat. PIGGYBANK
was three wide and just off the pace then tired. WOODHAVEN KID saved ground and tired badly. CENTSMYBABYLEFTME had brief speed. BETTS broke
slowly then showed little.

between rivals, continued well but proved no match for the winner. SONG OF HONOR bumped at the start while breaking slowly, advanced outside with a
mild rally. MAGICAL MESA vied inside briefly, dropped back before half a mile and was no threat. CAPTIVA STAR settled inside off the leaders and lacked
a rally. LA MAMA CHULA earned a narrow advantage for half a mile then gave way. MIZSHIPMAN broke slowly, raced wide and weakened. CIARRAI ABU
came out at the start bumping rival then stopped abruptly. TISTAAHAL dropped back early and lost contact with her field.

Footnotes
STRICTLY THE BEST came out and bumped INSPIRING JUSTICE, was in the five path while outrun early, moved in on the turn, swung wide into and
through stretch and was along in time. TOMASCO set the pace in three path, drew off mid stretch but then just failed. BIG RAY saved ground early, split
rivals through the stretch and was too late. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD, racing just off the rail and just off the pace, had no rally. FROST'S SONG raced
between rivals in second flight then tired. ASHRAQ raced very wide and tired. G DADDY saved ground in second flight then stopped. REPEATED
PROMISE, very wide, showed little. UNCLE TONY P was also very wide and no factor. INSPIRING JUSTICE, bumped leaving the gate, was three wide and
outrun. As per ruling 20177pp from the Pa Racing Commission, STRICTLY THE BEST was dq'ed and placed last for a positive test.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RISK outrun early, angled inside, came out rallying into the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. TRUE UPGRADE pursued the loose
pacesetter inside, reached even terms in mid stretch and continued gamely. HERO FOR HIRE dropped back early, advanced very wide, led briefly in the
stretch but was outfinished. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT trailed early, swung wide in the stretch and closed well while no threat. ATLANTIC AVENUE raced
just off the leaders outside, faded on the turn but came again willingly. THATTA BOY GIRL quickly sprinted clear inside but proved empty in the stretch.
SEEKING SHAMROCKS balked at loading delaying the start, bid between foes on the turn then faltered. VICTORIA E was urged close up outside early
then gradually weakened.

mild handling. TIVANO raced very wide and held onto place. FLAT OUT FLYING broke in a tangle and was rank early, saved ground to the final turn, swung
out very wide and was no real threat. MARDEN raced two wide and was never a serious threat. AHSAD saved ground just off the pace then tired. SKIPIN
ON ORCHARD, also saved ground and tired. KADENS COURAGE dueled for command inside winner then stopped. ORBERT appeared to in distress on
the backstretch, lost contact with the field on the final turn, was pulled up near the sixteenth pole and vanned off.

Footnotes
THE KING CHEEK took control at once, held rival safe and remained clear throughout while drifting out late driving. MR. DODA pursued the winner inside,
angled out in the stretch and continued gamely to the finish. INDIAN LAKE chased wide throughout and finished well while no match for the top pair. CALL
ME G Q broke very slowly, rushed between rivals to contention then moved inside in the stretch. IRON LAD raced just off the leader outside then began
fading on the turn. SPIRIT WOLF ducked out sharply at the start then offered some late energy. CLICKCLICKCLICK dropped back inside and was never in
contention. VOY A TI broke sluggishly, chased between rivals and gave way. MAC AND BREEZE angled inside early then weakened steadily.
HOLLYWOOD JET was a late scratch on the advice of the track veterinarian.

Footnotes
CALL ME DADDY raced outside and took the lead near the quarter pole and pulled away under steady pressure. DOUBLE CHUBBLE, between rivals early,
drifted out leaving the turn and gained place. ROAN MOUNTAIN was bumped by SHORELINE in furlong and again near the half mile marker, raced wide
and was no threat. YOUR AWESOME BOSS set the pace just off the rail before tiring. BEBEAU broke slowly and passed faders. VERO SUN broke slowly
and showed little. MISSION OBERON broke slowly, saved ground and tired. MY DANZIG PARTNER was two wide dueling for the early lead then had little
left. SHORELINE came out leaving gate bumping ROAN MOUNTAIN, bumped that rival again on the backstretch.

LOVE ON FIRE set a pressured pace inside, repelled challenges and edged away in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE made a menacing bid three
wide on the turn, loomed a threat but weakened in the final eighth. STORMBEAM settled off the leaders, moved wide in the stretch and rallied just missing
the place. COTTON CANDY CUTIE vied with the winner outside to the stretch and weakened. GOSSIP ISLE chased between foes early, was blocked on
the turn then proved empty when clear. BABY BAM BAM urged close up inside, was blocked and steadied near the top of the stretch and faded.
KARABESSA dropped back early, moved inside on the turn and lacked a rally. ASK SIRI raced off the pace and weakened steadily. SALLY O'PRADO
lacked speed and was never in contention. MIDNIGHT SKY raced far behind throughout.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY RED set the pace in the four path, was clear mid stretch and won under mild handling. E J'S REVENGE was two wide and not far back,
angled out near the quarter pole and held place. SCOOBYDOOPAPA, in the four path and just off pace, fell back a bit near stretch, continued inside and
had no late rally. TRUSTING FRIEND broke slowly, saved ground, took up in tight near quarter pole, eased out and failed to threaten. HIZAAM, well off the
rail and unhurried early, failed to menace. BANG THE DRUM broke slowly, was far back early, swung very wide into stretch. CALL WIL saved ground just
off the pace, split rivals in stretch and was no factor. BADUKE broke slowly, was in the five path early, angled to the rail at the top of the stretch, bothered.
TRUSTING FRIEND. SO HOT broke slowly, raced wide and never threatened. GAULTIER (FR) had some speed while very wide then tired. INKY DINKY
DO was extremely wide prompting the pace then gave way. NICO BREE N TEEJ dueled for command between rivals then stopped.
