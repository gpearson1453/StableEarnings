Footnotes
AUTOMATE stalked the pace while racing inside, rallied on the turn to assume command, drew away for a clear lead, was under pressure late and held well
under urging. PARADISE PRIDE was in traffic on the first turn and along the backstretch, angled in and got through along the rail on the turn, shifted out,
went willingly to the wire and narrowed the gap. JAMMINWITHBRANDON set the pace to the second turn, fell back, leveled off and held safely for show.
MY GOOD MAN broke slowly and was rated back, trailed the field, rallied five wide on the second turn, dropped back inside and came up empty in the drive.
BACKWOODS BOOGIE pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, weakened and dropped back. GEMO RAIN stalked the pace,
challenged four across on the second turn, had little left and gave way.

FIVE CARD DRAW set the pace with a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. INVEST chased the pace while racing inside, lacked the needed late
response and prevailed for place. MEO DESPERADO stalked the pace while racing three wide, bid willingly to loom a threat, didn't have enough late and
settled for show. MR. CHESAPEAKECITY bobbled a bit at the start while getting away well, stalked the pace while racing between horses, was taken back
on the turn, angled out, swung five wide and leveled off in the drive. G MAN raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. SPECIAL INTENTION
saved ground, lacked a bid and was outrun. FANTASIZE stumbled at the start to be off slowly and trailed the field.

Footnotes
GUNS BLAZING pressed the pace while racing along the inside, shifted out on the turn, bid between horses, closed steadily, got up near the eighth pole
and drew off. CAJOLE awaited room into the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, angled in for the drive and closed to get up for place. SPEED LANE
raced mid pack outside, rallied four wide entering the stretch, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. MET IN MIAMI saved ground to the turn, angled out,
bid six wide and finished well. POTION set a pressured pace, drew clear leaving the turn and was unable to sustain her bid. SHOOTINFORTHEMOON
stalked the pace, bid and came up empty. DANCIN AT THE RITZ broke awkwardly, trailed the field, got through inside on the turn and failed to rally. MY
MAGGIE MOO raced close to the pace inside, got boxed in entering the turn, dropped back and gave way.

Footnotes
GALE set the pace while racing in hand, drew off leaving the turn, extended her lead, had the rider lose his whip near the sixteenth pole and won handily.
STICKINGTOGETHER brushed at the start, moved up inside, settled off the pace, bid and was no match for the winner. STEADY LOVE raced close to the
pace, was in hand early, angled out for the drive and lacked a rally. QUIET IMAGINATION advanced three wide on the turn, was carried out a bit entering
the stretch, fell back and faded through the stretch. BETTER YET was unhurried early, went widest leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BRING ME
ANSWERS brushed at the start, saved ground to the turn and passed a tiring rival. LITTLE LION GIRL was not a threat.

Footnotes
ORBETTE raced close to the pace to the outside, bid three wide on the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive under urging. CONGA IN PARIS
moved up inside, bid between horses on the turn, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. SCARLET'S SONG was in tight and checked into
the turn, bid and came up empty. ESTHER'S FORTUNE was slow early, raced outside, offered a mild bid only and improved position. ALL ABOUT
AUDREY set a pressured pace to the turn, weakened and gave way. DIAL EMMA REILLY was impeded and bumped at the start, went six wide entering the
stretch and lacked a bid. BOURBON STYLE broke out, saved ground and improved position in a steady effort. GOOD TEMPERED broke in and bumped at
the start, flashed speed, dropped back and had no further response. CAN I EVER broke slowly, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. SISTER SEVILLE
was not a factor. CHAMBERED BULLET pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. FORTY CHARM LADY pressed the pace while racing between horses
and stopped on the turn. LIKE N' EAGLE was a bit reluctant to load, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
BENANDJOE set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. LECTRIC CHOKE settled off the pace while racing inside, shifted
out and bid between horses on the turn, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. OUTSIDE THE BOX was unhurried mid pack, rallied inside
on the turn, angled out for the drive, bid and hung. RUMSON RALLY was slow early, advanced inside on the turn, offered a mild bid and had little left.
LUDICROUS MODE trailed the field and improved position in a steady effort. JERICHO MARSH was sent to the front to press the pace, bid between horses
on the turn to threaten, flattened out and gave way. MINE TO HOLD failed to threaten in an even effort. MAYNOOTH passed tiring rivals. DAVID'S
PROSPEC was outrun. REDNECK COWBOY went four wide on the first turn, showed speed to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL dueled inside to the upper stretch, drew off and extended her lead under urging. SARAH'S TREASURE settled off the pace,
advanced inside on the turn, angled out and offered a mild bid to get up for place while no threat to the winner. MISS CHARISMA pressed the pace while
racing four wide, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, faltered and held for show. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY broke slowly, was void of early speed,
angled out mid stretch and offered a mild bid only. MARY'S JEWEL pressed the pace three wide between horses to the turn and gave way. AMANITE broke
awkwardly, dueled between horses to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MRS. CHAPMAN came away forwardly despite a bobble, set a pressured pace towards the inside, shook clear into the lane, drifted out in the final sixteenth
and held under a steady drive. MIDNIGHT CROSSING rallied between horses entering the turn, bid along the rail entering the stretch and closed to get up
for place. NYMUE'S TREASURE bobbled at the break,was never far back, worked between rivals around the turn, raced two wide into the lane and churned
on willingly. GREASEDLIGHTNING was slow early, rallied five wide on the turn, bid and hung late. MISS LAMBORGHINI stalked the pace, bid four wide
between horses on the turn and came up empty late to lose position. CATERINA ONE stalked while racing along the rail, was under pressure mid turn
swung six wide and had little left. ONE ODD STORY pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, began to fade leaving the three sixteenths then
was crowded and steadied near the eighth pole.
