Footnotes
VOODOO VALLEY saved ground racing well back from early contention then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward he three eighths pole,
circled rivals in the five path of the far turn, dueled to even terms inside the sixteenth pole and dug in determinedly to put a head in front through the final
yards. VIPER stalked the pace then challenged two deep nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead toward the five sixteenths and raced clear on the far
turn, was met at even terms inside the sixteenth pole and dug in gamely from that point, though, grudgingly ceded the nod the final yards. BIZ NASTY
settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth
pole. DOOLEY rounded the opening two turns in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride
in the lane. NORTH DUBAI raced off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. EDDY DIRT
took quick control of the early pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths then weakened at the
rail rounding the far turn. AY CARUMBA rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
HYPOTHESIS gave chase outside and steadily improved through the backstretch, circled horses four wide on the turn and dug in to take over later yards.
SOUL MACHEN gave early chase inside, eased five wide through the turn, dug in to take second the final yards and finished well. BEST SHOT chased the
pace inside and rounded the turn at the rail, took a slim lead at the eighth pole and dug in with the advantage from that point but was caught late and yielded
runner-up status the final yards. SAGEBRUSH chased the pace and dueled at even terms three wide on the turn, but dropped back mid-stretch and
flattened stride later yards. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN broke a step slow then picked up the chase, rounded the turn off the rail and could only pass a rival.
RESCUE FIVE was hustled along with the pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was headed two deep while between horses at the
eighth pole, raced close through the upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
YOUREOUTOFCONTROL took the lead at the half mile pole and rated the pace through the backstretch, came under pressure into the turn and was
steadily handled to widen. MISTER CARSON chased the early pace toward the outside, raced close off the rail on the turn, proved no match through the
lane and settled for second best. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY came away awkwardly then picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the
turn and was along for third the final yards. TIDAL FIELD engaged in close chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, angled
sharply to the inside leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride. SELECTMAN gave chase toward the outside, raced in the five path of the turn and finished
evenly. KUSTAAFU gave distant chase and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, though, showed little further. HIDE gave chase and raced at the
rail on the turn then weakened. RICHIE'S B L chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. RHYTHM GUITAR came away a step
slow and was shuffled back on the chute, angled to the outside to give chase and raced wide on the turn.

K W CAPTAIN FLINT broke awkwardly and settled off the pace about the four path, bid past the three eighths pole and dueled close three wide on the far
turn, was carried outward by Papa Ralph J approaching the head of the lane but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. SEIZE THE
DAY angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met at even terms at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested the rail rounding the far
turn, was caught mid-stretch but dug in to retain second. PAPA RALPH J stalked the pace in the three path the first turn then drew to even terms at the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that point and rounded the turn two deep, drifted outward approaching the top of the stretch and was outfinished in the
duel for second. RADCLIFFE ROYALE saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled out approaching the top of the lane and raced
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. THE EXCEPTION raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished evenly outside. FOREFRONT was not a factor. MRHUNTSSILVER broke
inward and settled close to the early pace, but dropped back through the opening turn and faded readily.

CHINA CAT stalked the runner-up off the rail then started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, drafted CALL ME JELLY ROLL at the rail through the far
turn, eased outside that one and dueled to the front mid-stretch and drew off under an aggressive hand ride, while the latter, rated a clear pace inside, came
under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. LIFE IN FLASH
settled off the pace and off the rail then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced four wide on the far turn and was along
for third later yards. PUT POSITION settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out
entering the stretch but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. CORY'S CUTIE was slow getting into stride and raced well back from early contention then
bid only mildly from the three eighths pole. KATE CARMACK faded at the rail the first turn and raced off the pace from the seven eighths pole, then showed
little response down the backstretch. SAINTE THERESE stalked the earlier pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn.

FLY E DUBAI took the lead nearing the seven eighths pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure midway on the far turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to hold off the late arriving TIZEZZY, who settled off the pace in the four and five paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and
raced in range of the winner from the four path of the far turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole and was gaining slowly. LITTLE LEO saved ground off the pace,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. THE PREDICTOR stalked the pace two
deep then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, faded off the rail rounding the far turn. DYNAFORM settled back in the two and three
paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. GLEN'S CASTLE was not a factor. WHISKEY
CREEK raced well back. CAPTAIN CHARITABLE stalked the early pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
showed no response, faded into the far turn and was eased.

rail then dug in through the lane to take second the final yards. JUBA TRAIN stalked the winner off the rail then took aim at the three eighths pole, raced
close through the far turn but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. STROLLING THROUGH stalked the earlier pace in the three path, picked up the chase

Footnotes
AWESOME BUZZ stalked the pace from the three path, took aim at the three eighths pole and moved to the lead approaching the five sixteenths, widened
his advantage on the far turn and was kept alert to hold on well. JUST CHILL OUT saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced
three wide on the far turn, dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining mildly on the winner. AFFIX settled off the pace about the four path
the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the six path and was along to take third the final yards.
VERN H raced off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was nipped from third the
final yards. DEPUTY DREW raced well back saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved off the rail on the far turn then finished evenly
to pass rivals. MARCH TO MY TUNE dropped back from early contention while saving ground, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced in
the six path of the far turn and passed some rivals. BEAU TRACE rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced four wide on the far turn and showed little more. BAY HILL saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and showed little
response. ALPHASTEST rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole but was caught approaching the five sixteenths,
dropped back from that point and faded at the rail on the far turn. OFFSHORE TRIP stalked the pace from the three path, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.
