Footnotes
AASR was off slowly and trailed the field through the cute, produced a bold sweeping rally five wide and outside of foes around the turn, bid for the lead in
upper stretch while shifting in, then drew clear passing the furlong pole without contacting inner foes. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE rallied off of the pace four
wide turning for home while inside of AASR, shifted in along with that foe while bidding in upper stretch, then was outkicked at the furlong pole.
GHOSTLORE lied forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied between rivals in upper stretch as outer foes made bids, but was
herded inwards by those foes after clearing inner competitors, then failed to keep pace with them passing the furlong pole. SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN
bobbled a bit at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside before shifting to the three path turning for home, and improved position through the lane.
MYSTIC NIGHT broke outwardly, stalked the clear leader two wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole as wider foes loomed large, and got outkicked by
those foes in upper stretch before flattening out. MOLIERE stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by outer foes at the five sixteenths pole, and failed to
threaten thereafter. PINTXOS stumbled a bit at the start, but recovered to clear the field early on, held a clear margin around the turn, but was headed
passing the quarter pole, and weakened. POTERYA got outrun. Following the race, the rider of GHOSTLORE claimed foul against the riders of
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE and AASR for interference in midstretch, but it was disallowed by the Stewards

Footnotes
RADIANTRITHYM stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled by the leader passing that marker, kept on through the lane as
ITS COLD IN DEHERE sustained a rally to his outside, then produced bid inside of that foe at the sixteenth pole as the leader tired, and prevailed. ITS
COLD IN DEHERE rallied four wide around the turn, chased the clear leader through upper stretch outside of RADIANTRITHYM, then sustained his charge
to bid for the lead along with that rival at the sixteenth pole, but was denied by his inner counterpart. KIFFLE vied two wide, forged an advantage at the three
furlong pole, repelled RADIANTRITHYM's bid passing the quarter pole and drew clear through upper stretch, but tired inside the final furlong, and was worn
down passing the sixteenth marker. PARKING TICKET took the turn two wide while far off of the pace, shifted three wide turning for home, and stayed on
for a minor share. SUNSET PAULA JO tracked from midpack along the inside, came into the lane two wide, but chased from behind the leaders through
upper stretch, then tired through the final furlong. JUST FLY shied from an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and passed
tired foes five wide in upper stretch without menacing. HEAVEN ESCAPE saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, but failed to squeeze through
tight quarters between rivals in upper stretch, and did not mount a rally. ROMANI tracked from midpack two to three wide, and weakened turning for home.
TAKE CHARGE ERICA was sent to set a pressured pace along the inside, but was headed by her pressing counterpart at the three furlong pole, stopped
through the lane, and was eased.

Footnotes
THREE TIPSY CHIX lied forwardly placed along the inside, shifted off of the rail at the half mile pole and pulled to a three wide stalking position into the turn,
tracked around the bend, then rallied to bid at the furlong pole, forged an advantage while brushing THUNDERING CREED at the sixteenth pole, and readily
drew clear. MARION FRANCIS set the pace along the inside, dug in after being headed by THUNDERING CREED in upper stretch, battled on gamely
through the lane, but was bested by an outer surging foe at the sixteenth pole, then reclaimed place at the wire. THUNDERING CREED pressed the pace
setter two wide, bid at the quarter pole and forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but drifted out and brushed THREE TIPSY CHIX as that foe drove
past at the sixteenth pole, flopped back to her left lead due to the incident, hung, and failed to secure place. POLKA POLENTA stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, then chased from behind them through the lane without producing a bid. FOOLERY was off slowly,
advanced to midpack two wide into the turn, then came under a drive turning for home, but lacked a kick and chased the leaders through the lane without
menacing. BEL FIORE took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, shifted five wide in midstretch, and improved. WILD COMBO lied forwardly
placed four wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened. ELLE EST FORTE was off slowly and bumped with a foe at the start, saved ground
far off of the pace, but failed to sustain a bid. TOTAL MALICE was off slowly and failed to factor. FLIPPANT lied forwardly placed five wide between horses
into the turn, but faded turning for home. LOFTHOUSE was off a step slowly, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TROUBLE MAKING broke
outwardly, got caught six wide while forwardly placed into the turn, but faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
FINITE rallied four wide turning for home to produce a bid outside of SANENUS (CHI) in upper stretch, forged an advantage from that foe passing the
furlong pole under driving pressure, and willingly drew off thereafter. SANENUS (CHI) was bumped by inner stacked up foes at the start, stalked the pace
setter two wide, bid turning for home before edging an advantage at the quarter pole, but got headed by FINITE at the furlong marker, and proved second
best. WHOA NELLIE saved ground far off of the pace, rallied along the rail without encountering traffic through the lane, but leveled off late and failed to
reach place. GOLD STANDARD took the turn two to three wide while far off of the pace, shifted five wide turning for home, and stayed on to improve
outside of foes for a minor share. GRAND CRU CLASSE stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turn, but bumped UNIQUE FACTOR while
forcing his way three wide passing the quarter pole, but chased the leaders through the lane, and failed to produce a bid before fading. RISKY MANDATE
broke out, set the pace along the inside, but was headed passing the quarter pole, and caved between horses in upper stretch. NEW ROO tracked from
midpack two wide around the turn, but faded through the lane. CRAZY SEXY MUNNY shook her head and took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start,
then was caught five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and was done early. UNIQUE FACTOR was bumped between horses at the start, lied
forwardly placed three wide, but was bumped by an inner foe while weakening passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
NEW EAGLE stalked two to three wide, vied outside of a pair of foes around the far turn, then drew off in upper stretch, and safely fended off GAMBLER'S
FALLACY to the wire. GAMBLER'S FALLACY rated off of the pace, stalked in the three to four path around the far turn, then rallied through the lane, but
was fended off by the clear leader through the final furlong, and proved second best. SUBDUED raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn,
tucked in into the far turn, then split foes in upper stretch, improved through the lane, and held show. MARTIAL EAGLE took the far turn in the three to five
path while far off of the pace, and stayed on through the lane outside of rivals, but missed show. UNCLE GREGORY set the pace, vied inside of a pair of
foes around the far turn, but proved no match for the widest rival in upper stretch, and weakened. BAHAMA CHANNEL stalked along the inside, but
weakened wihtout producing a bid. SMIRK pressed the pace four to two wide around the first turn, vied between horses around the far turn, but weakened in
upper stretch. SOUL BEAM tracked from midpack around the first turn, but weakened in the four path into the far turn, and was done early.
