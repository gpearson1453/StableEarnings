Footnotes
YESTERDAYSPLAN settled in range while in the clear, took closer order mid turn, swept four wide to challenge into the lane, took command soon past the
quarter pole, opened up under a stout drive and was kept alert to the final yards. I LOVE YOU prompted the pace two wide, was under a ride past the three
eighths, threatened between rivals entering the lane, fought past the quarter pole and continued with some interest to hold down the place. BRING ME
ANSWERS drafted back off the pace, raced three wide heading towards the lane, shifted out wider for the drive but failed to generate a solid run.
RIDGEMONT HIGH lagged off the pace, swung well wide for the drive but lacked a bid. DAZZLE ME advanced inside rivals to take over leaving the chute,
set the pace towards the rail, was taken on by the top two turning for home, failed to keep pace and surrendered leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
JACK GAVE BACK , off the pace while between rivals into the far turn, moved up past the three eighths then worked between runners in upper stretch,
altered to the rail with three sixteenths to go, sustained under strong handling, took control near the sixteenth marker, kicked clear then held firm. PIRATE'S
PALACE rated forwardly then edged up while saving ground into the turn, waited mid turn, eased out and rallied three wide into the lane, took over with
three sixteenths remaining, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. END ALL GET ALL lacked speed while outside horses into
the turn, circled six wide advancing into the stretch, ranged up to loom a danger in mid stretch, couldn't quite match strides but gave effort to the line.
DOUBLBARRELBOURBON , bumped at the break, settled in mid pack while saving ground, eased out while making some headway past the three eighths,
chased into the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. HELMS DEEP stumbled at the break, recovered and accelerate to contention, vied outside
ZOINKS SOOBY through the opening half mile, took over mid turn, handled some pressure before going clear under a drive in upper stretch, ceded
command near the three sixteenths then faded. STRICTLY BUSINESS broke inward and bumped with a rival, made a five wide run into the stretch but
failed to sustain. MANKLIN CREEK , away well, tracked the dueling leaders off the inside, bid three wide leaving the far turn, forced the issue to the quarter
pole then gave way. BATTLE OF THE NILE settled in the clear early on, angled out and gained four wide under a ride mid turn, pursued into the stretch
then weakened. ZOINKS SCOOBY broke slowly, rushed up inside rivals and took a short lead leaving the chute, set a pressured pace to the half mile
marker, failed to kick on mid turn and faltered. NOTORIOUS REY was done after a half mile.

Footnotes
WHISKEY AND RYE broke in the air spotting the field a couple lengths, pulled her way forward while saving ground leaving the far turn, steadied awaiting
room past the three eighths, got through along the rail to take command with a quarter to go, opened up after being put to a vigorous ride past the three
sixteenths, kept on under strong hand coaxing through the final sixteenth and held sway. KEWPIE DOLL settled off the pace, was under some urging past
the three eighths, moved up between runners heading towards the quarter pole, angled five wide into the stretch, straightened away and steadily closed the
gap. TRIP TO FREEDOM rated forwardly three to four wide, bid outside rivals mid turn, forced the issue into the lane and faded. UNREQUITED LOVE , in
range while about four wide into the turn, came under a ride past the three eighths, steadied briefly near the quarter pole then failed to seriously respond.
LAZARETTE sped to a short early lead, disputed the pace two to three wide into the turn, kept on between runners into the lane then tired. MOOCHIE vied
towards the rail, gained a short lead leaving the far turn, raced in the two path battling between horses past the five sixteenths, lost her rider after sustaining
an injury near the quarter pole and was euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
NOMO RON broke on top then was content to be settled well back off the early pace, picked up steam while saving ground mid turn, eased out approaching
the lane, swung out six wide past the three sixteenths, leveled off when put to solid right handed asking, rolled past rivals in deep stretch and was clear at
the line. STROLL SMOKIN vied three deep into the turn, prompted the pace outside THE CAIRO KID from the five sixteenths, wrested command near the
three sixteenths, briefly went clear leaving the eighth pole, kept on gamely but could not contain the winner. HOLD ME BLACK , four wide tracking the
leading trio, came under pressure mid turn, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds and churned on. BULL SHARK , taken to rate, edged up behind
rivals leaving the far turn, shifted in past the three sixteenths, threatened inside foes with about a sixteenth remaining then flattened out late. THE CAIRO
KID dueled between rivals, gained a short lead into the turn, handled pressure to the head of the lane, battled past the furlong grounds then faded. HARD
FOUGHT vied inside a pair of foes into the turn, failed to keep pace past the three eighths and faded. BLESSED ARION , five wide, dropped back.

FULL DINNER JACKET , three wide the first turn, was blocked behind several horses in upper stretch, altered course to the outside near the eighth pole,
closed determinedly and was up at the wire. REASSURED lacked speed, began to advance on the far turn, was four wide approaching the stretch, bid for
the lead outside foes in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and was out finished. IN THE TOP TEN chased the pace two wide, gained a short lead
on the far turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened inside the top pair. WHAT DOES IT TAKE saved ground on the far turn, angled out between
horses at the head of the stretch and was steadied behind REASSURED and IN THE TOP TEN in mid stretch. U S CONSTITUTION chased the pace, was
under urging three wide on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. STEADY EDDIE showed speed along the inner rail and weakened in mid stretch.
NO LAYING UP was outrun. IRON PEARLS stumbled and unseated his rider soon after the break. Objections by the rider of WHAT DOES IT TAKE against
REASSURED and IN THE TOP TEN for alleged interference in the stretch were not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but
no action was taken.
