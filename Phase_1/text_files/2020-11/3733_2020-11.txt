Footnotes
NASHVILLE shook clear to dictate terms through cracking fractions, remained unchallenged and was geared down in the final yards. WILD WES tucked in
to save ground through the turn, got through and kicked on to prove best of the rest. LITTLE MENACE settled saving ground, slipped through into the
stretch, shifted out a bit late and continued on well. BANGO came away a step slow, was unhurried into stride, came three wide and improved position.
FORE LEFT settled between foes, failed to make headway. CAJUN BROTHER was nearest the pace three deep to the stretch and faltered. RELENTLESS
DANCER was hustled along five wide for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
SLEEPY EYES TODD trailed along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, shied from a fallen foe in upper stretch, then shifted down to clear racing
room along the rail, and rallied to get up in the late stages. TRUE TIMBER stalked four wide, then chased between horses through the lane, sustained a
grinding rally, but was outfinished by an inner surging rival, and held place. EDGEMONT ROAD set the pace two wide, cleared off into the turn, widened his
clear margin in upper stretch, but began to tire in midstretch, got surpassed at the sixteenth pole, and weakened. EBBEN raced far off of the pace two wide,
swung four wide turning for home, shifted in for racing room while rallying between horses, and stayed on for a minor share. ENGAGE tracked from midpack
along the inside, tipped out to the five path at the three furlong pole, rallied turning for home, but flattened out in deep stretch. PHAT MAN raced far off of the
pace, got caught in the six path around the turn, and leveled off through the lane while grinding away mildly. EVERFAST raced far off of the pace two to
three wide around the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, and chased without menacing. MIDNIGHT SANDS was bumped at the start, recovered
to lie forwardly placed along the inside, but got bothered by a fallen foe in upper stretch, then was protected thereafter. MIND CONTROL chased three wide
and between horses, was slightly hampered by the incident in upper stretch, and weakened. ABSOLUTELY AIDEN vied along the inside early on, shifted
out into the turn to stalk the clear leader, but suffered an injury and fell passing the quarter pole, then was vanned off. STRIKE THAT chased the pace two
wide and between horses, but tripped over a fallen foe and lost the rider in upper stretch, then walked off. DINAR was off a step slow, raced far off of the
pace along the inside, but was bothered in the incident in upper stretch and lost his rider, then walked off. Following a Stewards' Inquiry, no change was
made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
GAMINE came away a bit awkwardly, recovered quick and tracked to the outside of SERENGETI EMPRESS into the turn, took dead aim at that one
entering the stretch, struck the front nearing the furlong marker and drew away to score as the rider pleased. SERENGETI EMPRESS assumed command
at once, angled in to set the pace, met the challenge of GAMINE leaving the turn, disputed the issue to the eighth pole, was unable to go on with GAMINE
but dug in to preserve the runner up spot. BELL'S THE ONE settled into stride off of the inside, wheeled out five wide leaving the turn, was floated out
further in the lane, but quickened and was making up good ground. SCONSIN tucked in to save ground, got through to make a bold bid, but flattened during
the drive. COME DANCING was allowed to settle, took closer order on the turn, came three wide and brushed SPEECH entering the stretch, drifted out
under left handed urging but failed to make headway. SPEECH attended the pace along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, brushed with COME
DANCING in upper stretch and weakened. SALLY'S CURLIN lagged well back, finished with some run but failed to threaten. VENETIAN HARBOR pulled to
contention three wide, but came up empty between rivals leaving the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
GLASS SLIPPERS (GB) raced off the pace along the inside, advanced while saving ground turning for home, sustained her charge to split the leaders three
wide at the furlong pole, bumped the tiring TEXAS WEDGE in the process, then drew off and held. WET YOUR WHISTLE hesitated at the start, trailed the
field two wide around the turn before swinging to the seven path turning for home, then rallied belatedly with a stout kick in the final furlong, but ran out of
ground. LEINSTER stalked along the inside, tipped off of the rail passing the quarter pole before shifting to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to produce
a bid at the furlong pole, but bumped with TEXAS WEDGE at that marker and got outkicked by an inner surging foe, then was outfinished by an outer
rallying foe for place. EXTRAVAGANT KID raced off of the pace while caught in the four path around the turn, shifted five, then six, wide in upper stretch,
and commenced a grinding rally, but was outfinished by an outer foe for minor rewards. GOT STORMY tracked from midpack three wide, shifted four, then
five, wide in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid through midstretch, but flattened out late. FRONT RUN THE FED raced far off of the pace two wide and
between horses, then stayed on through traffic through the lane. WILDMAN JACK prompted the pace two wide and between horses, produced a bid while
still between foes turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, held it to the furlong pole, but was headed passing that marker, and weakened.
BOMBARD chased the pace two wide and between horses, but steadily faded around the turn. OLEKSANDRA (AUS) was off slowly, raced far off of the
pace three wide, shifted to the five path turning fo rhome, but lugged in while getting outkicked by an outer foe, steadied, and failed to factor thereafter. BIG
RUNNUER saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. TEXAS WEDGE stalked three wide, bid turning for home, vied through upper stretch, but was
bumped and swallowed between horses at the furlong pole. INTO MYSTIC set the pace along the inside, met multiples bid turning for home, then was
headed by those foes in upper stretch, and weakened. IMPRIMIS tracked from midpark along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home, shifted
inwards to chase behind the leaders in upper stretch, but was stymied behind those foes at the furlong pole, steadied hard, and was quickly eased. JUST
MIGHT tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO set the pace from the outset while on the inside, was off the rail into the lane, repelled a bid in the stretch, kicked clear near the eighth pole and
was geared down in the final stages. JESUS' TEAM raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, worked back to the inside, made a bid in the
stretch from the inside and was up for place in the final stages. SHARP SAMURAI raced in tight and was checked hard into the first turn, chased the pace
down the backstretch, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid, continued the bid down the lane but did not have enough for place in the late
stages. COMPLEXITY tracked the pace early two wide, raced in the three path into the lane while making a bid but was repelled by the winner and
weakened late in the stretch run. OWENDALE trailed the field early on, was on the inside along the far turn, shifted out into the three path entering the lane
with a belated gain in the stretch drive. MR FREEZE chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in
the stretch run. RUSHIE was unhurried early on, raced in the six path into the lane with a minor gain in the stretch drive. ART COLLECTOR stalked the
pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and faded down the lane. WAR OF WILL was never a threat. SILVER DUST was never a factor. MR.
MONEY raced widest most of the backstretch, was in the five path into the lane. PIRATE'S PUNCH chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the
lane and empty down the lane.

Footnotes
AUDARYA (FR) tucked in, moved into contention on the backstretch, shifted out to launch his bid, churned on and wore down RUSHING FALL in the final
yards. RUSHING FALL shadowed the leaders three deep, came to level terms nearing the quarter pole, forged command and kicked on well but was unable
to resist the winner. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL settled in hand, advanced between horses, tipped out to be clear once in the final furlong and was making up
ground. LADY PRANCEALOT (IRE) settled off of the inside, came five wide and improved position. CIVIL UNION was unhurried, angled in to save ground,
was bumped and checked midway near the five-sixteenths pole, recovered and continued on well. SISTERCHARLIE (IRE) settled saving ground, moved
out a bid and rallied between horses. MEAN MARY was away alertly, disputed the pace to the outside of CAYENNE PEPPER (IRE) into the stretch, stayed
on to the final furlong and faded. NAY LADY NAY (IRE) lagged toward the tail of the field, mounted a belated gain but failed to threaten. MY SISTER NAT
(FR) finished with a mild improvement. CAYENNE PEPPER (IRE) went to the front, set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed entering the
stretch and gave way readily. PEACEFUL (IRE) was forwardly placed between rivals, was humped on to maintain position into the second turn, but came up
empty shortly after and retreated. MUCHO UNUSUAL contended five wide for a mile and tired. TEREBELLUM (IRE) contended between horses to the
second turn and dropped out. STARSHIP JUBILEE stumbled at the start and unseated her jockey.

Footnotes
WHITMORE saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, advanced inside of foes turning for home, smoothly tipped three wide in upper stretch to take
dead aim on the leader, reached that foe passing the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. C Z ROCKET chased while forwardly placed four
wide around the turn, got brushed by an inner foe passing the quarter pole, still managed a rally, but was outkicked by WHITMORE approaching the furlong
pole, stayed on to claim place in deep stretch, then just held that position. FIRENZE FIRE raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, split foes while
holding that lane passing the furlong pole, rallied inside of foes through the late stages, but just missed place. EMPIRE OF GOLD prompted the pace two
wide and between horses, bid for the lead turning for home before assuming command passing the quarter pole, drew clear, but changed back to his left
lead and lugged a bit inwards approaching the furlong grounds, got headed passing that marker, and yielded late. MANNY WAH tracked from midpack
along the inside, advanced to be two wide and between horses turning for home, but was bumped by his inner rival into his outer counterpart passing the
quarter pole, was jostled during the incident, but managed to sustained his rally to split foes in the late stages for a minor reward. DIAMOND OOPS tracked
from midpack five wide and between horses, advanced mildly around the turn, but leveled off through the lane. HOG CREEK HUSTLE raced far off of the
pace while caught four wide around the turn, tipped seven wide in upper stretch, and rallied mildly outside of foes through the lane. YAUPON was a bit
crowded between horses at the start, chased three wide, but came under encouragement to keep pace passing the three furlong pole, was bumped while
failing to do so turning for home, then was bumped by the same foe in upper stretch due to his stablemate shifting outwards, got pinched due to the incident,
then chased on, but shied at the sixteenth pole. LASTING LEGACY tracked from midpack six wide, advanced mildly around the turn, but flattened out in
upper stretch. BON RAISON raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and never got involved. FRANK'S ROCKETTE raced midpack two to three
wide around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but failed to make an impact. COLLUSION ILLUSION raced far off of the pace along the inside, and
never got involved. ECHO TOWN chased along the inside, but forced his way out passing the quarter pole, bumped MANNY WAH solidly in upper stretch,
then lacked a kick to produce a bid, and weakened. JASPER PRINCE cleared off early on, but was headed at the quarter pole, and stopped thereafter.

Footnotes
MONOMOY GIRL settled in hand, made a sweeping move four wide through the second turn, took over and edged clear a furlong out, was kept to task and
held. VALIANCE settled in hand, launched her bid circling five wide, churned on through a long drive and was all out to earn the place. DUNBAR ROAD
settled saving ground, was blocked and altered course to the far outside leaving the second turn, kicked on well and was gaining with every stride.
HARVEST MOON disputed the pace along the inside, weakened during the drive and gave way. CE CE settled off of the inside, angled out five wide but
toiled fruitlessly. POINT OF HONOR lagged well back, swung to the far outside and made a belated improvement. SWISS SKYDIVER stumbled at the start,
settled toward the inside, commenced a bold bid with seven-sixteenths to run, got through and loomed a danger but failed to sustain the drive. OLLIE'S
CANDY was close up between horses through the second turn and faded. HOROLOGIST was forwardly placed toward the inside, but came up empty
leaving the second turn and retreated. LADY KATE was away alertly, contested the pace outside of HARVEST MOON to the second turn, was collared
between runners and stopped.

Footnotes
TARNAWA (IRE) lost her footing at the start as her back legs slipped from under her, raced far off of the pace two wide around the first two turns, shifted out
and rallied in the four to five path around the third turn, sustained that stout rally outside of MAGICAL (IRE) through the final furlong, and drove past the
leader at the sixteenth pole. MAGICAL (IRE) lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses around the original two bends, but came under a drive
passing the half mile pole to commence a rally, responded mildly to gain in the three path around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and
sustained her bid through the lane, but was outkicked by TARNAWA (IRE) passing the furlong pole, then reached place approaching the wire. CHANNEL
MAKER set the pace along the inside, shook away from his pressing counterpart into the third turn, widened his advantage turning for home, but tired in the
final furlong, and was worn down by multiple foes at the sixteenth pole. LORD NORTH (IRE) reared in the gate, rated off of the pace two wide, then three
wide around the far turn before shifting to the four path turning for home, but lacked a kick to split foes passing the furlong marker, then stayed on mildly for
a minor reward. MOGUL (GB) trailed the field around the first two turns, advanced to be between horses down the backstretch, then tipped three wide at the
furlong pole, but lacked a kick between foes to produce a bid in the late stages. ARKLOW stalked along the inside, tipped off of the rail in upper stretch, but
chased the loose leader without making progress before fading through the final stages. MEHDAAYIH (GB) saved ground from midpack, inched forward
along the rail in upper stretch, but flattened out in the late stages before menacing. UNITED prompted the pace setter two wide, lobbed along with low head
carriage through the slow pace, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart into the far turn, stumbled mildly passing the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened thereafter. RED KING stalked three to four wide, but tired through the lane. DONJAH (GER) raced far off of the pace along the inside, took an
awkward stride and lost action while appearing to shy around the second turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC set the pace early with a loose lead from off the rail, stayed off the rail into the lane, kicked clear near the eighth pole and stayed clear of foes
in the final stages under a brisk drive. IMPROBABLE came in early on and bothered multiple foes while being bumped himself, raced four wide along the
first turn, the five path along the backstretch, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, continued on down the lane but was no match for the winner in the
final stages while second best. GLOBAL CAMPAIGN was bumped and bothered shortly after leaving the gate, chased the pace along the backstretch, was
in the three path into the lane while making a bid, continued that bid down the lane but flattened out late in the drive. TACITUS was unhurried early on,
raced off the rail into the lane, made a bid down the lane but leveled off late in the drive. MAXIMUM SECURITY tracked the pace early on, was on the inside
into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. TIZ THE LAW stalked the pace while under tight restraint from the inside, shifted out into the four path
entering the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. TITLE READY was bothered and squeezed back shortly after leaving the gate, raced along the
back of the field, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. BY MY STANDARDS wandered out and was bumped early on, chased the
pace along the backstretch, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. TOM'S D'ETAT was put in tight and jostled shortly after leaving the
gate, raced along the back of the field, was in the five path into the lane making a slight bid but could not sustain it and tired down the lane. HIGHER
POWER was unprepared at the start and always raced along the back. Due to an issue with timing during the live running of the race, fractional and final
times were calculated using video review. Authentic's earnings and the purse monies for the Breeders' Cup Classic reflect a $1,000,000 bonus from
Monmouth Park & BetMakers for winning the Haskell S., Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic.
