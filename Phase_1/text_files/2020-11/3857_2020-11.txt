Footnotes
CRUMLIN TIME stalked the two leaders in the three path through the first turn, advanced on hold into second turn, inched up down the stretch and wore
down the leader late, winning a head-bobbing photo finish. TEXT ME UP was inside being pressed by a rival around the first turn, had that pace pal put
away by midway on the far turn, had a length lead turning for home but failed to hold the winner late, losing a nasty photo. CLAIRESSENCE was away
slowly at the start and trailed into the first turn, came out between runners two to four wide on the far turn to burst onto the scene, continued to loom down
the stretch but hung in the final seventy yards. TWENTYTWENTYCREST sat two wide in mid pack, rallied two to four wide on the far turn, dropped back in
upper stretch before angling out in the final sixteenth and closing best of all late. DONT GET SMART settled in behind the leaders on the rail, had dead aim
in upper stretch but no bid was forthcoming, fading along the inside in the final sixteenth. MARTINI SUE stalked and pressed the leader through the first turn
and backstretch, began to drop off midway on the far turn and never recovered. AUDREY GRACE was three to four wide near the rear through the first turn,
got onto the rail on the far turn but could not enter contention. MUNCH AND CRUNCH began awkwardly and was near the rear, stayed two to three wide
throughout, never able to put in a bid. CALAIS COVE sat along the rail in mid pack throughout and retreated down the lane to trail.

Footnotes
CHEEKY PINT bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch, led in the final furlong and held sway under a drive. ARAMON
showed rail speed, set a pressured pace, moved clear into the stretch, was passed but gamely held place. HANCHY settled off the pace, closed on the
backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. SAYSO raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the first turn,
was hustled three and four-wide through the far turn then closed gamely between foes in the stretch. LEA RO stalked the pace, chased three-wide into the
stretch but evened out in the late stages. LONDONDERRY, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into
the stretch and finished gamely. NICE BROWN GIRL stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened
out in the final 16th. BOSSALINA raced from off the pace, circled three to five-wide on the far turn then rallied outside but evened out late. RAPUNZEL'S
DREAM settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, was blocked upper stretch and flattened out.
