Footnotes
BOURBON TAN, urged to the fore along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, came under pressure
to turn back several rivals leaving the far turn, shifted off the inside and went clear under pressure. MILBURN was rated just off the first flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. CLOUD TO
GROUND, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and continued with a mild bid while gaining a
share. CHANNEL STUFFER, off a bit slowly while shuffled slightly at the start, settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, split rivals just off the
inside nearing upper stretch gaining some position entering the lane but finished evenly late. MISTER CHARMING was rated off the second flight in the
opening half, angled to the rail racing into the far turn to gain contention nearing midstretch but had no final kick. DARK WOOD (IRE) tracked off the second
flight between foes in early stages, shifted inwards to save ground on the far turn but lacked a serious bid. NEXT MONDAY settled off the last flight near the
inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. POCKET PLAYER, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the first flight, steadily
faded after a half. HUEY ATTACK tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, advanced to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing the far
turn but flattened out in upper stretch. JACK VAN BERG was urged to terms prompting the eventual winner in the opening half, pressed the issue between
foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. RIDING THE TRAIN broke in the air causing his rider to momentarily be dislodged from his irons,
drifted out markedly racing into the first turn while coming under correction, continued to race rank under restraint into the backstretch and offered no rally.

Footnotes
LEMON BLITZ bobbled out of the gate, tracked the leading trio early, inched up to track the leading pair inside of FLEETWAY past the middle of the
backstretch, tracked in the pocket on the far turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, led at the furlong mark and drove clear. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN chased
keenly outside of SCATTERED CASH, bid three wide on the far turn, was driven three wide into the lane, sustained his bid but was outfinished.
SCATTERED CASH settled inside of MIRACLE MOUNTAIN, saved ground through the far turn, was taken out in upper stretch and rallied. ANGELINO
settled near the rear, continued two wide well off the pace past mid-backstretch, saved ground through the turn, and rallied belatedly between horses.
CROW MOON disputed the pace two wide, led past the five sixteenths, carried a narrow lead into the lane, was headed at the furlong mark and weakened
inside. IRISH MAJOR settled two wide near the rear, improved position down the backstretch while still well behind the leaders, chased in the two to three
path on the far turn, made mild improvement in upper stretch but ultimately lacked the needed kick. FLEETWAY tracked the leading pair early, continued in
the second flight outside of LEMON BLITZ past the five eighths, bid three wide on the far turn, engaged outside of CROW MOON past the five sixteenths,
but was turned back in upper stretch and weakened. SERTOMAN chased just outside of and behind LEMON BLITZ, kept on in range four wide through the
far turn, was driven four wide into the lane and weakened. SWEEPING EDGE settled near the rear, was outpaced into the far turn, trailed in the two path on
that bend, and was no factor in the lane. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN disputed the pace inside of CROW MOON until emptying out past the five sixteenths.
DRAGUNOV settled at the rear, was pushed along and made mild improvement past the five eighths, raced near the rear in the five path on the far turn, and
was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
VALIANT LADY tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing into the bend, came through when presented an opening to challenge for
command in upper stretch, then kicked away late under firm encouragement. NIGHTSTAR angled to the inside tracking off the second flight in the opening
stages, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch splitting rivals to challenge for command but couldn't match the winner while prevailing for the place
honors. HELEN MAE'S SONG tracked just off the pacesetter between foes leading the second flight on a narrow margin racing into the bend, was urged to
challenge for command between rivals racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. LIL B QUICK tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of
the second flight in the opening quarter, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch and faded in the drive. PROBABLY GRACE tracked off the second
flight outside a rival racing in the four path early, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but had no rally. BIT MONEY dropped out early. VEGAN
GOES BEST broke sharply, was hustled clear of the field while angling inside, held sway into the turn and gave out abruptly entering upper stretch. LUCKY
LORRETTA stumbled badly at the start losing position to the field, switched out nearing upper stretch, fell to the track when suffering an apparent
catastrophic injury and was subsequently vanned off the course.

Footnotes
SUMMER DAY angled inwards in early stages while being rated between rivals as part of the second flight, continued under patient handling into the far
turn, shifted out of close quarters to split rivals three deep racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and held
ACCORDING TO ASPEN safe to the end under firm handling. The latter was settled last while angling inside racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes
antering the far turn gradually gathering momentum, advanced six wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to challenge the winner nearing the
wire. QUINN MURPHY settled outside foes in the last flight early, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch advancing to challenge between foes but
was outkicked by the top pair while prevailing for a share. ARTISTIC JEWLER, reserved between rivals in the last flight early, shifted inside after a half,
saved ground through the far turn, shifted out entering the lane to split foes bidding inside the leaders leaving midstretch but had no final kick. FALL MOON,
reserved along the inside in early stages, shifted out nearing the lane to race in the four path, lost some momentum when caught in close quarters entering
the lane and made no real impression. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET, off a bit slowly, pulled her way to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the
backstretch, then pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch and abruptly gave out leaving the furlong marker. SUPERSTAR BEA sped to the lead
while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly resisted a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch but gave out midstretch.
ELUSIVE AMELIA angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. WINDY CITY GIRL, caught
four wide racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the far turn. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, pulling
against restraint three deep between foes tracking just off the first flight in the opening half, gave way abruptly racing into the lane.

CALL THE COLONEL broke outward, raced at the inside of the tracking flight, took closer order when shaken up in the three path on the far turn, swung
four wide into the lane, drifted out toward the center of the track, sustained his rally, and rolled to the lead in the final forty yards. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS
was bumped by OGEE'S EKATI in the opening strides, cleared to the lead into the first turn, was prompted by CUT TO ORDER past the seven eighths, set
a pressured pace until edging to a better defined lead past the five sixteenths, held CUT TO ORDER at bay under a drive in the lane, but was nabbed by
CALL THE COLONEL late. CUT TO ORDER tracked the pace into the first turn, advanced to prompt outside RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS past the seven
eighths, was turned back from the five sixteenths, and chased on in the lane while unable to regain ground on the pacesetter. HIDE THE EVIDENCE settled
at the inside of the rear flight, rallied while saving ground on the far turn, and chased on best of the rest while never threatening the top three. FORGOT TO
FORGET chased three wide, continued four wide through the far turn and into the lane, and came up empty. OGEE'S EKATI was herded out into
RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS in the opening strides, floated four wide on the clubhouse turn, raced outside of HIDE THE EVIDENCE in the rear flight down
the backstretch, continued three wide at the rear on the far turn, came into the lane between horses and offered no bid. TIMINGISEVERYTHING raced
between horses in the chasing flight, began to weaken two wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
HUNTER'S HELLCAT was rated inside rivals tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced along the rail to challenge for
command inside the leader in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. BIG LUCK settled last along
the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while angling six wide nearing midstretch and proved best of the others. BROADWAY DUCHESS
angled inside tracking off the second flight in the opening half, swung out racing into the far turn to advance on the leaders five wide racing into upper
stretch, continued willingly to gain position but was outkicked by the top pair. MELISSANI tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, split rivals
racing into upper stretch, then altered course to the inside in the closing stages but lacked the needed final response. VEGAS VIXEN, urged to the lead
along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner. HERECITYKITTY
tracked off the first flight three deep between foes to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the lane and emptied out. MAGNITUDE TEN, urged to a
forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that rival into the far turn and gave way between foes
entering the lane. HOOK HER UP, caught five wide racing into the first turn, settled outside foes and dropped out early. COCOA PARFAIT, caught four wide
racing into the first turn while urged to terms with the second flight, was through after a half.

Footnotes
DANCE was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, and increased her advantage under a drive in the lane. LOUIE P tracked the pace
between horses, was pushed along while tracking in the four path on the turn, came into the lane in striking range outside of DANCE, but proved only
second best while chasing her down the length of the straight. AUBREY tracked the pace inside of LOUIE P early, continued in range in the two path on the
turn, was driven inside into the lane, and kept on while unable to keep pace with the top two. WELL MAID settled behind the tracking group down the
backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. DEVIL'S ROSE settled toward the rear, was
driven in the two path on the turn, altered out and in behind traffic in upper stretch, and kept on mildly. LADY EXPRESS settled at the rear, took closer order
in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses outside under a drive. TROPHY BRIDLE leapt out of the gate, tracked the
pace outside of LOUIE P down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, came four wide into the lane and proved empty. SONG AND A KISS grazed
the gate, chased six wide down the backstretch, continued midfield in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane but came up empty. FIRST
HOOSIER reared at the break, settled in second last, raced near the rear in the six path on the turn, came into the lane seven wide, and did not rally.

Footnotes
I'M CORFU broke readily, pulled against restraint to gain terms prompting the pacesetter racing in the four path after the opening quarter, pressed the issue
on the turn, took over racing into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. DURANGO KID broke readily to track just off the first flight along the
inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest between rivals to prevail for the place honors. MIAS
MOONBEAM, a bit slow into stride, gathered momentum racing into the bend, split foes nearing upper stretch, angled four wide racing through the lane but
gained position to the end. ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing in the three path early, shifted inwards racing
into the turn while dueling for command, couldn't match the winner entering the lane and gave way. PRESIDENT ELECT tracked off the second flight along
the inside racing into the turn and steadily faded into the lane. CROCE D'ORO tracked off the first flight between foes and steadily faded nearing the lane.
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN dropped out last and trailed the field to the stretch. NOTACATBUTACARD broke slowly, was prompted to contend racing four wide
into the turn but soon retreated.

Footnotes
PROMISES KEPT broke readily to gain the advantage, shifted inwards to dictate the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, held sway on a clear margin
past midstretch and kept STOLEN GLANCE at bay under energetic handling. The latter tracked just off the second flight along the inside racing through the
backstretch, steadily gained position advancing along the rail racing into upper stretch and continued willingly inside the winner to the end. GRADED
ATTITUDE tracked off the second flight five wide racing through the backstretch, continued in that path into the stretch but finished with interest to gain
position to the end. SOPHIA'S DAWN, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, steadily faded in the
drive. BLAZING RUBY settled between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn gaining some position racing into upper stretch
but flattened out midstretch. NO PASSING ZONE, slow into stride, was settled between foes in the last flight racing into the turn, then shifted four wide in
the closing stages to gain position in a belated effort. EQUALLY EVEN, bumped at the start, settled last racing to the turn while angling to the inside, saved
ground to the lane but passed only tiring rivals. TWO MORE TIMES dropped back early. GIFT OF CHANCE was a brief factor between foes tracking off the
second flight to the turn but faded after a half. LYNNE T angled to the inside on the backstretch tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted out
entering the lane and gave way in the drive. FROSTY LINZ shifted to the four path early tracking off the second flight but soon dropped out. COOKIN
ROSES, broke out bumping a rival, was switched outside foes pursuing the pacesetter three deep racing into the turn and gave way abruptly into upper
stretch.
