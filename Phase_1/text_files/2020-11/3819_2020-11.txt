Footnotes
HIGH SIERRA rated mid pack after the field left the start at a snails pace, started to get in gear over the two jumps on the backside the final time, rallied on
the home turn to capture a slight advantage jumping the last and held sway to the wire.. LEMON AGAIN raced towards the back of a tightly bunched field
and always in contention, made a run on the final bend to get head and head for the lead heading to the last jump but could not gain further ground through
the lane. VINCENT VAN GOGO settled mid pack but always in striking distance, rallied on the home turn to give himself a chance then flattened out but
held on to the show spot. WESTERN CRUSADER raced towards the back, picked off rivals going down the backside the final time to briefly gain the lead
then was outrun from that point. LOVELY SUNSET took command at the start, held that position until the 3rd last fence then gave way. DUELLIST stalked
the leader for the first mile and a half then faded.

PENITENCE was unhurried until the final turn, then came with a rush after the second last dueling with rivals on the turn to gain a slight advantage heading
to the last, battled it out to the wire and prevailed.. YANKEE DOODLE BOY lagged for the first circuit, started gaining ground on the backside for the final
time, rallied on the home turn to be right there jumping the last but was out dueled to the wire. SIM CARD was always in good position made his move going
down the backside to be right there heading for the final turn and then flattened out.. CHOKLITCOVERDONUT had command until the final turn then faded.
ARGENTIC (FR) stalked the leader for the first mile and a half then stopped. BOWLED OVER raced in the back and was no factor here. OVER TO YOU
settled towards the back then started falling back with a circuit to go, lost touch with the field and was pulled up before the last jump and walked off.

ZOOM ZOOM ZOE (IRE) was well placed, closed the gap on the backside to draft the leader heading into the final turn dueled with that rival on the last turn
to be right there jumping the last and drew clear late.. NOTJUDGINJUSTSAYIN took command from the start and had a clear advantage heading into the
final bend went wide on the turn to obtain fresh ground and that might have cost him, letting the winner come up on the inside they were head and head
going to the last but was outrun after the last jump. ANIMAL KINGSTON was in no hurry for the first mile and a half but was never far out of it, rallied on the
last turn to be in the mix jumping the last and hung on for third at the wire. MIGHTY MARK drafted the leader for the first mile and a half then gave way.
JUNONIA settled towards the back, had a mild rally on the home turn then weakened. UNDISCLOSED (IRE) raced mid pack for the first mile and a half then
retreated..

MR. SARINANA assumed command from the start, had a commanding lead heading down the backside for the final time then started losing ground at that
point to be headed going into the final bend, battled hard with several rivals on the final turn but looked defeated going to the last, but defiantly came again
after the last fence and was not to be denied at the wire. LAP OF THE GODS was always in striking distance, rallied on the final turn dueling with several
rivals in the process to have a slight edge jumping the last, dueled with the winner through the lane and was beaten in the final strides..
CAINUDOTHETWIST settled mid pack closed the gap on the backside for the final time to gain the lead briefly dueling with other rivals on the final bend,
still battling hard over the last and through the stretch but just missed at the wire. KOKO STAR was well placed, closed the gap heading down the backside,
rallied on the far turn to be right there jumping the last but failed to persevere. BOGEY'S IMAGE lagged early, gained ground on the backside rallied final
turn to be within striking distance going to the last then flattened out. HEAVEN MADE was through early, then trailed the field. CLOUDBASED was never
really in the race, started losing ground on the backside for the final time, lost touch with the field heading into the final bend and was pulled up before the
2nd last jump and walked off..
