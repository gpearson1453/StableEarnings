Footnotes
FOREST CHATTER broke in front and was allowed to settle, set a pressured pace under confident handling early, edged clear on the turn and finished full
of run through the final furlongs to win going away. SAINTS MARCHING IN stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the four path and
finished second best. GIANT BOO BOO pressured the winner from the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. BAR STOOL BUDGET went evenly.
DOCTOR LEE failed to menace. HICKORY HILL raced four and five wide and also turned in an even effort. ASTRO JAK had speed along the rail into the
stretch and faded late.

MI LUNA broke in front, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, wore down rivals in a game effort and edged clear in the final stages. SEA MY MOVES
chased the winner down the backstretch, drew on even terms for the lead outside that one on the turn, battled until deep stretch and finished second best.
JILLY FROM JERSEY bumped at the start, stalked the pace along the inside, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid.
REGAL GHOST well placed, went evenly. MONBA NUMBER FIVE bumped at the start, moved up four wide into the stretch then leveled off. CAROLYN
close up four wide into the turn, failed to respond. PASSIONATE EMOTION was through early. PLENTY QUICK had brief speed. RED LITE NITE trailed.

Footnotes
UYEDA prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, battled until deep stretch and edged clear late under right handed urging. CENTRIST
never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the turn, battled with the winner until deep stretch and finished second best. DON'T MATTER was bumped
hard at the start and rallied late in the six path. GOD'S WILL BE DONE also bumped at the start, moved up two wide into the stretch then leveled off. MY
FRIEND BUDDY bore in badly at the start bumping rivals and had brief speed. WAR OF THE NORTH failed to menace. CAZMAN passed tiring rivals
inside. PRIME TIME had speed into the turn then gave way. MIJO set the pace into the turn then was used up. DERBYS MONEYMAKER was no factor.
DIDDY DEW was through early. GATTO ROSSO was outrun.
