Footnotes
PANDORICA settled off the pace along the inside, made no gain while hard ridden around the turn, bid inside of the duelers leaving the three-sixteenths
pole, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. LITTLE MISS HODOR dueled two wide to upper stretch, battled three deep
through the lane, was no match for the winner late but battled on to win the duel and wrest second away. CORINTHIA dueled inside of LITTLE MISS
HODOR, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and was outfinished. LUCI BREEZE chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. REALLYGOODTIMES steadied
near the half-mile pole, saved ground and never threatened. RUN SILENT played no factor while racing three wide. MARIA'S MIRAGE broke a step slow,
advanced inside down the backstretch, angled out nearing the turn, stalked the duel three wide in the clear and retreated through the lane. GLOBAL
QUEEN COCO broke through the starting gate prior to the start, steadied near the five-eighths pole, raced two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S PRIDE veered out sharply at the start, quickly got back on track sprinting to the front, moved inside widening around the turn, got roused into
the stretch and was kept to pressure never in jeopardy. SEMPER FIDELIS broke a step slow, checked behind NO QUE NO before going a sixteenth of a
mile, shifted off the inside to the three-path advancing around the turn, could not menace the winner but finished with good energy outside to be clearly
second best. NO QUE NO moved to the rail early, pursued WARRIOR'S PRIDE from the two-path heading into the turn, could not get near that rival and
weakened through the drive. TAPSASIONAL gave chase early inside, and tired after three furlongs. BIG RED STYLE was outrun inside. YACAMBU was
reluctant to load, raced three wide and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TIME'S ON MY SIDE prompted the pace outside PIPER, had her initial bid repelled coming to the quarter-pole, persisted after straightening away into the
stretch, put a head in front with a furlong remaining and edged away to the finish. PIPER crossed over inside with a clear early lead, fended off TIME'S ON
MY SIDE around the turn, could not hold that foe off leaving the eighth-pole, and was clearly second best. LADY JAE chased the top two from the outset
near the two-path, could not gain through the lane and was well clear for the show. PRETZEL lacked the needed response three wide. PRAY FOR RAIN
saved ground throughout and was outrun. CASH UP FRONT was urged early to no avail, drifted five or six wide approaching the stretch, and remained far
back.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ARAMIS pressed the pace two wide, took a narrow lead nearing the lane, vied outside to midstretch then drove clear. SANCOCHO (MEX) was
bumped at the start, quickly recovered to set the pace along the rail under pressure from the winner, battled on to midstretch and was clearly second best
late. MONMOUTH DR tracked the pace from the rail, dropped back a bit around the far turn and stayed on in the lane to regain the show. SURF SHACK
raced in range three wide, bid between foes nearing the lane and flattened out in the drive. DOCTOR D J trailed inside for a half, circled four wide around
the far turn to loom menacingly nearing the lane but came up empty in the stretch. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was bumped at the start, chased the pace two
wide and faded.

Footnotes
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF grabbed the lead inside CATCH ON EMOTIONAL soon after the start, battled with that one through a rapid pace, dug in through
the stretch, swapped back to his left lead 70 yards out and would not be denied. CATCH ON EMOTIONAL pressed SAGAMORE MISCHIEF from the start
in the two-path, could not get by through a long drive and was clear of the rest by a pole. REY DE LIGAS (CHI) was a step slow at the start, and no factor
from the two-path. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING was three wide early, moved inside midway on the turn, and could not keep pace.

COMBINATION stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead through stretch, closed
determinedly and was up in deep stretch. LONG BLADE set the pace along the rail, drifted a bit turning for home, held clear to deep stretch and was
collared in the final strides. KOBE FIFTY TWO chased the pace two wide, angled to the rail turning for home and was one-paced in the lane. LEGENDARY
PRINCE broke awkwardly, raced in range three wide, came four wide into the lane and lacked a closing bid. DECKOLOGY hopped at the start, pressed the
pace two wide and tired in the drive. HARDREDCANDY was in range between foes, steadied entering the turn and steadily retreated two wide.

Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA set the pace inside, edged away around the far turn, and widened through the stretch under pressure to 70 yards out. BROADWAY CAT
stayed close while alternating between the rail and the two-path for six furlongs, could not keep up with the winner turning for home, and ran on to secure
the place. JANET B DOESIT ALL saved ground to the far turn, advanced while shifting out four wide approaching the stretch, then finished evenly. ETANA
was slow from the gate and trailed inside for six furlongs, moved out several paths through the furlong grounds and went by tired horses. CAT'S J N J raced
three to four wide early, and never reached contention. MIDNIGHT GEM raced three wide, put in a mild run on the far turn, but flattened out in the lane.
TEACHER DRAMA went along in the three-path much of the way, and made no impact. UNION LANE hit the left side of the gate coming out, pressed
INEDATEQUILA from outside to the far turn, and was finished before completing six furlongs.
