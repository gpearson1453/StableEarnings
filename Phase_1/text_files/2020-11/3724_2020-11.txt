under steady handling then came back lame and was vanned off. TABERNACLE closed up quickly and pressed the pace, chased three and four-wide on
the turn and was all out in the stretch. FLAWLESS PINK raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but
evened out in the late stages. MORE SAVVY settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, posted a
mild rally and did not menace. SILENT MAMBA showed brief speed, was joined in a duel early turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, chased to the final
16th and evened out. DOWN TO EARTH settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly from the outside. PURRSUADE ME
broke alertly but outward, showed brief speed then settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn then evened out mid stretch.

DANCING DEREK moved up to a short lead, set a pressured pace, was pressured upper stretch but held bravely to the wire. PAPA TONY stalked the pace,
closed four then three-wide late turn, lapped onto the leader upper stretch, was very game, but hung. TALL WATER, in range, closed along the rail on the
turn, chased into the stretch, launched an all out drive along the fence and was inching up late. GIANT ATTRACTION had brief speed then settled in mid
pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. WILEY O'RIELLY broke sharply but outward then was taken back to mid pack,
closed along the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely but failed to menace. HOPE VISION was away a step slowly and settled off the
pace, was hustled from the rail to two-wide on the turn and closed a gap. NORTHERN CRUSADER broke outward, forced the pace, was hustled three-wide
on the turn then evened out in the final furlong. LILLZ NOT CRYING stalked the pace, dropped back under a ride on the turn, chased into the stretch but
flattened out. RADIO NOWHERE had brief speed then settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

hustled from the rail on the far turn and chased through the stretch. LIQUID LOUIE settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch and finished evenly. L'ETAT (GER) was unhurried to the far turn, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished gamely.
TURF FLIGHT lost his path when I SEE THE STARS broke in front of him, settled in mid pack, closed on the backstretch, dropped back a bit late turn and

Footnotes
PRINZ OF VIOLENCE raced in mid pack, closed up the rail on the backstretch, stalked the pace on the turn, launched a determined stretch drive, moved
out a lane to be outside the pacesetter, dug in and was up just in time. SON OF MY FATHER set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn then was all out
in the stretch but was caught on the wire. I DANCE ALONE, in range early, stalked the pace, chased into the stretch, finished gamely but had no late kick.
CONQUER THE BREEZE broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed late turn but failed to menace in the stretch. JORDANS WAY raced in mid pack,
came two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and showed some interest late. ARTIESATTHEPARTY stalked the pace racing two-wide
throughout, chased into the stretch but evened out in mid stretch. BIG MATTEO stalked the pace, was steadied early on the backstretch, was squeezed
back between horses early on the far turn then finished gamely to no avail. OPTIMYSTICAL settled off the pace, closed three-wide on the far turn but never
reached contention. TIZ TAP TANGO raced in mid pack, closed late backstretch but evened out late turn and lacked a rally. TOGQUOS was herded at the
start and stumbled, settled far off the pace and trailed along the rail throughout.

Footnotes
EMBRACE MY UNCLE chased the leader inside of two rivals throughout, shot up the rail turning for home to take on the pacesetter, getting the lead by the
eighth pole and inching away late. GREEN GROWTH quick to the front from her outside post, stayed off the rail until the backstretch, drifted out turning for
home allowing the winner to sneak up to her inside, then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. TALLESTOFTHETALL was three wide outside two rivals
chasing the leader, loomed up turning for home but was no match for the top pair, levelling out in the final furlong. CRYPTIC GRIP settled along the inside in
mid pack, rallied around the far turn and tipped out into the four path in upper stretch, closing ground on the top three but ran out of real estate. GOOGLE IT
broke out at the start but recovered quickly to chase the leader between rivals, still in range midway on the far turn but tiring at the quarter pole and falling
back gradually. ICE BLUE off the pace and along the rail early. trailed into the far turn before rallying mildly down the stretch. CASH ADVANCE was two
wide in mid pack early, roused two to three wide around the far turn but could not get involved. ZEPHAN had a sluggish start and dropped off the pace,
never able to put in a bid. SARARENDA lost her footing at the start and never recovered, always near the rear.

THE BOSS FACTOR led quickly, set a reserved pace, quickened into the far turn and held sway under a drive. SILENT JET, in range, chased hard two and
three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. HALLIE'S HERO stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then
chased through the stretch. FIRE FOR EFFECT settled in mid pack, chased along the rail through the far turn then rallied gamely between foes.
PICCADILLY BEAU raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn and tendered a mild rally from the outside. KAIGUN settled in mid
pack, was hustled along the rail through the far turn but evened out in deep stretch. ENGLISH ILLUSION settled off the pace, was hustled three and
four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. OTHER THINGS EQUAL raced in mid pack early, chased from off the pace on the far turn but never
reached contention. CANMORE forced the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, tired at the top of the stretch and faded.
