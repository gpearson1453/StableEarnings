Footnotes
AFLEET MELODY, in the four path while outrun, split rivals racing into stretch, took the lead deep stretch and edged away. COMMISSIONER DAVE,
slowest gate then far back, rallied very wide and closed too late. JAYJAYDEE saved ground, took the lead on final turn, was clear mid stretch then faltered.
GRAY LITTLE MEADOW raced two wide and was never a serious threat. SHILOH LANE showed nothing passing faders. BEST START raced far off the
rail, drifted wider into stretch and was never a factor. EPIGRAMMATIST dropped back steadily and was being eased. POP POP'S BOY ran off to a long
early lead, stopped and was also being eased.

Footnotes
CHUB WAGON, between rivals early, moved in before leaving the backstretch, quickly drew clear on the turn and was fully extended to the wire. AIN'T
NONE LUCKY raced four wide on the turn, challenged on the turn, was no match for winner and held place. RACK DADDY was slow to settle into stretch,
raced very wide throughout just missed place. SOUR MASH, three wide dueling for the early lead, tired. THREE POTATOE FOUR split rivals on the far turn,
was left with the rail and then tired. RISQUE'S JEWEL, in the three path early, swung out very wide on the far turn and wasn't a threat. PALOMA GRIS
ducked out and stumbled leaving the gate then showed nothing. GLOSSY MADRINA broke very slow and was outrun. CONNOISSEUR was inside,
steadied in tight on the far turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
SCREEN SAVER stumbled at the start, recovered and was sent up along the rail to duel, fell back a bit on the turn, continued inside, came again and was
just up. GEEBERT, two wide, steadied lacking room near stretch, swung to the outside, loomed but was outfinished. CHRISATUDE vied for command three
wide, took the lead near mid stretch and held on tenaciously. VALENTINE BUG bobbled leaving gate then was squeezed soon after, split rivals turn, moved
out for the stretch run and finished evenly . ARRECIFE saved ground and never threatened. TOMASCO vied for command three wide then fell back leaving
the turn. STAY HYDRATED came out and bumped Jw'S THIRD MISCHIE soundly leaving the gate, vied for command four wide then tired. JW'S THIRD
MISCHIE, bumped leaving the gate, raced five wide while just off pace then tired. STRAWBERRY RED was throwing his head back and forth in the gate,
broke in a tangle well behind his field, raced wide and showed nothing. BARCODE was wide just off pace, suffered a catastrophic injury near the quarter
pole. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START. THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
TOMARIE was two and three wide dueling for the lead, took over for good after a half and off to win in hand. FINISHING SCHOOL was moving her head up
and down at the break, recovered quickly, raced wide, took up chase near stretch but was no match. HOLA PRINCESS, outrun early, raced very wide and
passed faders. ANISSA split rivals when moving on the backstretch then gave way. SILVER EXCESS was three wide dueling for the early lead then tired.
OWESAYCANYOUSEE angled to the rail after the start, had her heels clipped racing into the first turn, dueled inside then tired. THERE GOES MY GIRL
broke slowly and showed little. CHANCEE dueled for command racing wide then tired. THEODOSIA ducked in after the start, clipped heels and stumbled
racing into first turn then failed to menace. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INTO THE FIRST TURN BUT THE RESULTS
WERE UNCHANGED.
