Footnotes
MIA BEA STAR away without apparent mishap, took up the chase four wide, got set down as the half was being rattled off, battled her way to the front end
during the first half of the stretch run, extended the margin, kept to the task at hand. LOVE ME TOMORROW off a half length the quickest, retained the
advantage, got set up along the inside route prior to arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, led the field facing only mild resistance during the run
around the bend, was put to a drive for the drive, surrendered in the furlong grounds, stayed on for the place. MIZZYS IMAGE broke a half beat tardily,
moved up into a contending position on her accord on the backstretch, tucked into the pocket at the top of the turn, loosely drafted behind the winner, got
cued up maneuvering to the outside a short distance from the end of the bend, wound up three wide by midstretch, didn't make enough headway in the last
eighth. EMPRESS LUCIANA parked out five wide on the turn, was about as wide in the stretch, gained some to earn the final significant slice of the purse.
VITANZA stalked the pacesetter two to three wide for the opening half and gave way. LEMONCELLA three wide onto the turn, lacked the necessary
response. SANDER'S EMPIRE saved ground to no avail. MISTY TASTE mostly two wide for the initial half, was more towards the rail entering the stretch,
had no rally. CRICK three wide onto the turn, was five wide exiting it, never got involved. ADORABLE MAYA pursued the pace towards path two until the
end of the bend, shifted out into path four for the drive, backed away.

four wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. ECCOCI QUA broke in at the start bumping HAY LAD in concert with MR. TAG who

cornered along the inside into upper stretch leaving a seam for DISCIPLANARIAN, went to close that seam down near the three-sixteenths drifting in when

finish. MR. TAG broke out at the start bumping HAY LAD in tandem with ECCOCI QUA, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got bumped and altered out off the heels of the aforementioned foe at the three-sixteenths and

Footnotes
VIP NATION established control in short order, rated well showing the way, loosely-contested and while spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, sailed
along under the same scenario cutting split after split, was coming up to the three-sixteenths marker when asked for her best, offered up the desired
response, digging in with good determination in the final stages to preserve the decision. GIACOSA tracked the winner from along the inside route, got
roused for the drive, closed the gap in a steadfast manner, tipped out late, displayed willingness to the end but was staved off. LIGHT IN THE SKY eyed the
winner from the pocket, went into the stretch, got outfinished. SILKY BLUE stalked the winner two to three wide, gave way. PECATONICA kept watch on the
winner two wide in midpack, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, lacked a good closing punch. OUT OF TROUBLE took the inside route,
made no impact. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS hung out three wide on both turns, swung out four wide into the lane, folded. KREESIE raced three wide on
the turn one, was one path wider on the subsequent one, angled five wide entering the stretch, had no offering.

ZAEVION hustled from the gate bumping RYAN'S CAT, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive to prevail. TOPPER T forwardly placed along the inside down the
backstretch, lost position through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, tipped out to the six
path straightened away and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. DURKIN'S CALL bumped at the start by ALMENDRO, who broke outwards,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ALMENDRO broke out at the start bumping DURKIN'S CALL, showed the way in hand just off the inside under
pressure from a pair initially then from RYAN'S CAT to the outside, came under coaxing headed for the front at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
for home, took over narrow and brief command at the three-sixteenths before being displaced by the eventual winner near the eighth pole and weakened
through to the finish. CONTROL STAKE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
BRUSH COUNTRY got bumped after the start due to pressure outside from ZAEVION, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. RYAN'S CAT coaxed from the gate,
prompted the pace from the three path down the backstretch and into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths seizing narrow command,
continued three wide for home, yielded near the three-sixteenths and tired.

VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD secured the pocket after the field had been sent off and running, was put to hard prolonged drive beginning from the half mile pole,
cut the corner, waited patiently as DARK MONEY was slowly but surely drifting towards path two during the early stages of the stretch run, slipped by in
midlane to take over, was under aim from SIX PERCENT in the final stages, dug in to win the bob. SIX PERCENT off the inside throughout, pursued the
pace three wide on the turn, was ridden one wider into the lane, had a good finish down the center of the strip, fell just short of snatching away the verdict.
YANKEE DIVISION sat forwardly placed three wide, challenged in earnest entering the stretch, failed to claim the top, yet stayed on well for third. DARK
MONEY established the top, slid onto the inside route at the top of the backstretch, was rated along setting the pace, accompanied buy GOLANI BRIGADE
from the outside, settled onto the head of the stretch and was given his cue, inched its way into path two during the ensuing furlong, saw the winner wrest
away the advantage along the open rail corridor with just under an eighth to go, weakened. GOLANI BRIGADE stalked the pace from path two, going about
the task from between opponents for a good portion of the trip on the turn, got turned loose in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, had already fallen
back a bit approaching the sixteenth pole, fell back even readily after losing interest shortly afterwards. I LOVE JAXSON departed the backstretch from the
two path, swung into the lane and went on having never made his presence felt. FREAKY STYLEY along the inside route, tired after going a half.
DYNAMAX PRIME spotted along the rail, displayed no speed.

Footnotes
KOKOPELLI broke in at the start taking over the empty lane of DIAMOND IN THE SUN who broke slowly, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack,
tipped out to the two path put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to close stoutly outside
overhauling the leader when bumped by that foe seventy yards from home and was up late inching away to the finish to prevail. PALACE GOSSIP
established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, took to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat through to the finish coming
out to bump her main danger seventy yards from home to no avail when caught late and was along well clear of the rest for the place honors. MONDEUSE
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors.
SECRETS KEPT broke out at the start bumping with SHE'S A MAJESTIC, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside for home and offered up a mild bid by tired rivals. ATHENA DANCER chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and made no headway. TANGERINE DREAM prompted the pace two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOVE'S MISERY hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and tired. DIAMOND IN THE SUN broke a beat slow, chased just off the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. BLESSED MOTHERMARY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. SAYOH chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five
wide into upper stretch and tired. SHE'S A MAJESTIC bumped at the start by SECRETS KEPT who broke outwards, chased along the inside under a ride
from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MICROSECOND away well, was firmly rated tracking the pace from along the inside route, got eased to the outside as three-quarters was being completed,
was cued up spinning into the lane, clawed its way lead by midlane, felt the top one closing in late, but held on with determination to stay in the clear.
SANCTUARY CITY kept watch on the front runners from along the inside route until the end of the second bend, moved out towards path two stepping into
the stretch, had a good finish, but came up short. MATTY'S EXPRESS established the top after the break, cut over to the inside, was rated along, attended
by an equally-rated DANFUSI in the two path, ventured onward under the same set-up for the opening six furlongs, came under aim from the winner leading
the others in the lane, relinquished after putting up a fight over the course of the next furlong, stayed on to save the show. CONFORTO made it over to the
rail prior to reaching the top of the backstretch, continued to chase the pace from the inside route, cut the corner, rallied mildly in the final furlong to earn the
last major check. OPERATIVE patiently ridden from along the inside, stepped into the lane, stayed in contention for a little while longer then weakened.
ALBIE underwent a two wide journey after lunging at the start, lacked a closing punch after arriving into the lane. DANFUSI rated prompting the pace from
path two for three-quarters, gave way. SIMPLY chased the pace two to three wide until the end of the second bend, angled about four wide for the drive,
made no impact. TEN EYCK sat two wide midpack, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked the necessary response. CORAGESCONTENDER strung
out three wide on the first turn, sat reserved two wide afterwards, chose the inside route as the one to take into the stretch, had no rally. QUIET OUT EAST
along the outside throughout, raced three wide on the far turn, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, tired. ROCKIN JO three wide on both turns,
folded.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT broke in at the start bumping AMERICAN WEST, established the front shortly after the start showing the way from the two path under some
pressure from the presence of a pair to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the final seventy yards. AMERICAN WEST got bumped between foes at the start
who each broke her way, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. CAFE SOCIETY broke in at the start and
was corrected, vied briefly from the four path before settling in close pursuit, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three to four wide for home and weakened. SPA READY led early on before vying between foes briefly, then chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide for home and tired. DAUNTLESS GAL broke out at the start clipping heels with AMERICAN
WEST and bobbling heavily conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased four then three wide coming under brief coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
two to three wide for home, folded and was eased to the finish.

Footnotes
ARREST ME RED away in good order, tracked the front runners from the pocket, was kept on hold behind some traffic awaiting options late oh the bend,
inched outward stepping onto the head of the stretch, loosely drafted the leader for the next several jumps before altering course to the outside while just off
that opponent's heels in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, kicked into her best and closed the gap, split foes at the start of the final furlong, struck
the front end less than a sixteenth down the road, drew clear. TOWN OF GOLD broke in line with WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN, edged away from foe in short
order and cut over to the inside with the advantage, showed the way, rider holding something back and with TRADE DEAL in attendance out in the two path,
got called upon coming under heavier pressure heading onto the top of the lane, was headed a short distance beyond the eighth pole, held on well to
salvage second. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN gathered after coming out slightly at the start, took up the chase two wide, was worked into path four from
upper to midstretch, got staved off. TRADE DEAL taken hold after briefly shying from WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN in the shadow of the starting gate,
prompted the pace towards path two, challenged in earnest from the top of the lane to midstretch, failed to claim the top and weakened. LIGHT US UP rode
the rail, stepped into the lane, made no headway. CHROME DIXIE took up position in midpack, kept an eye on the pacesetter from along the inside on the
bend, was maneuvered into path five during the early stages of stretch drive, lacked the necessary response. TEXAS BASIN darted into path two after the
field had been sent off and running, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, wound up trailing throughout.
