early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. RUNAWAY DREAM was through after a half. CRAFTY LADY was never a factor.

Footnotes
MARGARET'S JOY saved ground far off of the pace, advanced around the far turn before coming into the lane two wide and between horses while tracking
the leaders, shifted three wide through upper stretch, then sustained her rally to bid outside of DINN RIGH passing the furlong pole, flopped back to her left
lead passing the sixteenth pole, but still forged an advantage approaching the wire. DINN RIGH stalked along the inside before prompting the pace two wide
around the far turn, kept on through upper stretch as the pace setter held a margin, but inched closer approaching the furlong pole, forged an advantage
before digging in to hold it from MARGARET's JOY passing that marker, but could not fend that foe off approaching the wire. REARRANGE raced far off of
the pace two to three wide around the first turn, then four wide around the far turn, rallied through the lane, but was outkicked by an inner foe approaching
the furlong pole, then chased through the late stages while not having enough to produce a late bid. BALLOT INITIATIVE raced off of the pace in the two
path around the first turn, then in the four to five path around the far turn, and rallied willingly through the lane. SAIL ON ELLEN set the pace along the
inside, dug in to manage a clear margin through upper stretch, but was tested and headed by foes at the furlong pole, and gave way. HAPPY TUNE saved
ground from midpack, but raced keenly into and around the first turn, stayed unsettled down the backstretch, and failed to produce a bid before weakening
through the lane. REGAL PASSAGE stalked two wide, then from the three path around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. KEEPTHE MAIN THING
bobbled and shied from an inner foe at the start, then trailed the field, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor. SMOOTHOVER took bumps from
rivals on both sides at the start, then lied forwardly placed two to three wide before tiring in upper stretch. INNOVATE tracked from midpack in the three
path, but was done early.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT PATRIOT dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, shook free from them in upper stretch, then drew off passing the furlong pole, and held
sway. JURISDICTION stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, then altered out to the four path at the furlong pole as
COMMUNICATOR drifted across his path, then split foes at the sixteenth pole to edge place. IRISH SPIRIT lied forwardly placed two wide and between
horses, tipped four wide turning for home to rally outside of the leading trio, but only produced a chasing rally, failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in
upper stretch, then was outkicked for place by an inner foe passing the sixteenth pole. COMMUNICATOR dueled for the lead three wide, but failed to keep
pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch, drifted inwards passing the furlong pole, and yielded thereafter. BOURBON TRAIL was off slowly, raced far
off of the pace two wide, and improved but failed to menace. RIVERS OF LITE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace
with his inner foe in upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. TIZ MCNAMARA trailed the field, took the turn in the two to four path before
swinging to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. GOOD CLEAN FUN tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, but
weakened after being floated to the five path approaching the quarter pole. AREYAREADYFREDDY hopped at the start, saved ground far off of the pace,
but was outrun. LAUGHING LEVI broke sharply, but raced far off of the pace in the five path into the turn, then was eased in upper stretch, pulled up
through the final furlong, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SONNEMAN tracked from midpack in the three path, inched closer around the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, quickly
asserted command and readily drew off at the three sixteenths pole, and finished strongly to widen his margin. MAILMAN MONEY prompted the pace two
wide, vied around the far turn, but proved no match for an outer rallying foe in upper stretch, then secured place from his inner counterpart. MO MOSA set
the pace along the inside, held a slight advantage around the far turn, but was headed by a pair of foes passing the quarter pole, proved no match for one of
them in upper stretch, then failed to reclaim place from the other while keeping on through the lane. WHAT A COUNTRY raced far off of the pace in the four
path around the first turn, came under a drive while shifting down to the three path into the far turn, but failed to respond and did not play a factor. CASH
LOGISTICS saved ground around both turns while trailing, then passed a tired foe without factoring. OAK HILL stalked along the inside, but pulled while
rank through the first turn, settled down the backstretch, but came under a drive to keep pace with the leaders passing the three furlong pole, tipped three
wide turning for home, but weakened through upper stretch.

Footnotes
STORM RUNNER took some bumps from an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead outside of BLACKLINE while staying a path away from that foe, drew
clear of that rival in upper stretch, then tired late, but lasted. APRECIADO stalked two wide, tipped three wide turning for home, chased the clear leader as
HEMP HEMP HURRAY ranged up alongside, then gained through the final furlong as the leader tired, but did not have enough to catch him while safely
fending off his outer counterpart for place. HEMP HEMP HURRAY tracked from midpack two to three wide around the turns, shifted four wide turning for
home and rallied outside of APRECIADO through the lane, but was fended off by that foe for place. GO POKE THE BEAR got rank crossing the wire for the
first time and into the first turn, saved ground far off of the pace around both bends, then produced a mild rally inside of foes to achieve a minor reward.
KURILOV (CHI) saved ground off of the pace, tipped three wide turning for home inside of HEMP HEMP HURRAY, but was outkicked by that foe at the
quarter pole, shifted in, and stayed on, but was nailed for fourth. IMPERIAL MISSION was bumped between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the
two to three paths around the turns, swung five wide turning for home, but failed to rally. BLACKLINE dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but
gave way to that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. STORMCOAST hopped at the start, stalked from the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. BRIAR
JUMPER trailed the field, took the far turn in the five path, and never got involved. WORLD TAX WAR (IRE) raced off of the pace three to four wide around
the turns, and weakened.
