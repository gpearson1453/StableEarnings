start, chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. FAST RECOVERY trailed the field early
on, was in the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. DRINK chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in
the stretch drive. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and empty down the lane. APPROVED was through after
three quarters. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN was bumped at the start and done early. GREENSPAN broke awkwardly and was outrun. JUST LIKE RICHIE
was through early.

LIMONITE settled off of the pace two wide, made a three wide bid for the lead into the far turn, vied around that bend, then dueled outside of SPACE
MOUNTAIN through the lane, and prevailed over that foe approaching the wire. SPACE MOUNTAIN set the pace along the inside, vied inside of multiple
foes around the far turn, dug in inside of LIMONITE in upper stretch, gamely dueled inside of that foe through the lane, but was nailed on the wire. EASY
SHOT trailed the short field, took the far turn two wide, tipped four wide turning for hoe, and rallied to get up for show in the late stages. PROMPT tucked
down around the first turn, stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, and lost show late. INTREPID HEART stalked
outside of the leader, vied two wide and between horses around the far turn, then weakened passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
PERFECT SENSE got rank from restraint passing the wire for the first time, settled far off of the pace, advanced two wide around the far turn, split foes at
the quarter pole to take aim on GOOD JUJU, then rallied, bid passing the furlong pole, and readily drew off thereafter. GOOD JUJU cleared off in the four
path into the first turn, stayed clear around the far turn and though upper stretch, was no match for an outer foe approaching the sixteenth pole, and was
second best. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY stalked from the two to three path around the first turn, drifted to the four path turning for home while not keeping pace
with the leader, then stayed on show. ENGLANDER lied close up along the inside, but chased the leaders through the lane. TRIBULATION took a solid
bump from an outer foe at the start, then raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. LAUTREC saved
ground in midpack, but tired. SCOTT POND solidly bumped an inner foe at the start, then was outrun. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS lied forwardly placed in
the four path around the first turn, but was done early, and eased through the lane.

LOCALLY OWNED stalked along the inside, and from the pocket around the far turn, tipped three wide passing the quarter pole, cleared inner foes and
shifted in approaching the furlong marker, rallied inside of the leaders to produce a bid passing that marker, then edged past the leader in the late stages.
CHESS CHIEF tracked from midpack three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, dug in inside of FORT PECK in upper stretch, held an advantage
passing the furlong pole, but was bested by an inner surging foe in the late stages. FORT PECK raced far off of the pace in the three path around the first
turn, advanced in the four path and outside of foes around the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied while chasing CHESS CHIEF through the
lane, but flattened out in the late stages. NEPAL UP lagged behind the field, saved ground turning for home, and rallied along the rail past foes in upper
stretch, then chased the leaders home. HAUNT cleared around the first turn, then met multiple bids around the far turn before weakening in upper stretch.
TANK COMMANDER saved ground from midpack, got rank approaching the seven furlong pole, but quickly resettled, then swung to the five path turning for
home, but lacked a bid and faded. TWO THIRTY FIVE stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
MOVIE MOXY stalked two wide, bid turning for home before assuming command passing the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure passing the
furlong marker, and was geared down late. STREET OF DREAMS set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to MOVIE MOXY passing the
quarter pole, and was second best. STORM AT SEA settled off of the pace, advanced mildly two wide around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home,
but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then stayed on to reach show at the wire under a long drive. TIPSY GAL tracked from midpack three
wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the quarter pole, then got nailed on the wire for show. FATE FACTOR saved ground from midpack,
but awaited racing room at the five sixteenths pole, shifted two wide turning for home, the stayed on inside of foes through the lane, but failed to reach them
for show. BROADWAY LADY stalked along the inside, but steadily faded around the turn. MAGA SUITE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
READY TO ANSWER dueled for the lead along the inside, put away his counterpart while digging in to hold an advantage from FASTLY in midstretch, and
gamely repelled that foe approaching the wire. FASTLY stalked the leading duelers from the two path, made a three wide bid for the lead turning for home,
dueled for the lead while drifting a bit outwards in midstretch, straightened passing the furlong marker, but was repelled by his inner counterpart approaching
the wire. NOREN dueled for the lead two wide, but gave way between horses in upper stretch. SCALE was bumped on both sides at the start, advanced
from far off of the pace by saving ground turning for home, and chased the leaders through the lane. CENTRIFUGE was off slowly, raced off of the pace in
the five path around the turn, and failed to menace. SHANANIES PAYNTER raced far off of the pace along the inside, and passed tired foes without
factoring. CREASY was off slow, trailed the field two wide into the turn, and improved. BE FIERCE lied forwardly placed in the three path, but faded on his
left lead in upper stretch. CARMEL BAY was done early. STEELY DANZA raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and weakened in upper
stretch. ATOKA saved ground from midpack, but weakened turning for home.
