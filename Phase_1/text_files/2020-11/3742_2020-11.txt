Footnotes
NEVER SURPRISED away in good order, secured a prominent position on the backstretch, departed it from path three, took over the role as primary
pursuer midpoint on the turn, tucked one path closer to the rail once sufficiently in the clear, this occurring in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole,. whittled
away at the deficit, spun in the lane roused and directly abreast of the second place finisher, out-dueled the opponent during the ensuing furlong, kicked
away smartly under good handling. VENERABLE powered up along the inside to the front end on his own accord, was well rated showing the way, attended
by KENTUCKY KNIGHT one path farther off the rail, came under pressure from the winner during the later stages of the run around the bend, got asked for
more as the pair entered the stretch on near even terms, relinquished reluctantly, stayed on with good energy to earn the second best designation.
KENTUCKY KNIGHT pressed the pace from path two until the three-eighths pole before giving way. EXCELLORATOR three wide onto the turn, was slightly
closer to the inside stepping onto the top of the lane, made no headway. COACH P guided into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch,
failed to fire appreciably after cutting the corner into the stretch. MACLYRICAL sluggish while taking the inside route for the opening half, tipped into path
two for entrance into the stretch, never made his presence felt. ROCCO STRONG failed to menace after undergoing a two wide journey.

Footnotes
FANGIRL quickly established control, sailed along in the two path on an open lead on the backstretch pulling a bit on the left, stepped onto the turn and
extended the advantage, pilot holding something back in reserve, extended the margin even more still being lightly ridden during the opening phases of the
stretch run, was put to an abbreviated drive in the general area of the sixteenth marker with no outcome no longer in doubt. HOLMDEL PARK pursued the
pace three wide, was in the same path entering the stretch, outfinished CHARLOTTE WEBLEY to be along for the place. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY off the
inside throughout, chased the pace two to three wide on the turn, got steered out into path five from upper to midstretch, raced a bit erratically in the final
furlong, lost second. LEFT LEANING LUCY set up in the two path, was hard ridden spinning into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. QUEENDOM
took up residence in midpack, was in path two both entering and exiting the turn, made no impact. TRAPPED N MY MIND away last after bumping with
ANYDAYISHERDAY in the shadow of the starting gate, left the backstretch from path two, angled four wide for the drive, had no offering.
ANYDAYISHERDAY lightly bumped at the start, gradually made her way over to the inside route, went on to save ground to no avail. DARE TO TRY
corrected after coming out with its initial step, saved ground while almost trailing throughout.

KNOWN AGENDA hustled from the gate, raced four then three wide through the opening bend settling just off the pace four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide half a mile from home and advanced on the front tucking to the two path with seven-sixteenths to run, took over command
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths already under challenge from GREATEST HONOUR to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, widened away
in tandem from the rest, dug in knocking heads with that rival getting bumped lightly at the eighth pole and then brushed inside that station and gamely
fended off the challenge to prevail by a head on the wire. GREATEST HONOUR three then two wide through the first turn, settled in pursuit four paths off
the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked three wide half a mile from home and advanced into contention at the three-eighths
stacking outside the top pair with five-sixteenths remaining when placed to coaxing, spun just off the inside for home under a drive, spurted clear of the rest
of the field as a pair, dug in knocking heads through the length of the stretch coming in slightly to bump his main rival a furlong out before coming in to brush
that foe inside that station, both times being corrected just after, fought gamely to the finish but was denied at the end. OVERTOOK two to three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while improving position for the show
honors. BLU GROTTO established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home yielding command and was
coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths drifting to the two path, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SONO GRATO bumped at the start by
LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME, raced three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, took over command at the half mile
pole and tucked inside at that station, came under threat from a pair and yielded at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
BELLAGIO broke a beat slow and lost his lane to LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME, who broke outwards, chased along the inside until tipped out three to four wide
put to urging at the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and tired. GO LIME chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path into the far turn, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME broke out at the start bumping SONO GRATO
and taking over the lane of BELLAGIO, chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

SUZ vied for the lead during the initial stages, edged away and went onto the inside route after the first fraction had been finalized, showed the way tailed by
GOLD HEARTED PEARL from the outside, got set down to a hard drive approaching the quarter pole, kicked away to her largest lead during the next
eighth, saw the second place finisher moving the best of all in the last stages, held on to preserve the decision. STAY FOND pursued the pace three wide
on the turn, altered course into path six in midstretch, settled into her best stride, closed the gap belatedly with good energy, came up short. MOVIE SCORE
took up position in midpack on the backstretch, departed it from the two path, got sent out five wide from upper to midsrtretch, mustered up a mild response
sufficient enough to snag the show award. DIRTY BIRD chased the pace three wide, was driven into the lane, got outfinished. OFFLEE IRISH bobbled
slightly losing her footing springing from the starting gate, went on to take the inside route until the end of the bend, got worked out towards path three from
upper to midstretch, made no impact. MISS LOYALTY at or near the two path until the head of the stretch, cut over to the rail for better racing clearance at
the three-sixteenths marker, had no rally. PEACHES AND SPICE raced two to three wide on the turn, wandered out into path seven down the lane lacking a
response. ZECHA within striking distance of the front runners on the backstretch, travelled four wide on the turn, shifted out towards path six while backing
away in the stretch. COLD HEARTED PEARL pressed the winner two wide on the turn and gave way.

THE GOLDEN DOOR saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped to the two path into the far turn and came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole
angling out to swing seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside issuing a challenge inside the final sixteenth, overhauled the front nearing the finish
and prevailed edging away at the end. TACKLE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps. NEURO established the front and showed the way crossing to the
inside into the first turn, got joined by JADE'S DREAM five furlongs from home and knocked heads with that rival coming to the quarter pole, cut the corner
into upper stretch, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught in the late stages, then got nailed on the wire for the place honors.
BERNARDINO saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and took to the
rail straightened away, rallied up the inside with the aid of the infield chute latching on the leader inside the eighth pole before being forced to steady in tight
briefly, then kept on to the finish for the last major share. AMERICAN PIPER saved ground just off the pace, got set down swinging four then three wide
straightened away for home, weakened in the late stages. JADE'S DREAM hard held early on along the inside conceding the front, tipped to the two path
through the first turn tracking in closest aim before advancing to duel from the five-eighths pole, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three then
two wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going. NOBLE MISCHIEF just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HURRICANE ANDREW three wide through
the first turn, chased just off the inside until tucked inside three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no rally. A VOW OF
BEAUTY just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. KEY TO VICTORY three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper

Footnotes
SCREAMIN' BY took up the chase two wide towards the rear of the pack got fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, finished with good energy
down the center of the course to wrest away the advantage in the final strides. FRESCO settled into midpack after the start, departed the backstretch from
path three, quickened when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, maintained the momentum after spinning into the lane, fighting its way to a slim lead
by the end of the run through the furlong grounds, felt heavy pressure in the last eighth, eventually giving into it with several jumps to spare before the wire.
SUMMER AT THE SPA tracked the pace while spaced at a slight distance from off the inside, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied with willingness to
secure the show. DRAGONESS quickly sent over to the rail, rode it for the opening half, got sent out five wide into the stretch, mustered up a good kick to
be along for the last significant slice of the purse. ANCIENT BROWN saved ground until the end of the bend, angled five wide for the stretch run, rallied
mildly. JEN'S BATTLE kept an eye on the pacesetter from the pocket, without benefit of cover, cut the corner and slipped by the weakening leader in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, sustained the run for a little longer then flattened out. GRAETZ chased the pace two wide on the turn, moved out into
path four after entering the stretch, lacked the necessary response. CAPE COD DIVA stationed along the inside route for the opening half, tipped out
towards path two for entrance onto the head of the stretch, weakened. IMINCOMUNICADO forced the issue three wide and gave way. CANARSIE ANGEL
contended for the top while racing in path two, got overwhelmed early during the stretch run , steadily backed away afterwards. LINDA'S BALLET three wide
and asked on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HARDCORE FOLKLORE five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn advancing on the leader and
taking command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, drew away to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail.
MILLS seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths steadily advancing outside
rivals, continued five wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors cutting into the winner's margin to the finish. PLAYWRIGHT broke in at
the start bumping FINANCIAL FREEDOM, grew detached at the tail of the field seven to eight paths off the inside when sluggish early, tucked four to five
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly outside to procure the
show honors. ORPHEUS (ARG) chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SCARF IT DOWN four wide in pursuit, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late going. SHALAKO chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. BEACH ACCESS forwardly placed three wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from home
and took over command showing the way briefly to the five-sixteenths before yielding the front to the eventual winner, took the inside route into upper
stretch and tired. PIPES just off the inside just off the pace in pursuit, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went five to six wide into upper stretch and
tired. FINANCIAL FREEDOM bumped at the start by PLAYWRIGHT, who broke inwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. JUSTIN FRONT established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside half a mile from home and yielded the front inside that station, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and faltered.

Footnotes
PICKIN' TIME along the outside, sat perched three wide during the run around the bend, got cued up going after the ones to catch in earnest entering the
stretch, clawed his way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, kicked clear, driving. TEN FOR TEN grabbed the advantage shortly after the start, was
spotted towards the inside route on the lead, pressed by ISOLATE from the outside, inched away from that one as three-quarters was being completed only
to come under aim by the winner right afterwards, surrendered making its way through the furlong grounds, stayed on to finish well clear of the others for
second. ISOLATE pressed the issue two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter coming into the lane, swerved out while backing away in midstretch,
straightened away and continued his retreat. NOVA RAGS took up the chase primarily from the two path, slid over to the rail in time to cut the corner into the
lane, had no response. CIVIL WAR sent over to the rail nearing the half mile pole, went three wide into the lane, made no gain. IRISH HONOR yanked
towards the inside shortly after the start, was three wide entering the turn and sent out five wide exiting it, never made his presence felt. SPECTATORLESS
two wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, was through after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
LITTLE DUTCH GIRL just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the
corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to close well on the drifting out leader and was up in the final jumps to prevail. U SHOULD B
DANCING coaxed from the gate, came out shortly after the start and bumped STELLA MARS in tandem with KREESA LA WROTE, showed the way in
hand from the three path, tucked inside through the turn, got let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole drifting out despite
some off sided stick work, continued to drift out through the stretch under a drive to the finish about ten paths to the wire and was caught in the final strides.
KREESA LA WROTE came in shortly after the start and bumped STELLA MARS in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and closed well to
secure the show honors. EMPIRES FIRST LADY chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. STELLA MARS broke out at the start bumping QUIET
TYPE, then got bumped between rivals each coming her way shortly after the start and was jostled and pinched between foes, chased four paths off the
inside from just off pace, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a
mild bid but was outkicked. VIOLENTIAM bumped at the start by GUN HILL GIRL, who broke outwards, got carried out in tandem with THE PROMISED
ROAD by that same rival three paths five furlongs from home, tucked to the four path after that foe cleared and raced forwardly placed, tucked to the two
path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. THE
PROMISED ROAD coaxed from the gate, tucked briefly five paths off the rail before being carried out to the seven or eight path by GUN HILL GIRL who
came outwards from the inside, tucked three wide through the turn in pursuit from just off the pace coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. QUIET TYPE got bumped at the start by STELLA MARS and shied outwards from the exchange, chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and was unable to make an impact. AZOGAR broke out at the start bumping CAPTIVATING CARA, raced seven to eight paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch, made some
ground while making no positional headway. CAPTIVATING CARA bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased eight paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. GUN HILL GIRL broke out at the start bumping VIOLENTIAM and was corrected, tucked briefly four wide before getting out at the five-eighths pole
carrying out VIOLENTIAM and THE PROMISED ROAD three paths despite attempts at correction, race forwardly placed to the half mile pole six paths off
the inside, then got out through the far turn to be nine or ten paths off the inside midway, finished the course under her own power galloping to the end.
