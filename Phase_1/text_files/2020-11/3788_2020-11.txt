Footnotes
HIT THE WOAH coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and was in tight briefly twice nearing the half mile pole getting steadied very briefly along the
rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied, tipping out near the eighth pole to
the two to three path and steadily gained outside to take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. AMALFI
PRINCESS vied from the seven path down the backstretch with a trio to her inside, tucked four to five wide through the turn emerging in tandem with INTO
VANSIHING to her inside, took over command just inside three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, spun three then two wide straightened away into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under lone threat and was caught inside the final sixteenth, while well clear of the rest and along second best. INTO
VANISHING broke out at the start bumping WHY SHE DEW DAT, vied between foes among a quartet six paths off the inside, emerged with a slight
command tucked four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and was headed inside that station, spun three wide for home and
weakened in the stretch while along for the show honors. IMAGERY hustled from the start, vied from the three path inside a trio down the backstretch, got
shaken off into the turn and went four wide through that bend coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. WHY SHE DEW DAT brushed the near side stall at the start then got bumped and put in tight between foes when INTO VANISHING came
outwards, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six to
seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TEKILA coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. BLUE PAYNT coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, angled five wide for home and tired. TAKE IT OFF vied between foes five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was shaken off placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired.

drifted out late despite pilot applying strong right pressure, held sway. PIER FORTY off the inside, closed the gap three wide on the turn, angled out
approximately five wide into the stretch, closed in on the one to catch in a steadfast manner, came up short. DOUBLE SHOT strung out four wide on the
turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, venturing onward as practically the widest of all throughout, was along for the show. ALLIED
INVASION faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey. ROYAL SUSPECT stalked the pacesetter three wide, commenced the stretch one path wider,
gave way. LIGHTNING ROB guided onto the rail midway on the backstretch, got swung out five wide for the stretch run, launched no bids. ANZIO BEACH a
forward factor in the three path, folded.

Footnotes
AMOS chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied up the
inside to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in dueling to the finish with the runner up in game fashion and got the decision on the wire.
TILTINGATWINDMILLS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
issuing a challenge through the final furlong to knock heads with the aforementioned foe through to the finish gamely but was bested at the end. OK HONEY
broke in at the start bumping NASTY AFFAIR and FIVE ALARM ROBIN and pinching out NASTY AFFAIR, raced six paths off the inside down the
backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and taking over command, swung six wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. NASTY AFFAIR got bumped and
pinched out at the start due to pressure from OK HONEY breaking inwards, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to
the two path through the turn placed to coaxing just inside the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was
outkicked. VIBRANCY established the front and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, came under coaxing just inside the three-eighths under
threat, yielded the front and went four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. FIVE ALARM ROBIN bumped at the start by OK HONEY who
broke inwards, chased five to six wide coming under brief light coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the
finish.

Footnotes
BREES BAYOU at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, advanced four wide towards the ones to catch on the turn, maintained its momentum
angling one path farther off the rail into the stretch, chipped away the deficit, began the final sixteenth on near even terms with VERMONT BILLY, ground
his way past that stubborn foe with a few jumps to spare before the finish line to prove best. VERMONT BILLY established the top in short order, cut over to
the rail coming up to the top of the turn, got asked for more while under attack by WILD CAT WEST in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, flicked
that opponent only to have the winner take aim by the furlong grounds, relinquished reluctantly a short distance from the end. WILD CAT WEST hustled
from the gate to get going, prompted VERMONT BILLY from the outside, going about the task from path two starting on the turn, got cued up issuing its best
short coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, kept up its quest in earnest for another sixteenth or so then backed away. WARFRONT FIGHTER took up the
chase three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, narrowed in, but not enough so as to snatch away the show. CANARSIE GIRL
pursued the front runners from the two path, gave way after going a half. MUCHO SUNSHINE abandoned the rail approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, was hung out five wide on the bend, wandered out towards path eight stepping into the lane, never made her presence felt. LUCKY LINDSEY
saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SUPER DUDE brushed at the start by CHIEF KNOW IT ALL who broke in a step, established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide
under some pressure from CREATIVE STYLE to the outside, spun three wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, dug in dueling through
the length of the stretch and gamely held on to the finish. CREATIVE STYLE prompted the leader from the outside five paths off the inside, tucked three
wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads through to
the finish in game fashion but was ultimately denied at the end. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL broke out a step at the start brushing SUPER DUDE, chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths when tipped four wide nudging FLEER IRISH five wide, angled five wide for home and weakened in the late
stages. LUCKY RAMSEY three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in
the late going. FLEET IRISH six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
got nudged five wide at the three-eighths by CHIEF KNOW IT ALL, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PATEGORY ONE sparred for command from the two path, challenged in earnest stepping onto the head of the stretch, wore down a stubborn foe with
approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged clear. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS out at the start, made some light contact with its next stall neighbor, got
guided over to the inside route, vied with the winner hitched up for nearly three-quarters, saw their dispute pick up in intensity heading home, put up a fight
prior to releasing the lead for good in the general area of the sixteenth pole, stayed on for second. FARRAGUT attained a forward position, sat within
striking distance of the first two finishers racing three wide, got roused crossing the midway point of the turn, stepped into the lane, held the show.
FOREVER WICKED settled into midpack, chased the pace from path two on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked a solid closing punch.
RUN FOR BOSTON gently pinched after being brushed from both sides at the start, raced sluggishly on the chute, picked it up gradually joining up with the
others on backstretch, went onto the inside route at the half mile pole, stayed put to the end of the bend, fanned out into path five for the drive, gained.
PADDY ALL DAY brushed with RUN FOR BOSTON right after the field had been sent on its way, departed the backstretch from path two, got swung out
into path three for the stretch, lacked the necessary offering. DANCERS FOR TOKEN three wide onto the turn, was in path four exiting it, made no impact.
THIS CAT CAN FLY brushed from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, was parked out four wide on the turn, got sent into path six from upper to
midlane, continuing onward as the widest off all, never made his presence felt. BLACKJACK DAVEY underwent a ground-saving journey, gave out after
cutting the corner into the stretch, then was pulled up quickly after the finish.

FULL IMPACT four then three wide in closest aim of the front applying some pressure, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command and
swung three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. TWELTH MAN five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home safely securing the place honors. BLINDWILLIE MCTELL coaxed
from the gate, chased inside briefly before tipping three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the half mile
pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WAR TOCSIN coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside
under some pressure to the outside, came under a pair of off sided taps near the quarter pole and yielded the front, the rider seeming to be ready to place a
protective hold before swinging two to three wide for home, then got flashed the stick to the off side while in retreat to the finish. THE SICARII chased three
then four wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON pursued the pace three wide until the end of the second bend, tipped one path wider stepping onto the top of the lane and was
given his cue, narrowed in, went at it eye to eye with MUSICAL HEART during the final seventy yards and gamely got the job done. MUSICAL HEART
prompted the pace three wide, got roused taking over the lead a short distance shy of the quarter pole, was inching away from the former pacesetter when
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON arrived on the scene by the end of the furlong grounds, saw that one whittle away at the advantage, vied with vigour matched up
with that opponent for much of the final sixteenth, wound up the one getting denied. WINSTON'S CHANCE hustled from the gate, glided onto the inside
route with the advantage by the top of the clubhouse bend, showed the way, feeling the presence of the second place finisher from the outside all the while,
came under a drive getting headed past the five-sixteenths pole, fought onward during the ensuing furlong, backed away after failing to re-claim the lead but
managed to save the show. FINANCIAL SYSTEM gunned out of the gate, but out-hustled for the front end by WINSTON;'S CHANCE, was patiently ridden
tracking that one afterwards towards the inside, was more in the two path on the far turn, stepped into the lane and gave way. EKHTIBAAR took up the
chase two wide, was being urged along on the turn two, went into the lane and folded. EVALUATOR trailed throughout while undergoing a ground-saving
journey.
