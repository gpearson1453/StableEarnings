Footnotes
VICTORY BOULEVARD broke slowly, tucked from the five path to the three path into the turn while rating off of the pace, held that path while advancing
between horses turning for home, then shifted in to split foes at the furlong pole, produced a bid inside of that marker, reached the lead approaching the
wire, and held. PEPPER PIKE tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, chased inner foes through midstretch
under a long drive, then stayed on to produce a bid outside of the tiring leader, but was outfinished by an inner rallying rival and missed. MORNING SOCIAL
stalked three wide, vied outside of a pair of foes into the turn before dueling outside of FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY into the lane, forged an advantage from that
foe approaching the furlong pole, but tired late, and was outfinished by and inner foe and an outer rival approaching the wire. ADHHAR stalked along the
inside, but was outmoved by outer foes while shifting off of the rail turning for home, then kept on inside of leading outer rivals through the lane, but failed to
produce a bid. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY stalked two wide, bid for the lead inside of MORNING SOCIAL into the turn, held an advantage from that foe while
shifting to the three path turning for home, but was headed and faltered approaching the furlong pole. IDEA MAN was outrun. RAYO DE LUZ set the pace
along the inside, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole, and wilted through the lane.

Footnotes
WHISKY MAN tracked the pace from the three path around the turn, smoothly shifted five wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane to
reach the front passing the furlong pole, edged clear, and safely held MAJOR KONG at bay through the final sixteenth. MAJOR KONG rushed leaving the
chute to achieve stalking position two wide and between horses at the five furlong pole, held that position through the turn, but was outkicked by WHISKY
MAN in upper stretch, then split foes passing the furlong pole to attempt a bid inside of that rival in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough. IRISH
SPIRIT stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of TOM'S LAST GENERAL at the half mile pole, held a narrow margin from that foe around the turn, then
dug in inside of bidding foes in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, and gave way. RIVERS OF LITE stalked the pace two to three wide, bid
outside of IRISH SPIRIT turning for home, but chased that foe through upper stretch without reaching even terms, then was outkicked by an outer foe
approaching the furlong pole, and an inner foe passing that marker. WIND TWIST raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn turn, came into the lane
in the three to four path, and improved. TIZ MCNAMARA tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper
stretch, and faded. ALTERNATE NIGHTS trailed along the inside, and never got involved. LEA RIDGE saved ground in midpack, but failed to produce or
sustain a bid. TOM'S LAST GENERAL set the pace along the inside, but was headed passing the half mile pole, and weakened turning for home.

passing the three sixteenths pole, then fended off SUGAR LOVE's late bid through the final sixteenth. SUGAR LOVE stalked along the inside, awaited
racing room while getting outmoved turning for home, then surged through a rail opening at the furlong pole, dueled inside of ERV'S WRENCH through the
final sixteenth, but was fended off. BLACK KAT TAPS tracked from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, got floated five wide at the quarter pole,
but was outkicked by her inner counterpart in upper stretch, then stayed on to achieve show. FLASHY BIZ saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two to
three path passing the quarter pole, but found traffic in upper stretch, shifted to the rail at the furlong pole to follow SUGAR LOVE's rally, but only managed
to chase the leaders home. IRISH WILLOW stalked three wide, inched closer turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe while failing to keep pace
with inner rivals in upper stretch. SUPER CAT LADY dueled for the lead inside of BEAUTY DAY, drifted out a bit in upper stretch allowing for clear racing
room for SUGAR LOVE, then got swallowed between horses passing the furlong pole. BEAUTY DAY dueled for the lead two wide, but faltered between

TALKER at the sixteenth pole, and won going away under driving pressure. TELEPHONE TALKER tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, inched
closer turning for home to bid for the lead in upper stretch, vied under a long drive through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival passing the
sixteenth pole, stayed on, but was bested. DEAN MARTINI advanced from midpack into the turn to stalk two wide and between horses around the bend, but
was bumped by his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, then kept on to willingly chase that foe through the final stages. BY YOUR SIDE rated off of
the pace two wide around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and sustained a grinding rally. FIGHTING SEABEE trailed the field in the three to four
path around the turn before shifting six wide turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. WILD WES vied for the lead two wide and between horses
around the turn, dug in while clinging to an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed by rivals on both sides at the furlong pole, and weakened. CRYPTO

Footnotes
SOUTHERN PASSAGE rallied in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide turning for home to take aim on the clear leader, then wore that foe down
at the sixteenth pole, and won going away. BIRD RULER bumped with an inner foe early on, stalked the pace setter from the outside, vied around the turn
before drawing clear turning for home, but was worn down by a rival at the sixteenth pole, and stayed well clear of show. MR. PETERKIN chased along the
inside, shifted to the three path in midstretch, and improved. MOUNTAIN BEAR dropped his original rider pre-race and needed a replacement, chased the
pace from midpack two wide, gave way in upper stretch, but regained a minor placing. POLLARD'S DAY tracked from midpack in the five path around the
turn, and weakened late. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER set the pace in the two path, but was headed and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. PARROT HEAD
saved ground off of the pace, but failed to menace. MR. EINSTEIN failed to factor. CULVER took the turn two wide and off of the pace, and failed to make
an impact. MUTABAADAL shied a bit from an outer foe at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace and failed to rally. FLAT REWARD got jostled
between horses soon after the start, then was outrun. HICKORY HIGH was away awkwardly, lied forwardly placed three wide, but was done early.
