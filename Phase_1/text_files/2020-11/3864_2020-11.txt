Footnotes
SUBSIDIARY stalked the pace inside, seized command at the rail near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive,.
BROADWAY PEGGY raced off the early pace outside, made some progress two wide around the turn and rallied outside to gain the place in deep stretch.
JO JO'S CANDY prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, was pushed three wide as CHARLIEANNA got out around the turn, took the lead near
the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and lost second late. THE OTHER CAT went evenly inside.
MYFIRSTEXWIFE saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MOTHERWELL saved ground to no avail. NINA'S
PATIENCE was outrun while racing two wide. CHARLIEANNA set the early pace along the rail while trying to get out, led in the two path around much of the
turn, checked getting out nearing the quarter pole and retreated through the lane. BEATING THE ODDS was always outrun outside and got out through the
lane to finish near the outside rail.

HANDSOME PRINCE bumped with ROAD TO PEACE at the start, tracked outside FLAMING HOT early, took over at the top of the stretch, swapped back
to his left lead a sixteenth out and remained clear. EL ZEUS saved ground hemmed in behind the leaders for a half-mile, shifted out three wide for clearance
approaching the stretch, and ran on willingly to be clearly second best. FLAMING HOT bumped with ROAD TO PEACE at the start, set the pace inside to
the end of the turn, and weakened. ROAD TO PEACE was bumped between horses at the start, raced two to three wide, and tired through the stretch on
his left lead. IGOTSUNSHINE was finished early three wide, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
DANESSA BABY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. PHANTOM VISION pressed the winner two wide and was clearly second best.
CLASSIC SECRET was soundly bumped at the start, raced well back early, made progress with a clear rail run around the turn, angled three wide turning
for home and lacked a rally. EXACT chased the pace two wide down the backstretch, steadied and swung out to avoid a fallen rider leaving the
three-eighths pole, angled back into about the two path midway around the turn and was along for a share of the show. ZIA'S SONG was in range early,
checked avoiding a fallen rider near the three-eighths pole, raced two wide around most of the turn and played no further factor. MA REVE was bumped
after the start, steadied entering the turn, raced three wide and never threatened. CHIPS AND SALSA bumped after start, steadied from between foes
entering the turn and angled four wide to avoid the fallen rider and had no further bids. TRINNI LICENSE was reluctant to load, lacked speed outside, went
six wide to avoid the incident entering the turn and was never in contention. BRIGHT AND SHINY was bumped at the start, raced five wide and was always
outrun. THIRD TIME AROUND lost the rider entering the turn, galloped around with the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE TURN AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

THREE DEEP steadied slightly on the first turn as RED FOG went by to his outside, tracked outside the latter up the backstretch, took over after six furlongs
in the two-path, edged away in upper stretch, then held RAGS FOR BRITCHES safe in the final yards. RAGS FOR BRITCHES saved ground unhurried
early, advanced after six furlongs three wide, finished determinedly and was gaining outside the winner. QUASAR MOON broke slowly and trailed early
inside, moved out four wide on the far turn beginning to take closer order, but could not sustain the rally with a mild final response. RED FOG was four wide
into the first turn, moved inward coming away with the lead before completing a quarter-mile, got collared by the winner approaching the stretch, and gave
way through the late stages on the fence. TONS OF GOLD raced three wide, put in a mild bid a quarter-mile out, and weakened through the drive. MR.
CESCO raced two wide, and was finished after six furlongs. SMELL OF ROSES steadied behind the leaders approaching the backstretch, was through
soon after going a half-mile, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
ISADORABLE AIDA settled off the early pace while racing two wide, made a bold four wide sweep around the far turn, reached even terms three deep in
upper stretch, dueled outside of ZODIAC PRINCESS through the stretch and prevailed. ZODIAC PRINCESS stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out
midway around the turn, bid between rivals nearing the lane, dueled inside of the winner throughout the stretch and was narrowly outfinished in a game try.
CALENTITA (IRE) saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied inside of the top two. NAPA RULES had her head turned at the
start then bumped with CHEROKEE SOUND at the start, saved ground well back, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside. MONEY
FACTOR raced well back two and three wide, swung seven wide turning for home and improved position. OBLIO'S WISH went evenly inside. VITAEMI
dueled along the rail for five furlongs, briefly cleared midway around the turn, vied inside of the top two from the quarter pole to midstretch then tired.
DRINKS ON ME chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. CHEROKEE SOUND hopped and was bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. INTEREST played no factor while racing three and four wide. QUEEN OF CAUSE dueled two wide and stopped nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FRANK FIRST stayed close early inside, lacked room losing some position around the turn, shifted out three wide for clearance past the quarter-pole, rallied
steadily and overhauled SMASH from outside in deep stretch. LOVE NEST tracked outside SMASH to the stretch, ran on through the lane one-paced and
got by the latter near the wire. LI'L MEATBALL was a step slow at the start, swung four wide nearing the stretch, and offered a mild response. SMASH was
away alertly despite breaking outward, cleared inside with the early lead, stayed on to deep stretch and gave way. DR HARLAN saved ground to no avail.
MEADE moved in from the four-path midway on the turn, and could not reach contention. TIP SHEET was never prominent. DARK AGES broke a step slow,
and faded three wide soon after going a half-mile.

closed outside and was up in deep stretch. POSITIVE PHIL settled off the early pace four wide, remained in range three wide around the far turn, angled
further out turning for home, closed outside, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and led until the final strides. BACANO saved ground off the pace, angled
out near the quarter pole and rallied between rivals to gain the show. RED SORRELL was unhurried inside early, angled out in upper stretch, weaved
between rivals through the lane and rallied inside of the top finishers. GEOGRAPHY was off the pace two and three wide and improved position in the lane
without seriously threatening. TEXTPECTATION was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, angled out leaving the eighth pole and passed some
tiring rivals. SAINT LARNED tracked the pace two wide and lacked room through most of the stretch. DUKE OF MONROE set the pace along the rail and
tired in the drive. CARIBBEAN KITTEN was bumped at the start, raced three wide in midpack early, made a three wide bid midway around the far turn but
came up empty in the lane. DILLON ROCKS pressed the pace two wide to midstretch and steadied while fading near the sixteenth pole. QUICK ENOUGH
