MAJOR ATTRACTION stalked two wide and between horses, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, dueled through the lane while
clinging to a narrow advantage, and prevailed. CAN IMAGINE set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of multiples foes in upper stretch, dueled gamely
through the lane, but was bested. SMART CALL advanced from midpack to a four wide stalking position into the turn, sustained his gain to bid for the lead
turning for home, but chased inner rivals and failed to reach even terms in the late stages. THE BIG BLUFF hopped at the start, tracked the pace three wide
and between horses around the turn, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted inwards in search of clear sailing, but failed to produce a bid while
chasing the leaders. JURISDICTION lied in range two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, then stayed on
through traffic to prevail over tiring foes for a minor share. VEILED VIXEN broke a step slowly, trailed the field around the turn, swung six wide turning for
home, and failed to produce a bid, but improved. GOOD CLEAN FUN was off slowly and greenly causing him to spot the leader many lengths, raced far off
of the pace four wide around the turn before tipping five wide at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to produce a rally. CHURCH OF MANY lied forwardly
placed three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. CRITIC saved ground from midpack, but was
done early. BLUEBIRD DAY stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
BEEP BEEP prompted the pace four wide early on, shifted two wide into the turn while staying in the three path, failed to kick clear of his inner counterpart
while in hand passing the quarter pole, dueled with that game foe through upper stretch, but put him away passing the furlong grounds, and drew off under
driving pressure. RACARINO dueled for the lead inside of PATRIARCH ARTIE early on, then inside of the BEEP BEEP around that turn, dug in gamely
while resisting the latter through upper stretch, but gave way to that foe at the furlong pole. PREGAME lied far back along the inside, shifted to the four path
into the turn, then rallied between horses through the lane, and prevailed over those foes for show. WELLMAN broke outwardly, settled off of the pace three
wide, drifted out in upper stretch, but stayed on inside of a pair of outer foes through the lane, but was outfinished by one of them for show. SPHEROID was
bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace five wide and between horses into the turn, exchanged multiple bumps with AUDACIOUS
ANTOINE from the three furlong pole to upper stretch, then stayed on outside of a pair of foes through the lane, but was outfinished by them for minor
rewards. NOW A JAGUAR took the turn two wide and between horses while off of the pace, and failed to menace. ROMAN PHAROAH lied close up to the
pace three wide and between horses, chased the leaders through the turn, but weakened while drifting out through midstretch. BUGLE OF WAR lied
forwardly placed along the inside early on, retreated to midpack into the turn, awaited room turning for home, but lacked a rally thereafter. CONVENTION
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE lunged inwards and bumped
SPHEROID at the start, raced far off of the pace six wide into the turn, received multiple bumps from his aforementioned foe from the three furlong pole to
the three sixteenths pole, but flattened out passing that marker. PATRIARCH ARTIE dueled for the lead two wide, took back to stalk at the half mile pole,
but weakened turning for home and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH REGARD trailed around the first turn as the short field spread out, rallied three wide while in the four path into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, dueled for the lead outside of ALTA'S AWARD through the lane, and prevailed over that foe passing the sixteenth pole under driving
pressure. ALTA'S AWARD lied far off of the pace around the first turn, tracked outer bidding foes' rallies while saving ground around the far turn, slipped
inside of the tiring early pace setter to produce a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled gamely inside of HIGH REGARD through the lane, but was
bested by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. NOMIZAR stalked the clear leader from the four path around the first turn, inched closer into the far turn when
HIGH REGARD forced his hand, bid for the lead in the three path and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with his outer
counterpart and an inner bidding rival in upper stretch, then chased them home. MISS IMPERFECTION saved ground from midpack around the first turn,
retreated to trail the field in the two path around the far turn, swung to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally. OH SO TERRIBLE cleared off while
staying in the three path around the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, but noticeably tired passing the three furlong pole, and was swallowed
between horses approaching the quarter pole.

advantage under a long drive approaching the furlong pole, then drew clear through the final furlong. BEAVER HAT tracked from midpack in three path, held
that path through the far turn between horses, chased from behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped four wide at the furlong pole, and rallied to reach
place. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART advanced in the five path around the first turn to midpack, inched closer before being driven to produce a bid for the lead
approaching the five sixteenths pole, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the furlong pole, and got outfinished for place.

at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on through the lane. KADESH stalked three wide, bid for the lead two wide into the far turn, dug in inside of multiple
foes at the quarter pole while hanging on his left lead, resisted through midstretch, but yielded late. MISTER CANDY RIDE saved ground far off of the pace
around the first turn, then took the far turn four wide before staying on between horses through the lane. LAKE NAKURU hopped a bit at the start, trailed
along the inside, swung seven wide turning for home, and improved positoin. EXCESSION took the far turn five wide and far off of the pace, then passed
tired foes. DISTORTED MOON prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn, and was jostled between foes at the three
furlong pole while faltering. MULBERRY STREET saved ground in midpack around the first turn, then failed to factor. MAKE NOISE was sent early on to set
the pace, got a bit keen into the first turn, but settled readily, then got headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened. EXTRAORDINARY lied forwardly

AMALFI PRINCESS prompted the pace three wide, dueled two wide around the turn, and drew off passing the furlong pole. GRACE'S SECRET rallied five
wide around the turn, then sustained her bid through the lane to reach place. ALTERED SHOT gained ground four wide and between horses around the far
turn, then sustained a chasing rally inside of GRACE'S SECRET through the lane, but was outfinished by that one for show. EUPHORIC dueled for the lead
two wide, then inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but gave way to that foe passing the furlong marker. LADY FROSTED was off a step slowly,
saved ground far off of the pace, and rallied mildly along the rail through the lane. JOY OF PAINTING took the turn three wide and between horses while off
of the pace, but was outmoved by foes turning for home, then stayed on thereafter. MS V TIME dueled for the lead along the inside early on, but gave way
into the turn. AMUSING ANTICS stalked along the inside early on, retreated two wide and between horses around the turn, but was blocked in upper stretch
and failed to recover. FOLD EM chased the pace three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. HRASKY was off slowly, trailed through the turn, and was
outrun. CLOSET SHOPPER was off slowly, rushed to midpack along the inside, but was done early.
