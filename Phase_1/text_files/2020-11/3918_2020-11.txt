Footnotes
HERETODAYGONMANANA stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and raced at a
close disadvantage, still in the three path, through the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and held off the
later arrival of BOUNDTOBEOK, who stalked the pace inside, started a bid past the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the
far turn then dug in through the stretch to take second later yards, and finished well. JAMESTOWN ROAD tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure past the quarter pole and contested a slim advantage through the far turn, but was caught just inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride
later yards. TEST ME I DARE U settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished
well. C V'S POWERPAK rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced
in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. MISS MORGANTOWN steadied slightly from between horses shortly after the break and
rounded the first turn in the four path, settled off the pace leaving the turn then picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, but faded approaching
the far turn. PARTLY DANDY settled off the early pace in the two and three paths and raced outside into the backstretch, though, showed little response.

Footnotes
FANCY CONCHO took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was steadily
encouraged to late stretch then taken in hand the closing yards. OUT OF CENTS stalked about the four path the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but dropped back into the stretch and settled for second. TRIPLE BAD settled off the pace inside, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. I AM THAT I AM loaded reluctantly and
broke a step slow, raced in the six path of the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still
about the six path and showed little further. MOTATAABEQ saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole but showed little
response. K TOWN BRASS drifted into the first turn and stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the rail
on the far turn. PARTY LIFE raced outside into the backstretch and was through early.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY DANCER rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole
and closed to the lead three wide approaching the top of the stretch, raced clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. DAH PHILLY steadied into the
first turn then settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, checked from tight quarters at the rail leaving the
five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the far turn and dug in from the top of the lane to take second the final yards. FRENCH NOUGET stalked the
earlier pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then angled to the five path on the far turn, finished well to take third later yards and
was gaining on the runner-up. CATHERINES WARRIOR tapered in to race with the pace two deep and took the edge into the backstretch, dueled from that
point at even terms and had the advantage most of the far turn but was caught approaching the head of the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. KATIE'S
BAYOU rated a slim early lead inside, was caught into the backstretch and dueled close from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail but dropped back
into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. ENDUROS TIGRESS settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving
the three eighths pole but faded in the three path of the far turn. BACKCAT charged the gate just as the raced started and came away rank, rounded the first
turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and was not a factor.

improved to take the lead three wide approaching the top of the stretch, drew clear at the eighth pole then drew away through the stretch. CORREJON
stalked the pace two deep and took the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear at the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail but
was caught toward the top of the stretch and settled for second while flattening stride the final sixteenth. OWL RUN saved early ground then bid nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and was along for third later yards. BINN GOODE rounded the first turn about the three path
while stalking, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. SOCIAL
MEDIA rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path
and showed little further. BLACK QUEEN raced well off the pace and could only improve her position. UNBRIDLED BOND rated a short lead inside, was
caught nearing the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point then rounded the far turn at the rail, while weakening. CHARITABLE HERO
