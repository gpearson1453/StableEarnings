Footnotes
NAOMI FRALEY led two wide on the backstretch, cleared pressing rival early on the turn and shook free entering the stretch, held on to win by a quickly
diminishing margin. THECHAMPISFLORING tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, responded gamely to urging gaining solid
ground and just missed. SUGARATSUNDOWN pressed inside of leader along the backstretch, had to steady briefly entering the turn and reengaged leader
late in the turn, rallied well ad just missed while being edged out for second. TWO BEARS chased leaders along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn
along the inside and lacked needed response in the lane to make an impact. KAJA settled well of the pace on the backside, entered turn in the two path and
lacked needed rally in the stretch. GARRULOUS GAL fractious and had to be reloaded, stalked leaders well off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn in
the four path and came up empty in the stretch.
