Footnotes
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS set the pace two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. KAYLA'S TUNE prompted the pace three wide,
could not gain on the winner in the lane but stayed on to save the place. MATCHA raced off the pace two and three wide around the turn, swung widest in
upper stretch and rallied outside. CLARIST broke out and bumped at the start, raced in range two wide, angled out in upper stretch and was outkicked
between rivals. FIERY PRINCESS had early speed inside of the winner, chased inside to deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards.
PLATINUMCENTS settled off the pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch, lacked a serious rally while racing between foes and steadied off heels
in very deep stretch. AWESOME ANNMARIE hesitated at the start and failed to menace inside. BEND THE KNEE was bumped at the start, was trying to
get out throughout, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. COMPETTI was hung out five wide around the turn and played no factor.

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER sped clear early, rated along well off the rail to the stretch, and widened under a drive. KHOSEA saved ground throughout, posed no
threat to the winner but bested the others. ROMANTICAL NOTE bumped with ABUELA CORI at the start, then bumped with THEUNCAPTUREDLADY right
after that, raced two wide and lacked a rally. PLAYERA pursued DEM A WONDER from outside for a half-mile, and tired. ABUELA CORI bumped with
ROMANTICAL NOTE at the start, was outrun early inside, drifted way out under left-hand pressure through mid stretch, and remained well back.
THEUNCAPTUREDLADY bumped with ROMANTICAL NOTE soon after the start, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
THE MIGHTY JUDGE raced in range two wide, bid three wide nearing the lane, seized command in upper stretch, battled outside of RULE YOURSELF
through the final furlong and prevailed. RULE YOURSELF settled off the early pace two wide, made progress inside down the backstretch, advanced two
wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside of the winner from there and just missed in a game try. CASH CALL
KITTEN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide then rallied through the lane to gain the show. MYSTICAL MOON was bumped at
the start, steadied along the first time through the stretch, raced well back inside, swung widest nearing the lane, continued on the left lead and rallied
widest. BASHA stumbled badly at the start, raced three and four wide in midpack, made progress in upper stretch but was outkicked late. DEVOTED
KITTEN saved ground around both turns, bid nearing the eighth pole but flattened out late. SOUPER COURAGE was shut off at the start, raced off the pace
three wide around the first turn, made some progress five deep rounding the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. SON OF OAHU stalked the pace
from the rail, was blocked in upper stretch and never had a fully clear path. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY pressed the pace two wide and retreated through
the lane. CAPPY HOUR set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. TAKEDOWN dropped back inside the first time through the stretch, saved ground
around the first turn, went well wide around the far turn and trailed.

Footnotes
EMIT advanced toward the inside after three furlongs, tipped out after entering the stretch, wore down the leaders from outside a sixteenth out and was
going away at the finish. MONEY SONG vied early inside BLAME CHARLIE, deferred and went around to rebid outside that rival on the turn, battled for
command past the eighth-pole between horses, but was outkicked. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA bumped with LITTLE DUDE at the start, took closer order late on
the turn while moving in a bit from the three-path, could not seriously menace and was up for third nearing the wire. BLAME CHARLIE shook off MONEY
SONG before going a quarter-mile, stayed in the two-path facing another challenge from that foe on the turn, stayed on into the final furlong and weakened.
JR SPEED was a step slow at the start, and outrun three wide. LITTLE DUDE bumped with MIDNIGHT TEQUILA at the start, chased the leaders around
the turn while shifting out four wide, and was finished into the stretch. AWESOME BEACH became fractious in the gate prior to the start, wheeled to his left
unseating the rider at the break, and was escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
JANUARY WON settled off the pace along the inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn, tipped out nearing the lane, reached even terms near
the eighth pole, vied outside to deep stretch and edged ahead late. TAAMER set the pace along the rail around the first turn, continued to lead while racing
in the two path rounding the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, fought on inside of the winner to deep stretch and yielded late.
PURECRAZIDUDE prompted the pace two wide, was no match for the top two in the lane and lasted for the show. FRIENDLY FELLA stalked the pace
three wide and came up empty in the lane. INDY'S JEWEL never threatened while racing two wide and ducked out under left-handed urging in midstretch.
BUDGET BUSTER trailed outside.

WELL DEFINED bumped with RICHARD THE GREAT at the start, sprinted to the front inside, shook off OUTSHINE on the turn after a sharp half-mile, and
widened under pressure. GRAN OMERO (VEN) saved ground throughout, cut the corner rallying into the stretch, could not threaten the winner on his left
lead but was clearly second best. APACHE raced three to four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed rally. FIVE OF HEARTS bumped with
RICHARD THE GREAT at the start, chased inside to the stretch, and faded. OUTSHINE pursued the winner from outside early, and weakened between
horses approaching the stretch. RICHARD THE GREAT was bumped lightly between horses at the start, and was finished early.

Footnotes
FOREVER MARTA dropped back to last under some urging down the backstretch, trailed inside around the turn, swung out in upper stretch, continued on
the left lead through the lane, surged late and was up on the wire. SUNSET EMPIRE set a clear pace along the rail, held clear to deep stretch and was
nailed. BY HIS GRACE stumbled at the start, raced in range inside of several foes chasing the pacesetter, made some progress in upper stretch but
finished evenly to maintain the show. WORTH AVENUE chased the pace two wide between rivals and was one-paced in the lane. SHES ALL WOMAN
gave chase four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. DIZZY raced three wide around most of the turn, came about seven wide into the lane and never
factored. UNCAPTURED RUBY was in range three wide between foes for a half and faded.

Footnotes
COLD WARRIOR was slowest away after bumping with REACTION TIME, had to be held up behind horses into the turn, rallied on the hedge through upper
stretch, and edged away late under a drive. GRAND UNION saved ground in range to the stretch, moved out approaching the eighth-pole and finished well.
TOOK A CAB vied outside REACTION TIME to the stretch and was outfinished. REACTION TIME bumped with COLD WARRIOR at the start, dueled for
command inside TOOK A CAB to the stretch, and was overhauled from both flanks into the final furlong. DEBBIE'S ROAD raced two wide around the turn,
and lacked a solid closing bid. WHO IS JARETT was outpaced around the turn three wide, and ran on evenly. REINOANIMAUX hit the right side of the gate
breaking outward, and posed no threat. CAGLIARI steadied along the inside entering the turn, and had no rally. SHORTLISTER was floated out by
REINOANIMAUX at the start, raced four to five wide, and was finished after three-eighths of a mile. SWINGIN ON A STAR was outrun three then two wide.
