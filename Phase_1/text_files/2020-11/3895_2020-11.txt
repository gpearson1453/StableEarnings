Footnotes
ABBAA stalked the pace, saved ground on the turn, bid inside the leader at the top of the stretch, drew clear then held under a strong hand ride. HE'S
MEANT TO BE pressed the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, failed to draw even with a bid at the top of the stretch but finished gamely
and was just up for place. KITCHEN FIRE led quickly and moved clear, set the pace, was joined at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and
gave chase but lost place in the final yards. IN A TWIST settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then closed belatedly. SENT
FROM HEAVEN, off a step slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. SMARTY RIVER PANTS raced in mid
pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. DISTINCT PASSION settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on
the turn but never reached contention. STATION ROCK, off a step slowly, settled off the pace, chased four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a closing
response. THOR'S THUNDER settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ROAD TO ROMANCE led quickly, set a reserved pace, widened on the turn then held sway while drifting out under a drive. FEDALIA raced in mid pack,
was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn then closed through the stretch. LADY WAR MACHINE, taken back early, was hustled three-wide on the
turn then rallied in vain. OSTRACIZE was taken off the pace, chased from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. BIG GINGER stalked early,
dropped to mid pack at the turn, was hustled on the turn but failed to menace. ARRIVISTE settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on
the turn but never reached contention. BELIEVING stalked the pace, raced two-wide on the turn but flattened out in the stretch.

turn but evened out in deep stretch. PRINCE MARTHEUS raced in mid pack, was hustled on the turn, chased into the stretch but did not show a late gain.
ARTIESATTHEPARTY settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn, closed a gap but did not menace. G PRINCE OF SILVER broke alertly then stalked the
pace, backed away late turn and lacked a closing response. JORDANS WAY settled in mid pack, was hustled on the turn but never reached contention.
GIVE ME AN EYE settled in mid pack, was hustled on the turn but lacked a closing response. LANDRY showed early speed, set a pressured pace, was
headed mid turn and faded. MAZINAW LEGEND settled in mid pack, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally. PROFESSOR TALLY raced from off the

Footnotes
PERFECT CRIME was off the pace before rallying up the inside on the turn, came out to pass a tiring foe at the quarter pole, had dead aim on the leader at
the sixteenth marker and got by that one in the shadow of the wire. LENNY K stalked the early leader from mid backstretch around the turn, bid for the front
turning for home and had a clear advantage by midstretch, only to be run down late. OCELOT won a scramble for the early lead, was stalked and collared
by the eventual place finisher by upper stretch, holding on for the show spot but no match for the top pair. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK was between rivals in
the early mix for the front before taking back to stalk outside, stayed in midpack through the turn and ran evenly down the stretch, no threat to the top three.
BEYOND BORDERS off the pace in the early going, rallied into mid pack and was outside the winner in mid turn but seemed to bear out, giving the rider
trouble down the lane while lugging in and on one line. SPITE STORE moved up to chase the two pacesetters along the inside late backstretch and around
the turn, was still involved in upper stretch but retreated in the final sixteenth. ARBEIT settled in near the rear and along the inside, never getting into
contention. LUMBERJACK was in the hunt for the early lead three wide between, began to drop back into the turn and continued to retreat. PAPERBACK
HERO chased wide for a sixteenth, falling back before the turn and trailing.
