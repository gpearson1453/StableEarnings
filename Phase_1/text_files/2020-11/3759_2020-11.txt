Footnotes
QUETTA'S IN CHARGE gained on the turn drawing even outside the leader in upper stretch putting foe away to win going away. LONESOME PHIL pressed
the pace dueling along the inside to upper stretch being overpowered in the late going. GATTO MARRONE pressed the pace through the turn weakening in
upper stretch finishing evenly in the three path'. RACING RAVEN slow early played no factor out finishing the rest. I DUB THEE raced evenly off the pace
tiring in upper stretch. GOVERNOR MACHEN was never involved. AUSTIN RAY had brief speed before giving way on the turn. LIL DEUCE COOP folded
up on the turn.

RUBY'S RUSH away alertly set the pace through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening under a drive. WAR CAT chased the pace pressing in bid
on the turn, rebuffed in upper stretch finished well enough to secure place in the six path. ROSES FOR DOUG slow early lost ground to upper stretch
finishing evenly seven wide. SHAKIN SPLASH always a step slow picked up some tired ones. RUSHING TIME chased through the turn wearing out in
upper stretch. CHRISTINE was never involved. MEGAWATT pressured the pace through the turn wilting into upper stretch. CAN'T KATS A MOOSE
sluggish under heavy early prompting would struggle throughout.
