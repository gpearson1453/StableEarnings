Footnotes
EL BOHEMIO set the pace while near the two path into the far turn, was under pressure in late turn, shook clear after straightening, had his largest lead with
a furlong to go then was all out to the end to last. TWISTED MIRACLE was in mid-pack while never far back, raced in the four path through the far turn,
came into the lane four wide with momentum and rallied through mid-track to be closing in late and settled for second best. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY moved
to contention into the turn while in the two path, was asked in late turn while moving between rivals, continued in the two path after entering the lane, shifted
into the five path inside the eighth pole and re-gained the show spot. CONRAD IN CHARGE stalked the winner from the three path through the far turn,
came into the lane from the three path and weakened. DEVIL'S CROSS was close up early while along the inside and eager, was shuffled back
approaching the far turn, continued inside through the turn and never was a serious threat. FLATOUTJUSTICE was in the three or four path through the far
turn when being asked for more, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a bid. CORBIN was steadied soon after the start when losing his path,
raced in the two path while in the back and lacked an impact. SPOTLIGHT JUSTICE was bothered while jostled between rivals, raced in the two path into
the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
PORKETTA set the pace on a clear lead while near the inside, continued on a clear lead into the lane, opened up her largest advantage with an eighth to go
then was kept to the task to the wire. LIEUTENANT KITTY was off slowly and spotted the field some five lengths, raced in the two path through the first turn
and into the backstretch, began gaining momentum near the five-eighths pole, was under left-handed encouragement entering the far turn, continued with
energy through the turn while in the three or four path, swung into the lane from the four path and was steadily gaining to the end. MISS FORT chased the
pace from the three path through the far turn and into the lane, had aim on the leader after straightening in the lane then needed more while losing the place
spot late. LIGHTUPJUSTICE stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn, continued near the inside into the lane and was empty. CLEVER KATE
was outrun while in the two path through the far turn. LILMISS SASSYPANTS steadily faded and was eased through the final stages and walked off.
BICKERMENTS chased inside and was suddenly done near the three-eights pole and eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
COVENANT LADY was unhurried while off the inside, moved up through the far turn to pressure the pacesetter, was on near even terms with that one
coming into the lane, cleared before the eighth pole then was kept busy to maintain the diminishing lead late. MIZZEN ASH was unhurried while off the
inside down the backstretch, moved closer to the inside entering the far turn, gained momentum soon after, shifted into the three path when passing rivals,
shifted back to the rail approaching the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the lane with increased momentum, shifted off the rail when gaining on the fading
pacesetter, brushed with a rival just inside the eighth pole and finished willingly. REVS RUN was unhurried early while off the inside, moved up into the far
turn while in the four path, continued in the four path into the lane, had aim on the winner while straightening, brushed with the runner-up near the eighth
pole and could not gain further while well clear of the others. THE LAST FLING made the first run on the tiring pacesetter into the turn, gained the lead
before mid-turn, was under pressure into the lane then could not keep up. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE was never a threat while saving ground through the turns.
SWIFT TEMPLE was never a factor while in the four path through the turns. STORMY WAGER chased the pace from the two path into the far turn and was
empty turning into the lane. IMA BARREL RACER never made an impact while along the inside. BLUESKIESATNIGHT bobbled at the start, raced in the
two path and was never in it. EYESEEYOU was fractious loading, ran off to a large lead into the first turn, continued in full stride down the backstretch, was
caught entering the far turn and was suddenly done and eventually eased through the lane and walked off.

KENTUCKY SKY was clear briefly before being joined on the outside by DEFENCE MODEL and dueled that one to the wire, prevailing while kept to task.
DEFENCE MODEL pressed the early pace in the three path, bid on the turn, dueled outside of the winner and was outfinished. BOAT WAMPUM was
