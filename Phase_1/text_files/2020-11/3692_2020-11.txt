Footnotes
MYERS TIGER pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, was shook up outside the eighth pole and was under strong hand urging to
the wire. WISHED unhurried while in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished with energy to just get up
for the place spot. CUTIE PIE chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane with aim on the winner, could not gain on
that one and lost the place spot at the wire. SANDY'S NEWSGIRL was under pressure while setting the pace into the lane then gave way once headed into
the lane. ROYAL CHEYANNE never a factor while near the inside through the turn. PROPER SHE IS chased the pace through the turn while near the
inside and was empty turning into the lane. TAP N TWINE trailed throughout while saving ground.

Footnotes
SECRETARY AT WAR unhurried early while off the inside, moved up through the two path into the lane, bid three wide outside the eighth pole then edged
past and cleared. GOOD ONE pressed then vied with another through the turn, continued under pressure from another into the lane, was joined by the
winner near the eighth pole, could not keep up with that one but kept on well for the place spot. CORRUZE vied for the lead two wide through the turn,
continued on near even terms into the lane then weakened near the sixteenth pole. EXPROMPT (FR) was in the three path through the turn when asking for
more, came into the lane from the six or seven path and moved up. CALLE KINGPIN saved ground through the turn, cut the corner and benefited when
others swung wide, was still a contender once straightened then weakened. TOUGH STUFF vied for the lead three wide and between rivals into the turn
then slowly faded. SCOBY vied for the lead four wide into the turn, chased the pace through the turn then faded.

Footnotes
EL BOHEMIO set the pace from the outset, cleared before the first call, continued on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more
when straightened then extended the advantage to the wire. KULMER was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, moved
four wide near the eighth pole, could not gain on the leader and was all out to gain and save the place spot. REED O'PRADO was in the three path into the
lane, moved three wide near the eighth pole, was jostled between rivals inside the eighth pole and settled for the show spot. RUH ROH RAGGY chased the
pace from the three path through the turn, bid two wide into the lane, raced between rivals down the lane then weakened and drifted to the rail late. GRAND
HIDEAWAY was never a factor while along the inside. HOPPED UP was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. G AS IN GEORGE tracked
the pace while along the inside into the lane, took aim on the leader when straightening, began tiring approaching the sixteenth pole and steadied soon after
while losing his path. RUSTPROOF was off awkwardly at the start, bumped by inside rival and spotted the field some four lengths and was never in it.

Footnotes
SUITE MADAM BLUE vied for the lead with another from the outset, continued on near even terms with an eighth to go then inched to the front late. A
MERRY PRANKSTER vied for the lead two wide through the turn, maintained a short advantage with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe
while just lasting for the place spot. MIZZEN ASH was in the two path through the turn while unhurried, gained momentum into the lane, split rivals nearing
the sixteenth pole, was guided from the two path to the five path while with energy and just missed while brushing with outside rival at the wire. MILLER'S
MAIDEN chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was closing in late. WAR FALCON was off
a step slow at the start, raced in the three path through the turn and offered a mild gain while not a threat. MISHPOCHA chased the dueling pacesetters into
the lane and lacked a response. LUCKY SHORE was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. ROCK OUT made little impact while saving
ground.

Footnotes
OUT COLD was in the three or four path through late turn, came into the lane three wide, dueled with two others while straightening in the lane then drove
clear. MARCO'S DREAM pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, took over the lead and cleared before the three-eighths pole, continued with the top
spot into the lane, dueled with the winner for a bit then could not keep up while staying on for the place spot. SLICK AS A PIN was in the three path through
the turns, began gaining momentum in late turn, came into the lane from the four path and offered a mild bid from mid-track. GIANT'S FORREST chased
the pace from the two or three path through the turn, bid two wide into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then flattened. COME ON
VENEZUELA set the pace while under pressure into the far turn then gave way before the three-eighths pole. STACK EM HIGH was outrun while along the
inside.

Footnotes
GOOSING chased the pace into the turn while three wide, moved to press the leader through late turn, gained the lead after straightening in the lane and
drove past. BENNY BOO BOO was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished with good energy to gain the
place spot. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE chased the pace while in the three path through the turn, had aim on the leader through the lane and lost the place spot
late. SHA KON O HEY broke out at the start and bumped rival, raced toward the back, came into the lane from the two or three path and finished with some
energy although belatedly. BENNY'S LEGACY was bumped and bothered at the start and dropped by to trail the field, advanced along the inside through
the turn and gained belatedly. JEFF THE RUNNER set the pace along the inside through the turn then gave way entering the lane.
DEUTERONOMYSTRONG saved ground into the lane and tired. PUNKSTER was in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. GO NUTS was
outrun while along the inside. STRONG STYLE raced in the four to five path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. SKY LIBERTY chased
the pace along the inside through mid-turn then faded. WHITE SILVER SANDS raced close up early, suddenly dropped back and was eased to the wire and
walked off. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand-timed.
