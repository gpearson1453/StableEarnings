Footnotes
PRETTY LIDDIE went up to engage GLOBAL QUEEN COCO from inside up the backstretch, shook clear around the turn, and widened under pressure.
SPIN CLASS raced in striking range three wide around the turn, could not seriously threaten the winner, and saved the place. TAP TAP BIRDIE saved
ground on the turn, and lacked a solid late bid. METAFORA swung four wide approaching the stretch, and improved outside without becoming a factor.
LUCI BREEZE was outrun early, moved off the inside around the turn, and passed tired horses. INDY FRONT saved ground on the turn, and made no
impact. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO grabbed the early lead, relinquished command to the eventual winner soon after going a quarter-mile, and faded through
the late stages. PATRONUS tired after a half-mile. SISTER IS DEVIL faded three wide on the turn. PEDESTAL retired early.

Footnotes
MUSTANG CAT set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive. DESERT GENERAL raced off the early pace outside,
angled in early on the turn, made good progress at the rail in upper stretch, angled out near the sixteenth pole, was clearly second best and was vanned off
after the finish. DR HARLAN stalked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. J S BACH pressed the winner two wide faded
after a half. HARD WEST chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. CHASE RUNNER had brief speed three wide. INSPIRATO
(MEX) was outrun inside.

pace along the rail, gave way leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under strong left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole and continued to fade. DARLA

Footnotes
HYDRAULIC set the pace inside, repelled a bid from SMELL OF ROSES after a half-mile, and was driving to stay clear. SAINT LARNED bumped with
EMBATTLED at the start, saved ground in range early, could not reach the winner through the furlong grounds, and saved the place. BUDGET BUSTER
raced in striking range three wide to the stretch, and ran on willingly outside. QUASAR MOON was outrun to the stretch, and was going well belatedly.
JANUARY WON raced four wide on the turn, and gained ground through the lane without threatening. TEXTPECTATION was never a factor. BACANO put
in a mild run along the rail turning for home, but flattened out. MASON'S SONG was outrun inside. SMELL OF ROSES pressed the early pace outside,
lodged a brief bid outside the winner midway on the turn, and gave way into the stretch. INDY'S JEWEL was outrun three to four wide. EMBATTLED
bumped with SAINT LARNED at the start, and was outrun. FANTASIZING showed brief speed outside, and was finished on the turn.

STRUTTIN broke out and bumped ACTING LUCKY at the start, recovered quickly to show speed inside, drew clear nearing the lane, opened up in upper
stretch and held sway under a drive. AUDREY tracked the pace three and four wide and finished willingly to narrow the gap late. MELLOW GOLD lacked
speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out turning for home, rallied between rivals and was just up for the show. ACTING LUCKY was bumped at the
start, stalked the pace two and three wide and weakened through the final sixteenth. GOTHAM QUEEN never threatened while racing three wide. ADIOS
DEE DEE saved ground in midpack, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TONALA played no factor while racing three wide. BABY ANA led early,
vied outside of the winner around most of the turn and tired. PERSONAL REWARD was outrun while racing four wide. V K STAR made little impact while
racing two wide. SAETA had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GIANT was never far back, bid between MARIES MELODY and VIRGINIA BEACH approaching the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch and
stayed in command under pressure. SECRET TIME (GER) was outrun for six furlongs, saved ground into the stretch, and finished well to go clear for the
place. CHARGE ACCOUNT saved ground to the far turn, had the two-path into the stretch, and finished evenly. LOGIC N REASON raced three to four wide
around the far turn, and gained mildly in the stretch outside. MO OF THE WEST broke slowly and trailed early inside, and improved position through the
stretch without threatening. VIRGINIA BEACH led early inside before deferring to MARIES MELODY, rebid three wide after six furlongs, but weakened
through the drive. TOURNESOL raced two to three wide, and was no factor. ROMAN D'ORO stayed in range three then four wide to the stretch, and tired.
CHEROKEE SOUND was outrun inside. MARIES MELODY took over outside VIRGINIA BEACH after a quarter-mile and sped off up the backstretch, got
collared after six furlongs, and faltered through the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
GEONOSIS stalked the pace from the rail, bulled his way through leaving the three-sixteenths pole, finally switched leads near the eighth pole, closed
determinedly and was up in the final strides. SNAP HOOK dueled inside of BRASSTOWN, kicked clear nearing the lane and led until the final strides.
BRASSTOWN dueled two wide to upper stretch, was pushed out by the winner leaving the three-sixteenths pole and kept plugging away to hold for the
show. TRAPPEZOID stalked the pace two and three wide and lacked a rally. ICONIC lacked early speed inside, went three wide around the far turn and had
a mild belated gain. CANDY CRUSHEM played no factor while racing two wide. TOSS made little impact while saving ground and was easing through the
lane.

MONFORTE pressed ALLEGEDLY PERFECT from outside for a half-mile, took over entering the far turn, drifted out through the stretch and remained
clear. JOLTING JOE was outrun for six furlongs, rallied inside and was up for the place. ISLAND COMMISH loomed three wide approaching the stretch, but
flattened out late. YAMATO saved ground outrun to the far turn, swung out approaching the stretch making up some ground, and finished evenly.
ANOTHER MIRACLE went along in the second flight to the far turn, moved out four wide at the top of the lane, and could not reach contention. AFRICAN
HERITAGE raced forwardly outside from the start, lodged a mild bid near the quarter-pole, but gave way leaving the furlong grounds. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM
was outrun two wide. KING'S HONOR (IRE) faded inside after six furlongs. GRACEFUL KITTEN tired after six furlongs. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the
early pace inside, could not go with MONFORTE into the far turn, and gave way. SWAGSATIONAL dropped far back approaching the stretch, and jogged
in.

Footnotes
HARTS N FLOWERS was bumped and in tight soon after the start, raced well back two wide, rallied between rivals in the lane, seized command nearing
the sixteenth pole, quickly drew clear then just lasted. TENERIFE MOON was bumped just after the start, trailed in the two path to upper stretch, swung ten
wide turning for home, closed with a rush and just missed. FLORADO chased the pace three and four wide and churned on through the lane to gain the
show while well outkicked by the top two. CLARIST tracked the pace from the rail, bid inside to take the lead in midstretch but flattened out late. TRINNI
SUNSHINE raced in range two wide, bid three wide nearing the eighth pole and weakened soon after. DREAMINOFDASIES was bumped at the start,
saved ground and never threatened. TOO STYLISH dueled inside a foe in the two path and tired in the final furlong. LADY CLOVERLY played no factor
while racing three wide. DRILLZILLA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and failed to menace. RAIN OF BLESSING was outrun while racing four
wide. FIERY PRINCESS dueled in the three path and stopped through the lane.
