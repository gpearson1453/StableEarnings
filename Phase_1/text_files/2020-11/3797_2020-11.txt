Footnotes
GOBOLDLY tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and bid three wide late in the turn, responded to urging in the lane and
surged past late. EVER FOR EVER EVER tracked pace inside of rival on the backstretch, stayed along the rail through the turn and into the stretch, rallied
well along the inside for second. RUN MANNY RUN dueled two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide still in a duel, entered stretch in near lead
and battled gamely in the lane, shifted in deep stretch to bump foe. BULLET TIMES stalked pace along the inside, entered turn and seem to struggle early
in the turn losing a few lengths, came back in the stretch rallied willingly. AWESOME PIRATE dueled with rival along the inside on the backstretch,
maintained rail advantage along the turn, held half length advantaged late in the turn and into the stretch, while tiring in deep stretch was bumped by outside
rival and had to take up causing him to be edged late for fourth. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THAT
RUN MANNY RUN COST AWESOME PIRATE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING BY LUGGING IN AND FOULING AWESOME PIRATE IN DEEP
STRETCH, THEREFORE RUN MANNY RUN WAS PLACED BEHIND AWESOME PIRATE
