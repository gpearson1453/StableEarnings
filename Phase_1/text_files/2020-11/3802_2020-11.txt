willingly through the stretch but was outfinished in the final jumps despite a good effort. PRODUCTION CREDIT vied from the two path with a trio to his

Footnotes
DADDY KNOWS brushed at the start, attained a prominent position, was on hold sparring for command from path two until the head of the stretch, took
charge when given given its cue, then held on well to fend off the sole stretch threat. CAVARADOSSI brushed at the start, departed the backstretch from the
path three, sat perched behind the front runners for a good portion of the run around the bend, was put to a drive heading home, narrowed in en route to
garnering the place. VENTUS grabbed a slight advantage, moved towards the inside, eventually getting set up along the right rim of the inside route, was
rated along showing the way, tailed by the winner to his outside, came under a ride as the nemesis cranked up the pressure late on the bend, got shaken off
for good a few strides into the stretch run, backed away steadily. SCORESWHENHEWANTS brushed from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate,
travelled four wide on the turn, the widest of all, fanned out into path five after entering the stretch, maintaining his status of the being the widest of all
throughout, mustered up a mild response, sufficient enough to earn the final significant slice of the purse. CLASSY PAPA three wide onto the turn, was sent
out into the four path exiting it, had no offering. MINE THE COIN pursued the pace from path two, gave way. THE DR'S SLIPPERS rode the rail for the
opening half, got steered to the outside stepping into the stretch, ventured onward two to three wide afterwards to no avail.

RUNNINGWSCISSORS broke in line with LEAP TO GLORY, was rated along sparring for command with that opponent from the two path for a good portion
of the initial half, grabbed the advantage by a narrow margin as the second split was being finalized, struck the three-sixteenths marker and was given his
cue, responded and kicked well clear. POSSETIZZLY took up the chase from path two, got put to the whip crossing the midway point of the turn, fanned out
into the five path from upper to midstretch, rallied for the place. ON THE COUCH three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail,
proved no match. THREE JOKERS pursued the pace from path two, was hard-used on the turn, made no impact despite getting called upon more before
any of the others. LEAP TO GLORY hustled from the gate, cut over to the inside with the lead, fought to maintain it, matched up with the top one for a half,
yielded thrn retreated. BREEZE BURNER tracked the front runners from just off the rail, was swung out four wide entering the stretch, had no offering. OUR
DESTINY engaged for the lead during the opening phases, got eased back, rode the rail for the first half, tipped into path two stepping onto the head of the
stretch, backed away.

WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command near the eighth pole, inched away under a drive kept to task. WEYBURN dueled inside of KID CASH from the get go, got set down taking
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was displaced near the eighth pole in tandem with his main pace rival, ran on to secure the
place honors. KID CASH hustled from the gate, dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to his inside, got let out swinging three then two
wide into upper stretch, got collared in concert with his main pace foe near the eighth pole, kept on clear of the rest for the show honors. MOMZA bumped at
the start due to pressure outside from THE REDS and RISKY WOODS, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. UNBRIDLED HONOR coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and improved position. REBOPPER got bumped at the
start by MOMZA in a chain of bumps begun by THE REDS and RISKY WOODS who both broke inwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a
mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no headway. THE REDS broke in at the start then got bumped between foes as RISKY
WOODS came in from the outside, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. DAZZLE
TIME chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. DYNAMIC ONE shied from the kicking motion
of the assistant starter in the stall and struck the near side of the gate getting away last and conceding five to six lengths to the front, chased along the
inside detached at the tail of the field, tipped out four wide near the three-eighths placed to coaxing, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact. OHYOUDIDNTKNOW brushed the near side stall at the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before
darting to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing midway, spun two to three wide for home and tired. RISKY WOODS broke in at the start causing a
chain of bumping down through REBOPPER, chased five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GRADED ON A CURVE bumped lightly with JUNKANOO at the start, was unhurried in the two path during the initial stages, tipped into the three path for
the run around the second bend, narrowed in, angled towards path five for entrance into the stretch, kicked into his best and gained ground readily, began
the final furlong hitched up to the one to catch, inched its way forward until on dead even terms with approximately seventy yards to go, out-fought SCANNO
the rest of the way home to get the job done. SCANNO along the outside, was moved into the three path coming up to the far turn, overhauled a weakening
YES AND YES after three-quarters had been rattled off to appear to poke a head down in front by the quarter pole, went onward for another sixteenth
before finally being called upon for more, saw the winner bearing down from the outside by conclusion of the run leading up to and then through the furlong
grounds, relinquished reluctantly well inside the sixteenth pole, had enough left to save second. JUNKANOO shook off some contact with the winner in the
shadow of the starting gate, settled towards the back of the pack, got moved into path three by the top of turn two after being mostly in two path during the
journey leading up to it, quickened when let out a notch springing from the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out wider and wider for better racing room until in the
neighborhood of path seven by midlane, rallied with willingness to secure the show. BRAY alternated between the inside route and path two in pursuit of the
pace until the end of the second bend, was gradually worked to outside during the stretch run until four to five wide, closed in well for the last major check.
GAUGUIN (GER) kept watch on the front runners from the inside route, angled six wide into the lane, made a minimal amount of headway in the final
furlong. KLICKITAT loosely pocketed, lacked the necessary response. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY off the rail, stalked the pace three wide on the far turn,folded.
YES AND YES showed the way from the inside while appearing keen early, seemed to be vulnerable as six furlongs was being completed, was indeed
caught soon afterwards, backed away down the lane. GREAT CAMANOE prompted the pace two, stopped when no longer able to keep up, went nine wide
into the stretch under a protective hold and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
EAGLE ORB broke through the gate prior to the start commencing a small rebellion as a trio of rivals also broke through the gate, got away well at the
official start and chased three wide from mid pack albeit in striking range among a compact field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch, took over command near the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive to prevail. BLUE GATOR five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing under coaxing from the five-sixteenths to take command swinging two to three wide into
upper stretch, got displaced from the front near the three-sixteenths, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best.
MARKET ALERT broke out at the start bumping HALF RIGHT, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors getting up in the last jump to the
wire. HORN OF PLENTY broke through the gate prior to the start inspired by EAGLE ORB and was reloaded, chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch improving for the last major share, then weakened in the final furlong. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE
broke through the gate prior to the start in concert with a trio, vied three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, took
the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. STORM SHOOTER hustled from the gate, showed the way early on just off the inside before coming
under pressure from a trio, tucked inside half a mile from home, had LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE take the the rail directly in front near the three-eighths and
was steadied off the heels of that rival yielding three to four lengths in ground, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no headway. HALF RIGHT
broke through the gate prior to the start among a quartet to do so, got bumped at the break by MARKET ALERT who broke outwards, chased four wide
before advancing quickly near the half mile pole to vie for command, went three then two wide through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
MADELEINE MUST (FR) away in good order, slid into the pocket coming up to the half miler pole, was well held tracking the pacesetter, without benefit of
being covered up, saw the pilot take hold of the mount as the half was being completed, was taken hold of a second time a sixteenth down the road after
AUNT NADINE was steered over to the inside border of path two, responded when given her cue, inching up to the one to catch, slipped by in the final
seventy yards then dug in gamely to preserve the decision. AUNT NADINE retained the advantage after narrowly out-breaking the competition, went over
into path two soon afterwards, got rated carving out the pace, accompanied by KITTEN'S COVERGIRL one path farther to the outside, saw the winner
creeping up dangerously and got turned loose in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, dug in with determination only to see the top one whittle away at
the deficit nonetheless, got headed well inside the sixteenth pole, fought on with good courage, but couldn't re-claim the lead. ROYAL COLLECTION kept
watch on the front runners from along the inside route, tipped into the two path for the stretch run, gained ground in a steadfast manner, came up short.
STONE TORNADO (GB) darted into the two path after the field had been sent off and running, stalked the pace from midpack, got sent out four wide into
the stretch, mustered up a mild response. SECURE CONNECTION took up the chase from just off the rail for nearly a half, angled six wide into the stretch,
gained but all done without impact. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL pressed the pace two wide for a half and gave way. SO GRACIOUS two to three wide on the
turn, was maneuvered into path seven in the stretch, had no offering. SISTER SOPHIA off about a length the tardiest, travelled towards the inside for the
first half, got steered into path five during the early stages of the stretch drive, failed to fire.

Footnotes
THERAPIST tracked the pace two to three wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered
up a good finish outside through the final sixteenth and was up in the final jumps to prevail over a trio latched on at the wire. VALID POINT three then two
wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive steadily wearing down the
leader to take command inside the final sixteenth but was nailed at the end and forced to settle for the place honors in a good effort. DELAWARE (GB) grew
rank when wrangled off the heels of VALID POINT just inside seven furlongs remaining as that rival crossed over, tracked three then two wide, got set down
spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly but missed at the end. RINALDI established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside tucked inside at the three-eighths, got let out spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat through the final
furlong, got headed inside the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish while clear of the rest. CLEAR VISION bumped at the start by NINETY ONE
ASSAULT who broke in a step, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick. NINETY ONE ASSAULT broke in at the start bumping CLEAR VISION, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing four then three
wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HAWKISH tracked the pace along the inside
from the pocket, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BALLAGH ROCKS two to three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
JUST RIGHT off the inside throughout, took up the chase four wide on the turn, got roused one path farther off the inside entering the stretch, closed in
relentlessly, getting up in the shadow of the finish line. BRONX BOMBER sparred for the top three to four wide, grabbed a narrow lead as the second
fraction was being finalized, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and had the rider go to work, dug in, reluctantly releasing the advantage coming up to the
wire. SEVEN LILIES sat parked out five to six wide during the run around the bend, fanned out towards path seven from upper to midstretch, rallied for the
show. THE CARETAKER took up the chase two wide on the turn, got maneuvered all the way towards path eight for some running room in the lane,
managed to claw its way into the final on-the-board slot. BIG THICKET strung out four wide, angled six wide into the stretch, failed to make a sufficient
amount of headway. KOSCIUSZKO underwent a three wide trip, stepped into the lane and lacked the necessary response. SAN JUAN DIEGO four wide
both onto and off of the turn, made no impact. IT'S HOT OUT contended for the lead two wide while pulling on the left for the opening half, gave way. EYE
LUV LULU faltered off a ground-saving journey. HOT DIGGITTY pursued the pace three wide for most of the initial half, wandered out towards path nine
down the stretch to no avail. MANIFEST DESTINY three to four wide, gave out. THORNY TALE kept watch on the pace from the two path, was through
after going a half.
