Footnotes
BARB'S VALENTINE bumped at the start by outside rival, recovered quickly and pressed inside leader not allowing leader to clear on backstretch, entered
turn along the inside, came outside of leader to launch bid, drifted into the stretch and surged past leader in the five path. STREET FLYER led two wide on
the backstretch, cleared rival on the turn and shook free, had clear lead at the sixteenth pole, started to shorten strides and caught in deep stretch while just
holding second. COLOUR OF MONEY bumped by outside rival at the start, tracked leaders along the inside, stayed inside through majority of turn, tipped
out into the stretch and rallied well and just missed second. EARLY MORN broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace along the inside and stayed
inside throughout, responded to urging in the stretch and bested rest along the inside. IN IT FOR LIFE settled along the inside and lacked speed on
backstretch, entered turn along inside, swung out midway on the turn three wide and had to alter back in when stuck behind rival, kept on in the stretch
while under steady urging. CHANTE tracked leaders two wide in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn and had to avoid rival and bumped
CHROMES LIL SIS, after the bumping lacked any rally in the stretch. SHEZA COLONEL tracked leaders four wide on the backstretch, entered turn four
wide and rivals bumped each other resulting in on rival coming out and bumping the hind end of SHEZA COLONEl, after the incident lacked any response
thereafter. DIOSA turn head and off very slow, settled off the pace in the four path, entered turn three wide but had to alter out to five wide early on turn and
never a factor. CHROMES LIL SIS tracked leaders three wide in between rivals, at the turn inside rival came out and knocker her into outside rival and
causing her to steady sharply, lost all chance after the trouble.

SATURNCLOUD vied three wide on the backstretch, shook free of rivals midway through the turn and responded well to urging in the stretch while holding
safely . BELLIGERENT chased leaders two wide on the backstretch, in range of leader at top of the stretch but unable to match strides late and finished
second best. MAGICALCHIC vied inside of two rivals on the backstretch, shuffled on the turn losing two or three lengths, re-bid and eased out turn, and
rallied up for 3rd in the stretch. JUPITER S. stalked dueling leaders along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside and launched a non
menacing mild rally in the stretdch. GAMBLER'S APPEAL lacked speed on the backstretch and showed some late run in the stretch passing tired rivals.
NIGHT OF IDIOTS broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch and never launched a rally. MAZ KANATA bumped
at the start by inside rival, vied between for the lead in a contested pace and faded in the stretch.
