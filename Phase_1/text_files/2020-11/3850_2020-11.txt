Footnotes
STORMING LION stalked along the inside, rated from the pocket just behind the dueling leaders around the turn, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, split
the leaders approaching the furlong marker as FIVE DREAMS's drift created ample room, then prevailed over that foe under a long drive inside the final
sixteenth. FIVE DREAMS stalked three wide, bid for the lead and forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path in upper stretch,
clung to an advantage passing the furlong pole as STOMING LION produced a bid towards his inside, but was bested by that foe late. KOUFAX dueled for
the lead two wide, got headed by FIVE DREAMS passing the quarter pole, then chased that through the lane, got outkicked for place at the furlong pole,
and held show. MEAN MACHINE saved ground far off of the pace, and produced a rail rally in upper stretch, but leveled off. MOUNT ATHOS was pinched
back severely at the start, pulled while very rank and behind foes, tracked from off of the pace four wide around the turn, swung six wide passing the quarter
pole, bumped HARD ASSET in the process, then stayed on mildly through the lane. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM dueled for the lead along the inside, but
was headed by outer foes turning for home, then faltered through the final furlong. SO DIALED IN broke inwards and bumped an inner foe at the start,
tracked from midpack four wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the quarter pole, and faded. HUSH OF A STORM took the turn in the three path
while far off of the pace, swung to the seven path turning for home, and failed to menace. FUNNY ACTOR bumped an outer foe at the start, bumped SO
DIALED IN early on to track from midpack two wide, then weakened through the lane. DEVOTED TO YOU settled far off of the pace in the two path, and
never got involved. HARD ASSET raced off of the pace while caught five wide around the turn, then was bumped to the seven path by an inner foe passing
the quarter pole, and weakened thereafter. PRETTY CREATIVE was off slowly, and trailed the field throughout along the inside.

Footnotes
SEQUIN cleared early on, widened her margin turning for home, was roused to hold that margin in upper stretch, came under a drive at the furlong pole
while tiring a bit, but held sway through the late stages. PALOMITA bumped the gate and was off slowly, got rank while trailing at the half mile pole, shifted
outside of rivals into the turn and rallied four wide around the bend, reached place at the three sixteenths pole with multiple lengths to find on the clear
leader, narrowed the gap via a sustained grinding rally, but drifted out a bit through the final sixteenth, and failed to reach the leader while the rider lost his
whip approaching the wire. AMERICAN LEGEND tracked from midpack three wide, but was outmoved by PALOMITA turning for home, got put to a bit of
tight quarters in upper stretch as that foe shifted inwards, altered out approaching the furlong pole, then stayed on late. TAP N SWAY stalked the clear
leader from the two path, but was headed for place by an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, and chased the leaders home while not producing a bid.
HEADFIRST tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. CABO DORADO saved ground in midpack, then weakened.

Footnotes
HEMBREE rallied three wide around the turn, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, then produced a bid while drifting out approaching the furlong
pole, forged a very narrow margin at the sixteenth pole, then edged away after the rider switched to right handed pressure approaching the wire. GUN IT
vied three wide, drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, managed a clear margin on his left lead through upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong pole as
HEMBREE produced a bid, resisted that foe grimly through the late stages, but drifted out while getting bested approaching the wire. SAVVY advanced
along the inside down the backstretch, tracked two wide around the turn, tipped three wide at the quarter pole while getting outkicked by HEMBREE, then
chased the leaders home. SIR ALFRED JAMES raced far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, swung four wide turning for home, and improved
past tired foes. KAZIRANGA dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened. DREAMS OF VALOR stalked the trio of duelers early on, but faltered between horses into the turn, took the turn in the three to four path,
and failed to get involved again. MADISON'S LUNA bobbled at the start, vied inside of a pair of foes early on, but weakened approaching the three furlong
pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
PEDDLERS PRIDE veered outwards at the start and spotted the leader many lengths early on, rallied five wide and outside of foes around the turn, then
sustained that advance through the lane to get up approaching the wire. DEANOS CAPE bumped an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide
around the turn, shifted four wide passing the quarter pole, then rallied inside of PEDDLERS PRIDE through the late stages to bid at the sixteenth pole, but
got outfinished by that foe approaching the wire. BOLD COWBOY set the pace along the inside, held an advantage through upper stretch, but was brushed
by an outer foe while holding his path at the furlong marker, then got surpassed by a pair of outer rallying foes passing the sixteenth pole. MONTE NE
stalked along the inside, shifted two wide to attempt to split the leaders in upper stretch, but was bumped by his outer counterpart approaching the furlong
pole causing him to be pinched passing that marker, then stayed on. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT rushed to prompt the pace two wide, drifted inwards at the
furlong pole as MONTE NE attempted to split, bumped and pinched that foe passing that marker, and subsequently weakened. MONKEY ZONE tracked
from off of the pace three wide around the turn, but failed to factor. SCHOCHOH advanced to stalk three wide around the turn, but chased inner foes
through upper stretch before weakening late. SECRET MOVE bumped with an inner foe at the start, then tracked from midpack two wide before saving
ground around the turn, but failed to factor. STAR FOR BETSY saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. SAM MIGUEL bobbled at the start, raced
far off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. INGENICO tracked from midpack along the inside, but faded around the turn and was done early.
