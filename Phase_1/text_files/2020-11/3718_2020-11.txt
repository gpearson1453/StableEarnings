Footnotes
HIGHLY MOTIVATED broke inwards, tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced to stalking position into the turn, tipped three wide at the quarter
pole to be outside of the dueling leaders in upper stretch, then produced a bid at the furlong pole, and drew off readily. QUICK TEMPO set the pace in the
two path early on, cleared down to the rail into the turn, dug in to hold an advantage from RODERICK in upper stretch, but was quickly surpassed by
HIGHLY MOTIVATED passing the furlong pole, then held his outer counterpart off for place. RODERICK pressed the pace setter from the inside down the
backstretch, tipped outside of that foe at the three furlong pole to produce a bid turning for home, but had little resistance for an outer foe passing the furlong
marker, then hung and failed to reach the inner pace setter for place. AWESOME GERRY tracked from midpack two to three wide, but never factored. SIR
WELLINGTON rated far off of the pace along the inside, advanced to forge fourth by saving ground turning for home, but tired before menacing, and got
surpassed for that position at the wire. SAFFA'S DAY lied forwardly placed three wide, stalked the leaders around the turn, but tired and faded turning for
home. UPSTRIKER raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and never got involved. ASSERTIVE STYLE was off a step slowly, and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
EVER DANGEROUS tracked the leaders three deep, came under a ride entering the stretch, quickened inside the furlong marker, caught FANCY LIQUOR
late and edged clear. FANCY LIQUOR went to the lead, set the pressured pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive but was unable to resist the
winner. BYE BYE MELVIN was allowed to settle, came six wide to make his bid, finished well and was up to earn the show. PIXELATE bobbled at the start,
settled off of the inside, rallied between rivals and improved position. RECONVENE was unhurried, wheeled out eight wide leaving the second turn, but
found his best stride too late. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM was unhurried, mounted a late rally seven wide between horses, but failed to seriously threated.
TAISHAN was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out off of the rail near the eighth pole and flattened. DON JUAN KITTEN contested the pace outside
FANCY LIQUOR to the final sixteenth and gave way. NO WORD pulled along the inside, leveled into stride, got through but lacked the needed late
response. ANGELUS WARRIOR contended between horses to the stretch and faltered. SPANISH KINGDOM failed to make headway. ENFORCEABLE
failed to respond. MO READY was allowed to five wide but lacked a response. FIGHTING SEABEE showed little.

Footnotes
AMY'S CHALLENGE rushed along the inside through the opening stages to reach the front by the nine sixteenths pole, built a clear advantage into the turn,
then widened that margin in upper stretch under driving pressure, and held sway through the final furlong. UNIQUE FACTOR trailed the field in the two path
into the turn, swung out turning for home to be five wide between horses at the quarter pole, then rallied to just get up for place at the wire. WILDWOOD'S
BEAUTY tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, inched closer turning for home to bid for place at the quarter pole, dug in to hold that
position through midstretch, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. UNHOLY ALLIANCE raced off of the pace two wide and between
horses, shifted four wide while still between foes turning for home, commenced a chasing rally through traffic, shifted a bit inwards at the sixteenth pole, but
failed to produce a place bid. INTO CHOCOLATE saved ground from midpack, produced a place bid along the rail in upper stretch, but tired passing the
furlong pole, and faded. BYE BYE J saved ground far off of the pace, came into the and three wide and between horses, but shied a bit from an outer rival
at the sixteenth pole, and failed to factor. ROYAL CHARLOTTE raced far off of the pace while caught in the five path around the turn, got floated six wide
passing the quarter pole, and failed to rally. HARMLESS stalked three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. HEADLAND prompted the pace two wide, but
weakened in upper stretch.

ROCKETRY came away a beat slow, settled toward the tail of the field,. split horses to commence his advance inside the half mile marker, made a swift
sweeping move through the final turn, reeled in his foes and was kicked away. MIRINAQUE (ARG) attended the pace along the inside, worked his way out
of cover entering the stretch, loomed large and kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. DACK JANIEL'S was away in good order, angled in to set
the pace, fought on through a prolonged drive, but weakened slightly and settled for the minor award. DANNY CALIFORNIA was close up four wide, moved
up to engage the leaders on the final turn, but flattened between rivals and faded. MURALIST was caught in tight and checked hard midway through the first
turn, settled saving ground, continued on willingly but failed to seriously threaten. PLUS QUE PARFAIT prompted the pace four wide, stayed on to the
stretch and tired. SIGNALMAN vied between horses to the final turn and faded. TENFOLD settled in hand, was bothered and checked early, was keen to
place, checked again into the second turn, and went evenly thereafter. YOU'RE TO BLAME checked hard from tight quarters, was forced wide, leveled into
stride at the tail of the field and finished with belated improvement. JOB SECURITY was hustled along between foes, but came up empty on the final bend
and faded. FARMINGTON ROAD saved ground to little avail. CUPID'S CLAWS was hustled along in mid pack, moved up to make a mild bid but failed to
sustain the drive. MILITIAMAN was bothered and checked early, settled into stride, but lacked a response thereafter. RY'S THE GUY bobbled at the start
and never recovered.

FIRE AT WILL shifted inwards passing the wire for the first time without clearing inner foes, caused multiple rivals to be stacked up and steadied in the
process, then stalked from the pocket around the turns, shifted outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong pole, and drew off
under driving pressure. BATTLEGROUND raced far off of the pace three wide around both turns, swung six wide turning for home, brushed SEALIWAY
passing the three sixteenths pole while holding his path, then produced a rally through the late stages to get up for place approaching the wire. OUTADORE
set the pace along the inside, gamely added to his margin in upper stretch, but was challenged and headed by FIRE AT WILL passing the furlong pole, then
gave way on his left lead, and got nailed for place on the wire. CADILLAC (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, inched forward
through traffic in upper stretch while chasing from behind the leaders, then sustained his grinding rally, but was outkicked by BATTLEGROUND for minor
rewards passing the sixteenth pole. SEALIWAY (FR) was bumped by outer foes crossing the wire for the first time, steadied due to the incident, then raced
far off of the pace two wide and between horses around both turns, shifted five wide turning for home while inside of BATTLEGROUND, brushed with that
foe and an inner foe when put to tight quarters passing the three sixteenths pole, then was outkicked by the prior at the furlong pole. GRETZKY THE
GREAT stalked two wide, got floated three wide as his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, then weakened between foes through the final furlong.

Footnotes
VEQUIST tracked the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the rail then took over command and kicked clear in the
final stages. DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE set the pace from the outset, was off the rail into the lane, remained clear in the stretch but yielded in the late stages
and lasted for place at the wire. GIRL DADDY stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, finished willingly in the
final stages and just missed place at the wire. SIMPLY RAVISHING bobbled at the start, came out a bit into the first turn, chased the pace down the
backstretch, was in the three path into the lane, altered out late in the stretch and finished willingly from between horses. PRINCESS NOOR stalked the
pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but steadied while tiring late in the stretch run. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL was well placed
early on, raced in the three path into the lane and lacked a late bid in the stretch drive. THOUGHTFULLY was bumped at the start, shied and forced out into
the first turn and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
AUNT PEARL (IRE) came away in good order, cut clear to dictate terms, remained unchallenged. MOTHER EARTH (IRE) steadied near the wire first time,
was reserved toward the rear of the field, commenced her advance four wide on the second turn, angled out a bit further into the stretch, quickened and was
just up to earn the place. MISS AMULET (IRE) settled saving ground under a snug hold, worked her way out of cover inside the three-sixteenths pole and
kicked on well. CAMPANELLE (IRE) was nearest the pace, stayed on well to the final furlong and gave way. PLUM ALI tucked in to save ground, got
through to make her bid, loomed a danger but failed to sustain the drive. SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR stalked the pace three wide, moved up four wide to make
her bid, but came up empty and retreated. EDITOR AT LARGE (IRE) was allowed to settle, took closer order through the second turn four wide, but wilted
after six furlongs. MADONE was fractious in the gate, settled in hand, made an eye catching move through the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive.
OODNADATTA (IRE) was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. NAZUNA (IRE) failed to make headway. INVINCIBLE GAL
(GB) broke slow and was never a factor. ALDA was rank to place, leveled into stride through the first turn, was within striking distance for six furlongs and
dropped out. ROYAL APPROVAL was forwardly placed through the second turn and caved. UNION GABLES was close up between horses for five furlongs
and stopped.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL QUALITY broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide around the first turn, tipped outside of foes into the
backstretch, advanced four wide around the far turn to take aim on the leaders in upper stretch, switched leads approaching the furlong pole, produced a
good kick, and edged past the leader in the late stages. HOT ROD CHARLIE tracked from midpack three wide, commenced a rally approaching the half
mile pole, sustained that gain around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of JACKIE'S WARRIOR turning for home, forged a narrow advantage from that
one passing the furlong pole, but got run down by ESSENTIAL QUALITY passing the sixteenth pole. KEEPMEINMIND received a solid bump from an inner
foe at the start, trailed the field around the first turn, rallied stoutly around the far turn while tipping to the four path, then sustained that rally to achieve show
in the final sixteenth while gaining on the leaders. JACKIE'S WARRIOR stalked along the inside around the first turn, tipped three wide into the backstretch
to be outside of rivals, inched forward down the backstretch to vie outside of DREAMER'S DISEASE around the far turn, forged an advantage from that foe
turning for home while HOT ROD CHARLIE ranged up along side, clung to a lead from that foe in upper stretch, but was headed by that foe passing the
furlong pole, and yielded. ROMBAUER raced far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three to five path, and stayed on to improve position.
DREAMER'S DISEASE broke sharply and set a pressured pace along the inside, but was headed by his pressing counterpart turning for home, and
weakened in upper stretch. KING FURY tracked from midpack along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring foe around the far turn, tipped two
wide in upper stretch, and chased without menacing. CLASSIER prompted the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, took back to stalk
into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, and faded thereafter. SITTIN ON GO raced far off of the pace in the two path
around the first turn, then was caught five to six wide and outside of foes around the far turn, and failed to factor. REINVESTMENT RISK saved ground off
of the pace around the first turn, then tracked two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid. CALIBRATE got caught
four wide around both turns while off of the pace, and never got involved. CAMP HOPE broke inwards, then saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.
LIKEABLE pressed the pace three to two wide into the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. NEXT chased the pace four wide around the first turn,
but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the backstretch, was done early, wilted around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.
