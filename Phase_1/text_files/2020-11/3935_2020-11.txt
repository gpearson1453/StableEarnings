Footnotes
BABIE MONSTER broke readily, tracked the pacesetter four wide through the backstretch, then three deep on the bend, continued with a steady bid to
challenge for command in the closing stages and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. DO WHAT IT TAKES bobbled at the start, quickly
recovered to track off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane and continued willingly to the end to edge a rival for the
place honors. SIDEPOCKET BET tracked just off the pacesetter along the rail racing through the backstretch, came through inside that foe when presented
an opening to gain a clear advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. EXCEED THE GOAL settled off the second flight along the
inside early, angled to the six path racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to gain some position. CILINGA (MEX), forwardly placed prompting a
rival's pace between foes racing to the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave way late. NIGHT WATCH settled outside foes in the opening
stages, raced four wide into the turn while under pressure to advance but lacked the needed closing bid. MOON OVER VICTORIA broke sharply, was urged
to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn and gave out abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
JOE MAN JOE, held up in in close quarters just after the start, was settled last to the backstretch, gradually gained some position after a half from between
rivals, shifted to the four path racing into upper stretch and found his best stride leaving the furlong marker to just collar RICOCHET nearing the wire under
left handed pressure while being brushed by that rival. The latter was prompted to a contending position four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off
the first flight, was urged to challenge three deep for command racing into the second bend, went clear into upper stretch, but just failed to contain the
winner while shifting out making some light contact with that rival nearing the wire. DISTORTED LIMITS, urged from the break prompting the pace along the
rail into the backstretch, disputed the issue inside foes into the far turn, then weakened in late stages. COMMANDEER was switched off the inside early
while being urged to a forward placing three deep between foes, was urged to challenge between foes racing into the far turn but came up empty in the
drive. INDY LYON was urged forcing the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch but gave way abruptly entering the far turn.
GRUNDER shifted outwards at the start brushing the eventual winner, angled to the inside on the first turn tracking off the second flight to the backstretch
and steadily faded. LOWCOUNTRY, caught four, then five wide racing to the backstretch while briefly moving to terms with the second flight after the
opening quarter, dropped back early. An incorrect finish time was displayed during the live running of the race, the correct time is included in the chart.

Footnotes
MARVELLA tracked off the first flight nearest the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out to the three path leaving the turn, lost some position while
angling to the five path when lacking an opening racing into upper stretch but continued with a solid late response to just gain even terms with U KNOW I B
LION at the wire under right handed pressure. The latter was carried out at the start to drop out last early, recovered to track the leaders outside foes in
second flight, was urged to advance four wide into upper stretch and struck the front between foes to finish on even terms for the win under firm left handed
pressure. NOWITNA RIVER tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight in the opening quarter, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the three
furlong marker, shifted to the inside racing into upper stretch, briefly awaited an opening when caught in tight quarters leaving midstretch but split foes just
off the inside to just miss nearing the wire. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL was urged to the lead three deep on the backstretch forcing the pace on a narrow
advantage, dueled for command into upper stretch while edging forward but yielded late when failing to maintain that momentum. MANCORA, off slowly,
was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled six wide entering the lane and was making steady progress late. ELEGANT ROSE, urged
inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, continued inside a rival to upper stretch and gave way late. HEATHER HILLS ducked
out at the start momentarily impeding a rival, tracked off the first flight in early stages, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing the turn but
soon emptied out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MARVELLA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST U KNOW I B LION FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
VICARAGE was rated three deep tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the second bend, was prompted to
advance four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, then moved to wrest command in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement.
INITFORTHELOVE, reluctant to load in the gate, broke readily to gain a forward placing along the inside while pulling a bit against rating, shifted out leaving
the far turn to bid between foes nearing midstretch, couldn't match the winner but edged a rival for the place honors. MY BOY BLUE, urged to the lead while
angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dispatched a rival to go clear into the lane but yielded to the top pair late. IN
HONOR OF ARTIE was rated off the second flight inside foes in the opening half, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and gained some position
in an even effort. SYMBOL AZTECA settled last to the backstretch, split foes after a half, then angled to the inside to steadily improve position in the closing
stages. DISCO'S BRIDGE, urged prompting the pace outside a rival for six furlongs, gave way into upper stretch. SWIFT KID tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress between rivals racing into the far turn but had no closing bid. FUEGO, urged
to gain a position outside a rival in second flight racing to the first turn, steadily faded after a half. SECRET MAGICIAN settled inside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SUPER SHOES settled outside foes in the last flight in the opening quarter and never proved a
serious threat.

Footnotes
WEST SIDE WARRIOR was urged foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn and grudgingly held HE'S ROYALTY through the
stretch under firm handling to prevail. The latter gained terms with the first flight attending the pace three deep under light rating racing into the turn, was
prompted to challenge while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch, loomed outside the winner nearing the furlong marker but was outkicked. DENY
tracked off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch, shifted out entering the turn to advance on the leaders three, then four wide racing
through the stretch and found some late stride to close the gap while edging a rival for a share on the wire. MOZANO tracked off the first flight outside a rival
racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the turn to advance inside foes entering upper stretch but was outkicked for a share. TINKER'S
PAL settled outside foes dropping off the second flight early, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch but continued with some mild interest to gain
position to the end. DIVINE CONTROL settled inside foes early and proved no threat. STOPIT, urged along between rivals prompting the pace into the turn,
gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
ATONE was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, switched off the inside
racing into upper stretch while being roused to challenge the leader, took over from that foe and went clear under firm encouragement. MARKSMAN angled
inwards while being rated just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside after a half, continued three deep into the second bend,
was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. FOOD AND WINE sped to the lead along the
inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the second bend, shook clear racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted
by the winner and lost the place honors late. BATTLE CREEK tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, continued between foes into
the lane, then angled five wide nearing the furlong marker to gain some position late. THAT'S BUCKBEAK urged to terms prompting a rival's pace soon
after the break to the far turn, gave way between foes into the stretch. SUN SQUALL tracked off the second flight along the inside, switched out racing into
upper stretch but offered no rally. DAHOG settled last along the inside early and never gained contention. UHTRED tracked the leaders outside a rival as
part of the second flight racing to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. ANDREZ CONQUIST settled outside foes in the last flight and
dropped out early.

Footnotes
SNIPER SIS was settled outside foes behind the second flight racing through the backstretch, commenced a steady, four wide advance racing through the
turn to challenge for command in upper stretch and went clear in a strong drive. TOASTNJAM, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening
stages, pressed the issue between foes past midstretch and held a rival for the place honors while failing to match the winner. SHARON'S LAW tracked just
off the second flight between foes in early stages, advanced three deep racing into the turn to bid for command between foes striking the front racing into
upper stretch but flattened out late. TEA PARTY tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch
and continued evenly late. CAPTUREMENOW, a bit slow to gather stride, advanced to contention outside foes racing into the turn, was fanned five wide
entering the stretch but had no final kick. DRILL'S VALENTINE, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, gave way racing
into upper stretch. EVERYWHEREILOOK, pinched back at the start, settled between foes and never gained contention. A FOOLISH FANCY dropped out
early. INHONOROFOWENJR was urged along the inside racing behind the second flight on the backstretch but retreated early. DEESSE, forwardly placed
three deep tracking just off the first flight in the opening quarter, gave way racing into the turn. SUGAR BRITCHES, caught in close quarters, then steadied
between foes on the backstretch, retreated early.

Footnotes
SKOLE broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gamely held the
challenge of VALIANT VIRTUE to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was prompted to gain a forward placing attending the pace
racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into upper stretch to gain even terms but was outkicked. KITTEN'S SPA tracked off the second flight between
foes under light reserve racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals three deep leaving the far turn, angled inside the leaders in the
closing stages and continued willingly inside those foes to close the gap to the end. MY BROTHERSLEDGE, caught in close quarters between foes racing
just behind the pacesetter, bobbled slightly when appearing to clip heels racing into the first turn, continued between foes in second flight to the far turn,
angled to the inside racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. JUAN PABLO, caught five wide racing into the first turn while dropping off the second
flight, continued five wide through the far turn to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. PERFECT BEAM, off last, was settled to the
backstretch and passed between tiring rivals in the closing stages while proving no real threat. SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked off the second flight along the
inside while held up momentarily in tight quarters racing into the first turn, but lacked a closing response. DUKE OF MONROE tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded. DERBY CITY tracked off
the first flight inside foes for a half and steadily faded nearing the lane. CHAOS KID, urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch,
emptied out early.

Footnotes
LUCY'S TOWN, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half, was prompted to make a sharp advance to
contention four wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed pressure. POSTINO'S IDOL,
reserved off the second flight inside, switched out nearing upper stretch to split rivals five wide entering the lane and gained the place honors late. CLASSY
OF COURSE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue into upper stretch but yielded late. WATCH HER STRUT tracked the leaders
three wide in second flight to the far turn, was urged to advance in that path nearing the lane and continued evenly into the stretch. ANIMAUXSELLE settled
last along the inside early, angled outside foes racing into the far turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch and made no impression. BELLA PIERINA
tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight and faded into the stretch. MOMENTS TO SAVER, off a step slowly, settled outside foes to the backstretch
and failed to menace thereafter. MORGAN'S Z VA, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way
into the lane. RIPROARING tracked the leaders between foes in second flight for a half but faded early. NOBLE INTENTIONS, urged to a forward placing
three wide racing to the far turn, emptied out nearing the lane.
