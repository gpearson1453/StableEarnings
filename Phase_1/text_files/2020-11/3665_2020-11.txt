Footnotes
GO MIKE chased HAIL SOUTHERN to the head of the stretch, caught that rival leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. THE KUKRI advanced
between rivals into the turn, came three or four wide into the lane, lugged in through the late stages and was along for the place. HAIL SOUTHERN set the
pace in the two-path, and weakened on his left lead past the eighth-pole. BRYTON'S D J settled in the middle of the pack early, passed tired horses and
posed no threat. IMPEACH HIM was no factor four wide. TOP BOMB saved ground to no avail. FORMAL TREASURE raced forwardly three wide for a
half-mile, and weakened. LORD DARNLEY was no factor two to three wide. WAR DOCTOR was outrun four wide. RAL COBRA CREEK broke behind the
field, and was outrun inside. SOLD AMERICAN was never prominent. CAN'T BE BROKEN steadied and was off slowly, and raced far back throughout.

Footnotes
ENSIGN PARKER stalked the pace two wide, reached near even terms outside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, vied past the eighth pole and drove clear.
DOCTOR K set a clear pace along the rail, resisted the winner in upper stretch but was no match for the final sixteenth. MACHO REAL chased the top two
from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally but stayed on to be well clear of the rest. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA was bumped at the start,
raced two wide and never threatened. ALMONASTER hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, reached contention in upper stretch but came up
empty. MISTER FERNANDO failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BLAME CHARLIE was bumped at the start, had some speed three wide but
was through early.

Footnotes
CAIRO CAMPAIGN tracked outside early, took over from SOUL REFLECTION after three-eighths of a mile, and widened through the stretch under
pressure. SOUL REFLECTION set the pace inside to near the quarter-pole, was no match for the winner past that point, and stayed clear for second.
BAHAMIAN BEAT pressed the early pace three wide, lacked a solid final response but was best of the remainder. PLEASE SIT DOWN was outrun to the
stretch four wide, and rallied on the far outside for a share. WILD ONE FOREVER saved ground and was no menace through an even effort. VENERATE
raced three to four wide around the turn, and never reached contention. FLAMING HOT faded inside through the lane. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN broke
slowly, angled to the rail early, and made no impact. SOUPER SHENANIGAN broke slowly and was no threat. LITTLE TEQUILA was never close.
GLENN'S CAPER showed nothing.

ITSMYLUCKYGIRL dueled four wide to upper stretch, drew clear in upper stretch and widened under moderate urging. MARKISTAN lacked early speed,
saved ground throughout and rallied inside to gain the place late. SOLID AS A ROCK set a heavily pressured pace between rivals down the backstretch,
dueled inside of two foes in the two path around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, angled out leaving the eighth pole and was
outfinished for the place. BABY ICE vied inside early, could not keep pace into the turn, chased inside around most of the turn, angled out nearing the
quarter pole was one-paced in the lane. NOTHINS FREE had early speed between rivals, dropped back two wide around the turn, angled out near the
quarter pole and lacked a rally. TAKECHARGE MIRELLA dueled three wide between rivals to upper stretch and tired. SALSA RITA was outrun while racing
three and four wide. The five-eighths fraction was hand-timed.

PINK FIZZ hustled out to the lead, widened on her own courage around the turn, and continued to draw away through the stretch in hand. VIVI'S DREAM'S
chased outside the pacesetter to the stretch, and edged PITUFINA for the place. PITUFINA broke a step slowly, moved inside approaching the stretch, and
was edged on the rail for the runner-up spot. DANCING IN FIRE was no factor three to four wide. BLAZED N CONFUSED lacked the needed response near
the two-path. GOLD COUNTRY bumped with MARIA'S MIRAGE at the start, and was outrun inside. MARIA'S MIRAGE bumped with GOLD COUNTRY and
was slow to begin, got taken off the inside early, and could not reach contention.

APACHE lacked early speed despite some early encouragement, made progress two wide around the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, seized
command nearing the eighth pole and powered clear under a drive. KHOZY MY BOY raced well back in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch and
finished well to be clearly second best. MUKULWITZ stalked the pace three wide, bid between rivals nearing the eighth pole but was no match in the final
furlong. FREE FLAY stalked the pace two wide, steadied in upper stretch, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole but weakened soon after. VALIANT
APPEAL failed to menace while racing three and four wide. NICHOLAS ROSE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and stopped in
the lane.

Footnotes
VITAEMI saved ground in striking range to the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing the stretch, caught ROSYJERSEY from outside a sixteenth out and
drew clear. ROSYJERSEY hustled away from the gate, led through most of the first quarter-mile before getting headed from outside by OBLIO'S WISH,
regained command up the backstretch, settled into the stretch with a clear lead, drifted out as VITAEMI closed in past the furlong marker, and settled for
second best. DRINKS ON ME raced two to three wide around the turns, and lacked the needed closing bid. ELUSIVE RYDER broke outward and was away
a couple lengths slow, put in a mild run along the rail turning for home, but could not sustain the rally. ETANA was no factor three wide. OBLIO'S WISH went
up four wide to briefly poke a head in front near the three-quarter pole, stayed on the chase to the far turn, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
SASSY BEAST was bumped at the start, had early speed inside, dropped back at the rail around the turn, angled three wide in upper stretch, re-rallied
outside, seized command leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. FIOR DI LATTE broke a bit slow slowly, made progress down the
backstretch, bid two wide around the turn, took the lead leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, edged ahead of the pace rival but
was swallowed up by the winner. MOANAS POWER set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. PRETZEL chased the pace two wide, took up
sharply entering the turn, steadied again near the five-sixteenths pole and stayed on to improve position in the lane. PRETTY LIDDIE was bumped at the
start, raced four wide and never threatened. TRASHTHETRAILER was off slowly, saved ground off the pace early, angled three wide near the three-eighths
pole, advanced outside through upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. INPENDING BREEZE was outrun inside. ANGEL EMBRACE chased
the pace two wide and had little left in the lane. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF PRETZEL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.
