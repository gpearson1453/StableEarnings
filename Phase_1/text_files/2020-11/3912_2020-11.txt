Footnotes
EYES ON ME moved clear before going a furlong, stayed out from the inside and was under mild urging while widening. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY was
unhurried, rallied the rail around the final turn, angled to the outside in early stretch and lacked a further response. BOLT BROTHERHOOD chased inside,
came out from the rail on the final turn then tired. CRAZY IDEA was no factor. STARRY SKY was outrun. HIZAAM chased two wide for about three-quarters
then stopped. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was finished early.

best. FUN AND GAMES angled out into the three path on the turn, angled out through the lane and missed while finishing far out into the track. TRIXIE'S
TIME chased, was sent to vie outside the winner in the three path on the turn, was carried out while dueling on near even terms through the final furlong and
faltered. An objection by Chiappe against the winner was not allowed. BRANDYWINES SECRET broke slowly, was hustled early, stayed out from the rail
around the turn then gained late inside the top three. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS settled, raced the three path around the turn and finished far out into the

GONE INZANE stalked in hand, moved to vie outside in the three path on the turn, dueled through the lane and prevailed. PRAY WITH FAITH wasn't far
back two wide between horses to the stretch then finished with good energy. TWEET KITTEN took command at once, stayed out from the rail around the
turn, dueled inside the winner into late stretch then faltered. BLUEGRASS POSSE advanced wide around the turn and lacked a strong late response.
MAGRITTE was slow early, raced the three path around the turn and gained late. PAPADOPALOUS raced two wide between horses into the stretch and
lacked a strong closing. EXPEDITER wasn't far back along the rail into the turn then faded. ULTIMATEENTICEMENT was outrun. CHUNNEL trailed. THAT
L D K IS MINE pulled up suddenly in early stretch and was vanned off.

ITSGOTTABEMYWAY settled, began a rally along the rail into the far turn, swung out three wide entering the stretch then drew out through the final furlong
under mild urging. HOLY MOSEY bore out while showing speed into the first turn, vied along the rail on the final turn but couldn't stay with the winner in the
lane. PENNY IN LOVE pressed outside the early leader, moved to a short lead in the three path midway on the final turn then gave way from between the
top two in the lane. KABUKI was slow early, made a wide run around the final turn then flattened out. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was outrun. MAXIMUM
ENTROPY wasn't far back between rivals for over a half then tired. THERE GOES MY GIRL was outrun. SHACKLE ME GOOD moved three wide to a clear
lead midway on the final turn, remained out from the inside while making the pace into the far turn then stopped.

GRAB THE GOLD stayed out from the rail once clear on the backstretch and was under intermittent urging. OCTORARO ORPHIE advanced five wide
around the turn and couldn't gain through the lane. INHONOROFTHEMOON was caught in tight behind horses nearing the end of the backstretch, fell back,
swung wide into the stretch and gained outside. A MAIZE ZING RIP chased three wide outside the winner to the stretch then weakened. SOUTHERN
BRIDGE was close up along the rail into the turn, fell back then regained some ground. DIGGERS DIAMOND was no factor. LORD WINSALOT raced four
wide around the turn and tired.
