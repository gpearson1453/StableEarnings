Footnotes
TOM T hoped at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set the pace along the inside, was headed briefly near the furlong marker and fought back gamely
through the final stages to proved best under left then right handed urging. BRILLIANTBENNY chased the winner into the far turn, drew on even terms for
the lead two wide, dueled through the stretch but couldn't handle the winner. BIG PERFORMER stalked the pace in an even effort. DIAL MR
PROSPECTOR failed to menace. BELTON AVE well placed, lacked the needed response. GIVE ME A CHANCE hopped at the start and was no factor. I'M
THE NAVIGATOR was no threat. DOC GARDNER trailed.

Footnotes
GLENNWOOD prompted the early pace two wide, dueled for the lead down the backstretch, shook clear on the second turn, drifted out brushing the runner
up in deep stretch and proved best in a game effort. FRANCO settled within striking distance inside, altered course to the six path in upper stretch, drew to
the winners' outside, was brushed late and finished second best. HE'S NO BULL battled for the lead along the inside into the far turn then faded in the
stretch. SEA THIEF stalked the pace in the five path through the far turn, was forced wider by the runner up in upper stretch then lost ground. BARITONE
was through after a half. HAZ A NOTION had brief speed. EIGHTTHEHARDWAY trailed.

Footnotes
KNOCKOUT RANGER well placed, closed with the burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack through the stretch and got up in the final strides three
wide. PIOCHE GOLD set a pressured pace along the inside, dueled through the final three furlong and gamely held on for second. WHAT'S ON TAP
prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead with the runner up, matched strides the balance of the trip and just missed in a
determined effort. LOVE TREE stalked the pace for a half, loomed boldly three wide, battled through the far turn then came up empty. GREAT PLAN failed
to menace. DIMATE trailed from the start, rushed to contention four wide before a half, battled into the stretch then was used up. FLIGHT MISSION was
through after a half. ANGEL'S KNIGHT was outrun. SOLAR MAXIMUS was no threat.

EDGE OF NIGHT chased the runner up for six furlongs, rallied two wide to draw on even terms for the lead at the top of the stretch, battled the balance of
the trip and proved best under right handed urging. MOBIL LADY away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, dug in when joined by the
winner but finished clearly second best. GRIZABELLA stalked the pace and went evenly in the four path through the stretch. BIRDACIOUS failed to
menace. TING TANG was no threat. LEONA'S REWARD was through after a half.

Footnotes
OLE WATASHI stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch and drew off through the final stages under right handed
urging. YOU BET YOUR LIFE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, shifted four wide and finished clear for second. GOOD ENERGY never far back,
finished with good courage in the seven path. BODYGUARD made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. NORESTFORTHEWICKED never far back, offered a mild bid along the rail in upper stretch then failed to sustain that bid. MA
MOO POWER chased the pace in to the stretch then weakened. TORNADO KID was outrun. TROMBONE EASTON was no factor. LAST CRUSADER
failed to menace.
