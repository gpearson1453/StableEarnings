Footnotes
END ZONE chased the early pace from the outside, remained forward up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded to duel
through the drive and inched clear late. MOGOWAN broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued
to show the way through the second turn, dueled through the drive but could not keep pace. CHARMING BULLET squeezed at the start, was outrun early,
advanced outside through the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and closed with a rush for the show. ANSWER IN THE WIND bobbled at
the start, chased the early pace outside, remained forward but came up empty in the drive. MAJESTIC SOCIETY could only improve position. EGOMANIAC
forced the early pace and tired. SON OF PATRIOT was no factor. RACIN ROCKS was no threat. LUKE THE DRIFTER was finished early. This race was
hand timed and split times unavailable.

between foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch but could not keep pace. PERFECT PEACH forced the early pace outside but had
nothing left. BEYOND D'ORO pressed the early pace outside and tired. ARTIE'S DIAMOND was off a step close and no factor. SWEET PINOT broke slow

Footnotes
HERO OF GOLD stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, altered outside for the drive, responded when asked and was
along in time. CALAJA forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward entering the drive but could not keep pace. SHESTHECATSMEOW broke
sharp from between foes, dueled up the backstretch, remained forward but could not match strides. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS forced the early pace from the
inside, remained forward but had nothing for the drive. SEASIDE SURPRISE could only improve position. POSSE GONE WILD could only pass tired ones.
VIVA CAT was no factor. TWO WITH A TEN was no threat. MISS DAWN chased the early pace and faded. GEORGIA DAWN vied inside and faded.

place. BLUEGRASS PHAROAH dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained forward but was outfinished for the
place. MR. PAYCHECK six wide into the first turn, chased the pace outside, advanced through the second turn, responded but was too late. SHOULDA
HAD IT could only improve position. OUT MAKING TREBLE could only pass tired ones. CATCH THIS STAR forced the early pace and faded. HOOKED A

Footnotes
MUCH CLASS well placed from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, inched forward entering the second turn, altered outside for the drive,
responded and was just up the final stride. GUITARZAN broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch,
continued to show the way through the second turn, remained clear at the eighth pole but could not last. JACK BE QUICK unhurried early from the outside,
steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive and rallied but too late. GREELEY'S DEALER crowded at the start, was outrun early,
advanced outside entering the drive and rallied but too late. ALWAYS A CATCH chased the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. INVASORS
WIND was no factor. MR. GRACEFUL was no threat. PINE GROVE ROAD broke in at the start, bumped with a rival, chased the early pace and faded.
POWER SONG forced the early pace outside and gave way.
