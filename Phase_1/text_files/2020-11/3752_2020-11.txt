Footnotes
PROMNESIA hustled for speed and cleared quickly along the inside, maintained advantage into the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in the stretch and
never challenged. NIGHT OF IDIOTS tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and lost ground through the turn, re-rallied
under hand urging to get up for second comfortably. BABY BEAUTY tracked pacesetter along the inside, and stayed along the rail through the turn and into
the stretch, kept to task in the lane and gave way late losing second in final fifty yards. CUTE TALKER settled well off the rail in the rear of the field, entered
turn in the three path, entered stretch in the four path and kept on well and sustained a mild rally in the stretch. SLIGHTLY tracked leader in between rivals
on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and never launched a bid in the stretch.

MOUNTAIN VIEW broke well and quickly took command and opened up on his rivals, entered stretch well clear and held safely while lead diminished late.
MALIBU MAGIC stalked lone leader in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch, kept to task and clear second best
while gaining on the winner. OVERKOTER stalked leader along the inside of two rivals on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and battled gamely for
second and gave way late while being well clear of nearest pursuer. AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE angled to the rail to settle off the pace along the inside,
entered turn along the rail and into the stretch in the three path and passed tired rival. BALLYCASTLE stalked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered
turn three wide and lacked any response in the lane.
