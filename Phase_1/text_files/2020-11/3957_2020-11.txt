stretch, altered course to the inside when caught behind TAKE ME HOME near the eighth pole and rallied mildly. TAKE ME HOME set a pressured pace,
saved ground on the turn, drifted out turning for home, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. TAPETE CLAIRE raced along the inner
rail on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. HETTY G. chased the pace while three deep on the turn and gave way in mid stretch. MARY ALICE

Footnotes
TWO DOORS DOWN , patiently rated, edged up in about the two path mid turn to take aim on a trio of rivals, shifted out and came five wide into the lane,
closed steadily under left handed rousing and collared LIFESPAN inside the furlong grounds, gained a short advantage near the sixteenth pole, dueled
outside, exchanged a bump in deep stretch and held sway. LIFESPAN , taken in hand while well within range, moved menacingly four wide and bid outside
the dueling leaders heading towards the stretch, was roused clear near the three sixteenths, drifted in near mid stretch, drifted out under left handed rousing
bumping the winner in deep stretch and just missed. YES MEANS NO , sluggish early, circled five wide into the lane, straightened and offered a mild
response to be clear of the rest. BOSS LIFE had speed then rated off the winner nearing the five eighths, eased out and bid two wide mid turn, sparred
between runners into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. MAXIMO STRONG had speed outside rivals, dropped in when clearing near the five and a
half furlong marker, was joined mid turn, battled into the lane then gave way past mid stretch. POWER BOSS , towards the inside and off the early pace,
gained some while under a hustling ride past the three eighths, raced three wide in upper stretch, angled out near the three sixteenths but came up empty.
FAVOR MAKER , off slowly, was used four wide nearing the turn, chased and weakened. TEMPTING MOMENT flashed speed towards the inside, chased
for a half then dropped back. BEAN POLE , wide giving early pursuit, faltered leaving the far turn. An objection by the rider of LIFESPAN against the winner
for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST broke a bit slowly, recovered and settled towards the inside, commenced a rail run leaving the half mile marker, got through along the
inside to take command soon into the lane, opened up after being put to a left handed drive, appeared to want to relax when about to be geared down past
the sixteenth pole, had her rider get back to solid hand encouragement and lasted. THUNDERTURTLE settled well back, moved up between rivals leaving
the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out progressing in mid stretch, straightened and finished well to gain. PETES PRIDE stalked the loose
leader, angled three wide while advancing towards the stretch, had aim into the lane and churned on. IN CLASS bobbled outward at the break and bumped
with a rival, pulled her way clear in the opening quarter mile while well off the inside, was guided down to about the two path leaving the far turn, was passed
from her inside by the winner entering the lane, pursued from there then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. WIN THEN GRIN rated off the pace,
raced three wide into the lane, shifted in some and offered a mild kick. LANA , bumped at the break, gave early chase and came up empty. PAZ THE WINE
saved ground most of the way and lacked a bid. CHIT CHAT GIRL broke outward and bumped with a foe, chased off the rail and tired through the drive.

Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN , two wide around the turn while chasing the pace, gained the lead under urging in mid stretch then drew off. ESCAPABILITY bumped with
RIP IT when coming in at the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, weakened but held the place. RAPID RESPONSE saved
ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and had a slight rally. JUST PICK ONE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and offered
a mild, late rally inside horses. FEROCIOUS STORM , two wide on the turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch and failed to rally in an even effort.
ALL THREES , three deep around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way. RIP IT bobbled then was bumped by ESCAPABILITY leaving the
starting gate and failed to be a factor. SMITTEN ENOUGH , three wide on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
INTROSPECTION rated in range, took closer order saving ground past the five sixteenths, eased out and responded when asked soon into the lane, forged
clear in mid stretch, widened and was flashed the stick in the final seventy yards. THEA'S THEME stalked off the inside, moved up three wide heading
towards the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the winner near mid stretch but kept on willingly to save the place. ADABEL settled in the clear early on,
chased outside a rival mid turn, altered towards the rail in the drive and kept trying to the line. SCARLET TANAGER vied inside, shook clear heading
towards the half mile marker, widened early turn, wandered outward when confronted in upper stretch and weakened. MELISANDE , off the pace, raced
well wide in the drive and failed to menace. IAM A DANCER , sluggish from the gate, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the lane but lacked a bid.
TRADING CENTS saved ground and weakened. RAPIDASHQUEEN vied outside SCARLET TANAGER through the opening three sixteenths, chased into
the turn, failed to keep pace mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
EMPTY NESTR lacked speed, was in hand along the inner rail waiting for room entering the far turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch,
closed determinedly outside horses and took the lead approaching the wire. ITGOT GRANDMA , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, opened
up turning for home and gave way grudgingly. UHWARRIE SKY saved ground stalking the pace, advanced to reach a striking position in mid stretch then
flattened out. MOONLIGHT SHADOW lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn then failed to seriously rally. CHEYENNE BULL , well placed down
the backstretch, entered the stretch in the two path but came up empty. APPROVETHISMESSAGE , four wide the first turn, rushed up outside horses down
the backstretch, chased the pace and drifted out in upper stretch when tiring. CAMPARI , along the inner rail on both turns, was not a factor. DAY raced in
the three path on both turns and was not a factor. POSTERITY , four wide on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
OXIDE , three to four wide chasing a contested pace, shifted out a bit near mid stretch, leveled off when put to left handed asking, closed determinedly while
under steady hand pressure in the final seventy yards and forged ahead in the final jumps. REDEEM EDDIE stalked the leaders three wide, was coaxed
along to maintain a forward spot mid turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, secured command past the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but just failed to
contain the winner's charge. THE POSER , bumped at the break, hustled up soon after and bid along the rail to draw even heading towards the half mile
marker, dueled around the turn, fought on past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. YOUNGEST OF FIVE , bumped at the break, was shuffled back
soon after, recovered and was sent up between runners nearing the half mile pole, took closer order under asking mid turn, eased out some in the final
furlong and kept giving effort to the line. GIRLS LOVE ME broke outward and bumped with a rival, pulled clear early, set the pace off the inside, was joined
from the rail by THE POSER leaving the five eighths, dueled outside that one around the turn, wandered wider into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch
then weakened. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , off the pace, circled six wide into the lane and had belated action. SIR BACK IN BLACK , bumped and steadied
at the break, dropped well off the early pace, raced three wide into the lane but failed to make a solid recovery. TOMMY SHELBY , towards the inside, was
not a factor. WHISKEY AND YOU , four to five wide chasing the pace, faded in the drive. MARDEN saved ground without threatening. RAILMASTER came
in at the break and bumped with a foe, moved up towards the inside and gained a stalking spot into the turn, failed to quicken past the five sixteenths and
gave way.
