Footnotes
TUNSTALL tapered to the inside to rate a clear pace, came under pressure at the quarter pole and held on well under steady handling. HOUSE OF LOVE
chased the pace and raced close off the rail through the turn, though, had to settle for second best. PROMENADE PRINCESS chased the early pace well
off the rail, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. LOVE HAPPY gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened
stride inside the eighth pole. MY BLONDE MARY gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more.

Footnotes
BUFF N rated off the pace inside the first turn, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced a close factor in the three path of the far
turn, then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to take the nod under the wire. MY EMMALLY raced in the four path the first turn and took the lead
outside into the backstretch, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement
but was nipped under the wire. GATTOLOTTACHARM stalked the pace two deep the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced
at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. C V'S CAMPFIRE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into
the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. KEEP
LOVING settled off the pace into the backstretch then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the five path entering the stretch but
showed little further. PROUDLY ELEGANT was hustled to the front and angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught into the backstretch and gave
chase from that point, but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
TAPPIN FOR GLORY stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, then challenged into the backstretch and dueled determinedly from that point to
put a head in front the final yards. MINISTRY OF MAGIC rated a short lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled gamely from that point, though,
grudgingly ceded the final yards. RETURN TO ME rated close off the rail the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
at the rail and raced evenly down the lane. JUBA EARLY rounded the first turn in the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on
the far turn then flattened stride later yards. CANDY INVASION steadied soon after the break and rounded the opening turn in the five path, left the turn
outside and bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and showed little more. EMPEROR PENGUIN settled back off the
rail the first turn and bid only mildly from the three eighths pole. PONTICELLO raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace entering the
backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn. BERNIE THE GAMBLER stalked the pace off the rail the
first
turn,

THREE BOPS accelerated to the lead and set a pressured pace leaving the three eighths pole, dueled clear and angled in midway on the turn then dug in
through the stretch to hold on well. UNDENIABLE TOUCH pressured the pace off the rail down the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then dug in
through the lane to hold second. LETTS GO TO DIXIES engaged in close early chase inside but checked off the inside flank of Gandhi's Castle nearing the
quarter pole, came around that one and rounded the turn about the five path, then finished well outside to take third under the wire. THISLILLIMEOFMINE
gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the three path and was nipped from third under the wire. GANDHI'S CASTLE pressured the pace from the
three eighths pole then angled in past the five sixteenths, checked near the rail approaching the quarter pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. QUICK
ENERGY gave only distant early chase and could only close the gap.

DON'T SPIN ME was hustled with the pace and took the nod at the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge through the turn and continued at even terms to
mid-stretch, then drew clear later yards. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT was hustled with the pace through the backstretch but dropped back toward the quarter pole,
came back to even terms leaving the eighth pole, though, flattened stride later yards. PRINCESS JANET gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn
then dueled through the lane for third. INTRACTABLE gave chase inside and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BARBSGRAY LION chased the
pace and rounded the turn three wide then ran evenly down the lane. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE gave chase off the rail, eased out past the eighth pole and
flattened stride. WAY AHEAD OF YOU was brushed lightly at the break, picked up the chase and rounded the turn about the three path but showed little
further. UNCANNY came out and made light contact with Way Ahead Of You leaving the gate and was shuffled back on the chute, then gave chase outside
and raced in the five path of the turn.

SOUND OFF settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the there eighths pole and took the lead approaching the five sixteenths, raced
clear into the stretch and was mostly hand urged to the finish. GIO DUDE settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced
at the rail on the far turn, proved no match through the lane but held on for second while flattening stride later yards. KING MAURO saved ground off the
pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path, showed little in the lane but was gaining on the waning
runner-up. EARNED IT settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and showed little more. CATCH MY CABOOSE stalked the pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. THE WAYNE
FACTOR angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the five sixteenths and faded
at the rail on the far turn. MY EMINENCE rounded the opening turn in the five path and proved no factor.

FINAL SAY angled in to stalk the pace two deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead past the pole, raced clear into the far turn,
drifted outward toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. BROTHER CORBIN saved ground just off the pace the
first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path but
couldn't improve significantly. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR settled off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn and raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn three wide and was along to take third later yards. RIP RAP
RILEY was hard held when hemmed in through the front stretch and angled to the three path into the first turn, stalked into the backstretch and challenged
from the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and weakened. SHACKLED broke outward to make contact with CATONSVILLE
then rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole but was caught past the pole and faded at the rail rounding the far turn,
while CATONSVILLE, was bumped outward and into START FROM SCRATCH leaving the gate then pinched back early, saved ground off the pace, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened while drifting out on the far turn; the latter of whom, was bumped at the break, settled off the pace
and off the rail the first turn then showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
MARTIN MAN stalked the pace from the four path the opening turn, challenged three wide leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead approaching the
quarter, dueled clear toward the head of the lane, widened under steady encouragement but was taken in hand later yards. ASTRO RIDER bobbled leaving
the gate and settled close off the rail, took a slim lead while between horses at the three eighths pole and dueled from that point but was caught
approaching the quarter, dropped back into the stretch and flattened stride, though, managed to hold on for second. DESTINY'S CHARGE saved ground off
the early pace then picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out entering the stretch and was gaining
on the waning runner-up. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE saved ground the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide
and passed some rivals in the process. CUBIC SOUND saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, came through the
far turn four wide and showed little more. SWEETIN BREAD stalked the pace two deep the first turn and took a brief lead into the backstretch, yielded the
advantage and gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded at the rail rounding the far turn. GATTOSING became a bit edgy in the gate then stalked
the pace three wide, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. TRUTH SERUM set the pace inside from
the five eighths pole but was caught and gave chase into the backstretch, then faded past the three eighths pole. KOPP CAT was not a factor.
