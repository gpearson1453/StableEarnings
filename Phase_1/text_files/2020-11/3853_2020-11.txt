Footnotes
FUNWHILEITLASTED prompted the pace three wide through the opening half, took control near the three-eighths pole and angled in to the rail, drew off in
upper stretch in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and held well clear under a drive. SHAKEM raced off the pace three
wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished well to be clearly second best. FACTS ONLY tracked the
pace from the rail for a half, remained up close two wide around the far turn and was one-pace in the drive. KETCHIKAN lacked early speed while racing
three wide, moved up three deep around the far turn and improved position in the lane. BABY LION saved ground to no avail. LEARNT raced off the pace
inside, checked off SO JADED'S heels near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked any bids. BONHEUR raced three wide around the first turn, advanced
outside down the backstretch, made a bid three deep nearing the three-eighths pole then gave way soon after. INDY FRONT hopped at the start and made
little impact while racing two wide. SISTER IS DEVIL pressed the pace two wide between rivals around the first turn, took over midway down the backstretch
but retreated around the far turn. SILVER SKY SMOOTH saved ground rounding the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and was always outrun.
SO JADED chased the pace two wide between rivals and was through after a half. PATRONUS set the early pace along the rail, stopped, pulled up in the
stretch and walked off. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF LEARNT AGAINST SHAKEM FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BON PRIX tracked outside the leaders three wide for a half-mile, challenged for command outside I KICKN and PLENUM in mid stretch, exchanged some
light bumps and brushes with the latter past the eighth-pole and prevailed after a long drive. PLENUM vied early inside I KICKN before getting outpaced into
the turn, went around and rebid outside coming to the quarter-pole, battled gamely between I KICKN and BON PRIX while exchanging bumps and brushes
with the latter into the final furlong, and narrowly missed. I KICKN contested the early pace outside PLENUM, cleared off and moved inside on the turn, dug
in along the rail when confronted by the top two finishers through the furlong grounds, then brushed lightly with PLENUM and steadied in tight nearing the
finish. FIRST HOMESTEAD faded steadily inside. KEYLARGO spotted the field a couple lengths at the start, and remained outrun. SMALL REASON broke
awkwardly, and was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive.
SOUPER ENERGIZER was bumped at the start, steadied early, raced off the pace two wide, made progress around the far turn, swung five wide and
bumped with SEVEN CHANNELS turning for home and rallied for the place. SEVEN CHANNELS saved ground off the pace early, advanced three wide
around the far turn, came six wide and was bumped entering the lane and was along for the show. SNOW JOB steadied along just behind the pace inside
and lacked a rally. GUNMAN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. SEEK HIM FIRST hit the starting gate
and was outrun while racing two and three wide. PUTMAN set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter pole and gave way readily.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY was brushed from both sides at the start, advanced three wide to challenge outside FIGO after six furlongs, outdueled that rival through
the stretch, then held on to preserve the decision in the closing yards. ANOTHER DUKE brushed with the eventual winner at the start, took closer order
approaching the stretch, finished fastest of all outside and ran out of ground. FIGO set a manageable pace inside, dug in when challenged into the stretch,
and stayed on with good courage. SIGRUN FAST BOY was three wide early, moved inside up the backstretch, stayed on his left lead in the stretch and
lacked a solid closing bid. DUDES GOT GAME got bumped and forced out by SHES SKY HIGH entering the first turn, put in a run through the middle
stages near the two-path, then flattened out. ALADO prompted FIGO from outside to the far turn, and had nothing left after six furlongs. SHES SKY HIGH
brushed with TOP GUN TOMMY at the start, became extremely rank and checked while getting out and bumping DUDES GOT GAME into the first turn,
trailed until getting eased in the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
JIRAFALES was bumped at the start, raced well back early, advanced two wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane, split rivals nearing the eighth
pole and drew off under a drive. LAST MINUTE DEAL was bumped at the start, cruised up three wide around the turn, seized command leaving the quarter
pole, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. THE RED MAN chased the pace three wide, continued on
the left lead in the lane and was along late for the show. TRIPLE JEOPARDY never threatened while racing four wide. PROUD CONTENDER tended to lug
in throughout, saved ground off the pace, made progress in upper stretch but could not sustain while lugging in through the final furlong. VENEZUELAN
WINNER set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. TODAYSTHEDAY stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. ALMONASTER had
brief speed inside.

HERA tracked from easy striking range outside to the far turn, bid outside YOLANDA'S PRIDE and wrested the lead away in mid stretch, and edged away
under pressure. GHOSTLY BEAUTY bumped with SAND DRIFT at the start, then brushed with PRINCESS BETTY a stride later, settled in the second flight
for a half-mile advanced three wide into the stretch and finished willingly. SAND DRIFT took the worst of a bump with GHOSTLY BEAUTY at the start,
saved ground at the back early, swung four wide approaching the stretch and rallied for a share. WHAT A BEAUT tucked in behind the leaders to the end of
the far turn, moved off the hedge to the two-path in upper stretch, and had no closing response. PRINCESS BETTY brushed with GHOSTLY BEAUTY at
the start, saved ground outrun for a half-mile, came three wide off the far turn and improved for the last major share. DANCE TILL DAWN saved ground on
the far turn, and made no headway through the stretch on her left lead. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set the pace inside, got collared in upper stretch by the winner,
and gave way. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE faded three wide after a half. MO ME MO MY prompted the pace two wide, and checked while tiring between
horses midway on the far turn.

Footnotes
DOC AMSTER set the pace along the rail and held firm under a steady drive. R MERCEDES BOY stalked the winner two wide, bid near the quarter pole but
was kept at bay through the lane. SEMPER FI saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally for the show. MAN OF VISION failed to menace while racing
two wide. SANDYS BLAZE prompted the pace three wide and tired through the lane. WEEKEND DREAMER stumbled badly at the start, causing the rider
to lose the irons for most of the backstretch run, went three wide around the turn and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
KARENINA saved ground to the far turn, waited behind a wall of horses moving off the inside approaching the stretch, tipped out a bit more finding
clearance through the furlong grounds, caught BLUES SONGS from outside late and held for the decision in a blanket finish. BLUES SONGS settled in the
middle of the field for six furlongs, collared OMNIA from outside entering the final furlong, but could not resist the winner in the final yards. NOBLE MARIA
saved ground on hold to the stretch, slid out for room approaching the eighth-pole, responded willingly and was gaining late outside the top two. STRICT
VOW lagged well back in or around the three-path on the turns, moved out widest and was closing in too late. OMNIA tracked three wide to the far turn,
came away with a short lead after straightening away for the drive, then was outkicked the last eighth of a mile. JEANIE'S ANGEL dropped back inside after
breaking with the leaders, raced three to four wide still well back on the far turn, moved in a bit and gained some ground without threatening. TAILADIOS
raced four wide to the stretch, and faded. SUPER CUTE was toward the rear three wide early, and never menaced. TELL ME MAUX was three wide early,
wound up four to five paths off the inside around the far turn, and could not reach contention. EMOLGA pressed the pace between horses for six furlongs,
and gave way in upper stretch. MY LITTLE ROSE was nursed along on a short lead for six furlongs, and faltered in the stretch. BEAUTIFUL ROSIE was no
factor through a three-wide journey.
