ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the drive, responded and inched away late.
HE'S AN HONEST MAN stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded when asked but could not reach the
winner. ALPHA TO OMEGA dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, fought through the second turn but could not keep pace in
the drive. MAGNANIMUS MAN chased the early pace inside, remained forward but had nothing left. CLEAR THE NILE went evenly. WABASH
CANNONBALL was no factor. LOOKIE LOO was no threat. IT'S A SWEET ONE was no menace. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE forced the pace from the outside
and faded. WHATAKISS showed little.

Footnotes
NANA'S JOY unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded when
sat down for the drive and was along in time. WENEEDTOTALK pressed the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded
but was no match late. LOVE AND LEMONS dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, gained
a clear margin at the eighth pole but could not last. ARGUMENT WON allowed to settle, advanced outside through the second turn, responded and had a
late rally. HARPER BEE went evenly. MISS GURETTA was no factor. ALL FORE KICKS was no threat. MISS BILLIE K dueled from between foes and tired.
KAYDEES IN TOWN had a steady fade. HARLANS WARRIOR dueled from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
JOY TO THE WORLD well placed from the inside early, chased the pace up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded to gain the margin at the eighth pole and was well clear while kept to task. CHICKEN OR THE EGG up close early from the outside, inched
closer entering the second turn, remained forward but was no match for the winner while holding position. MADELYN'S MOMENT forced the early pace
inside but could only hold position. CLEVER MUSIC chased the early pace inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded but was too late.
CABO SUNSET could only improve position. TOSHITA FOREVER could only pass tired ones. BE A BANDIT was no factor. SOUVENIR CHANNEL was no
threat. SOFIA KAPE had a steady fade. CHEROKEETIN XPRESS broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the
backstretch then gave way.
