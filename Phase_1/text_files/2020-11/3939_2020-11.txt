Footnotes
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS broke well then dropped back to stalk the top pair, moved three wide into the far turn, headed rival at the quarter pole, kicked
clear and powered away through the lane. THREE AY EM settled near the fence, angled three wide on the final turn, rallied an edged LURE HIM IN for
second. LURE HIM IN broke out and bumped rival, chased off the inside, traveled four deep into the stretch and was edged for the place honors. M TOWN
GEM hopped at the start, trailed the field early from off the rail, tugged his way to the front, dueled for the lead from outside, gained command early on the
final turn, was overtaken at the quarter pole and flattened in the late stages. IRISH HEATWAVE tracked between rivals, three deep at the quarter pole,
asked in the drive but never produced a bid. ROYAL ACT settled early along the inside, moved out into the two path around the final turn and failed to
respond. MARCKIE'S WATER bumped leaving the gate, unhurried through the opening stages, traveled two wide then three wide on the backstretch,
angled into the four path on the last turn and made no impact. SHOT OF A LIFETIME showed early speed then stalked the leader, pulled briefly to attend
the pace before dropping back again first time through the stretch, stalked three deep up the backstretch, dropped back between rivals on the final turn and
faded. NEVER EASY sprinted to the front to take control then slowed the pace first time through the stretch, dueled for the lead from the inside through the
clubhouse turn, up the backstretch, and into the final turn, lost command around that bend and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GATES OF HEAVEN stalked off the inside, three wide into the turn, bid outside the leader around the bend, floated out by that rival into the stretch, took
control and cleared at the eighth pole and drew off. LOVE MY JIMMY sped to the front and crossed over, entered the turn in the two path then drifted out
leaving the bend, could not hold off the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to preserve the place. SKY NAVIGATOR bumped at the start, trailed early,
advanced four then three wide around the turn and rallied for the show. SHORT RIB chased the speed along the rail, two wide into the stretch and lost the
show. THE ROAN RANGER off a bit slow to begin, took the turn two wide and lacked a rally. GHOSTER stalked outside a pair of rivals, went four then five
wide around the turn and weakened in the drive. KING WAVE broke out and bumped rival, raced off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn and
never made an impact. RUNAWAY WYWY stumbled leaving the gate, chased along the rail into the turn, moved out into the two path around the bend and
failed to threaten.

around the final turn, led through the drive but was caught in deep stretch. ZEE DROP stalked between rivals then outside a foe, closed in around the far
turn, angled five wide into the stretch, rallied but got outkicked by the top pair. CROUGHAVOUKE (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, raced
two wide then angled to the inside, angled out into the stretch, angled out further mid-stretch and finished evenly in the late stages. NASTY pulled early a bit
off the rail, chased between rivals on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, angled out with a furlong to go and never rallied. MO SEE CAL showed
early speed and angled to the inside quickly, moved back into the stalking position around the first turn, came off the rail into the stretch, asked and
weakened in the drive. CARPE VINUM tracked three deep then four wide into the lane and failed to rally. PRINCESS OF CAIRO raced off the pace along
the inside, was in a bit tight at the five-eighths pole, cut the corner into the stretch and came up empty. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) shifted out and bumped rival in
the beginning, chased four deep into the first turn then closed in on the leader, assumed command at the five-eighths pole, showed the way up the
backstretch then relinquished control at the three-eighths, chased four wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
PARNELLI stalked the top pair from off the rail, bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, cleared at the quarter
pole, then drew off under hand urging. EDITOR IN CHIEF raced four to three wide around the first turn, traveled three deep and between foes at the
seven-sixteenths marker, advanced three wide around the bend and finished well for the place. NORTH POLE bumped entering the first turn, pressed the
pace from outside, took a short lead at the three-eighths then was overtaken at the five-sixteenths, chased the leader from inside into the lane and lost the
place. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY bumped and steadied into the first turn, chased off the rail, four wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. WILLY
THE COBBLER settled along the inside, coaxed at the three-eighths, angled three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HELIOCHROME
set the pace under pressure, lost command at the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the turn and tired. ENOUGH NONSENSE bumped and steadied
into the first turn, raced off the rail in range, between runners at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back around the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
FLUFFY SOCKS settled off the pace, bumped rival at the five-sixteenths then drifted out again and bumped at the quarter pole, came five wide into the
stretch, rallied and finished strong under urging. JAVANICA mid-pack early on, raced two wide then three wide into the stretch, steered out then closed well
but could not get by the winner. QUATTROELLE (IRE) traveled near the back of the pace off the rail, bumped at the quarter pole, exited the far turn six
wide, close and finished a game third. PIZZAZZ tracked outside a rival, ranged up five wide leaving the far turn, struck the front in upper stretch, cleared at
the eighth pole but flattened in the final sixteenth. CONSTERNATION (IRE) angled to the inside early, trailed the field early, went between rivals at the
three-eighths, bumped at the five-sixteenths then got bumped again and checked at the quarter pole, kept on through the final furlong and improved
position. MAGICAL THOUGHT stalked three deep then four wide into the lane and weakened. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, bid
along the fence at the top of the lane but proved no match in the final furlong. PLUM SEXY set the pace under pressure and gave way in the lane.
NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) pressed the pace from outside and weakened in the drive. CLOSING REMARKS stalked between rivals, lacked room entering the
stretch, angled to the inside and lacked room at the eighth pole, then faded in the late stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDER'S
OBJECTION PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD CONSTERNATION AGAINST FLUFFY SOCKS. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH FLUFFY SOCKS DID DRIFT OUT AND BUMP CONSTERNATION AT THE QUARTER POLE, IT DID NOT COST CONSTERNATION A
CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH. HAND-TIMED.

BEDROCK settled off the pace, raced six then five wide around the turn, closed outside and drew clear. GREAT POWER vied for the lead from inside, led
past the seven-sixteenths pole, showed the way clear into the stretch but could not hold off the winner. SINGLE ME OUT unhurried in the early going,
closed in around the turn, waited for room near the quarter pole, entered the stretch two wide, checked upper stretch, angled in then back out a bit and
finished well. ECOLOGIST chased off the rail then between rivals, raced four wide into the lane, brushed with rival in upper stretch and kept on for a minor
award. CAL'S GEM lacked early speed and raced outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. BABY GRONK set the pace early,
vied between rivals then dueled outside a foe, could not keep pace into the lane, brushed with rival in upper stretch and weakened. KING PARKER raced off
the pace, saved ground into the lane, steadied briefly nearing the eight pole, angled out and could not rally. FINAL ROSE showed early speed between foes
then chased the top trio, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. SURFSIDE SUNSET was always outrun. CONNECTION angled out early, raced
four wide on the turn, dropped back and weakened. BIG BAD GARY showed early speed four deep then three deep, chased three wide into the lane and

Footnotes
COUNT AGAIN traveled near the back of the field off the inside, angled out on the second turn, entered the stretch four to five wide, closed fast and bested
the runner up. FLAVIUS raced three wide around the first turn, unhurried in the early going, exited the final turn five wide, rallied to the front inside the eighth
pole but could not hold off the winner. NEXT SHARES tracked two wide to the stretch, split foes mid-stretch and finished well to earn the show.
ANOTHERTWISTAFATE showed early speed, led early then lost command at the nine-sixteenths, chased inside into the second turn, tipped out into the
stretch but got outkicked in the final furlong. BOWIES HERO raced three wide then outside a rival, raced five to six wide into the stretch and showed a mild
response. SPIRIT ANIMAL chased along the inside, saved ground into the stretch, lacked room at the eighth pole, tipped out and finished willingly.
MAJESTIC EAGLE tracked off the inside, went four wide into the lane and lacked a serious bid. BLITZKRIEG chased early then pressed three deep, led at
the three-eighths pole, cleared around the final turn, held a short lead at the eighth pole but weakened in the final furlong. IMPERADOR (ARG) in range two
then three wide and flattened in the late stages. MY BOY JACK raced off the pace near the fence, steadied and altered out at the five-sixteenths pole,
continued off the rail into the stretch and could not rally. CAMINO DEL PARAISO in range through the early stages, lacked room and checked behind ONE
BAD BOY who was being eased, angled out then back in on the turn and was not persevered with. ONE BAD BOY stalked early then moved up to take
control at the nine-sixteenths, eased out of the race at the five-sixteenths pole, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

COLT FICTION chased the speed from outside, exited the turn three wide, closed in the final furlong and reeled in CURRY in deep stretch. CURRY set the
pace and angled inward, led clear to the eighth pole but was caught in the late stages. COALINGA ROAD in range off the inside, entered the stretch three to
four wide and kept on to secure the show. I WILL NOT forwardly placed along the inside, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and finished evenly.
POLICY raced off the pace off the inside, came out into the stretch and improved position. AGAMEMNON stalked the pacesetter from inside, cut the corner
into the drive and failed to respond when called upon. ABUSIVE GARY up close early outside the leader, chased two to three wide into the stretch and
faded. PERFECT FANNY chased off the rail, went four to five wide around the turn and weakened. STRIKE IT LUCKY stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the
field early and was never a factor.

DOMESTIC SPENDING (GB) raced three wide then four wide into the stretch, closed fast and got up in time. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT forwardly placed
through the early stages, bid outside with a furlong to go, led late but got nailed in the final moments. GUFO trailed early off the rail, came out into the
stretch, surged late and finished a strong third. GET SMOKIN sped clear early, set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way around the far turn and into
the stretch, held a short lead nearing the eighth pole, fought back when challenged from outside but yielded in the final sixteenth. DECORATED INVADER
bothered by inside rival entering the first turn, tracked off the inside, raced three wide then four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly. SCARTO pulled a
bit into the first turn while angled to the inside, stalked along the rail to the stretch and also went evenly through the final furlong. STORM THE COURT went
three wide into the stretch, angled out and improved position. LANE WAY traveled off the rail in range, raced three wide to the stretch and weakened.
TAISHAN shifted out and steadied entered the first turn, raced off the rail to the lane and never rallied. KANDEREL steadied along the inside into the first
turn, remained inside then tipped out into the stretch and proved no menace. STRONGCONSTITUTION tracked two wide then angled to the rail and
weakened.
