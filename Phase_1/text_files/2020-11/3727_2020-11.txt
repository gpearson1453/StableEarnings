Footnotes
ANACONDA prompted the pace from outside, drew up on even terms at the quarter pole, gained the lead and kicked clear under left-handed urging and
drew away under steady handling. MCWHERTER off a bit slow and bothered at the start, traveled along the inside into the turn, moved out into the two path
leaving the bend, finished well and was clearly second best. LEME AT EM settled off the pace, raced in the two path then looked to be in a bit tight past the
three-eighths pole and checked, angled to the inside after and closed last for the show honors. DEUCE broke inward leaving the gate, quickly established
the front, pressured by rival up the backstretch and into the turn, headed at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. WARAIRE
stalked the pace widest of the field early, took the turn four wide and lacked a rally. TOP GUNNER chased three wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TAKE A LEAP stalked the lone leader from inside then two wide into the stretch, chased rival through the lane then put in a late bid and reeled in rival in
deep stretch to get up. UNO TROUBLE MAKER sped clear early and controlled the pace under a hold, went two wide into the bend then a bit off the rail into
the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole and could not fend off the winner. MADAME BARBARIAN chased outside a rival early on, took the turn four then
five wide, never found the needed response in the lane but kept on to edge ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR for the show. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) stalked
the pace off the rail, went three wide into the turn then four wide entering the stretch, lacked further response and lost the show. STURDY ONE off a bit slow
to begin, steered outside early, went four wide into the turn then angled to the fence around the bend and was never a factor.

LUXURY LINER off slow to begin, hustled early and went up inside to challenge for the lead, dueled with BIG AWARD into and around the turn, cleared foe
entering the stretch, put to right-handed urging and held off the runner-up. COMPLETE CONTROL angled in early, traveled two wide into the turn, angled
out into the three path around the bend, closed outside the leader and was clearly second best. BIG AWARD away quickly from the gate, went to the lead
then dueled with LUXURY LINER, lost contact with that rival exiting the bend, weakened in the drive but lasted for the show. KEEP YOUR COIL stalked five
wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and missed the show. METAROSE dropped back early, raced three wide through the turn, angled out in the lane
and passed tired foes. SUPERNOVA WILDCAT forwardly placed early on, traveled three wide around the turn while dropping back and was not persevered
with late. MILITARY PRINCESS chased four wide into the turn, came in tight quarters and steadied past the three-eighths pole, dropped back and was
eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
STRIKE IT LUCKY off slow leaving the gate, angled to the inside, steered out into the three path leaving the turn, rallied between late and edged JOHNNY
PODRES for the score. JOHNNY PODRES settled outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, floated out into the lane, closed four deep late and missed.
RESTORING DREAMS took control early, inched away around the turn, saved ground into the stretch, held command through the drive but drifted out and
brushed HIDDEN PROMISE in the final sixteenth and got caught by the top pair. CARTELLATE showed early speed then chased the leader from a bit off
the rail through the turn, tipped out in the lane and took aim outside the leader, brushed by that foe then put in tight quarters and steadied nearing the wire.
HIDDEN PROMISE off a bit slow to begin, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch and proved no menace. SILARDI stalked outside the top pair,
raced three then two wide while outside a rival on the turn, then drifted in mid-stretch while tiring.

in upper stretch, took a short lead soon after and inched away in the late stages. FROSTERIA pressed the pace from outside, took control approaching the
quarter pole, challenged in upper stretch and could not go on with the winner and stayed on for the place. MOONLIGHT D'ORO chased in the two path
around the turn, bumped with inside rival past the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished willlngly. AGREETODISAGREE stalked
outside a rival, bumped with inside rival into the turn, moved into the four path around the bend and finished evenly late. HELEN MARIE off slow and
brushed the inside of the gate leaving, raced along the inside then swung five wide into the stretch and never rallied. FRACING FAST chased off the inside,
went four wide into the lane and never threatened. GHOSTLY GAL hopped slightly at the start, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. LUNATIC off a
bit slow to begin, went up inside to take control, set the pace under pressure, lost the lead nearing the quarter pole, bumped with rival past the
three-sixteenths pole and faded. MAMA SUPERIOR dropped back early, took the turn two then three wide and had little left for the stretch.

VIA EGNATIA stumbled leaving the gate, stalked the leader to the far turn, asked at the quarter pole, quickly cleared entering the stretch and held safely
under a drive to the wire. VANTASTIC mid-pack early, raced two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly alongside
IRISH HEATWAVE and outkicked that rival for the place. IRISH HEATWAVE chased the speed from inside, waited for room near the quarter pole, gained a
clear path into the stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong but got edged for second. M TOWN GEM went two then three wide around the first turn,
went between foes and was in tight quarters then lacked room off heels at the three-eighths pole, came off the far turn four wide and improved position. DR.
TROUTMAN broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, sped to the front, set the pace to the far turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole, failed to
respond to urging and weakened. RESPECT THE HUSTLE raced off the rail throughout, came five wide into the stretch and never threatened.
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS bumped leaving the gate, settled inside early, moved out into the two path on the far turn, raced three wide in upper stretch and

Footnotes
ACTING OUT brushed leaving the gate, showed good early speed, set the pace along the fence, kicked clear into the stretch while padding the lead and
powered away in the final furlong. QUEEN OF THE TRACK broke through the prior to the start, broke out and bumped rival, taken back off the pace, tipped
out into the two path around the bend, showed a mild rally and bested the rest. MAGICAL GRAY chased outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, four
wide entering the stretch and gained the show. MISS FIA attended the pace early outside rivals, chased three then four wide into the stretch, lacked further
response but stayed on for a minor award. WATCH ME BURN chased in the two path into the turn, moved down to the rail around the bend and weakened.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP bumped and crowded at the start, up close early, traveled two wide around the bend, three wide upper stretch and weakened.
