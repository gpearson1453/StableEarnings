Footnotes
OCELIA was unhurried while off the inside, raced in the three path into the far tun, moved four wide in late turn, came into the lane four wide, cleared
outside the eighth pole and was under a drive to stay clear to the end. HOT N SWEET was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the
lane from the three path and behind a wall of rivals, shifted into the five path and chased the winner to the wire while finishing clear for the place spot.
JACK'S FINALE vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, was no match for the top two but stayed on well to be well clear for the show spot.
LITTLE MAEMI hesitated at the start and spotted the field a couple of lengths, moved up along the inside into the first turn, was able to acquire a stalking
position into the far turn, bid three wide into the lane then weakened through the final eighth while drifting in a couple of paths. TOUCH OF BLESSING vied
for the lead two wide through the far turn then gave way entering the lane. CRYPTO CAT raced four or five wide into the far turn when asking for more,
continued well off the rail into the lane and weakened. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE was never a factor while in the two path. HANDFUL OF HEROES chased the
pace from along the inside into the backstretch and steadily faded. TWO LUCKY stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn then was suddenly
done.

Footnotes
FEARLESS ANNA was in the two path while never far back through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, quickly collared and passed the
pacesetter outside the eighth pole then was under strong handling inside the sixteenth pole to last while drifting out about three paths late. WICKED WAYS
was in the two to the four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from mid-track and moved up for the place spot while being well
clear of the show rival. KEE SHE was in the two path throughout and moved up for the minor share. IRENE was unhurried while along the rail through the
turn, continued along the rail into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART was in the two path through the turn when well
back, angled into the eight path and moved up while never a threat. JOKINGLY chased the pace from the two path through the turn and and faded once
entering the lane. EUROPUNKSTAR set the pace into the lane while saving ground then gave way readily. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS was never a factor
while in the three path. MOMMA CRIBBED broke with the pack and ran with others for a sixteenth then dropped back into the turn.

the far turn, bid two wide and between rivals into the lane, dueled to the sixteenth pole and edged up late. DAAHER STREET was in the three path through
the far turn, bid into the lane four wide, continued three wide near the sixteenth pole and was gaining to the end. REED O'PRADO chased the pace while in
the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane then could not keep up with the top two. SUNDAY DRIVE was squeezed at the start and shut off,
raced in the two to the four path through the first turn, moved up while in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and was
gaining to the end. ALL STAR JUSTICE raced in the five to the four path through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn, was in the three or
four path entering the lane and finished evenly. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE was along the inside through the far turn and never was a threat. MOONSHINE

Footnotes
STAGE FIVE CREEPER chased the pace while along the inside through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, gained the lead when straightening in the
lane, was headed near the eighth pole then dug in gamely to edge to the front late. LADY BLUE was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the two
to the five path on the turn, came into the lane from mid-track with momentum, gained a short lead and looked like a winner with an eighth to go then could
not hold the winner safe in the closing strides. ROMANTIC ATTACK was unrushed into the far turn, came into the lane from the three path, shifted into the
five path inside the eighth pole and moved up for the minor share. FUN SUCKER pressed the early pace then gained the lead while off the inside, continued
with the lead through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and faltered once straightened. OVER THE BLUES settled off the pace down the
backstretch, bid quickly three wide into the far turn, moved to chase the pace in late turn then tired after entering the lane. BEHOLD set the early pace
through the first turn, chased the leader into the far turn while in the two path then tired after entering the lane. I CAME TO PRAISE chased the pace from
the three path into the backstretch and was done entering the far turn. MAJESTIC BOLD was in the five path through the first turn, raced in contention down
the backstretch and was suddenly done entering the far turn.
