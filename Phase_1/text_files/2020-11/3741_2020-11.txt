rail at the turn, was hustled from mid pack, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD stalked the pace, was pinched back at the
turn, chased two to four-wide to the stretch then rallied from the outside. MISS BEHAVE led into the turn, set the pace, was engaged near the top of the
stretch, dueled, both were passed by STARLIGHT RIDGE, chased briefly and gave way. STARLIGHT RIDGE, in range, closed two-wide on the turn, bid in
earnest at the top of the stretch, was passed quickly and retreated. BOBBI'S LEGACY, in range, chased four-wide late turn then evened out in the stretch.

SARATOGA VISION raced in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide on the far turn, cut inward at the top of the stretch, closed between rivals and powered
to the lead in the final 16th. KEEPME IN THEGAME was herded inward at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then
closed gamely through the stretch. SHES THE NORTH pulled to the early lead, set a rated pace, quickened on the far turn, was still in command mid stretch
but hit the wall in the final 16th. SKY DRAGON broke inward herding KEEPME IN THEGAME, stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then
chased through the stretch. WITCH MOON settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. CON THIEN was
herded inward leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turns, chased into the stretch and rallied between foes. GLORIANNIA stalked the
pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn and was all out along the fence in the stretch. SWILLING, taken well in hand at the break, raced from off the
pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but was never in contention. SMARTY ILLUSION, rated off the pace, was roused three-wide late turn but lacked

Footnotes
SPARKLE SAMMY sprinted clear quickly, set a reserved pace, was set down upper stretch and held sway under light handling. CINDERVELLA bumped
with PIERIAN at the start, raced in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn then rallied gamely. MISS ARIEL settled in mid pack, closed two to four-wide late
turn then rallied between foes. AIRY FAIRY bumped with PIERIAN leaving the gate, stalked the pace, chased two-wide then the rail late turn, launched a
determined drive but had no kick in the late stages. PRINCESS FABIANA lost her path just out of the gate, settled off the pace, angled from two to four-wide
closing through the turn, was fanned out at the top of the stretch and rallied. YES PLEASE settled in mid pack, was in range late turn then finished evenly.
ONEZY'S DREAM raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but offered no closing response. WITHOUT A DOUBT settled off the
pace, saved ground but lacked a rally. PIERIAN, bumped with rivals on both sides leaving the gate, stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn,
chased into the stretch then flattened out with a furlong to run. SUBZERO PLUS reared at the start and trailed the field. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START RULED THAT SUBZERO PLUS WAS TO BE DEEMED A NON-STARTER DUE TO AN UNFAIR START. THERE WILL BE A REFUND OF
SINGLE RACE WAGERS ON SUBZERO PLUS WHILE MULTI RACE WAGERS USING SUBZERO PLUS WILL INHERIT THE FAVOURITE IN ITS
PLACE.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY CURLIN sat in mid pack by the wire for the first time, had only two rivals beaten late on the backside, geared up and circled four to five wide on
the far turn to loom up at the quarter pole, drove to the front outside the eventual place finisher in upper stretch, widening once changing leads by the eighth
pole, still in the six or seven path at the wire. ART OF ALMOST sat in mid pack three to two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide on the far turn
and bid for the front turning for home, but the winner's kick was much better, forcing her to settle for a well beaten second. PEACE SEEKER chased along
the rail throughout, got up the fence turning for home when the leader drifted out, staying on gamely for the show award. ELIZABETH WAY (IRE) was
between foes chasing the leaders coming out of the first turn, appeared to be dropping back near the quarter pole but once straightened out in the stretch,
she seemed to catch her second wind, re-rallying for a minor award. JULIANA (PER) was hard held prompting the early pace setter, couldn't be held back
any longer and cleared into the far turn, stayed out in the two to three path and held until turning for home, tiring down the lane. GUN SOCIETY was three to
two wide around the first turn and off the pace, rallied three to four wide on the far turn and closed down the five path in the stretch to best the balance
without threatening. TAPPITTY TAPPITTY was four to three wide in mid pack around the first turn, advanced into a stalking position three to two wide on the
far turn, hanging in until the eighth pole when losing positions. A BROKEN BREEZE was off the pace along the inside, steadying when moving up the rail
out of that turn, followed the show finisher around the far turn but faded in the stretch. SILENT TANGO was at the back of the pack throughout, never
involved in the outcome. AUNTIE KATHERINE set the pace with the rider high in the saddle, was headed before the far turn, retreating from that point.

Footnotes
MISS SAVVY led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear mid turn then held sway under light handling. ROSEBUD'S HOPE stalked the pace, came two
and three-wide through the turn and rallied gamely. BOOGIE WITH ME stalked the pace, raced from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished under a brisk drive. BIG MISTAKE stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. SILENT RESPECT
settled in mid pack, raced two-wide on the turn, angled out upper stretch but evened out late. GOLDEN GARTER forced the issue then stalked late turn but
lacked a closing response. BROADWAY BONNIE settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch but chased when
clear. CLOSE IMAGE steadied at the start and settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide late turn, rallied from the outside but was not a threat. HASSAH
(GB) settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. STOKES settled in mid pack, rode the rail then moved
two-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and launched a determined drive. MIZZONA, in mid pack early, closed three and four-wide late turn but tired in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
SKYWIRE rated kindly at the back of the pack, closed into the far turn, was roused, bumped with TIMESKIP upper stretch, bid a furlong out and drove clear
after a brief battle with ARMISTICE DAY but was kept to business. ARMISTICE DAY broke well but was quickly headed, stalked the pace, closed into the
far turn and forced the issue, challenged mid turn, gained a short lead at the top of the stretch, was engaged by SKYWIRE a furlong out, was no match and
chased to the wire. TIMESKIP settled off the pace, saved ground, chased two-wide into the stretch, shared some bumps with SKYWIRE then chased that
one to the end. VANZZY broke inward and was steadied then rated in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, was lugging in through the stretch
and evened out in the late stages. SALUTE WITH HONOR was used early to gain the lead and was taken in hand to set the place, was pressured into the
far turn and engaged mid turn, yielded at the 1/4 pole, was game to the final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
DRUNK DIAL was herded in and bumped THRILLING BABY at the start, gained a short lead on the main track, set the pace, moved clear on the turn then
widened in the stretch. IN MY OPINION broke outward and bumped ARRIVISTE, settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch then
closed willingly. HAZELBROOK settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. POLAR APPEAL, bumped at the start,
pressed the pace into the turn, chased hard to the stretch but evened out in the late stages. SHOW ME THE GOLD was bumped then pinched back at the
start, settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. BIG GINGER showed brief speed, forced the pace, chased from the rail
on the turn then finished gamely. ARRIVISTE, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn but evened out in the stretch.
JOKERS RUN settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. FEDALIA broke inward, stalked the pace, was hustled
four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. KOTO raced in mid pack, came along the rail and two-wide on the turn but had no closing response.
FROSTED FOLLY, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then lacked a response in the stretch. THRILLING
BABY, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
AUG LUTES jumped to the right at the start and trailed, quickly recovered to chase four wide between runners, advanced two to three wide on the turn and
challenged the eventual place finisher who had taken over the lead turning for home, drove by at the eighth pole and was inching away in the final yards.
ROCKET RELOAD broke out but had the lead early, allowed a rival up her inside to take the front, cruised by that one midway on the turn, was challenged
by the winner in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. JILL chased along the rail through the turn, came out in upper stretch but lost her action
momentarily, recovering quickly but no match for the top pair, losing ground to them late but holding the show spot with a diminishing margin. BLESS AND
HONOR was outrun early, trailed on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was gaining on the show horse late without threatening the top pair. QUEEN
RHONDA broke out at the start and chased widest down the backside, dropped back on the turn and closed mildly late after shifting in upper stretch.
FOREST DRIFT rushed up inside the early leader to take over, was headed by that one midway on the turn and retreated from that point.

PERFECT SPEIGHTY settled in mid pack, angled off the rail late on the far turn, rallied between foes and was up late under a razor sharp drive.
INVENTING BLAME led early, set a pressured pace, held his constant rival off through the stretch but was passed late by the winner. VIEWFINDER broke
in the air then settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide late turn, rallied outside and was gaining late. VEGAS KITTEN stalked the pace, forced the
issue on the backstretch and far turn, was unable to get by INVENTING BLAME and lost positions in deep stretch. PRIMO TOUCH, in range, chased
three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. WEDGEWOOD threw his head leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, came two and three-wide
through the far turn, encountered traffic in the late stages and evened out. DOTTED LINE broke outward, stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled into the
stretch but lacked a closing response. ROSE'S VISION, in touch, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, launched a determined drive but evened out late.
DUKE OF CARTHANIA settled off the pace, closed two-wide late turn, was blocked mid stretch and evened out. BURNING MAN settled off the pace, was
hustled four to six-wide through the far turn then closed gamely in the stretch but never reached contention. ARTISTICO was rated in mid pack, chased hard
three to five-wide on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. SANDINO RULER (ARG) lost his path at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JACKIE MILTON settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled and edged clear in the final furlong. TOP HAT BOSS
dueled on the backstretch, set a pressured pace on the turn, moved clear mid turn, was challenged at the top of the stretch, battled, but gave way
grudgingly in the final furlong. DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE stalked the pace, dueled into the turn but was headed and backed away along the rail then
evened out in the stretch. SPACE GENERAL stalked the pacesetter, closed four-wide late turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch and chased to the end.
PLAY IT SMART settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. ENGLISH BISCUIT settled in mid pack,
was hustled three to five-wide on the turn, began to rally between foes but angled out mid stretch and picked up where she left off. CAPTURE THE
MOMENT stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SOUPER CAPACITY was
herded outward leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide through the turn then finished with some interest. MOONLIGHT MELODY
broke outward and was steadied, raced from off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK
settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. IRISH CHARM forced the pace,
dueled into the turn, was headed, dropped back along the rail on the turn and lacked a closing response. AUDITION broke outward, showed speed and
dueled from the rail, dropped back quickly on the turn and lacked a rally.
