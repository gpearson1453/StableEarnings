Footnotes
JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP set a pressured pace along the inside, kicked clear from a bidding foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and held sway thereafter.
DANCE RHYTHMS chased from midpack, advanced in the three path around the turn before tipping four wide turning for home, then rallied to achieve
place while not threatening the leader. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK broke outwards and bothered a rival, stalked the leading duelers from the three path,
produced a three wide bid turning for home, but was repelled by the inner pace setter in upper stretch, then lost place approaching the wire. VIOLENZA
pressed the pace two wide, vied outside of the leader around the turn, sustained vying position turning for home as MOM'S RED LIPSTICK ranged up
alongside, then failed to keep pace between horses passing the quarter pole. LUVIN BULLIES chased along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch.
INTUICAO (BRZ) was off a step slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and improved mildly in the lane without factoring. UNAQUOI was
bothered at the start by an inner foe, then saved ground off of the pace, but tired. CRYSTAL LAKE was outrun while wide through the turn, then was eased
while drifting out through the lane.

BACK RING LUCK bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide, vied outside of OPTIMUS KAT around the far turn, forged an advantage from that foe
in upper stretch, then drew off under driving pressure through the late stages. OPTIMUS KAT set the pace along the inside, clung to an advantage from the
eventual winner around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and proved second best. CATIPARI shied inwards from an outer foe and
was crowded between horses at the start, trailed along the inside around the first turn, then rallied in the five path around the far turn to bid for show in upper
stretch, forged that position in midstretch, then held it from WESTERN PHAROAH late. WESTERN PHAROAH took bumps from rivals on both sides at the
start, rated off of the pace in the two path, trailed into the far turn before rallying four wide around it, then stayed on to split foes in the late stages, but
missed catching an outer rival for show. CITY DRIFTER bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked while forwardly placed four wide, lied in range three
wide around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, then weakened through the late stages. SURMONT raced far off of the
pace in the two to three paths around the turns, and failed to menace. HALF COCKED stalked three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole. KICK
SOME TALE saved ground from midpack, but was done early. BEAT DUKE broke inwards, tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened into the far turn.
BEAUCETTE'S EKATI lied off of the pace three wide, but weakened around the far turn.

RAMSEY SOLUTION set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage at the quarter pole, repelled the bidding SPLIT THE WICKETS at the
furlong pole, and held firmly through the late stages. SPLIT THE WICKETS tracked from off of the pace two wide, gained through the far turn to produce a
three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but hung on his left lead through the lane and was repelled by an inner foe at the furlong marker. MIDNIGHT
TEA TIME stalked two wide, but was outmoved by SPLIT THE WICKETS at the quarter pole, then gave way between foes in midstretch. CULLUM ROAD
trailed along the inside, then two wide into the far turn, shifted four wide at the quarter pole, and failed to mount a rally. LOUDER THAN BOMBS saved

Footnotes
GAGETOWN stalked the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, held that path in upper stretch and split the leaders approaching the furlong
pole, then drew off under driving pressure thereafter. GUN LAP stalked three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, chased the leaders as GAGETOWN
split them in upper stretch, then reached place on the wire. NAME REJECTED dueled along the inside, dug in as outer foes forged advantage, reclaimed
place while getting outkicked by GAGETOWN at the furlong pole, then was nailed for that position on the wire. ROCKSTAR RO dueled for the lead two
wide, shifted three wide in upper stretch, which allowed for running room for the eventual winner, got headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and yielded
thereafter. CASH ROCKET raced far off of the pace three wide around the turn, and failed to threaten. AERONAUT was off slowly, saved ground far off of
the pace, and chased the leaders from the rail through the lane. SUPER WISE raced far off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, and was
outrun. DIVINIUM rushed to vie inside of foes early on, took back to stalk into the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
