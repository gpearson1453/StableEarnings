weakened the final furlong. SUGAR DADDY hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and gave way. COMMANDING GENERAL , two wide on the turn,
angled to the four path in upper stretch and gave way. OFFICER COUNTRY was outrun.

Footnotes
GARY DOING BIZ , in the clear stalking the dueling leaders, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths, rolled to command outside a pair of runners in
mid stretch and widened under a steady hand ride. JOYFUL JILL broke slowly, recovered and advanced towards the rail in the opening quarter mile, came
off the inside past the five sixteenths, raced three wide into the lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. QUICKSTRIKE dueled outside GREAT CAUSE
through solid fractions, briefly went clear mid turn, dug in when confronted entering the lane, could not resist the winner in mid stretch and gave way
grudgingly from there. AWFULLY FOXY bobbled inward at the break and bumped with a foe, straightened and pursued about four wide, edged up to have
aim into the lane but went evenly in the final furlong. HELLO GRACIE was jostled between rivals then pinched back at the break, recovered and pulled her
way forward five wide outside rivals, dropped in and quickly gained past the three eighths, bid outside the leader nearing the lane, pressed to mid stretch
then faded. ACADIAN GIRL , off the pace, saved ground mid turn, eased out in the drive and had some belated interest. STAR OF SHANGHAI , unhurried
while well off the pace, came four wide for the drive and had a slight kick. GREAT CAUSE rushed to gain a short lead towards the rail, dueled to the inside
of QUICKSTRIKE for a little more than a half mile then gave way. MAYFIELD OF DREAMS , three wide early, saved ground into the lane and failed to
menace. STORYBOOK FARM , bumped at the break, raced between rivals while chasing into the lane and weakened. NOR PER OURS , wide, was not a
factor. RENAGADE RUSH was outrun.

WHATS THE CHANCES stalked the pace two wide around the turn, gained command in upper stretch and drew off. TRUE SHIPMAN saved ground around
the turn, remained inside in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch and rallied. MAKE US SMILE bore out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner
rail on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and had a slight rally. BURGESS , bumped by NEVERFOLD leaving the starting gate, hugged the rail into the
stretch, angled out near the sixteenth and gained late between foes. KUKULKAN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way the
final furlong. PAY THE KID reared at the break, raced inside horses in the stretch and showed a late move. SENSATIONALIST , four deep on the turn,
weakened. CALL ME LATER , five deep leaving the turn, was not a factor. PERSEVERED , three wide on the turn, was outrun. NEVERFOLD bumped and
forced out leaving the starting gate, was done mid way on the turn. JUST GO WITH IT , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. FELLOW
was outrun.

Footnotes
LIV AND LET LIV drifted out at the break, straightened and rated close up three wide, bid to engage the leader nearing the lane, forged clear after being
roused in upper stretch, responded to left handed rousing through the final furlong and held sway. BREEZE OFF THE BAY had speed inside rivals, was
shuffled back nearing the turn, eased out and then progressed between foes into the lane, kept on willingly from there and gained the place.
SHACKABOOM vied outside, went clear into the turn, was joined by the winner entering the lane, failed to match strides but held well through the final
furlong. HONOR YOUR MOTHER had some speed inside, dropped back into the turn then failed to generate the needed kick. DOUBLE FIREBALL had
speed to the inside of SHACKABOOM, steadied off that one nearing the turn and faded. FAST LANI broke slowly, made a wide mid move and weakened in
upper stretch.

JOURNEYTOTHEMOON saved ground stalking the pace around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and took the lead late. LITTLE
HUNTRESS sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, held a clear advantage in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. MARVELLA NASTY , well
off the rail between horses into the lane, rallied mildly. SHANNON , between horses into the stretch, swung outside approaching the eighth pole and showed
a nice, late move. BABA , two wide around the turn, chased the pace and gave way in the drive. FACTOR IN was not a factor. EXPECT THE SUNRISE ,
fractious behind the starting gate, was four deep on the turn and weakened. ENTER SANDWOMAN , wide on the turn, was not a factor. EPHEMERAL was
outrun. COOKIES AND CREAM , three deep on the turn, chased the pace and gave way in the drive. LOST LAKE hugged the inner rail on the turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
GALERIO broke a step slow, dropped right to the rail and edged up to rate close, got through along the rail to take command after six furlongs, shook clear
in upper stretch, was guided off the inside and held firm under a drive. TATTOOED , under a snug hold while trailing through the opening half mile, raced
between foes into the far turn, dropped in and followed the inside route of the winner entering the lane, shifted out for the drive and gave game chase to the
wire. STONE COURAGEOUS rated off the pace while wide, continued off the inside to the three eighths, dropped inside for the stretch run and kept on with
interest. LET'S PLAY NINE wandered outward while stalking into the backstretch, mild bid three wide outside a pair of rivals past the five sixteenths, chased
into the lane and faded. BIG CITY BOB saved ground, moved up some past the three eighths, angled out to pursue into the lane and came up empty.
PASSION PLAY broke on top despite a stumbled, sprinted clear, set the pace two wide, left a seam for the winner nearing the five sixteenths, sparred to
upper stretch then weakened. SKYSCANNER rated in range while off the rail, angled four wide while under a drive into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT , two wide in a striking position around the turn, found room along the inner rail in the stretch, closed inside MAP OF AMERICA and took
the lead late. MAP OF AMERICA , sent to the early lead, saved ground around the turn while setting a pressured pace, drifted out in upper stretch and gave
way grudgingly. BE PRESENT prompted the pace outside MAP OF AMERICA and weakened the final furlong. EXCESS CAPACITY , steadied in close
quarters leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail the final half mile and rallied mildly. ESCAPE FUND hopped at the break, circled the turn three wide,
chased the pace and weakened. PATRIOTIC PUNCH , three wide on the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch then came up empty. AMANITE ,
checked in tight quarters entering the turn, was not a factor. LAST LOVE trailed.

Footnotes
BEYOND THE VICTORY took over at once, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away an early bid from UNIVERSAL PAYDAY then kicked clear with
five eighths to go, was put to a solid drive nearing mid stretch, wandered outward from left handed asking when meeting a challenge nearing the sixteenth
pole, had his rider go to strong hand encouragement from there, kept on tenaciously while drifting out a bit through the final yards and held firm. PARADISE
PRIDE rated forwardly while three to four wide, moved up to take aim past the three eighths, ranged up outside BEYOND THE VICTORY to threaten with
about a sixteenth to go, was floated out and kept on gamely to the line. DIXIE DRAWL saved ground, edged up into the far turn, was hard ridden pursuing
the leaders into the lane but lacked a solid bid. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY prompted the pace two to three wide, brief bid past the three quarter pole, chased into
the far turn then faded. NICK PAPAGIORGIO stumbled at the break, settled in the clear moved up under pressure and off the rail past the five sixteenths,
came four wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. PRETTY GOOD YEAR settled outside a rival, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled five
wide but failed to generate a legitimate response. ROUGH SEA broke poorly, saved some ground and failed to recover. Following a stewards' inquiry and
objection by the rider of PARADISE PRIDE alleging interference in the stretch, BEYOND THE VICTORY was disqualified and placed second.

MCELMORE AVENUE hugged the inner rail, took the lead on the turn, opened a clear lead near the quarter pole, drifted out and drew off. GALATIANS
showed speed outside the winner, gradually weakened through the stretch and held the place. SUCCESSFUL CURE , bumped leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn three deep, floated to the six path in upper stretch and rallied mildlgy. WALK AWAY JOE hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to
menace in an even effort. JAMMINWITHBRANDON bumped and forced out BELLARMINE HALL when bearing out at the break then was outrun.
PITCHING ARI raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. BELLARMINE HALL , steadied when bumped around
leaving the starting gate, rushed up outside horses down the backstretch, raced three wide on the turn and tired.
