LIP SERVICE unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the drive, angled outside,
responded and inched clear late. FROM NOW ON allowed to settle early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded and closed with a rush for
the place. SONG N A CAT dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. BUCK
DYNASTY dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch but had nothing left for the drive. DANCEHALL JACK went evenly. LITTLE TOE dueled
from between foes and tired. SUPER FACTOR was no factor. ROLLWITHIT was no threat. ITS A CITY DAY was no menace. I B REVOLUTIONERY forced
the early pace and faded.

GOTTA GO stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the drive, responded to gain
the margin and was well clear while kept to task. HOORAY AUSTIN dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward entering the
drive but could not keep pace while holding position. YES HE CAN dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch but could not keep
pace in the drive. FOOLISH STEVE forced the early pace outside but had nothing left. PRINCIPE GUILHERME was no factor. NEW COLOSSUS was no
threat. SLITHER vied from the inside and faded.

the way at the eighth pole but could not last. ELISHER stalked the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded but just missed the
place. DURITZ chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the turn but was too late. LIONS HOT MESS forced the early pace inside but had
nothing left. BIG COUNT chased the early pace and tired. PRETTY GUILTY was no factor. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT was no threat. CLASSY'S FAST ROY was
