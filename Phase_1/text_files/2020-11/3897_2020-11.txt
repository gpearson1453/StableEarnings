Footnotes
WATERLOO SUNSET broke sharply clearing the field setting the pace through the turn drawing off in upper stretch winning as much the best. QUEEN
KNOWLEGE chased the pace through the turn proving no match for the winner in upper stretch angling out to mid track getting up for place at the wire.
ISLAND BETTY chased the pace saving ground to upper stretch weakening late on the rail. MISTERKAPLAN raced evenly off the pace circling six wide in
upper stretch gaining modestly late. SHEZA MEAN BROAD slow early raced nine wide down the lane. MUSTA BEEN ANN E was bumped and jostled
between horses at the break. GERRY LYNN chased through the turn tiring in upper stretch. KYLESNORTHERNSTAR played no factor. BELLA BLESS
gave hard pursuit through the turn wilting in upper stretch. DREAMINGOFROSEALLA hopped at the break, raced second flight tiring to upper stretch. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MUSTA BEEN ANN E AGAINST THE RIDERS OF MISTERKAPLAN AND ISLAND BETTY FOR INTERFERENCE AT
THE START WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
