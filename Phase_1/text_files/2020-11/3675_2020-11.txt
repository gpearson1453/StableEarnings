along the rail and two-wide but tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
MY SILENCER forced the pace, dueled on the backstretch and through the far turn, gained the lead 1a furlong out and just held under a drive.
GUESTIMATION led on the first turn, dueled on the backstretch and far turn, was headed a furlong out but came on again and just missed with a late surge.
KING CAUSEWAY raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely outside. VELOCE, in range, was hustled two-wide late turn then
chased through the stretch. COMBATIVE raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but had no late kick
getting to the end. ARGENTIUM settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then finished evenly. MAMBOINTHEFOREST lost his path
leaving the gate, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but was not a threat. INCLUSIVE settled off the pace, was hustled
four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. DOCTOR UPTOWN raced in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn but failed to menace.
REDOUTE'S LIGHT settled off the pace, trailed to the top of the stretch and never reached contention. MATINEE stalked the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the far turn but tired in the final furlong. LUCAS N' LORI, away slowly and off the pace, was never far off the rail but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
LOMAKI'S GEM was quick to the front from his outside post, stalked by the eventual place finisher throughout, drifted off the rail in upper stretch, opened up
a clear advantage and was hard ridden to prevail. BODE'S TIPSY came out well to stalk the winner the entire trip, ducked in sharply outside the eighth pole
and was lucky to stay off the winner's heels, then closed determinedly up the rail to make it close late. MARITIME MISSION sat along the rail in mid pack,
closed up around the far turn and came off the inside down the lane to get up late between rivals for the show spot in a three way photo. SUPPLICATION
sat a perfect trip nestled in behind the front pair, those two sprinting away nearing the turn for home, then was outfinished for the third spot late. BREAKING
ALONE sat in mid pack and beside the eventual show finisher the entire trip, closed with that one down the lane and could not match his energy while in the
three or four path at the wire. GA GA GIZMO broke off stride and was bumped in a chain reaction at the start, at the back five to three wide around the first
turn, came with a nice run three to five wide on the far turn and fanned out into the eighth path turning for home, still closing while widest down the stretch.
GO TAKE CHARGE broke in bothering numerous rivals at the start, settled four to three wide in mid pack on the first turn, circled three wide on the far turn
to loom up at the quarter pole and hung late in the stretch while outside. TOURIST'S DREAM chased mid pack, was between rivals two to three wide at the
quarter pole but had no response down the lane. CALIFORNIA KEEN was squeezed back in a chain reaction at the start and at the back four to two wide
around the first turn, trailed into the far turn and could only pass a few stragglers down the stretch. AWESOME LAUNCH lost his path in a chain reaction
bumping incident at the start and was always near the back, mildly closing down the stretch. ABSTEMIOUS was bumped soundly at the start, four to three
wide around the first turn off the pace, circled three wide into contention on the far turn but stalled in the stretch. TWICE AS SMART steadied on heels
throughout the first turn, dropping back from that experience and never in the hunt.

Footnotes
MR. COOL led early, set a pressured pace, moved clear on the turn but was getting pressure approaching the stretch, shook clear again and held sway
under a drive. CELEBRATORY forced the issue on the backstretch, chased three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. ZIP LINE TO
HEAVEN forced the pace on the backstretch, chased four-wide through the turn then finished gamely but was outfinished for place. CANOLA WORLD
forced the early pace, chased along the rail through the turn, looked dangerous at the head of the stretch but lacked a late kick. MR WILL pressed the pace
from the outside on the backstretch, was hustled five then four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. SEA SCOUT drifted out a
bit and was steadied at the start, moved to the rail quickly and chased through the turn but evened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE WIDGET along the rail in mid pack and steadying through the first turn, got up the inside on the far turn before angling out to the three path
nearing the turn for home, drove by the leader at the sixteenth pole and was widening late. FEDERAL LAW was inside chasing a trio of pacesetters early on
the first turn, came off the inside to take on the pace survivor into the far turn, had a short lead at the top of the stretch and opened up but was headed at
the sixteenth pole, clearly second best. FORESTER'S DESTINY was steadied in behind a reversing runner late on the first turn, dropped back to the rail and
closed up the inside around the far turn to be in back of the leaders turning for home, his rally not good enough but up for the show spot late. FLORIDA
WON was between rivals for the lead into the first turn, steadied hard when taking back late on that turn, the rider apparently unhappy with his position,
causing confusion behind him, then angled out three to five wide on the far turn, fanned into the seven path turning for home and continuing to inch up wide
down the lane. COURTLY MANNER was inside two rivals pressed on the lead into the first turn, came out in front down the backside, was tackled by the
eventual place finisher by the quarter pole and battled that one to upper stretch, retreating from that point. FRANKIE BARONE was two to three wide in mid
pack around the first turn, stayed in range three to four wide on the far turn but had no response down the lane. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed all the
way to midway far turn, tipped out to the four path turning for home and rallied mildly. MY MARC ANDRE pressed the pace three wide around the first turn,
stalked the leader down the backside and faded around the far turn and stretch.

caught approaching the wire. PRICELESS WILL, in range, closed two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch then finished under a determined
drive. BOKERMIN showed speed then forced the pace, held a short lead on the turn, was passed in the final furlong and chased to the end. HAVE A
SOUPER DAY, in range, closed three to five-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. BETTER BOOGIE raced in mid pack but was rank and forced to steady
repeatedly on the backstretch and early turn, was hustled along but evened out in the stretch. DETROIT STEEL (IRE) stalked the pace, closed three and
four-wide late turn then evened out in the final 16th. COPINSAY held a short early lead, forced the pace from the rail on the turn, then flattened out mid
stretch. DIXIE GIANT stalked the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. LAKESIDE PARK got away slowly, raced from off the pace, closed three
to five-wide on the turn, drifted out at the top of the stretch and flattened out.
