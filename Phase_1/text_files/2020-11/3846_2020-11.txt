Footnotes
MANOLETE had early position along the rail, edged out two wide for room while commencing a rally approaching the lane, ran clear from the outside after
five furlongs and widened under urging. VICTORY ELEMENT went in the air at the break, hit the outside door leaving the gate, rallied the rail around the
turn, edged out through the lane and finished willingly. FOR THE ROAD opened a short lead soon after the break, edged clear before a half, raced two wide
around the turn then weakened. CRUSH IT swung four wide into the stretch while not far back then flattened out. CAMGO wasn't far back, steadied behind
the winner near the quarter pole then weakened. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST was bumped and carried out leaving the gate, lagged early then made a belated
run along the inside. FIRE DOWN BELOW ducked out sharply into GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST leaving the gate, raced wide and was outrun. JACK STRAIGHT
was wide and outrun. SAVAGERY chased the early leader to the stretch in the three path then stopped.

Footnotes
R RAJUN BULL stalked outside in the three path, moved to the front in early stretch, ran clear in midstretch and was under intermittent urging. ROYAL KAZ
broke sharply for the early lead, stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the stretch but couldn't stay with the winner. E T'S NIGHT RANGER
raced inside the top two into the turn, fell back, came out into the three path nearing the lane and continued evenly. SAINT MARCO improved position in the
four path around the turn and lacked a rally. EAGLES CRY advanced between horses on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn and tired.
MIZZEN MONEY stayed inside and failed to menace. LISTON was outrun. CHAIN BREAKER couldn't catch up after a slow break. LUPI was far back.
SPLIT THE PACK wasn't far back between horses to the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE SPEIGHTS took command at once, moved two wide to a clear lead into the turn, remained out from the rail and held stubbornly.
CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST pressed inside the winner to the turn, fell back, re-engaged along the rail in midstretch but wasn't enough. GRAY HAZE had
position in the three path but couldn't gain. BESS was sent up the inside early, fell back on the turn, angled out between rivals in the lane and gained late.
FIRST FOREVER raced two wide between rivals and lacked a strong closing. KAYLASAURUS lagged after a slow break then made up ground too late.
KATY THE CAT was slow early, came out into the three path on the turn and failed to menace. GUILTYWITHANEXCUSE improved position three wide on
the turn then weakened.
