Footnotes
STRAY ARROW set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and held safely under mild urging. WONTONTOMATO pressed the pace two across to the
turn, fell back, lacked a late rally and finished second best. MARILYN MONEYROLL was never far back, rallied five wide on the turn, closed steadily and got
up at the wire for show. GOING TO JACKSON moved up inside, awaited room into the turn, bid, hung late and was caught for third. FEISTY FOXEY veered
out at the start, raced wide and lacked a bid. EMILY WHO broke slowly, raced inside, was steadied on the turn and finished evenly. DIXIE CHIP had brief
speed only.

Footnotes
SPEEDY WILDCAT raced close to the pace, closed steadily and wore down BOSSY BABY to get up late and drew clear. BOSSY BABY was hustled along
to set the pace, drew off on the turn, led past the sixteenth pole and was outclosed. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was never far back, angled in on the turn, bid
inside, lacked the needed rally and settled for show. MISS LUBBOCK raced close to the pace outside, went five wide entering the stretch, came up empty
late and hung in the lane. BRANDISTYLED showed brief speed inside, fell back and lacked a bid. I'LL BE DIP was slow early, saved ground and raced
evenly. BAND OF GLORY pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. SPANKEY THUNDER bumped at the start, was steadied on the backstretch and
swung wide leaving the turn. MAX A MILLION RSS bumped at the start, was steadied, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
KONA COAST pressed the pace, challenged four wide on the turn, dueled for the lead and inched away to prove best. INDIAN H WHO set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel, was no match late and yielded grudgingly. CELESTIAL COWBOY pressed the pace, challenged three wide between
horses on the turn, leveled off in the drive and held safely for show. GETTY raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. PERCY FAWCETT
raced close to the pace outside, was carried out entering the stretch and lacked a bid. AWESOME K P stalked the pace, bid between horses on the turn to
threaten, gave way and dropped back. WE'RE JUST SAYIN broke slowly, was void of early speed and passed tiring rivals. HOWDY failed to threaten in an
even effort. BAD RABBIT was crowded at the start and outrun. IMA REAL DEAL raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, had
nothing left and dropped back steadily. MOOSEWOOD was outrun in an even effort. BELLAMY BLING was shut off and checked hard entering the first turn
and failed to contend.

effort. FOUR STAR SAINT was outrun in an even effort. ONE KEY set a pressured pace, responded to duel and stopped. DANDY DON WHO pressed the

Footnotes
ROCKY PROSPECT vied to mid stretch and drew off under urging. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER lagged early, bid six wide, found his best stride late and was
gaining ground. CHICO LADRONE was never far off the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, failed to rally and held for show. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING was
slow early, raced wide and finished well under mild encouragement. DE BILLY'S BOY showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back, angled out for
the drive and lacked a bid. ZAMBEZI FEVER vied to mid stretch and gave way. VICTORIA'S STORM was not a factor. FINAL JUDGMENT was never far
back while racing outside and outrun in an even effort. PULPITS PHANTOM failed to respond. FLY WITH PRIDE was hustled along, steadied along the
backstretch, fell back and gave way. PAPER ROSES led early, showed speed to the turn and stopped.
