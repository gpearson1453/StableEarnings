Footnotes
PALACE COUP led early, set a reserved pace, was all out through the stretch and held sway. GREEK GEEK stalked the pace, forced the issue on the far
turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. EASY WEEKEND was steadied at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide
on the far turn, rallied along the rail in the stretch and was gaining late. GREEN FLEET settled off the pace, circled three to five-wide on the far turn then
rallied from the outside. LION'S GOLDENHEART settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then finished gamely between foes. LION
KINGDOM was off slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. INSIDER TRADING led a step
slowly and stumbled several strides out, raced from off the pace, rode the rail but was never in contention. STOP THE HUMBUG, off slowly, raced in mid
pack, closed up to stalk the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. SWEEPIN HARD broke slowly, settled in mid pack, was
hustled three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

THE BOSS FACTOR sprinted to the front, opened up a huge lead down the backstretch and held in the stretch while tiring. COLEYVILLE was taken back
early while racing on the inside, began to improve on the far turn, split foes nearing the 1/4 pole before angling out then finished strongly.
SUITEDCONNECTED raced with the pack while two-wide then chased through the stretch. EPILOGUE hit the gate at the start, raced three-wide while with
the pick, was asked on the far turn then flattened out in the final furlong. DANI'S VICTORY raced between foes in the early stages, was three-wide on the
far turn then carried four-wide entering the stretch before finishing evenly. UNO CHAMP raced on the inside well behind the top two while leading the pack
then weakened on the far turn. TOLD IT ALL showed speed, tracked the pacesetter, raced well clear of the pack, was asked for more on the far turn then
came up empty. LORD OF LEGENDS hopped at the start, trailed the field, raced four-wide into the far turn and was never a threat.

TRUFFLE KING raced in mid pack, was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch then closed with a surge but
missed. TAPE TO TAPE set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn, was headed in mid stretch and chased to the end. HIATUS stalked the pace in hand,

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL chased the two leaders while three to two wide around the turn, dipped in to get inside that pair in upper stretch, drove by the pace
survivor nearing the sixteenth pole and sprinted clear in the final seventy yards. FOREST SURVIVOR won the break and cleared off from two pace rivals
early, was engaged midway on the turn by a rival, shook that one off by upper stretch but drifted off the fence in doing so, leaving room for the winner to fly
up inside, no match for that one but holding the place spot late. CANDY OVERLOAD off the pace early, came between rivals into mid pack on the turn,
angled out turning for home and found his best stride inside the sixteenth pole, and another gear in the final seventy yards closing best of all. ALL
CANADIAN broke in at the start but recovered to stalk the early leader, bid for the front midway on the turn and was head bobbing for the lead turning for
home but tired in the final furlong. AVOMAN sat on the rail in mid pack, steadied when trying to advance between rivals on the turn, closing mildly off the rail
down the lane. DRAGON'S BREW was off the pace down the backside, came three to four wide circling on the turn to look dangerous but couldn't sustain
his bid and levelled off in the final eighth. SOUPER CLASSY off the pace early, hustled three to five wide on the turn but was laying in down the lane and
couldn't get into a contending position. DE ONLY SOLUTION broke out and off stride at the start, trailed the field throughout and passed a tired foe late.
BLIND TRUST lost his path at the start, rushed up inside the two leaders, settled in to chase that pair but faded from midway on the turn to the wire.

Footnotes
STRIKING MOON raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn, rallied outside and was up late under a drive. SANDY BAY stalked the pace, chased
two-wide late turn, bid upper stretch, took command but was passed in the late stages. RED HIERARCHY, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the
turn then rallied gamely. TOWN CRUISE bumped with STORMY SOUL at the outset, pressed the pace to the turn, stalked from the rail, was blocked at the
top of the stretch, angled out mid stretch and finished gamely. ELEKTRONIC set a pressured pace, was joined upper stretch and gave way quickly.
CHAMPIT hit the gate and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. WHEAT KING, pinched
back at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied inside. STORMY
SOUL bumped with TOWN CRUISE and lost his path at the start, came three and four-wide through the turn but evened out in the final furlong. RED
STORM RISEN hopped out of the gate, raced in mid pack, closed five-wide on the turn but had no response in the stretch. PRINCE OF THIEVES raced in
mid pack, came four-wide through the turn and lacked a rally. SYCAMORE RUN broke outward, settled in mid pack, dropped back on the turn and offered
no closing response.

four to six-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. SUIGU STAR bumped with BIG BOY BENNY and POOL SIDE leaving the gate, settled in

three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch. GRAPES raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the final turn but lacked a rally.
