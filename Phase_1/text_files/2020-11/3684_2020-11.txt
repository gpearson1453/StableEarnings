STEEL SHOT was unhurried while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, moved with momentum five wide near the
eighth pole then edged up late. OFF SIXES was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and rallied
through mid-track. WESTWOOD PROUD was in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane while four wide, was on nearly
even terms for the lead with an eighth to go then was outfinished by the top two. POLO ART set the pace on a clear lead through the turn then gave way
when headed while straightening into the lane. OLD TIMER'S DAY chased the pace while along the inside into the lane then faltered. HAT IN THE RING
was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. FEELING IT chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn and into the lane then
faded. GETTIN EVEN lost ground while saving ground through the turn.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED vied for the lead along while near the inside, shook clear in late turn, widened into the lane then extended the advantage when put
under a drive outside the eighth pole. CABOT TRAIL chased the dueling rivals into the turn while in the three path, bid three wide into the lane to get nearest
the winner then could not gain further while clear for the place spot. WAR ACT chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn, bid four wide
into the lane while looking like a serious contender then was weakening late and just saved the show spot. JAMMING CAMERON vied for the lead with the
winner through the turn then gave way in late turn. CALL WEST raced in the three or four path through the turn and never was a factor. DONTNEEDANAME
faded along the inside.

Footnotes
DOWN HOME KITTEN stalked the pacesetters from the four then the three path, was asked for more in late turn, gained the lead straightening in the lane
and drew away while being kept to the task. CHANGING LANES was along the inside into the backstretch, was shuffled back into the far turn, continued
near the inside through the turn then chased the winner home while getting up for the place spot. BOO REID set the pace from the two path through late
turn, was collared by the winner into the lane, yielded to that one but kept on losing the place spot late. COLONEL MOON was in the two or three path into
the far turn and weakened. SUGAR DOG FOX was well back while in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and passed
tired ones. IRISH CHARLIE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn and was empty approaching the five-sixteenths pole. BOOGIE MAN set the early
pace into the backstretch, chased the pace into the far turn while saving ground then was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
NIECE JACKIE DAVIS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, remained three wide inside the three-sixteenths
pole, cleared inside the eighth pole and drew clear. TROPHY DOLL (IRE) vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, yielded to the top one just
inside the eighth pole but kept on to be clear for the place spot. LOVE BROKE THRU was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, angled into the
four or five path and moved up for the show spot. GIRO KATE tracked the pacesetters through the turn from the two path, dropped to the rail nearing the
eighth pole and lacked a closing bid. LUCY TOO vied for the lead two wide and in the three path through the turn, came into the lane as a contender and
tired. SHAPE OF YOU was steadied soon after the start, moved up to contend four wide into the far turn, continued in the three path into the lane and tired.
COLONIAL JILL was never a factor while racing near the inside. BENTEN was gunned out of the gate to lead early, continued on the pace into the far turn
then was suddenly done nearing mid-turn and was eventually eased to the wire and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN DID
NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
CARMELLA KEY was unhurried while in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swept past the leaders near
the quarter pole and quickly cleared, widened to the eighth pole then was kept to the task to the end. DONTYOUREMEMBER stalked the leaders three wide
into the far turn, continued in the three path in late turn, was no match for the winner into the lane then dueled through the lane and was all out for place.
SYDNEY'S TREASURE was off awkwardly and lost a couple of lengths to the field, raced in the back into the far turn while in the three or four path, came
into the lane from mid-track and was gaining through the final eighth and just nabbed the show spot. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN vied for the early lead then
settled to press the pace through mid-turn, continued to duel for the place spot through the lane and could not keep up late. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL set the
pace while under pressure into the far turn, cleared in late turn then gave way entering the lane. BIRDIE BLUE saved ground through the turn when never
far back then steadily faded through the lane.
