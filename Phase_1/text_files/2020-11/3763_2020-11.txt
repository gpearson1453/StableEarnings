Footnotes
COMPASS POINT was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with momentum, caught the leader soon after the eighth
pole, quickly widened and geared down the last fifty yards. BLAZEN JUSTICE stalked the pacesetter while in the two path , was quickly passed by the
winner into the lane, kept on to run down the previous pacesetter late to regain the place spot. VICE COP hustled to the lead from the outset, set the pace
into the lane the faltered approaching the sixteenth pole. RILEY RICH was never a serious threat while racing in the five to the four path through the turn.
CEE DEE chased the pace from the three to the two path into mid-turn then faded through the lane. GUARD never a factor while in the two path through the
turn. ALTERED never made an impact while racing near the inside. SKY JUDGE was outrun while along the inside.

Footnotes
GOLD INCLUDED raced in mid-pack while in the three path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, swung into the lane from the five path, caught the
leader well outside the eighth pole then drove clear. SPECIAL BEACH was in the two path through the turn when unhurried, bid into the lane, was no match
for the winner then settled for being second best. EXCEBLADES was in the five to the four path through the first turn, raced in the two path through the far
turn when in mid-pack, gained momentum through the lane and moved up for the show spot. NARROWS BRIDGE chased the pacesetter through the far
turn, looked to be a serious threat into the lane then weakened. MORE COWBELL came in toward the rail entering the first turn, raced in the two path while
in mid-pack, bid into the lane from the two path, was shut off near the sixteenth pole when another stepped into her path and lost all serious chance.
SPRING FROST was in the four path through the turns, bid near the three-eighths pole to be a contender then faltered entering the lane. THE ROVING
KIND vied for the lead two wide through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. MY WYNTER ECHO was never a factor while along the inside
through the far turn. MARINA NIGHT chased the pace while near the inside and was done near the three-eighths pole. NARIZ CANELA was checked
sharply and taken up when put in tight entering the first turn, raced far back along the inside. PRINCESS AVRIL vied for the lead along the inside into the far
turn and was empty entering the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE INTO THE FIRST TURN RESULTED IN #3 MORE
COWBELL BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM 5TH AND PLACED 10TH .
