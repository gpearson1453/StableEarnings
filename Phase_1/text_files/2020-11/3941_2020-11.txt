Footnotes
MAKATI PHIL showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, poked a head in front outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch, inched clear under a right-handed whip into the final furlong and proved best under strong
urging. G DON'T KNOW was well spotted just off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while still on
his inside lead until inside the furlong marker, switched to the proper lead at that point and finished with good courage for the place. IMA SUNNY SONG was
forwardly placed on the outside, went four wide under urging on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and
was out-kicked while able to get the show. RUN AWAY SON came out at the start then was hustled, raced just off the pace, chased inside on the turn,
swung three wide into the stretch, drifted out significantly into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. SHAKIN SILVER broke a bit slow then was taken
up, moved up under urging between horses, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under an all out drive and lacked the needed
response. WICKED ALEX showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed outside the
quarter-pole, came under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. GREY SLOAN was unsettled at the start and broke slow,
spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back in the field, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
MULETRAIN broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the rail at the quarter-pole and was no factor.
MISTA VALENTINE was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved further out around the
three-sixteenths and also failed to threaten. BESTBANGFORYABUCK settled near the middle of the field, dropped back while three wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. R AND R STAR broke very slow, went around the turn in the two path and never reached
contention. ASHLEYS BISCUIT settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

PALVERA came away in good order, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied near the rail on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, fought off the
challenge of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU broke a step slow, moved up then
was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong, drew even with that foe into the final
sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead about seventy yards from the wire and was denied while clear for the place. BINDING AGREEMENT dropped
back passing the trees on the pan-camera view while in tight after the start, moved out then was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and

four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TACTICAL PRIORITY broke in front then was hustled, dropped off the pace while taking a few slightly
awkward strides against the rail early, raced just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole and came up empty. COMMANDER
SCOTT veered out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.

TAKE THAT FOR DATA broke a step slow, was reserved on the outside, rounded the far turn in the four path while patiently ridden, was let out a bit coming
to the quarter-pole, advanced under a hand ride to make an outside bid in upper stretch, took a slim advantage into the final furlong, was very confidently
ridden under a very mild hand ride into the final sixteenth, drifted in some at that point then was eased up while best late. MUCHO MACHO BETS went two
to three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased two then three wide on the far turn, took the lead under a drive into upper stretch, lost
the advantage to the winner into the final furlong, battled with that foe while dropping to the rail into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear
for the place. KING OF CANDY was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace on the inside, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened. SHIRL'S READY saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along while
inside to the two path on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CRYPTO BRAVE broke very alertly then quickly sprinted clear, dictated terms while inside through the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and drew
off under strong urging. GILDED APPLE was urged along on the far outside, went four then five wide on the turn, chased the winner into upper stretch,
drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and narrowly earned the place. GALAXY STAR broke out at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back while
skimming the rail leaving the backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, moved
out from behind horses at the three-sixteenths, drifted in late and just missed the place while clear for the show. CUSTOM GULCH settled off the pace, was
roused while three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. MY GIRL EM settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two
path and failed to threaten. ST MARIA broke out at the start, settled towards the rear under some urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. LIL BAD LIL BOUJEE was urged along towards the front, went three wide while ridden along on the turn and came up empty.
DIVIDED was urged along in second position, raced inside to the two path while ridden along on the turn and also came up empty. GO MY JULIET was
ridden along well back in the field, rounded the turn in the two path and showed little. CLOCKED IN TYME broke a bit slow, settled off the pace while
moving in, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and failed to respond. A LITTLE GUILTY broke a step
slow then was taken up, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and showed little. GREEDY GAL X LEE settled on the outside,
was roused while four wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

MY FRIEND FLAVIN was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, rallied through a sizable opening at the quarter-pole, made a bid
in upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. DOUBLE BARREL MAN was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground
on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, rallied into the final furlong and closed well but missed
while able to get the place. MY WISE CAT was hustled to the lead, contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead in upper
stretch, battled on into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to get the show. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY settled towards the rear, raced inside to the
two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then dropped in some while roused, pursued the vanguard into the final furlong and finished willingly
for the last spot in the superfecta. CABO'S RUMOR was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch,
advanced into a good striking position on the far outside but flattened out in the final furlong. BIG BELLA BROWN tracked the pace on the outside then four
wide on the turn, ranged up at the five-sixteenths, made a bid into the stretch, led past the three-sixteenths, battled outside of two foes into the final furlong
and was out-kicked. PRIZELESS settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. FREE INDEED was urged along at the rear, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to three wide and failed to threaten.
KEYS TO THE PALACE was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GHOSTLIGHTER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five then four wide on the far turn, rallied to the lead in
upper stretch, shook off two foes under a left-handed whip into the final sixteenth and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. BENIAH went
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted out over heels at the five-sixteenths then was roused,
came under a drive into upper stretch, angled out into the final furlong and finished fast but missed while clear for the place. MCDOWELL saved ground
while tugging at the bit on the first turn, was keen under restraint onto the backstretch, established a good position while settling more kindly, advanced
along the rail to take the lead early on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, turned into the stretch under the whip, lost the advantage at the
three-sixteenths and was outfinished but narrowly earned the show. PALAZZI went five then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer
late on the backstretch then bumped with a foe, made a bid while four then three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, battled into the
final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the show. HOLD TIGHT went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three
to four wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. STORY OF THE NIGHT went four wide on the first turn,
settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn then shifted four wide, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. MR. BRUTUS saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path and was no
factor. LOYAL LOUIE moved in while showing speed, disputed the pace on the inside, dropped back onto the backstretch then moved out, tracked the pace
from that point, bumped with a foe at the seven-sixteenths, came up empty on the far turn and retreated. B W P SPECIAL went four then three wide on the
first turn, moved clear onto the backstretch, was headed in the two path early on the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
COHERE disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch, drifted out a bit late and gamely
prevailed. READY FOR LOVE bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner while still on his inside lead to the sixteenth-pole, switched to the proper lead at that point, fought hard while
being carried out a touch late and was denied while well clear for the place. GUILTY LOVER was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn
then moved to the two path, shifted three wide later on that bend, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best
of the rest. GALLANT STAR was reluctant to load, raced on the outside while urged along, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
tired. ADIEU LE CHAT was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, drifted out near the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. MARTINIZED broke a step slow, raced towards the rear, steadied in traffic at the half-mile pole then bumped with a
rival, went three wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. CUSTOM BOBBY'S dropped well off the pace, started the turn in
the two path then shifted four wide and was no factor. PERFECTURE was away alertly, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on
the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and capitulated. ALIGNED INTEREST broke a bit slow, raced well back in the field, tossed his head while rank
near the half-mile pole then checked, bumped with a foe outside the seven-sixteenths then lost action badly, saved ground on the turn and never reached
contention. PEYTONWEGOTDONUTS was urged along towards the rear, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and failed to
respond. WIDDLE ZEE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was carried nine wide into the stretch
then drifted in and also failed to respond. VOLITION raced just off the pace, tugged hard at the bit while keen behind horses from the half-mile pole to the
three-eighths pole, steadied in the two path at that point, shifted four wide into the stretch and faltered.
