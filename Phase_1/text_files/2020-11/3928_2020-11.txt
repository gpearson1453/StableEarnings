Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS broke outward, quickly cleared the field, set an unchallenged pace while saving ground through the turn, was hand urged in upper
stretch, felt two strikes of the crop midstretch, and was allowed to cruise home in the final sixteenth. MARK OF THE Z chased midpack, saved ground
through the turn, and kept on two wide in the lane to prove best of the rest. YOU'RE KILLIN ME dropped his head at the start and hopped out of the gate,
settled at the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, came into the lane four wide, kept on mildly and got up for show late. FOLLOW THE SIGNS was in
tight between horses in the opening strides, chased the leading pair down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, chased three wide in the lane
and weakened between horses in the final furlong. SHANGHAI POINT tracked well off the leader down the backstretch, was outpaced by him while racing in
the three path on the turn, and faded inside in the lane. DURANGO KID settled in the rear pair, pulled up from near the seven sixteenths, and was vanned
off.

Footnotes
LINE OF DENHAMS was placed on the lead, took token pressure from DISTINCT THUNDER down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path on the
turn, and pulled away under a drive in the lane. DOUBLE ONE SHOT was bumped by SILVER HIT in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair outside of
BERACUDA HEART, continued to track three deep on the turn, proved no match for LINE OF DENHAMS into the lane, chased on best of the rest and
narrowly held the place. ROCKET RIDE settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, was taken six wide into the lane, got carried even further
out as A SHEEN CAT drifted out midstretch, showed good belated interest but narrowly missed the place. A SHEEN CAT chased midpack well off the
inside, continued midfield in the four to five path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane, drifted out midstretch, and was outfinished. BERACUDA
HEART tracked the leading pair inside of DOUBLE ONE SHOT, continued in the three path on the turn with the tracking flight, proved no match for the
pacesetter into the lane, and flattened out in the final furlong. POCHO'S DREAM settled two wide in the rear pair down the backstretch, raced in the three
path near the rear on the turn, and rallied mildly three and then two wide in the lane. B'S TURNING POINT broke slowly, settled in the rear pair, trailed in the
four path on the turn, was taken five wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. SILVER HIT broke outward, settled midpack, chased in the two to three
path on the turn, went to a drive inside into the lane, and weakened. DISTINCT THUNDER attended the early pace outside of LINE OF DENHAMS, began
to weaken between horses on the turn and continued to fade two wide in the lane.

Footnotes
BODEMAX tracked the leader down the backstretch, engaged two wide into the turn, vied around the bend, cleared in upper stretch and kept command
under a drive. STOLEN GLANCE tracked the leading pair inside of NURSE KATIE, continued to track in range in the two path on the turn, was taken three
wide to upper stretch under a drive, proved no match for the winner, but got up for the place inside the sixteenth mark. DRIVE LINE tracked three wide, bid
three wide past the seven sixteenths, continued in range three wide to the lane, proved no match for the winner, and was outfinished for place. THE MORE I
BURN settled in second last, raced between horses in the rear flight while three wide on the turn, came three wide in the lane, and rallied mildly to prove
best of the rest. MIDNIGHT FROST settled toward the rear, saved ground through the turn, and passed tiring horses in the lane. NURSE KATIE was
reluctant to load, tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, lost ground in the four path on the turn, and had no kick between horses in the
lane. DANCING DIAMOND was sent for speed, vied inside of BODEMAX on the turn, proved no match into the lane and weakened inside. KARMA REIGNS
veered out in the opening strides, settled at the rear, raced four wide in the rear flight on the turn and into the lane, drifted further out in upper stretch, and
offered no rally. TWO MORE TIMES settled outside of MIDNIGHT FROST, raced two wide in the rear flight on the turn, and came up empty. ZIP ATTACK
BABY chased midpack, raced in the two to three path on the turn, and faded in the lane despite being urged to the wire.

Footnotes
EASTER MUSIC ducked inward in the opening strides, nonetheless cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn, drew further clear
in the lane under a drive, and held sway. MIND TRAPPE settled midpack inside of HIGH HERO, raced at the inside of the chasing flight on the turn, was
driven inside in upper stretch, gained with good interest but could not get to the pacesetter. DEANO broke sharply but settled back to chase inside, saved
ground through the turn, was swung four wide and driven into upper stretch, chased on, proved no match for the top two but narrowly held the show.
OFFLEE FUN settled near the rear, raced in the three path on the turn, rallied when driven inside from upper stretch, and narrowly missed the show. HIGH
HERO settled midpack outside of MIND TRAPPE, raced in the six path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and kept on mildly to prove best of the
rest. COUNTRY COOL settled at the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, was urged six wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. ROMEO O ROMEO
tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch and on the turn, went to a drive between horses into the lane, and weakened. POWER CRY chased
midpack down the backstretch, continued between horses in the four path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, and came up empty. GREELEYS ICE
tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for EASTER MUSIC, and
faded in the final furlong. PERFECT PIRATE settled near the rear outside of OFFLEE FUN, raced in the seven path on the turn, came seven wide into the
lane, and offered no rally.

cleared to midstretch, separated from the rest of the field in tandem with ROAD GAME in the final furlong, and held sway. ROAD GAME broke inward and
bumped BUMPTYBUMPBUMP in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the tracking flight, tracked in the three path on the turn, chased STRIKING
HEIR down the lain, separated from the rest of the field along with that foe in the final furlong, but could not get past. W W RUSSIAN GOLD chased outside
of HAUNTED MESA, was pushed along near the seven sixteenths, rallied between horses on the turn, stayed on between horses in the lane, and proved
best of the rest. B SALTY tracked the pace between horses down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, proved no
match for STRIKING HEIR into the lane, chased on but was outkicked for the show. MAXIMUS IMAGE was slow into stride, settled in the rear flight, began
to improve between horses through the turn, came four wide into the lane, and kept on while drifting out late. ANDREWS BOOGIE settled toward the rear
between horses, raced four wide on the turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, kept on, and was forced out late when

the bend, came into the lane inside, and improved mildly inside. HAUNTED MESA raced at the inside of the chasing flight early, continued in the two path
on the turn, and weakened two wide in the lane. AZUSA ST. cleared to the early lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was engaged by STRIKING
