NOVA antsy in the gate prior to the start of the race, broke well and led a contested pace three wide early, ended up two wide going into the turn and into
the stretch, responded well to urging and proved best. FANCY TERRACE pressed leader along the inside, held rail position through the backstretch and into
the turn, pressed leader through the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in stretch and just held second late. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE stalked leaders two
wide on the backstretch, launched bid two wide midway through the turn and kept on in the stretch rallying and just missed second. HYDROSTATIC vied for
lead early, had to steady due to being in tight approaching the two furlong mark, entered turn near rail and finished up willingly in between foes in the
stretch. MELCHIOR pressed leader three wide on a contested pace, entered turn three wide and into the stretch in the four path, in range when making bid
and outfinished in deep stretch under steady urging. NUTTY SIERRA stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside
throughout and never threatened.

Footnotes
SON OF A QUEEN pressed pace outside of leader on the backstretch, overtook leader midway through the turn and shook free entering the stretch, kept to
task in the stretch and safely held. EDDIE EAGLE hit gate and came out slow, chased leaders along the inside, entered turn along the inside, tipped out late
in the turn and responded to urging to be a clear second. EVENING REWARD off bit slow at the start and lost his path, tracked leader two wide on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide and entered stretch in the three path and rallied up for third in deep stretch. RAINDANCE RULES led along the inside on
the backstretch, maintained lead entering the turn and overtaken by outside pressing rival midway through the turn and lacked need response in the lane to
maintain position. P TOWN TITAN stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and never launched a bid in the stretch.
