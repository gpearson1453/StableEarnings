Footnotes
CHILL HAZE set a clear pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under left-handed urging. NIMBLE BEAST raced off the
early pace, advanced three wide around the turn and narrowed the gap late without seriously threatening the winner. MAKINALEGACY lacked early speed,
moved up three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. BOMOSEEN stumbled at the start and bumped
YEUDIEL but was still away quickly, chased the pace two wide and faded after a half. SOLE SEEKER was devoid of speed, raced two wide and passed
tiring rivals. CONSILIUM failed to menace while racing four wide. DREAM WILLCOME had early speed inside and steadily faded. WICKYDIDIT had brief
speed two wide. YEUDIEL was bumped at the start, raced four wide in midpack and was through after a half.

Footnotes
U S S LOIS was allowed to settle early, ranged up to join the leaders four wide approaching the stretch, edged past CAMELLIA GAL from outside through
the furlong grounds, and prevailed all out. CAMELLIA GAL raced three wide throughout, challenged for command after six furlongs, fought inside the winner
through the lane and yielded grudgingly. LOOKN FINE AS WINE moved inside on the first turn, shifted to the two-path in the stretch and rallied mildly.
MOONLIGHT MISS was reserved inside behind the leaders to the far turn, and came up empty when roused. MISS WROTE set the pace inside, got
overhauled approaching the quarter-pole, and gave way. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE prompted MISS WROTE from outside, bid briefly on the far turn, and
tired in the drive. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED raced four wide around the far turn, and posed no threat. SASSY GIDGET lagged well behind three wide to the
stretch, and was eased up in the late stages.

FAST FRACTION prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, took the lead two deep near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted
out under left-handed urging nearing the sixteenth pole, lightly brushed TWILIGHT GALAXY, straightened out and held firm. TWILIGHT GALAXY tracked
the pace from the rail for five furlongs, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, rallied outside, was lightly brushed nearing the sixteenth pole and
could not get to the winner. AUBURN reared at the start and spotted the field ten lengths, advanced inside around the first turn, moved up two wide around
the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole and flattened out a bit late. NATIONALIST stalked the pace four wide
early, had dead aim three wide around the far turn. bid between rivals in upper stretch but came up empty in the final furlong. RANDIABBY set the pace in
the two path around the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn, was collared near the three-eighths pole, fought on to upper stretch then tired inside.
AMBER PRINCESS was caught five wide between foes rounding the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn and retreated inside. LA VIEXA chased the
pace six wide around the first turn and was through after a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION

Footnotes
DIVINE MARTHA grabbed the lead after the start, widened around the turn near the two-path, and stayed well clear while drifting out near the
sixteenth-pole. YOU'RE THE BEST raced three wide around the turn, could not menace the winner and was best of the others. FEARLESS GIRL saved
ground throughout, and lacked the needed closing bid. K'S RUNNING FREE bumped with DIALIN SOME SASS at the start, raced two to three wide around
the turn, and did not threaten. ROUGH STUFF pursued the winner from outside early, and gave way on the turn. DIALIN SOME SASS bumped with K'S
RUNNING FREE at the start, and was outrun three to four wide.

Footnotes
PELUCHIN CHIN was steadied at the start, made progress down the backstretch, angled in to advance along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide near
the five-sixteenths, bid outside, drew clear leaving the eighth pole, angled in and lasted under a steady drive. TRUE IDENTITY raced off the pace two wide,
angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and was gaining quickly late. SILVER DOLLAR CITY set a clear pace along the rail, was collared leaving the
eighth pole and held third. SIDARTH hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace and improved position in the lane. NONA RAC broke out and bumped
ALTMAN, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. ALTMAN was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. MORNING TRIAL
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.
NEVERENOUGHCOCO was shut off at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. PAINTED RAGS was outrun inside. HIGHLY NOTED had early
speed two wide and stopped after a half. FIREY GOLD trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SIESTA MOON tracked behind the leaders for nearly a half-mile, shifted out to the three-path to go after STARSHIP TAXI turning for home, wrested
command outside that rival coming to the eighth-pole and drew off under pressure. PRICEY VICTORY pursued STARSHIP TAXI three to four wide for a
half-mile, stayed on his left lead through the lane and ran on to get the place. TRIBUTE FLAG was outrun early, put in a run along the rail leaving the
quarter-pole, but flattened out through the last eighth of a mile. STARSHIP TAXI set the pace in the two-path, could not handle SIESTA MOON through
upper stretch and gave way. THE SPIDER raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. AT THE BEACH was no factor two wide.
VENERATE never reached contention three to four wide. MONEY HOUSE leapt at the start and came down still in the stall with his head draped over the
right side of it, eventually exited the gate and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

FOOLISH HEART set the pace along the rail, dug inside of HARA when that foe put a head in front near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside from there to
the wire and tied the head bob in a game effort. HARA pressed the pace two wide, took a short lead near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled two wide from
there to the wire and tied the head bob. FLASH TOWN raced off the duel in the two path, tipped three wide in upper stretch and rallied. QUEEN DOMINA
trailed in the three path.

WENT WEST set a pressured pace for a half-mile, spurted away on the rail through upper stretch, and had enough to hang on late. FROSTED GRACE
tracked behind the leaders inside to the turn, moved out getting ridden along three wide past the three-eighths, had the winner get away from him into the
stretch, stayed on task remaining on his left lead and was closing in at the wire outside. LUSITANO pressed WENT WEST from outside for a half, got
shaken off into the lane, and ran on gamely between horses to the finish. LORD BARNA broke a step slowly, and was outrun inside. LIKE YOU stayed in
range early, then faded..

FREE TO FLY dueled outside of PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL in the three path around the first turn, took the lead two wide nearing the quarter pole, vied outside
to midstretch and drove clear in the final furlong. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL dueled inside of the winner while racing in the two path around the first turn, hugged
the rail rounding the far turn, battled on to midstretch and was clearly second best late. VALLEY DATE was in tight at the start, raced well back inside,
moved closer two wide around the far turn and rallied between foes to gain the show in deep stretch. YAKO stalked the top two from the inside, angled three
wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. BAHAMA KITTEN raced off the pace two wide early, saved ground around
the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced. GRAN ETIQUETA chased the duelers three wide and tired nearing the lane.
