Footnotes
TOO MUCH HEAVEN steadied from inside early, switch outside the leader, chased two wide to the stretch, drew alongside the leader at the sixteenth pole
and drove past. A G INDY sped to the front and angled to the rail, traveled clear to the eighth pole, challenged from outside with a sixteenth to go and was
outfinished by the winner. COLOMBIAN GOLD in range early, went two then three wide into the stretch and finished well outside the top pair. WHITE
VELVET steadied off heels early, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch, steered out further in the lane, rallied and closed well four deep at the wire.
SABINOS PRIDE steadied off heels early, stalked the pace from inside, looked to have run late but lacked room behind the top pair inside the sixteenth
pole. LOUD LOUD MUSIC went three then two wide around the first turn, tracked in the two path to the stretch and failed to rally. STAR OF AFRICA raced
outside a rival off the pace, advanced three to four wide around the second turn and lacked further response in the lane. LADY NOGUEZ traveled near the
back of the pack from inside, steadied briefly near the nine-sixteenths pole, took the second turn three to four wide and was always outrun.

Footnotes
OLE SILVER broke out, stalked off the rail, raced three deep into the turn then outside a rival, ranged up three wide into the stretch, collared the leader at
the eighth pole and bested ELGOFRANCO in the final furlong. ELGOFRANCO away quickly in the beginning, stalked the top pair from inside, ranged up
two wide around the turn, challenged between foes in the lane then fought with OLE SILVER and could not match the winner in the late stages. CAPITAL
HEAT forced out and had the rider lose the right-iron at the start, still managed to clear the field and set the pace to the turn, rider finally regained her iron at
the five-sixteenths pole and continued to show the way around the bend, headed by a pair of rivals at the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong.
LITTLE MISS BELLE dropped back early, angled out into the stretch and passed a pair of rivals. CHEERFUL CHARM tracked two to three wide around the
turn and failed to rally. WIN LIKE COACH P broke out, showed early speed and raced inside the leader then chased that foe leaving the backstretch, raced
between foes at the three-eighths pole then lost ground around the bend and had little left for the drive. FIERCE KITTY stumbled leaving the gate, chased
off the rail, took the turn four wide and also had nothing left for the stretch run.

SEEKING REFUGE bumped from the outside at the start, stalked from between runners, steered out four wide in the stretch, put in a late bid outside the
runner-up and reeled in foe under urging. HONOS MAN stalked three wide and outside a rival, bid three deep at the quarter pole, took a short lead in upper
stretch, cleared inside the furlong pole, challenged by the winner in deep stretch and could not hold. TURN THE SWITCH pinballed and steadied at the
start, tucked inside early, continued along the fence then tipped out into the two path near the quarter pole, finished well in the lane and edged GO TIME for
the show. GO TIME broke in and bumped rival at the start then steadied off the heels of TEJON, trailed the field early, went outside a rival on the second
turn, came three wide into the stretch and missed the show honors. MR RIGHT NOW sped to the front, led along the inside, headed by a pair of rivals at the
quarter pole, fought back to the eighth pole and weakened late. BIG CITY BANE tracked three wide then moved out into the four path entering the stretch
and never threatened. TEJON broke in, forwardly placed early on two wide, bid between at the quarter pole and gave way in the final furlong. SILENT
MUSKETIER stumbled leaving the gate, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, came off the rail in the lane and proved no menace.

the lead from inside, dueled with rival into and down the lane and yielded late. SILK FROM HEAVEN settled off the pace while off the inside, swung out into

THREEARCHBAYMAFIA had early speed three deep, duel with LUCKY RYAN SEVEN leaving the turn and into the stretch, kicked clear at the eighth pole
and was kept to task to the wire. FOLLOW THE LUTE broke out and got brushed by inside rival leaving the gate, chased off the rail, moved further off the
inside and bumped with rival near the seven-sixteenths pole, went between runners at the three-eighths, ranged up four wide nearing the stretch, chased
outside the leader through the lane, could not summon the needed late kick but proved second best. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN vied between runners into and
around the turn, dueled two wide into the lane and weakened in the final furlong. WILD CAT CANYON attended the pace four deep on the backstretch,
chased four wide then three wide into the lane, was in range in upper stretch but flattened out in the furlong grounds. TWIRLING DERBY tracked outside a
rival, bumped with that foe near the seven-sixteenths pole, raced three deep into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FLOYD
MONEYMAKER broke out and brushed rival, raced off the pace, entered the lane two wide and was never a factor. ACTING CAT vied for the lead from
inside to the five-sixteenths pole and faded. EL MAS PODEROSO lacked early speed and was always outrun.

ON MARS raced two wide and outside a rival on the first turn, went outside a pair of foes at the half-mile pole, closed in two wide into the lane, collared foe
mid-stretch and drew clear. VELVET QUEEN away quickly and sped to the front, opened up a large lead around the first turn and into the backstretch,
continued well clear into the far turn, held a diminished lead into the drive, caught by the winner mid-stretch and held the place. SHANGHAI TRUFFLES
traveled along the inside then angled out in the drive and finished willingly for the show honors. PAID INFORMANT raced outside a rival early, traveled
between foes at the half-mile marker, dropped back between foes around the second turn, then showed some response to urging and whittle the gap late.
HERMAPHRODITE (FR) raced along the inside then moved off the rail on the backstretch, angled four wide into the lane and never rallied. ALL QUALITY
settled off the pace, closed in along the inside around the second turn, then weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
RED FLAG vied four deep to the turn, kicked clear approaching the quarter pole and powered away under hand urging. UNCLE BOOGIE raced far off the
pace, entered the stretch four wide, came with a late run and bested the rest. AMBIVALENT angled out some early, well placed behind the speedy quartet
up the backstretch, altered around foe past the three-eighths pole, chased the winner around the turn and through the lane and got outfinished for the place.
SPIELBERG vied for the lead between rivals up the backstretch, was outpaced to the five-sixteenths pole, chased two to three wide into the drive and
stayed on for a minor award. WESTON vied for the lead from inside, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and
tired. COASTAL KID vied three deep to the turn, stumbled between runners past the three-eighths pole and dropped back, then weakened in the stretch.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO COULD NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF WHY COASTAL KID STUMBLED
PAST THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MAGICAL THOUGHT set the pace outside a rival, cleared that one into the turn, angled to the inside, challenged in the final furlong and held gamely.
VELVET shifted in and bumped foe at the start, chased inside then two wide, exited the bend three wide, rallied outside the top pair but could not get by the
winner. FREEDOM FLYER chased off the rail, two wide around the turn, ranged up outside the leader in the lane but lacked the needed late punch. EVOO
tracked off the inside or outside a rival, checked past the three-eighths pole, exited the turn three wide and kept on for a minor award. AMERICAN
HEIGHTS stalked four wide around the turn and weakened. INVESTMENT GRADE shifted in at the start, pressed the pace from inside, steadied near the
three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch and flattened. PHILLY LISHES settled off the pace, went four wide around the turn and proved no
menace. JUDY WITH GRACE traveled between runners at the rear of the field, bumped with inside rival past the five-sixteenths pole, and never made an
impact. MADE IN KAROO raced three deep up the backstretch, through the turn, and into the stretch and failed to respond when asked. BATHORY bumped
at the start, checked early down along the inside, was in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole, bumped outside rival at the five-sixteenths, and had little left for
the drive.
