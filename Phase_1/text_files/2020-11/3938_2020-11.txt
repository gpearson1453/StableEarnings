Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PENNY broke outwards and forced a foe into another, stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turn, awaited racing room
turning for home before surging between a narrow gap three wide between horses passing the quarter pole, produced a strong kick to bid inside of INJECT
passing the furlong pole, and finished with good energy to win going away. INJECT stalked two wide early on, inched forward three wide to bid for the lead
at the five sixteenths pole, swept past inner foes clearing that marker, drew off from outer bidding rivals with quick turn of foot passing the quarter pole, but
was overhauled by CHARLIE'S PENNY's inside bid passing the furlong pole. GOOD WITH NUMBERS saved ground off of the pace, slipped through a
narrow rail opening passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and chased through the lane to secure
show. LICHITA tracked from midpack four wide, bid for the lead outside of INJECT turning for home, but was repelled passing the quarter pole, and
flattened out. COREY steadied mildly in a bit of tight quarters early on after CHARLIE'S PENNY cleared and crossed across her path, got keen due to
restraint and pulled two wide and between horses to midpack into the turn, then shifted four wide turning for home, but failed to produce a bid.
OVERDRESSED was bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, trailed the field early on, took the turn in the three path before tipping five wide
approaching the quarter pole, but failed to factor. ASSERTIVE STYLE pressed the pace setter two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.
TRAIN TO ARTEMUS bobbled and was bumped by an inner foe at the start, rushed through the opening furlong to set the pace inside of a rival, but
weakened approaching the quarter pole.

stretch, then sustained a late rally to reach place on the wire without threatening the leader. MINUTE WALTZ hopped and received a substantial bump from
an inner rival at the start, was urged along from midpack down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn to produce a bid for the lead at the
quarter pole, vied outside of a pair of foes through upper stretch, but flattened out at the furlong pole, tired, and was nailed on the wire for place. TIZ
SPLENDID NEWS dueled for the lead inside of a foe before clearing off at the half mile pole, dug in at the quarter pole while meeting several outer bids, but
gave way appraoching the final sixteenth. POCA MUCHA took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, and improved without menacing. STELLAR

turn, rallied four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage from inner foes in upper stretch, cleared off inside the
furlong pole, but was worn down by an outer foe approaching the wire. COACH lied forwardly placed two wide, backed off to midpack into the backstretch,
rallied three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied after CLAIRIERE ranged up alongside, turning for home but was
outkicked on her left lead by that foe at the furlong pole, then fended off her inner counterpart's rebid for show. SIMPLY RAVISHING lied forwardly placed
three wide early on, inched forward to prompt the pace two wide with five furlongs to run, held an advantage between foes around the far turn, but was
headed at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded at the furlong pole. PRINCESS THEOREM rated far off of the pace in the two to four around the first turn,
and improved through the lane. ALEXANDRIA stalked two wide, but weakened in upper stretch. LADY LILLY stalked along the inside, got restrained under

Footnotes
MANDALOUN advanced to a three wide stalking position into the turn, inched forward under urging turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole,
sustained his bid and dueled outside of TWILIGHT BLUE through midstretch, the cleared off passing the sixteenth pole under a long drive. TWILIGHT BLUE
stalked three to two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as MANDALOUN ranged up alongside, dueled inside of that foe through midstretch, but
was bested passing the sixteenth pole. FOUNDER broke a step slowly, tracked from off of the pace in the three path around the turn, inched forward and
chased the leaders from between horses through upper stretch, but sustained his churning rally and stayed on to secure show. PICO D'ORO rallied five
wide around the turn to produce a mild bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with inner rivals in upper stretch, leveled off, and held a minor share.
SMOKIN' JAY pressed the pace along the inside early on, stalked around the turn before shifting two wide in upper stretch, but chased the leaders through
the lane and failed to produce a bid. TWIRLING MAMBA set the pace two wide early on before clearing his inner counterpart into the turn, dug in to cling to
an advantage inside of a duo of foes at the quarter pole, but weakened passing the furlong marker. CRAZY SHOT tracked from midpack along the inside,
then two wide and between horses around the turn, then shifted inwards in upper stretch while tiring. ULTIMATE rated off of the pace four wide and between
horses around the turn, but failed to factor. KING'S OVATION saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CHICKEN TRUCK was off a step slowly, and
never got involved.

KEEPMEINMIND patiently trailed the field around both turns, tipped five wide passing the quarter pole to set up shop outside of the leading group, then
sustained a grinding charge, bid for the lead inside the final furlong, and got up approaching the wire. SMILEY SOBOTKA dueled for the lead along the
inside of a pair of foes through the early part of the backstretch, got headed by those rivals around the far turn, but regained an advantage turning for home,
repelled his outer counterparts passing the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch, held a clear margin through midstretch, but was worn down by an
oncharging foe in the late stages. ARABIAN PRINCE tracked from off of the pace two wide and between horses, chased from behind the leaders through
upper stretch, then split foes four wide at the furlong pole while getting outkicked by the eventual winner, then kept on to secure show. SWILL stalked along
the inside, shifted to the two path into the backstretch while still stalking the leading trio, tipped to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to be outside of
those foes, attempted a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe passing the furlong pole. KING FURY prompted the pace three
wide, inched closer into the backstretch to bid for the lead, sustained vying position through the far turn, but failed to keep pace between horses in upper
stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. SITTIN ON GO saved ground off of the pace, and produced a mild rail rally through the lane, but failed to
threaten. ONCOMING TRAIN dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened passing the quarter pole. ULTIMATE BADGER raced off of
the pace three wide around both turns, and weakened. INSPECTOR FROST lied forwardly placed two wide, got rank between horses around the first turn,
remained pulling in the bit shifting three wide down the backstretch, then faded while getting floated to the five path, then six path, turning for home.

Footnotes
RUNWAY MAGIC lied forwardly placed four wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, and drew clear through the final furlong. OUTASITE prompted the
pace two wide, took over passing the five sixteenths pole, but was challenged and headed at the furlong grounds, and gave way. REPO ROCKS tracked
from midpack two wide and between horses, loomed behind the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, tipped three wide in upper stretch, but failed to threaten
the leaders while chasing them home. VANCOUVER MOON tracked from midpack along the inside, then chased the leaders through the lane. SULLY'S
BRO saved ground far off of the pace, advanced while swinging five wide passing the quarter pole, but leveled off through the lane. GROUP HUG raced far
off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted to the six path turning for home, and improved through the lane. SABUDA stalked three wide, but was
outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, and weakened through the lane. FED MONEY raced far off of the pace in the two path around the turn,
and never got involved. LAUGHING BOY stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back turning for home and failed to recover. PRINCE MAIOR was
bumped between horses at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to make an impact. PERSIAN EMPIRE was off slowly,
took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and was outrun. NITRO TIME set the pace while pulling in the bit, but weakened approaching the
quarter pole.
