Footnotes
MERCY RULE went right to the front, set all the pace to the stretch, was headed by the runnerup in mid stretch, continued to battle then drifted out in the
final strides, bumping DEBT MONGER and got the nod by a whisker. DEBT MONGER chased the pace to the second turn, was four then three wide to the
stretch, rallied to catch MERCY RULE in mid stretch, could not shake loose but was holding off that one then was bumped very late and missed. MR.
MAGICO was settled to the half, got fanned four wide to the stretch then chased the top two home. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE pressed the pace to the second
turn, was three wide and got outkicked to the stretch then weakened. ON THE WINGS OF tracked the leaders to the second turn, saved ground to the
stretch then tired. TYPHOON HARRY checked between rivals on the first turn and was not a factor. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run
involving the first two finishers and disqualified MERCY RULE from first to second for interference to DEBT MONGER.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was unhurried to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, rallied when roused, split rivals in mid stretch and finished strong
to be along in time. BOYSON chased the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but was bested for the win.
HULA KING set the pace off the rail to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, battled gamely to deep stretch then was bested. FINAL FINAL had no
speed, settled for a half mile, circled four wide on the second turn, rallied to mid stretch, was a threat to the sixteenth pole then was outfinished. AGENT
ZERO was also settled mid pack to the second turn, raced three wide then swung out widest for the drive but could not offer the needed late response.
HOLD ME CLOSE stalked the leader to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the drive. AUTISM IMPACT pressed the pace two
then three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EASY GAME had keen speed and shifted in, cleared rivals on the turn from the rail and was ridden out to the line. ARNO'S MANE MAN chased the pace to
the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but finished willingly for second. JENS DE VILLE trailed to the turn, was four
wide to the stretch then picked off rivals in the lane. DYNAMIC DUO was also chasing the winner, raced three wide to the stretch then did not threaten in the
drive. LADY CHROME pressed the winner early, got outkicked on the turn, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. STONE GROOVE was outsprinted early then
saved ground to no avail. RED CLEM had no speed, was two wide to the stretch but never a factor. TINA'S EXCHANGE chased the pace three wide to the
stretch then gave way.

POLISHED LADY was chasing to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and drove clear late. FAST TO FORTUNE was
also chasing while just in front of the winner, raced two then three wide to the stretch, also rallied when asked and was best of the rest. OKOYE broke out
sharply but was corrected and contested the pace three wide, pushed away under urging to mid stretch but was weakening late. LA PANZANELLA hustled
to duel for the lead between rivals and two wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the favorite to mid stretch then weakened. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT trailed two
wide to the stretch and could not threaten in the drive. ZAKKIYYAH was also chasing outside the winner, had to circle five wide to the stretch but gave way
in the final furlong. MALIBU JEWEL hustled to dispute the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired.

five wide on the second turn then was gaining through the final furlong. ARCH ANTHEM chased the leaders to the second turn, raced three wide to the
stretch then came up empty. MUHNEY LINE tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened. KYLEMORE stalked the leader three wide to the

FRUITFULLY was unhurried to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then rallied, caught FANTASTIC SECRET nearing the sixteenth pole then held
on determinedly. MISS YOU MOM had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then made a late surge to get the nod on the
line for second. CIRCULODEGANADORAS trailed to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive and just missed the place.
FANTASTIC SECRET pressed the pace to the backstretch, pushed to the front at the half, widened considerably on the second turn but was tiring badly in
the final furlong. DREAMING ABOUT YOU was allowed to settle to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but was never a threat. PULPIT SINGER
was on the pace early then pressed the leader to the second turn, got outrun to the stretch and finished evenly. SEIZE THE CHANCE had early speed but
was rank and lugging out to the backstretch, continued to be unmanageable to the half mile pole then was pulled up by the rider on the second turn and
walked off.
