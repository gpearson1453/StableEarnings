Footnotes
AMISTAD at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, departed the backstretch from path three, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the front
runners from midpack, fanned out into path six during the early going of the stretch drive, becoming the widest of all, closed in on the ones to catch with
good energy, struck the front end in the general area of the sixteenth pole, kicked clear smartly, under a strong hand drive crossing the finish line. LOADED
JOE stalked the pace from the two path, commenced the stretch one farther off the rail, came home with willingness to procure the place. VERMONT BILLY
three wide onto the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, rallied for the show. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER guided over to the rail midway on the backstretch,
stayed put tracking the front runners on the turn, angled three wide turning into the stretch, had no closing punch. KITH got moved into the two path by the
conclusion of the backstretch, swung out four wide heading home, rallied mildly. BOLD GEM bumped with MR. TAG after coming out at the break, assumed
control, was lightly hand urged carving out the pace from along the inside route on a loosely-contested lead , came under some soon after settling into the
stretch, relinquished for good with approximately a sixteenth to go then steadily weakened. BROADWAY JOE pocketed on the turn, failed to fire. MR. TAG
stumbled after making contact with BOLD GEM at the start, tucked on the rail and went on to save ground to no avail, was subsequently vanned off after the
finish. MAKOTO chased the pace from path four on the turn, got spotted in the five path at the top of the lane, folded. Due to a timer malfunction, half mile
fractions was hand timed.

furlong taking command narrowly near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ELUSIVE RULER bumped at the start by BAHAMIAN
PARK, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide
into upper stretch, rallied between foes to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth pole, fought on to the finish
to just preserve the place honors on the wire. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing stacked five wide at
the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, ran on to procure the show honors. DOUBLY BLESSED tracked the pace just off the inside, came
under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. JOY CITY two to three wide in pursuit,

yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. KNIGHT FROST leapt up at the start getting away last, raced
a bit keen into the first turn and was steadied off the heels of a rival slightly coming outwards and forcing SUPER WICKED CHARM to be taken hold off,

Footnotes
FUNNY GUY got set up in path two, bided time within striking distance of the front runners, flashed some interest shortly after entering the turn, got cued
and swung out five wide, becoming the widest of all, spinning onto upper stretch, kicked into his best at the sixteenth pole, eventually wresting away the
advantage with two jumps to spare before the finish line. MY BOY TATE prompted the pace two to three wide, was more the former turning into the lane, got
called upon for more right around the three-sixteenths pole, responded and took charge, left the sixteenth pole with the winner bearing down hard,
relinquished reluctantly in the shadow of the wire. BANKIT three wide entering the turn, was sent out towards path four exiting it, made no headway in the
final furlong. T LOVES A FIGHT took the inside route until the end of the bend after stumbling badly at the start, got worked into path three from upper to
midlane, lacked the necessary response. BINKSTER stumbled at the start, responded to a light hand ride to assume the top, showed the way from just off
the rail, surrendered after going a half, then faded down the lane.

Footnotes
VALLETTA three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the rail scraping the
paint inside of KITTEN'S ROMANCE to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. CLADDAGH'S RUN chased
three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SENGEKONTACKET tracked from
just off the pace two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, got
overtaken just inside that station and kept on to share in the show honors on the wire. WICKED HAPPY just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came
under coaxing along the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and ran on to dead heat for the show honors on the line.
MALIBU ANTHEM three wide in pursuit, went four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and
weakened in the late stages. KITTEN'S ROMANCE forwardly placed two to three wide in closest aim of the spurting leader, advanced to take over
command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under a drive, dug in and was headed just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late
going. SCHATZI tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. STARRY HOPE chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued two to thee wide for home and offered no response.
KARLEY O spurted away showing the way just off the inside, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to run, cut the
corner into upper stretch and tired. MS BOOMBASTIC brushed the off side stall at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled four wide for home and made no impact. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter and half mile fractions were hand timed.

Footnotes
BRATTLE HOUSE got out a bit during the opening phases while appearing keen, was expertly worked back closer to the rail, glided to the front end as the
second fraction was being finalized, led the way, held in reserve and while spaced just off the rail, was momentarily cued up in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths pole, had already built up a substantial advantage when put to being ridden out, a sixteenth later, saw the pilot do that for the next
sixteenth, correctly judged the second place finisher as being no serious threat and got geared down late. FLOWER'S FORTUNE attained a forward
position, chased the winner two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter spinning into the lane, proved no match while finishing well clear of the rest of
the competition for second. STORMI CAT LADY took up position in midpack, departed the backstretch from the three path, got sent out six wide from upper
to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, came home well enough to be along for the show. EXFILTRATION raced towards the rear for the opening
three-quarters going about its business at or nearr the two path, stepped into the lane, lost its battle with STORMI CAT LADY for third. CAPTIVATING
CARA two wide onto the turn, was in path four exiting it, gave way. NEBO quickly placed in the two path, swung out five wide into the stretch, folded.
DUCKPHAT towards the inside, vied for command matched up with the top one for a half, faltered. FLIRTACIOUS KISS sent over to the rail approaching
the conclusion of the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, straightened away and was then allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
SOMEBODY two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, dug in and held safe to prevail. SMILE BRYAN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
to five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. MICROSCOPE chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed
along from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to be along for the show honors. DR. DEVERA'S WAY led early on
among a trio vying for command, then raced three wide in aim of the leader, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole and took over narrow
command when set down swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, then flattened out in the late stages.
CAUSE OF ACTION chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was
outkicked. LATIN LOVE BUG chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went
seven wide for home and offered no response. TWELFTH LABOUR bumped at the start by MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE, who broke inwards, chased along the
inside coaxed along from three furlongs out, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. QUEEN'S MASON vied briefly with a pair before
chasing just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took over narrow and brief command between
foes before being headed by DR. DEVERA'S WAY near the quarter pole, spun three wide at that station and weakened. SKY OF HOOK broke in at the start
and was corrected, vied briefly with a pair before taking sole command five and a half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under pressure nearing the five-sixteenths and was headed inside that station while latched on to a pair to his outside, spun just off the inside for home,
tired, then got pulled up after the finish favoring his left front leg, the rider dismounting to brace his charge placing his back in the crook of the horse's neck
to support weight until help arrived and was subsequently vanned off. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE broke in at the start bumping TWELFTH LABOUR, chased
just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MACHO JACK
four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SANCTUARY CITY patiently tracked the front runners from along the inside for three-quarters pole, angled three wide for the drive home, charged to the
top, displaying a solid burst of speed during the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, got chased by horde of rivals from the eighth pole
onward, proved stubborn to the end. ADVANCED STRATEGY strung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, worked out a tuck closer to the rail before
reaching the end of the backstretch, chased the pace from path two in between rivals during the run around the far turn, was spotted back into path three for
the stretch run, rallied with willingness but got staved off by an opponent equal to the task at hand. MORE LIKE IT sat within range three wide, got set down
tipping to the outside coming up to the quarter pole, commenced the stretch run from path four, was one of several battling hard down the lane, earned the
show award. THE GOLDEN DOOR pursued the pace primarily from the two path until the end of the second bend, angled five wide into the stretch, clawed
its way towards the ones to catch, ultimately settling for the final significant slice of the purse. MR. KRINGLE broke in the air, landed back down and went on
to take up chase from the three path, got steered out five wide entering the stretch, narrowed in with only a minor check to show for the effort. SIDD FINCH
retained the advantage after breaking on top, was guided over to the rail, got rated along cutting the pace on a loosely-contested lead, felt an uptick in
pressure as three-quarters was being rattled off and then still more by upper stretch, yielded to it deep into the furlong grounds then steadily weakened.
AUSTRIAN reserved along the inside route in midpack, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, lacked the necessary response. BAD GUY kept
watch on the pace while saving ground for six furlongs, shifted out three wide for the stretch run, had no punch. MATTY'S EXPRESS secured the pocket,
was rated along for three-quarters, awaited options nearing the quarter pole, was forced to idle along during the stretch run, having some but nevertheless
requiring just a little more racing room with which to launch a rally in earnest. KICHIRO hesitated at the start, then went on to save ground to no avail. JO'S
BOLD CAT underwent a two wide pursuit and folded. CONFORTO stalked the pace from path two, pulling a bit on the bit early, gave way.

KILKEA established the front into the first turn and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into
upper stretch, drew off under a drive and was kept to task. PANDAMOM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to just secure the place honors. MIKE'S GIRL rushed the gate just as the latch
was sprung getting away to a fast beginning, settled in hand being briefly taken in hand as KILKEA crossed in front into the first turn, tracked the leader
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish no match for the winner and

Footnotes
ESPRESSO SHOT away without apparent mishap, pressed the issue from path two, rider utilizing a light hand ride, kept directly abreast of the nemesis all
throughout the run around the bend, had already assumed control when switched over to the stronger handling at the three-sixteenths pole, came under aim
from the runner up leaving the furlong marker, dug in well to preserve the decision. PRAIRIE FIRE took up the chase three wide on the turn, was in the
same one spinning into the stretch, displayed willingness but was held off. OFFICER HUTCHY off the rail at all times, was strung out four wide on the turn,
turned into the lane just as wide, lacked the necessary response. BANKERS DAUGHTER pocketed within range of a contested pace, shifted into the two
path for the stretch run, got outfinished. SADIE LADY bumped at the start, got worked onto the inside route on the backstretch, showed the way, prompted
by the winner from the outside, proved no match once that foe was ready to make her move, steadily backed away. FIGHT ON LUCY out a bit springing
from the gate, made contact with her next stall neighbor, cut over to the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, got fanned out in path six from upper to
midstretch, becoming the widest of all, had no rally. STEAL MY HEART took up position towards the rear of the pack, pursued the front runners hand ridden
in the two path, angled in the direction of path five for the drive, failed to fire.
