Footnotes
JUSTKISSMYGRITS stalked in the three path outside the early leader, took over midway on the turn, drew out entering the stretch and widened under
urging. EMPERADORA advanced early along the inside, came out into the three path on the turn then flattened out in the lane. KAZ'S PRINCESS was
reluctant to load, opened a short lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the turn then stopped. SPECTACULLARI
wasn't far back in the three path for a half then stopped. PALACEOFRESENTMENT briefly showed speed outside, stopped and was eased up through the
lane. DARK HEART stumbled badly a few strides out of the gate and unseated the rider. Off time was delayed 11 minutes because of the two late scratches
at the gate.

Footnotes
MAIN COOL CAT stayed well out from the inside while content to lag, circled the final turn, was six wide into the stretch and ran clear through the final
yards. THE GREAT CASBY was rated outside, made a run two wide between horses around the final turn, opened a short lead along the inside leaving the
furlongs grounds but was little match late. PAPA JOEL chased the early leader, moved three wide to a short lead midway on the final turn then gave way in
the drive. MONEYBAGS was slow early, steadied in tight along the rail midway on the final turn, angled out between horses and finished willingly.
MONKEY'S MEDAL made a run between horses into the stretch and flattened out. WARLEGGAN settled inside, began a run into the far turn, was taken up
when caught behind a rival midway on the final turn and lost best chance. SWINGING STAR raced between horses and failed to menace. CATTLE DRIVE
was caught wide around the first turn, made a four wide run around the final turn, was wide into the stretch and stopped. MAJESTIC WOODY was hustled to
a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed close to the inside while making the pace into the far turn, stopped suddenly and was eased up.

TOO MUCH DATA trailed inside to the stretch, rallied quickly and ran to the front in the final yards. COACH ADAMS moved on the turn to vie in the three
path outside the early leader, dueled with that one through the lane and couldn't contain the winner late. SCHWARBERTOWN broke sharply, angled in
leaving the chute, stayed out from the rail while holding a short lead into the stretch and gave way late. Following an objection by Hernandez,
SCHWARBERTOWN was disqualified and placed eighth. BEYOND GONE was bumped while not far back along the rail nearing the five and a half pole,
came out three wide between horses on the turn and lacked a strong closing. MCPHERSON was bumped into BEYOND GONE early on the backstretch,
advanced inside early, came out two wide between horses early on the turn while making a run, came in on KICK KICK HUSTLE nearing the quarter pole
then flattened out in the lane. Following an objection by Beato, MCPHERSON was disqualified and placed sixth. HONOR RUN was outrun after a slow
break. KICK KICK HUSTLE was forced in while showing speed from the outset, steadied along the rail approaching the turn, checked nearing the quarter
pole the stopped. BOAT'S A ROCKIN steadied leaving the chute, came in on MCPHERSON, raced two wide around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
MEMORY BOUQUET showed speed outside, raced two wide around the turn, moved clear after a half and widened under urging. AMERICAN CHESTNUT
was hustled between horses early, steadied in tight approaching the end of the backstretch, came out three wide for room midway on the bend, loomed
boldly outside the winner nearing the stretch but couldn't couldn't keep up in the drive. MIDDLE EARTH wasn't far back outside, raced four wide into the turn
then continued evenly. BEAU BRIDGE was bumped leaving the gate, pressed between horses while inside the winner, angled to the rail on the turn and
weakened. HANFORD was slow early, improved position in the three path on the turn but failed to gain through the lane. MACHO SMOKE fell far back after
a slow break then found best stride too late. RECYCLE was close up early, was fanned out four wide on the turn then stopped. SPRITZER wasn't far back
along the rail into the turn then stopped suddenly. BEAT NAVY was no factor. UHAVETOBEKITTENME ducked into BEAU BRIDGE leaving the gate, had
early position three wide between horses into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
FLATTERING RUBY showed speed inside, fell back off the pace entering the turn, came out two wide, made a run to the front approaching the quarter pole
and was kept to whip. CHARITY STRIPE stayed inside to the stretch, angled out and finished willingly. RITHM BOX broke slowly, fell back early, stayed
inside around the turn and finished with good energy. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO moved to a clear lead before going a furlong, angled to the rail early on the
turn and weakened in the lane. LOVELY LYDIA raced three wide between rivals around the turn and lacked a rally. TARA'S TALENT was close up outside
early, fell back two wide between rivals on the turn and continued evenly to the end. MA MEATLOAF wasn't far back two wide between rivals into the turn
then stopped. KELTOI raced four wide and failed to matter.

Footnotes
SOMERSET BAY began a two wide run on the turn, ran clear in early stretch and held under urging. JOZANI R V F began a run along the rail on the
backstretch, came out for the drive and gained to the end. REVANS REIGN was slow early, rallied the rail around the turn, moved closer past midstretch
then gained slowly. LORD RED PEAK raced inside the winner early, came out between horses in early stretch and lacked a closing. BAREFOOTIN' BAY
moved to a clear lead soon after the break, stayed close to the rail while making the pace to the stretch then tired. WILLING HERO raced three wide in an
even effort. EYES OF ZEUS was no factor. GEM JUAN was far back early. RHYTHM GUITAR stopped.
