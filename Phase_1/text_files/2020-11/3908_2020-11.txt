Footnotes
LEVEL SEVENTEEN rated a slim lead from the mid point of the opening turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole then dug in through the
stretch to hold on well. NOT TELLING settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close three
wide on the far turn and finished evenly, while unable to gain on the winner. THISISTHETIMETOWIN stalked inside from the middle of the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. BOSTON BILLY raced off the pace in the
two and three paths the first turn, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn four wide and flattened out inside the
sixteenth pole. UNCLE JESSIE saved ground off the pace, showed only mild response through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to
the four path nearing the head of the lane but flattened stride and was vanned off post race. EJE GAMA came away a step slow and rounded the first turn in
the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. DUSKY rated close to the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. R TAP veered outward at the break, rounded the first turn about the six path and
never factored. PARLAY VOEUX rounded the opening turn in the four path and was through early.

Footnotes
TAKE TIME drafted Nazca Mystry through the front stretch and raced in tandem with that one through the opening turn, started a three wide bid
approaching the three eighths pole, drew to even terms past the eighth pole and took the nod in the upper stretch, then dug in under steady handling to inch
clear. LUFTY'S KISSES stalked the pace two deep, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead approaching the three eighths, raced clear
at the rail on the far turn but was met at even terms past the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded later yards. HE'S A GOLD DIGGER settled off the pace about
the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then flattened stride later yards. NAZCA MYSTERY set the early pace
inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught approaching the three eighths and gave chase from that point, but dropped back
at the rail leaving the five sixteenths and weakened on the far turn. RUM RUNNER RED settled off the pace about the four path the first turn and raced
outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. JOVIAL JOHN settled off the earlier pace in the two
and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded at the rail past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
CHESTNUT LIME angled in with a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dug in from the head of the lane to take over mid-stretch
and widened under steady handling later yards. B J'S BIG BOY closed to the front toward the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in under
steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. MINI BOLT was pinched back early and angled toward
the outside to give chase, rounded the turn four wide, dueled for third in the upper stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. GRECIAN ADMIRAL was
forced inward and into Island Cadger early then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened out inside the
sixteenth pole. REDOUBTABLE was bumped off stride early then picked up the chase inside, steadied at the rail into the turn, eased out past the eighth
pole and finished evenly. SHARP'S MISSION raced well off the early pace inside, bid into the turn and raced in the four path through the turn and passed
some rivals. LIL MR MATT chased the pace outside, raced in the six and seven paths on the turn and showed little more. HOPE FOR THEMONEY chased
the pace outside, rounded the turn in the seven and eight paths and showed little further. ISLAND CADGER was bumped inward and into Redoubtable early
on, picked up the chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. MAKANA was pinched back early, angled to the outside and never factored.

KENS LADY was hustled to the front and set a pressured pace, raced clear near the rail rounding the turn and dug in under steady encouragement from the
top of the lane to hold on. STOP TALKING chased the pace and rounded the turn off the rail, then dug in through the lane and was gaining slowly late.

rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. WATERLOO ROSE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail then
flattened stride the final furlong. JUST ASK ME broke a step slow then steadied on the chute, raced well back from early contention but started a bid
approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn just off the rail, angled out in the upper stretch and finished evenly widest. R AWESOME ROSE gave early
chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. PACIFIC GOLD chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the

Footnotes
MERRY MERRY MOJO rounded the first turn in the five path and settled off the early pace, stalked into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn then drew away under steady stretch handling. JACKY'S MAN saved ground through the
opening turn then raced well off the pace, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, raced in the five path of the far turn and dug in through the lane to take
second later yards. EXECUTIVE RETREAT settled off the early pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three
path of the far turn but was nipped from second later yards. MOON WATCHER angled to the inside to rate a slim lead, came under pressure into the
backstretch and put Eagle Pride away to the five sixteenths pole, but was caught at the rail midway through the turn and weakened past the eighth pole.
CASTLEFINN rated off the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride. EAGLE
PRIDE stalked the pace off the rail, challenged into the backstretch and raced close most of the backstretch but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and
faded at the rail rounding the far turn. LASS MOMENT raced off the pace about the three path and was not a factor. CASTLE ONE mostly saved ground.

RIGHT NOTION stalked the pace from the three path the first turn and dueled at even terms three wide leaving the half mile pole, edged away from
Revolving Love and Pimm And Proper past the five sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to late stretch to hold on
well. HOLIDAY CURLS stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in
the four path, took over second mid-stretch and was gaining through later yards. REVOLVING LOVE raced with the pace and dueled at near even terms
from the half mile pole, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn, ceded second mid-stretch, though, held on for third. TRINNI SUNSET saved
ground off the pace the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail rounding the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
CROSS KEYS settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of
the far turn and passed rivals. PIMM AND PROPER angled to the inside to set the early pace, dueled at even terms two deep while between horses leaving
the half mile pole, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened into the stretch. DIANATHEHUNTRESS saved ground off the pace and showed
little response through the backstretch. PRINCESS ANNE raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, left the first turn outside and showed little
response. COMMANDING LADY rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

NATURAL SONDE broke out to make contact with Celia's Pride and was hustled up to set a pressured pace, dueled clear at the rail midway on the turn and
held on well with steady handling. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL gave chase and rounded the turn four wide, dueled for second in the upper stretch but couldn't
close significantly on the winner. WILD CORK gave chase inside, raced at the rail through the turn but flattened stride the final furlong. CELIA'S PRIDE was
bumped outward and into LILBITSOFDRAMA leaving the gate then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the six path, raced
outside into the stretch and finished evenly, while the latter was bumped at the break then hustled up to pressure the early pace, but dropped back off the
rail midway on the turn and weakened. SAMMIE GIRL broke awkwardly then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little
more. MEGS SQUIRELLYGIRL gave chase inside though, never factored. REAL FANCY PANTS gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail. ITSI BITSI
