Footnotes
PAPALE broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked the pace near the inside, came out and bumped GOVERNOR'S PARTY twice at the
three-sixteenths pole, headed the leader at the eighth pole and drew clear. GOVENOR'S PARTY pressed the early leader from outside, chased that foe
from between rivals and got bumped twice into the stretch, then continued willingly through the final furlong to secure second. COZY BEAR attended the
pace three deep, chased the leader into the lane and was floated out at the three-sixteenths pole, then finished evenly through the late stages. PAISANO
quickly took control from inside, showed the way with company to the outside, cleared rival at the quarter pole, headed with a furlong to go and weakened.
TODAY MATTERS pulled early while between rivals, stayed off the rail and came four wide into the lane and never rallied. SAGUARO traveled four deep at
the seven-eighths pole, chased from off the rail to the drive and weakened. RED HOT CAT stumbled and got bumped by inner rival, chased off the inside
and tired. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PAPALE FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR SHIFTING OUT AND BUMPING
GOVENOR'S PARTY AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, COSTING GOVENOR'S PARTY A CHANCE A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
ONE FAST BRO tracked the leader in the two path, four wide in upper stretch, drifted in a bit then closed outside the leader, took a short lead at the
sixteenth pole and edged away. SECRET CLUB tucked inside early, angled out in upper stretch, rallied and got up for second. BURNIN TURF crowded
between soon after the start, stalked outside the leader, applied pressure leaving the backstretch, took over with a furlong to go, lost command near the
sixteenth pole and was edged for second. COOL YOUR JETS in tight between rivals early then settled inside before moving out a path, angled out at the
three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. MAMBA COOL chased from inside, angled out at the top of the lane, lacked room in the stretch and kept on. N.
K. ROCKET MAN pulled early while going to the lead, set the pace from inside, responded when challenged around the far turn, fought back from inside
then weakened late. SQUARED STRAIGHT traveled three wide on the first turn, entered the stretch two wide, lacked room at the three-sixteenths pole and
lacked further response. QUESTION AUTHORITY stalked three wide to the lane and had little left for the drive. DUCHESNE trailed the field early, eased
around the far turn, pulled up near the eighth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
SECRET COURIER prompted the pace from outside, collared the leader at the eighth pole, cleared inside the furlong grounds and inched away. NATURAL
HISTORY lacked early speed, whittled the gap around the turn from inside, rallied through the lane and got up for the place. LIONITE settled off the pace,
went four wide through the turn, finished well but got outkicked for the place honors. CARTELLATE set the pace under pressure, carried a short lead into
the lane, fought back to the eighth pole and yielded late. ITALIANO stalked the top pair in the two path to the stretch and never produced a bid. HORSE
GREEDY bobbled leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival then between foes past the midway point on the turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the
drive.

entering the stretch, collared rival and put a head in front at the eighth pole, cleared that rival and held well in the closing moments. APPLECROSS (IRE)
settled off the pace from inside, saved ground into the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole and finished gamely. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) pulled early,
raced off the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, steered out with a furlong to go and was gaining late. WOKE UP TO ACES away quickly from
the start, went to the front and opened up a large lead early, held a diminishing lead through the far turn, led clear into the stretch, lost command at the
eighth pole and weakened to a minor award. GO BIG BLUE NATION traveled off the pace, saved ground from inside, steadied briefly off heels late, angled
to the inside and finished willingly. OVER ATTRACTED settled off the pace, angled four wide leaving the second turn and failed to rally. MISS ADDIE PRAY
stalked off the rail, came five wide into the lane and proved no menace. AWESOME DRIVE trailed the field early, went outside a pair on the backstretch,

Footnotes
STREET BEHAVIOR stalked the pace near the rail, urged upon around the far turn and tipped out a path, chased the winner through the drive then dug in
late and edged rival in the final moments. MOST SANDISFACTORY hustled to the front, dueled from inside then cleared rival past the nine-sixteenths pole,
cut the corner into the stretch, responded to urging when challenged in the late stages but could not hold off the winner. MASTER RECOVERY bumped
from the inside at the start, raced three to four wide on both turns and bested the rest. MONGOL ALTAI tracked the pace from inside, angled out on the
second turn and kept on for a minor award. DERBY WAR bumped both sides leaving the gate, angled in on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and
summoned a mild rally. MALIBU PRINCE broke out and bumped rival at the start, raced near the back of the field off the inside, came four wide into the
stretch and was never a factor. WESTERN SMOKE dueled for the lead early outside a rival, could not keep pace near the nine-sixteenths pole and chased
the winner to the far turn, lost ground around that bend and faded through the drive. KENJILOOKSLUCKY raced well of the pace, came four wide into the
stretch and made no impact. RIVER NORTH forwardly placed behind the to pair, dropped back on the second turn, exited that bend two wide and tired.

Footnotes
ORGLANDES (FR) broke in and bumped rival, traveled near the back of the field then moved up to mid-pack on the backstretch, raced two wide into the
stretch, came out and bumped rival at the sixteenth pole, then surged outside the runner-up to prove best. GOING TO VEGAS stalked outside the early
leader, closed in around the final turn, took the lead in upper stretch but was reeled in by the winner. QUICK (GB) raced mid-pack early while a bit off the rail
then outside a rival, angled out into the stretch, got bumped at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly for the show honors. COLONIAL CREED bumped
leaving the gate, in range from inside, tipped out at the top of the lane, put to right-handed urging but lacked the needed late punch. BLAME DEBBIE broke
out and bumped rival, stalked the pacesetter from inside the raced outside a rival, entered the stretch three wide then four wide in upper stretch, knocked
into rival at the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. AUNT LUBIE sped clear early, held a short lead into the lane, lost command in upper stretch
and weakened late. CALIFORNIA KOOK lacked room through the first turn, settled off the pace near the rail, lacked room near the quarter pole, angled out
into the drive and lacked a rally. NEVER BE ENOUGH (GB) checked early on the first turn then angled out around a rival, settled outside a foe, angled out
into the stretch and failed to produced a bid. HOLLYWOOD GIRL bumped leaving the gate, race far off the pace, traveled outside a rival then came three
wide into the lane and never made an impact. WOODFIN angled in early, saved ground to the stretch and was always outrun. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH ORGALANDES CAME OUT AND BUMPED BLAME DEBBIE INTO QUICK NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE,
IT DID NOT COST EITHER HORSE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
GANGLY came in and steadied early, settled outside a trio of rivals, raced five wide into the turn, angled in some then moved back out leaving the bend,
closed fast and reeled in the leader and inched away. SMILEFORME bumped with outside rival at the start, unhurried trailing the field early on, angled out
into the stretch, summoned a late rally and earned the place. OCTOPUS up close to the pace while outside a pair of rivals, bid alongside the leader at the
quarter pole, led in upper stretch, could not hold off the winner and lost the place. SATCHEL DE RITCHES tracked the pacesetter from inside, angled four
wide and finished evenly through the final furlong. UNCAPTURED HERO set the pace and angled to the inside, fought back to the eighth pole and
weakened. BIG BARREL bumped leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, raced two wide then three wide in upper stretch and lacked a response when
needed. LEATHERNECK checked between rivals early, saved ground into the lane and never threatened. CALL YOU TOMORROW chased three deep
early, three to four wide into the stretch and weakened. DORITA'S LEMON chased off the rail then outside a rival, went four to five wide into the lane and
was always outrun. STREET IMAGE showed early speed outside the leader, chased two wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
GREGDAR stalked the pace near the fence, angled outside the leader on the far turn, bid alongside at the three-sixteenths pole, cleared rival and inched
away under urging. BENCH JUDGE pulled early, raced off the pace then swung out into the stretch, drifted in and bumped rival near the eight pole, drifted
further in after, rallied and proved second best. HOOP DREAM stalked the leader in the two path, was in range at the top of the stretch but lacked needed
late punch and got outfinished for the place. ARMOUR PLATE angled in early then back out on the first turn and raced between rivals into the backstretch,
traveled two wide into the lane and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. INVICTATATUS sped clear to gain control, crossed over to the inside,
inched away into the second turn then got pressured around the far turn, challenged at the three-sixteenths pole, lost control in upper stretch and gave way.
TURN THE SWITCH raced mid-pack while off the rail, went three wide into the far turn then angled out and raced four to five wide into the lane, bumped by
outside rival near the eighth pole and weakened. PALACE PRINCE angled to the rail entering the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground to the lane
and never rallied. GO TIME dropped back early, saved ground along the fence and never threatened. BUD KNIGHT chased off the rail, came four wide into
the stretch and weakened. RAILSPLITTER up close early just behind the leader to the outside, lost ground around the far turn and weakened in the drive.
PRAISE LOUDLY dropped back early, raced outside a rival then two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.
