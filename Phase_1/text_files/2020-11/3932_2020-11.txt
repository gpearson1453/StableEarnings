firm handling. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE contended throughout, was outfinished late but was second best. BEST OF YOU was wide early, drooped to the
inside on the far turn and went evenly late. MY LITTLE LILY raced mid pack and saved ground, lacked a late response. SEEKING A JEWEL was allowed to
settle and failed to menace. PANAMANIAC set the pace for three quarters, then quickly gave way. SWEET CHELSEA was no factor. ANSWER QUIETLY
contended early and was through after a half and stopped in the stretch.

throughout and held gamely in the drive to just miss. VINNY BOY dueled on the lead until mid stretch, weakened slightly late. YOUNG AMERICAN was well
placed and saved ground, closed a gap late. WESTWOOD PROUD stumbled at the start, raced mid pack and was no threat. MADEYE allowed to settle on
the inside, failed to menace. KING VALERO slow early, was outrun. MR. CAT flashed brief foot, and was through early. PERSUASION raced wide and was
no factor. ALYCAR FLASH raced close up early and was through after a half.
