REPEATED PROMISE was bumped at the start, dueled inside for the lead, continued to battle with FROST'S SONG entering the far turn, battled back
gamely inside past midstretch and earned the place spot. FROST'S SONG dueled outside for the lead, battled on the far turn, gained a short lead at the
quarter pole, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch run and weakened late. COURT SKY raced three wide early, settled off the leaders and had no
rally. WOODHAVEN KID raced off the pace, then between rivals and failed to threaten. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL raced two wide off the pace and did not
factor. PIGGYBANK raced off the rail, off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY RED took the lead at once after another lengthy gate load, set the pace in three path, was clear leaving the turn and won under mild
handling. LUVINMEISEASY drifted out on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, drifted out again through stretch. TOMATER GATOR, inside second
flight, drifted out near stretch then gave way. ASPHALT PAVING, between rivals early, was left with the rail and was no threat. CREDIT CYCLE raced wide
and drifted wider under left handed pressure. GRAVES ISLAND saved ground and showed little. METAPHORICAL, very wide and just off the pace, tired.
DROSSELMAGIC was between second flight and stopped.

Footnotes
BEACH TAG set the pace four path, shook loose and held a clear lead mid stretch then lasted. VOLODINA raced three wide, drifted out badly through
stretch and just missed. CREEDIBILITY, between rivals early, drift out a bit on turn and took up sharply, swung out into stretch, also drifted out and closed.
TWO CARAT broke very slowly, saved ground to stretch, swung out and rallied. LITTLE NECK, two wide and never far back, finished with good energy. UP
JUST IN TIME raced in the five path chasing then gave way through stretch. TIZ A DATE saved ground just off the pace then tired. NOT IN THE MOOD
broke slowly then failed to menace. WEST HORIZEN, wide, was not a serious threat. BRYCE'S PHILLY was three wide and just off the pace, dropped back.
MISS LOYALTY saved ground and showed nothing. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CREEDIBILITY AGAINST VOLODINA NEAR THE QUARTER
POLE WAS DISMISSED.
