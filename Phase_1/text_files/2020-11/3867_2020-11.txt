CLASSY SOLUTION , three deep on the turn, chased the pace and gave way the final furlong. CONFUSION BABY BOY , no factor, was five deep in upper
stretch. SCORCHED BY FIRE was outrun.

Footnotes
POINT DRIVEN edged up inside nearing the five eighths and garnered a stalking spot, moved through an inviting rail opening into the stretch, seized
command leaving the three sixteenths and eagerly drew away while kept to a steady drive. STROLLED ON BY , off the pace while saving ground, took
closer order under pressure into the lane, kept on willingly and earned a dead heat for the place. PUSH TO START bobbled outward at the break and
bumped with MORE TWIRL, corrected and spurted clear, set the pace three wide into the lane, could not resist the winner past the three sixteenths, gave
way grudgingly and finished on even terms with STROLLED ON BY. ROOF TOP BAR , off the pace and between foes past the half mile marker, advanced
under pressure and outside a rival past the five sixteenths, swung five wide for the drive but lacked a serious closing kick. MORE TWIRL , bumped and
forced out at the break, recovered and moved up wide past the five eighths, stalked the leader leaving the far turn, was under asking into the lane and
faded. YES SIR COLONEL prompted the pace outside the leader, was under heavy pressure past the five sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong.
BARRISTER broke a step slow, lagged off the pace, raced wide in the drive and failed to menace. AUCHINCRUIVE , wide into the turn, dropped back.

Footnotes
EGO TRIP dropped back under patient handling leaving the backstretch, circled horses on the turn, was five deep in upper stretch, advanced outside rivals,
took command near the sixteenth pole and drew out. GHOST ON A MISSION , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path between horses on the far
turn, eased out for the drive, bid for the lead outside SEVEN PLUS SEVEN in upper stretch and flattened out. GLORIOUS WEEKEND , inside horses on the
far turn, eased off the rail and to the two path in mid stretch and passed a tired rival. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN , four deep entering the first turn, took the lead
mid way down the backstretch, opened up on the far turn, raced along the rail in the drive and faded late. STAND MY GROUND , pinched back leaving the
starting gate, had a mild, four deep move into the far turn then gave way through the stretch. POWER BACK bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the
pace outside horses down the backstretch and gave way. SINGLE FOCUS sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and faltered on the far turn.
SEVILLE ROW , forced out leaving the starting gate, dropped back after five furlongs.

Footnotes
HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY stalked three wide, advanced five wide into the lane, dueled outside CHARGING LION from the three sixteenths, gained a slim lead
late and prevailed under a steady hand ride. CHARGING LION prompted the pace two to three wide, came under a strong ride past the three eighths,
challenged for command while three wide and between runners into the lane, dueled inside the winner through the final three sixteenths, had his rider lose
the stick late and just missed in a gritty effort. EMPTY NESTR saved ground under early rating, took closer order while continuing an inside trip past the
three eighths, steadied briefly when in a bit close in upper stretch, recovered and continued with interest. ALWAYS FORGIVEN broke a step slow, pulled his
way forward while between rivals past the seven eighths marker, chased three wide into the lane, shifted out and kept on willingly. KEEPING THE PEACE
quickly went clear, set the pace towards the rail, was engaged near the quarter pole, faltered near mid stretch and drifted out. DAY bobbled at the break,
lost ground four wide into the backstretch, remained wide and faded leaving the far turn.

POSITIVE FORCE , three wide around the turn while chasing the pace, challenged UNO TIGRESS in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in an extended
drive. UNO TIGRESS prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead mid way on the turn and gave way grudgingly inside the winner. ROCKSTAR GIRL
saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BRUT ROSE , unhurried to the stretch, offered a mild move inside horses late.
VILLAMOURA broke slowly, raced along the inner rail around the turn, eased out and weakened in the drive. CASSEY'S GIRL , kept wide around the turn,
was not a factor. WHISPURRING KITTEN stumbled leaving the starting gate, angled to the four path in upper stretch and weakened. MAGIC IN MALIBU
was not a factor. STEP BY STEP sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, was done leaving the turn and faltered in the stretch.

ITS A JOURNEY pressed the pace two to three wide outside I'LL TAKE THE CAKE, drew alongside nearing the lane, wrested command past the three
sixteenths, edged clear under a stout drive past the sixteenth marker and held sway. ANNIKA GOLD , well placed stalking about two wide, came under
pressure mid way on the final turn, worked her way between rivals in deep stretch and earned the place. I'LL TAKE THE CAKE was sent to the front, set a
pressured pace towards the rail, dueled two wide to the inside of the winner entering the lane, kept on past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly in the
final fifty yards. GENNIE HIGHWAY was squeezed back at the break,, recovered and settled towards the inside, eased out leaving the far turn and made
some headway, circled five wide into the stretch and churned on with interest. MIA BELLA ROSSA , four wide to contention, stalked outside, ranged up four
wide into the lane to loom a threat, wandered outward with pursuit in mid stretch, corrected but failed to sustain. CANOOCHEE broke slowly, raced wide into
the backstretch and failed to menace. MORTAL STORM , a bit keen behind the leaders while saving ground, steadied leaving the seven eighths pole,
continued inside and faded leaving the far turn. MISS CHLOE G saved some ground early then dropped back after a half mile.

Footnotes
GRACETOWN broke well and quickly made the lead, set the pace along the rail, opened up in mid stretch then was kept under pressure to the finish.
LUCKY FIND raced in the two path between horses for most of the trip and rallied late. LOOKIN DYNAMIC saved ground around the turn, remained along
the rail in the stretch and finished willingly. BREAK CURFEW chased the pace outside the winner, was three deep turning for home and weakened late.
SAVEDBYTHEBELLE , along the rail in upper stretch, swung out late and rallied mildly. ONE LAST TRIAL , very wide leaving the turn, was not a factor.
FAIRY WISH was no factor. A GIRL NAMED JAC , four deep on the turn, gave way. GLOBAL AMBITION was outrun. PILOT EPISODE chased the pace
three wide on the turn and faltered. SPEEDY VANESSA dropped back.

Footnotes
HALL PASS broke a step slow, regrouped and settled well back while saving ground, commenced a run leaving the far turn, cut the corner advancing into
he lane, altered out while continuing progress in mid stretch, forged to command near the sixteenth pole and kicked away under a drive. SPEIGHTSFORD
accelerated to the inside of rivals leaving the chute to take command and then go clear, set a solid pace, moved away mid turn, kept on under a drive while
off the rail past mid stretch, failed to contain the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but continued gamely to save the place. GOLDEN BROWN settled off the
pace while saving some ground, eased out while making a run mid turn, worked between rivals leaving the three sixteenths and churned on. JUMPMASTER
stumbled at the break, raced well back while off the rail, dropped in entering the lane, came back out for the final furlong and kept on with interest.
FORTUNATE FRIENDS stalked three wide, moved up to have aim into the lane, chased to mid stretch then faded. HANALEI'S HOUDINI saved ground
under early rating, angled out with run mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch but flattened out. JOHN JONES chased off the rail and gave way.
SARATOGA JACK prompted the early pace, was under pressure two wide mid turn and weakened. TAP THE MARK , off the inside, was under a ride into
the turn but failed to respond. ASPECT , well wide leaving the far turn, gave way.
