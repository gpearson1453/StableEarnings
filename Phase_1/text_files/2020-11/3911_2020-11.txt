Footnotes
RACK DADDY broke slowly and a bit awkwardly, saved ground, was steadied lacking room on the far turn, moved to the outside and closed determinedly
and was just up. HEY DEWZPOTS set the pace in the three path, was clear mid stretch but then just failed. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT raced outside while
never far back and lacked a rally. YOURINDENIAL, between rivals and just off the pace, lacked a strong closing. RISQUE'S JEWEL broke slowly, raced
four wide and failed to menace. PALOMA GRIS, bumped leaving the gate, saved ground and faded. ALICE HELEN came out and bumped PALOMA GRIS
at the start, saved ground, stopped suddenly and lost contact.

LOVE ON FIRE between foes on the backstretch, was bumped lightly on the far turn, was left with the rail, closed determinedly and was along in time.
GATOR GIRL drew clear on turn, drifted out a bit through stretch and just failed. STORMBEAM saved ground, dropped back last on the far turn, went
between rivals on the turn then raced six wide into stretch and made up ground. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE, just off the rail, split rivals on the turn, angled out
and then flattened out. LORDEN'S LOVE came in slightly and bumped the winner lightly on the far turn, dueled two wide then tired. COTTON CANDY
CUTIE raced wide and failed to menace. GOSSIP ISLE, three wide and just off the pace, tired.

Footnotes
CAPO KANE set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, drifted out in front of BRETT'S WORLD at the top of the lane,
responded when asked and pulled away under urging. BRETT'S WORLD stalked close up outside, bid midway on the far turn, angled out behind the winner
at the top of the stretch, dug in gamely but no match. CELTIC HEART stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly.
DOCTOR DOOM tracked inside, chased on the far turn and tired. JAMMIN JAMIE was bumped at the start, raced four wide early, off the pace between
rivals, went three wide past the quarter pole and failed to threaten. COBBLE ROAD broke in and bumped a rival at the start, raced off the pace inside and
did not factor. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN raced five wide early, three wide off the pace, went four wide at the quarter pole and faded. A Jockey's Objection by
the rider of CAPO KANE against the winner was dismissed.

RACEHORSEINARED set the pace in three path resisted to mid stretch then gave way. DOUGIE was in motion in the gate, lunged then stumbled losing all
chance. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN broke slowly then failed to menace. RULES raced wide while just off the early pace then stopped. LAWYER ROY racing
