Footnotes
CROW MOON, urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, held sway on a clear advantage into the lane and
maintained a safe margin under pressure. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN angled to the rail tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, saved ground to the
second bend, shifted out five wide bumping a rival midstretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail for second. SUMMER CASTLE angled to
the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in second flight, shifted out three deep racing into the lane while being urged to challenge but couldn't gain terms
with the winner while just outkicked for second. ANGELINO, urged inside prompting the pace in the opening stages, tracked just off the leader to upper
stretch and weakened in late stages. GLORY RIDE, reserved between foes in early stages, angled in entering the far turn and improved position inside foes
late. NO CENTS LEFT tracked off the second flight three wide to the backstretch, angled six wide racing into the stretch but passed only tiring foes. CADET
CAPTAIN tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, lodged a brief bid leaving the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. TENSPEED,
caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked outside foes in second flight, angled four wide nearing upper stretch briefly gaining contention but came up
empty in the drive. NORCO tracked off the second flight between foes, was fanned five wide into the lane, was bumped by MIRACLE MOUNTAIN
midstretch and quickly came up empty. DRAGUNOV settled outside a rival racing to the backstretch and never seriously menaced. TALES OF WAR broke
a step slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COCOA PEACH cleared quickly to an unchallenged lead, set the pace while saving ground, and widened her advantage under a drive in the lane. VICE
GRIP hopped at the start and was off slow, settled in second last, began to gain from the five eighths, sustained her rally in the three path on the turn,
bumped MISS GAVEL in upper stretch when swinging out, and chased on second best. THE MORE I BURN chased the leading pair two wide, continued in
the four path on the far turn, came into the lane between horses, kept on under a drive inside horses through midstretch but was outkicked for place.
BLAZING RUBY tracked well off the unchallenged leader, proved no match into the lane and was outfinished between horses. MISS GAVEL was hard to
settle near the rear early, swung three wide while urged around the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch by VICE GRIP, and lacked the needed rally.
WICKED SOPRANO chased the leading pair inside of THE MORE I BURN, raced into the lane at the inside of the chasing flight, and flattened out.
SUPREME IRENE settled near the rear outside MISS GAVEL early, continued near the rear down the backstretch, was outpaced in the three path on the
far turn and empty for the drive. ASHLEYSDREAM hit the gate when breaking inward, stumbled, soon trailed, continued well behind the rest of the field in
the three to four path on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch and passed a tiring horse. SKIPTOTHEWIRE settled midpack, raced two wide on the
backstretch, faded in the five path on the far turn and was no further threat.

Footnotes
OMAR ATTACK was rated off the second flight just off the inside racing to the turn, shifted to the rail racing into upper stretch advancing inside foes, then
switched outside the pacesetter splitting foes in close quarters in the final sixteenth to strike the front in time under steady handling. SIERRA HOTEL was
urged prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch and was just outkicked. HILTON MAGIC, urged along the inside
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. HOTFOOT
angled inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out to bid between rivals nearing midstretch, then was steadied out of tight quarters
losing momentum nearing the wire. ROYAL COMMISH, off last, then held up out of close quarters in the opening stages, angled to the inside steadily
gaining position inside foes racing into the bend, shifted out five wide racing through the lane and continued to make mild progress. TAKE ME UP BRADY
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance but lacked the needed late
kick. LIBERAL LUNACY, reserved outside foes racing to the turn, angled in nearing the lane to split foes three deep with a belated effort while making no
real impression. HERE COMES KYLE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch but had no closing
bid. CANARY ISLANDS tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, swung out five wide nearing uppper stretch but had no rally.
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing into the bend, was fanned six wide into the lane and steadily faded.
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY tracked off the second flight inside rivals in the opening stages but retreated early.

Footnotes
TODDLES vied inside of BEE HAPPY ATTACK, set a pressured pace into the turn while saving ground, shook clear from the three eighths, drove clear in
the lane and held a clear advantage while kept to the task. LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased four wide down the backstretch, improved when pushed along
four wide on the turn, came into the lane four wide, and chased on a clear second best. ROCKET RIDE chased three wide down the backstretch, was
pushed along while still positioned three wide on the turn, came into the lane between horses, and improved mildly in the lane. DEORA STORE tracked the
leading pair early, kept on in range while in the three path on the turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, came into the lane three wide, and weakened
in the final furlong. B'S TURNING POINT came off a step slowly, settled at the rear, took closer order in the two path on the turn, and passed outside tiring
horses under a drive in the lane. BEE HAPPY ATTACK vied outside of TODDLES early, pressed two wide into the turn, could not match TODDLES from the
three eighths, was driven in upper stretch but came up empty. WAR TRAIL was reluctant to load and restless in the gate, raced at the inside of the chasing
flight, continued in the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane but had no bid. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS was hard urged between horses
early, faded in the three path on the far turn and had nothing further for the drive.

Footnotes
PRINCE ARLO was settled into stride a bit off the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside rivals after a half, steadily
gained position along the rail racing into the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to collar the
pacesetter and go clear in time under firm encouragement. ALPHA BOY, reserved while angling to the inside in the opening stages, saved ground through
the far turn, angled five wide racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors. HINTON, urged between foes prompting the pace into the
backstretch, went clear after a half while angling to the inside, held sway on a clear margin past midstretch but was collared late. BEAST MODE settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes to race six wide into upper stretch, exchanged some contact with SATURDAYS
HANGOVER in late stages but continued to gain position to the end. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, switched
outside foes gathering momentum leaving the far turn, was fanned seven wide racing through the stretch while exchanging some contact late but continued
with a mild bid. TALKING ZIP, urged along the inside prompting the pace into the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch and
gave way. ANDREAS angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid
nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. SHELL FIRE tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half and emptied out racing intot he
far turn. SEBA'S DANCER was a brief factor outside foes but faded early. STRIKING HEIR, forwardly placed three deep prompting the pace racing to the
far turn, gave way into the lane. SHO POKE dropped out early.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO FIRST was hustled through horses to get to the front, saved ground around the turn while setting the pace, cleared in upper stretch, and
remained in command under a hand ride. MEGAN'S HONOR was reluctant to load and restless in the gate, chased three wide early, was driven three wide
on the turn and into the lane, and chased on under a drive while unable to get to the winner. D' YANK settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn,
raced inside with the rear flight into the lane, was taken out in upper stretch, and chased on under a drive to prove best of the rest. GIVIN UP NONE tracked
the leader inside, steadied past the half mile mark when CRANKSHAFT came in on him, saved ground while racing at the inside of the tracking flight around
the turn, was driven into the lane, but outfinished inside. DEMAND RANSOM was away sharply but settled midpack after being outsprinted to the lead by
VERRAZANO FIRST, raced in the three path with the second-last flight through the turn, floated four wide into upper stretch and lacked the necessary kick.
CRANKSHAFT tracked the early pace outside of GIVIN UP NONE, came in on that foe past the half, continued to track the pace between horses on the on
the turn, was driven between horses into the lane and weakened. SUPRISE CAT settled toward the rear early, was driven in the five path on the turn while
racing with the second-last flight, continued under a drive into the lane but responded with no rally. W W TRAFALGAR was hard to settle early, raced in the
six path with the rear flight on the turn, and offered no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
WORKINGFORALIVING, urged inside foes disputing the pace along the rail racing into the first turn, was headed midway through the backstretch,
continued with a steady effort to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch, widened the advantage to midstretch and just held RICH E Z to the end
under firm right handed encouragement. The latter settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, gradually gained contention racing
into the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch while producing a steady late response and continued willingly to the end to close the gap.
DIAMOND DAVE, off slowly, was settled last along the inside, split foes just off the inside on the far turn, then found his best stride in the closing stages to
advance inside foes while prevailing for a share. COWBOYS DREAM tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide
entering the lane while being urged to advance but had no final kick. BOLD PROPHET, urged between foes forcing the pace racing into the backstretch,
couldn't match the winner after six furlongs and gave way into upper stretch. ITSALLABOUTYOU, reserved out of striking distance racing off the inside,
swung out five wide in the stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. PLEASANT MOON, urged to a forward placing three deep
prompting the leaders to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. BEAR TRAPPE, caught four
wide racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight, steadily faded after a half. FLIT N TIME settled along the inside early and proved no threat. LANDING
GEAR, caught in the five path tracking off the second flight racing into the backstretch, dropped out early.

Footnotes
SEATTLE TRAIN settled near the rear early, edged to midfield by five furlongs out, chased midpack between horses around the turn, responded with a rally
when driven three wide into the lane, led near the sixteenth pole and held. DON'T HOLD QUEENS settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn,
responded well inside under a drive in upper stretch, sustained her rally and narrowly missed. IZE DISCREET ROSE tracked the dueling pair, saved ground
through the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch as LADY WARRIOR drifted out, was headed by SEATTLE TRAIN near the sixteenth mark, proved no
match for her or DON'T HOLD QUEENS late but held show. LIL BIT TIPSEY reared at the break and came slowly away, settled near the rear, was pushed
along and began to improve in the two to three path on the turn, offered a belated rally in the lane and missed the show. LADY WARRIOR broke outward
and bumped TRYST CAT in the opening strides, dueled inside of that foe, edged ahead to a narrow yet defined lead past the three sixteenths, floated out
six wide into upper stretch and was headed by IZE DISCREET ROSE, and continued to drift out while chasing on to the finish. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN
settled toward the rear, raced three wide with the rear flight around the bend, and passed outside tiring horses in the lane. EDISTO ISLAND chased outside
of ICE ATTACK down the backstretch, raced three wide with the chasing flight around the bend, but lacked the needed kick in the stretch. KLONDIKE
ANNIE tracked the dueling pair outside of IZE DISCREET ROSE early, chased the leading trio in the four path on the turn, and weakened. ICE ATTACK
chased inside of EDISTO ISLAND, continued at the inside of the chasing flight on the turn while saving ground, was in range to midstretch and then allowed
to fade. PEPPERMINT ICE settled toward the rear, raced in the three path on the turn, and mustered no bid. TRYST CAT was bumped by LADY WARRIOR
in the opening strides, dueled outside that foe, pressed outside that foe as she began to edge away from the three eighths, came three wide into the lane
and emptied out.
