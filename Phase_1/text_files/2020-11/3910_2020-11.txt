Footnotes
INSOFAR pressured the pace dueling abreast rival to upper stretch brushing lightly gradually wearing foe down to win clear. TOUCHDOWN JESUS rallied
to pressure four wide on the turn, lost momentum in upper stretch regrouping late to come on for place. SKINNERSBURG sent hard inside dueled on the
turn then brushed with rival at the head of the lane battling from the rail coming up a bit short. CAKE AND EAT IT TO moved to threaten on the turn then
weakened at mid track in upper stretch. PRINCE AMADEUS a step slow through the turn raced evenly in the four path down the lane holding the others.
OSMI SLEW faded on the turn. SMOKIN CITY drifting in while rushing early, flashed speed then gave way on the turn. TEXAS JIMMY was always outrun.
