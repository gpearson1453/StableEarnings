Footnotes
INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM vied briefly early on before easing of and settling in hand three then four wide latched on to the outside of a duel, attended those
foes in reserve through the turn until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command three-sixteenths from home, dug in under a
drive inching away to the finish to prevail. CLEMENZA coaxed from the gate, vied among a quartet early on before emerging in tandem with O'TROUBLE to
duel with that rival loosely between foes when joined to the outside by the eventual winner, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home, got collared in tandem at the three-sixteenths with his main pace rival and continued to battle on knocking heads to the finish to get up for the place
honors. O'TROUBLE vied early on before emerging to duel along the inside of the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside for home, got displaced from the front at the three-sixteenths in concert with his main pace foe, dug in dueling through to the finish with
CLEMENZA fighting on to the end and was bested for the place honors while just preserving the show. GROWL TIGER four wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish and just missed for the show honors. DETERMINED FURY four
then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KNOCKOUT
PUNCH inside briefly after the start, tipped out to chase just off the inside, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PERFECT MUNNINGS secured a prominent position after the field had been sent on its way, departed from the two path, responded when put to feverish
encouragement crossing the midway point of the turn before pausing in hand when momentarily caught in some traffic coming up to the quarter pole, was
gradually worked into path three from upper to midstretch, kicked in when given his cue, roaring by the runner up a short distance beyond the eighth pole,
edged away. DANCING BUCK along the outside, kept watch on the pace three wide on the turn, inched up as the second fraction was being finalized,
settled in upper stretch and got called upon, emerged a furlong later holding a narrow lead, had it snatched away by the winner soon afterwards, held on
well to save second. MASKED MARAUDER off a half length the quickest, prompted the pace from path two, continued onward as a forward factor before
weakening in the final furlong. MR HOT CHACHA tracked the front runners from along the inside route, angled out four wide for the drive, had no winning
response. HEYMACKIT'SJACK established the top after being put to an abbreviated brisk hand ride springing from the gate, showed the way, feeling some
pressure from MASKED MARAUDER from the outside, gave in to challengers in upper stretch then steadily backed away. ON MICK'S DAY towards the two
path in pursuit of the pace, swung out three wide into the lane, had no offering. BOLGHERI rode the rail for nearly a half, was ridden three wide into the
stretch, came up empty. LOULOVESTHERIVER chased the pace two wide, got sent out into path five during the drive to no avail. NEVER EVOLVED saved
ground for the opening half, fanned out five wide once in the stretch, was never in it. TAKECAREYALLCHICKN faltered after undergoing a ground-saving
journey.

BAKERS BAY tracked the pace along the inside saving ground through the whole trip until set down angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in
rallying under a drive through the final furlong surging late to just get up in the very last jump to the wire. COMPLIANT just off the pace two then three wide,
got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, lugged in nearing the eighth pole forcing BLUEGRASS PARKWAY to alter in slightly and OBSESSED to be
very briefly paused inside that rival, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under a drive under threat and was nailed in the very last stride to the
finish. BOX N SCORE saved ground near the rear of the field early on, made steady progress to mid pack, then advanced to be just off the pace through the
far turn, got roused spinning five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish and was up for the show honors in a blanket finish to the line. GLYNN
COUNTY saved ground near the rear of the field in reserve until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick to close in late for the last major share. DANTE'S FIRE brushed the off side stall at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and kicked on belatedly. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY forwardly placed just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, shied in nearing the eighth
pole as COMPLIANT lugged in, dug in under a drive and was displaced from that rival a furlong out, fought on to inside the sixteenth marker and was
outfinished in the late stages. CIBOLIAN saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home
and stayed on one paced to the finish. COWTOWN went three wide through all three turns, chased two to three wide in pursuit, got set down angled four
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. OBSESSED broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way rated along the inside, came under
threat for the initial time nearing the quarter pole, got roused when headed for the front taking the inside route into upper stretch, paused briefly nearing the
eighth pole as COMPLIANT lugged in and weakened.

Footnotes
THE SOUND established the top in short order, cut over towards the inside, making it into the two path as the half was being completed, showed the way on
a loosely-contested advantage, was travelling through the furlong grounds when switched over to stronger handling, responded to stay well in the clear.
ADARE strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly closer to the rail, proved no match. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD a forward factor from
along the inside route, had no rally. FAMILY BIZ four wide onto the turn, was set down right afterwards, got moved out five wide exiting it, came up empty.
AMERICAN RULE pursued the pace from path three during the run around the bend, went into the lane and failed to gain. FORT WORTH settled into the
two path by the half mile pole, began to get roused by the three-eighths pole, swung out four wide into the stretch, tired. SCORESWHENHEWANTS parked
out five wide on the turn, folded.

MISS BRAZIL dueled from the two path with PRECIPITATE to her inside, shook off that rival just inside the three-eighths coming under some pressure to
the outside and was placed to coaxing in response five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to
prevail. CARAMEL SWIRL chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path through the turn advanced nearing the quarter pole
and came in slightly near that station due to some pressure outside from DEALING JUSTICE, cornered just off the inside for home, ran on through to the
finish chasing the winner home. PRECIPITATE coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of MISS BRAZIL down along her inside down the backstretch and into
the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off a bit three furlongs from home, was under coaxing when steadied along the inside
nearing the quarter pole when her lane tightened briefly as CARAMEL SWIRL came in very slightly due to DEALING JUSTICE coming in slightly to her
outside, went two to three wide for home and improved position to just get up and share in the show honors. DEALING JUSTICE three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, came in slightly near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened sharing in the show honors
on the wire. FIRING CAROL broke out brushing the off side stall at the start and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for
home and was unable to make an impact. SOMA broke out at the start trading a bump with PARADISE SONG, who broke inwards, chased two to three
wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, went three wide for home and made no impact. PARADISE SONG broke in at the start
trading a bump with SOMA as that rival broke outwards, chased four wide throughout under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued four wide for home
and tired. There was a Claim of foul by the rider of PRECIPITATE alleging interference at the quarter pole against CARAMEL SWIRL which was reviewed
and dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) away without apparent mishap, patiently keep an eye on the front runners from the pocket, eased to the outside approaching
the quarter pole, was three wide and having been maneuvered into a blind switch several strides later, idled along, came upon a usable seam in midstretch,
mustered up a sharp display of speed when given her cue, burst to the front end shortly afterwards and drew clear. WOW tracked the pace towards the
inside route during the opening phases, tipped to the outside and went on to travel two wide on the far turn, fanned out wider and wider for room once in the
stretch, finally procuring good clearance in path six deep into the furlong grounds, rallied down the center of the course to garner the place. SINGLE SOUL
(GB) three wide on the clubhouse bend, was one path closer to the rail on the subsequent one, swung out towards path five for the drive home, clawed its
way into the show slot. THIRD DRAFT raced within striking distance three wide on both turns, angled about four wide heading home, forged to a slim lead
during the ensuing furlong, but with a cluster in hot pursuit, got swallowed up and weakened. CADENCIA tucked behind eventual winner as the field neared
the end of the homestretch, got rated along tracking the pace, found itself with an open rail corridor by the end of the second bend, once the top one herself
had been tipped to the outside, advanced with good energy from upper to midstretch, then flattened out. CASH REFUND (GB) along the outside, was
towards two path during the initial stages, raced in the three path on turn two, got sent out seven wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all,
made no impact. FUCHSIA strung out three wide on the first turn, pursued the pace from path two once on the backstretch, got moved out six wide early
during the stretch run, rallied mildly. IRISH CRUSH (IRE) sent over to the rail at the top of the first bend, continued to save ground, came under a drive
coming up to the quarter pole, failed to fire. STUNNING PRINCESS stalked the pace two wide and gave way. MO SPICY steadied after striking the gate,
went on to save ground to no avail. FOOL YOURSELF showed the way from the inside, proved no match once challenged in upper stretch, relinquished and
backed away.

command straightened away, edged clear under a drive to prevail. A GREAT TIME three to four wide in pursuit, got let out spinning three to four wide into
upper stretch, ran on to just get up for the place honors in the final jumps. RISKY MISCHIEF established the front and showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, got collared
straightened away, kept on through to the finish and was just bested on the line for the place honors. MADELEINE MUST (FR) just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the last major share. ODE TO JOY tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened. I'LLHANDALTHECASH broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. SARATOGA TREASURE two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MENTALITY chased three wide and was wrangled off the heels of a rival five
furlongs out growing a bit rank and brushing with SARATOGA TREASURE, tucked to the two path through the turn, spun three wide for home and
weakened. MY SASSY SARAH dwelt at the start leaving the gate last and conceding five to six lengths to the front, crossed directly to the inside detached
at the tail of the field, advanced into contact with the rear of the field taking to the two path briefly before tucking back inside into the turn, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no headway. DENDROBIA saved ground near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHARE THE RIDE broke in line with TRIBECCA, eased back when put to a firm hold, sparred for control matched up with the aforementioned opponent
from the two path, inched up to that foe as the second fraction was being finalized, settled on the top of the lane and saw the rider go to work, vied with
vigour, struck the front end in the final seventy yards then dug in gamely to preserve the decision. STAN THE MAN chased the pace two to three wide, was
more the former spinning into the lane, rallied with willingness to grab the place. ABSENTEE off the inside throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, was in
the same path heading onto the top of the lane, battled hard to earn third. TRIBECCA abreast of the winner during the opening phases, got conceded the
top, glided onto the inside route approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, led the way, tailed by the top one, had the nemesis crank up the pressure as
the half was being completed, stepped into the lane and was set down, went at it on even terms with SHARE THE RIDE until well inside the sixteenth pole,
then weakened. DRAFTED two wide onto the turn, got angled five wide exiting it, made no impact. ARCH CAT took up the chase three wide on the turn, got
put to a drive in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and gave way. MAJESTIC DUNHILL broke last after fidgeting about prior
to the field being sent off and running, got guided over to the rail, stayed put having never made his presence felt.

field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, had rivals drift out in front and angled in to the two path to rally up wide open

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BRAVO REGINA got bumped between foes at the
start who each broke her way, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. LEXINATOR tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down swinging four wide for home, got bumped
with about three-sixteenths to go as LOVESTRUCK tipped out from the inside in reaction to BIG TIME LADY drifting in front and in turn bumped ISLAND
TREASURE before bobbling, then weakened through to the finish. THURSDAY broke out at the start bumping BRAVO REGINA in concert with ISLAND
TREASURE who broke inwards, tracked from just off the pace just off the inside, suffered an injury with five and a half furlongs remaining and was quickly
put to a protective hold and pulled up, then was subsequently vanned off. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the bumping at the head of the stretch focusing
on BIG TIME LADY and LOVESTRUCK. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
UNPRECEDENTED pursued the pace three wide, challenged in earnest coming into the lane, out-dueled MONTAUK DADDY during the ensuing furlong to
narrowly emerge at the eighth pole in front, edged clear, then held well to fend off the second place finisher. GRANDMAS FAVORITE tracked the pace while
taking the inside route, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, rallied down the center of the course for the place. MONTAUK DADDY cut over to
the inside after grabbing the advantage, showed the way, prompted by THREEPOINTNINENINE, had just shaken that foe off when confronted by the top
one stepping onto the head of the stretch, put up a fight before yielding a furlong later, had just enough late to save the show. PROPENSITY got set up in
path two in time for the beginning of the run around the bend, commenced the stretch one farther off the rail, narrowed in en route for the final significant
slice of the purse. IMPLIED VOLATILITY saved ground for the opening half, tipped into the two path at the top of the lane, made no headway. DARING
DISGUISE kept watch on the front runners from along the inside route, was put to a drive a short distance from the end of the bend, stepped into the stretch
and lacked the necessary response. RED MULE two wide onto the turn, got sent out three wide exiting it, had no rally. THREEPOINTNINENINE pressed
the pace two wide for a half and faltered. MY AMANJENA slow to settle into stride, rode the rail for nearly a half, swung out three wide into the stretch then
went on never having made his presence felt. SMITE travelled three wide on the turn, shifted out towards path five while backing away in the stretch.
