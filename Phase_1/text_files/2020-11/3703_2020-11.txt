wide around the far turn and rallied outside to gain the place. ADEEB bumped with IN HONOR OF ARTIE early, raced off the pace two wide, launched a
three wide bid around the far turn, took the lead leaving the quarter pole, led past midstretch but was overwhelmed late. SAFE AND SOUND was bumped
after the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced two wide just inside of IN HONOR OF ARTIE around the far turn, gained in upper stretch and flattened
out late. TONE FEELIN was strung out five wide around the first turn, advanced three wide down the backstretch, bid two wide between foes nearing the
lane, continued on the left lead and came up empty. ANGEL'S ENTRY set the pace along the rail, was collared leaving the quarter pole, continued on the
left lead and retreated through the lane. PERFECT ENOUGH chased the pace two wide around the first turn then faded inside. NOBLE NEBRASKAN had

Footnotes
HANGAR ONE bumped with GLOBALTROUBLECOCO early, saved ground bottled up behind the leaders around the turn, got through on the rail in upper
stretch, took over from MINDSHIP Q leaving the eighth-pole and drew away in hand. ROYAL MEETING steadied in the three-path heading into the turn,
moved out widest for the drive and was up late for the place. MINDSHIP Q set the early pace, left the rail open turning for home and was powerless to fend
off HANGAR ONE, and weakened through the late stages barely holding the show spot. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO got bumped between HANGAR ONE
and TURPIAL and checked sharply after the first sixteenth of a mile, saved ground into the stretch and ran on for a minor share. FORTY FLASH was a step
slow at the start, raced two to three wide around the turn, and posed no threat. TURPIAL bumped with GLOBALTROUBLECOCO early, raced two wide on
the turn, and tired. FRATELLI A. A. hit the left side of the gate and was off slowest, and made no impact three then four wide.

Footnotes
CAPTIVANT broke a bit slowly, raced well back outside early, advanced outside down the backstretch, moved four wide into contention around the turn,
seized command in midstretch and drew clear under a drive. SIMPLE STORY pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the half-mile pole, drew clear in
the two path around the far turn, led to midstretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but fought on outside a foe to maintain the place.
BEASAICHI raced in range two wide for six furlongs, angled to the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. BIZ
MAKER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. FOLEY SQUARE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the half-mile pole, chased inside
around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch when BEASAICHI came in in front of her near the three-sixteenths and faded through the lane. MATRACA
stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. RED KITTEN played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
CAFFEINE RUSH took over outside DRAWNTOMUNNY heading to the turn, moved in drawing clear, and widened through the lane kept to pressure.
UPTOWN QUEEN was outrun early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and finished well outside to pick up the place. ALLURING RUMBA was
prominent from the outset three wide, could not stay with the winner around the turn, and ran on for the show. PLATINUMCENTS raced three to four wide,
and was no menace. ISADELAS DREAM was crowded and steadied at the start, and lacked the needed bid three wide. KAY'S DREAM was no factor two
wide. DRAWNTOMUNNY grabbed the lead with a sharp start, relinquished command to CAFFEINE RUSH heading to the turn, and weakened inside
through the lane. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER came in after the start causing crowding, and was outrun. TRULY AMBITIOUS faded inside after three furlongs.
MAMA LONGLEGS was outrun four to five wide. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW was never close. BOOTSCOOTINSHUFFLE was crowded at the start and slow
to begin, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
SEE ME SEE YOU raced two wide between foes in the pack chasing the runaway pacesetter, closed determinedly outside and was up in the final strides.
SIERRA DIAMOND sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, held clear to deep stretch, shortened stride and was nailed. V K
PRINCESS chased the pace from the rail while racing just inside of the winner and had a mild rally. CORINTHIA raced off the pace two wide, angled four
wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. MISBEHAVING LADY failed to menace while racing three wide. REALLYGOODTIMES was forced out and
bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. GO ESTRELLA hit the starting gate, chased the pace three wide just outside of the winner and
came up empty in the lane. VAN KHOZAN was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing four wide. BACKSTORY unseated the rider and
briefly ran loose pre-race and was always outrun while racing well off the rail.

CAT'S ASTRAY bumped with SAYONARA BABY at the start, hustled out to a clear lead in the two-path, and maintained control through the stretch under
mild hand urging. SAYONARA BABY bumped with the eventual winner at the start, saved ground throughout, and finished evenly to stay clear of the rest.
FOXY MISCHIEF leapt up into the left side of the gate and was off slowest, swung four wide off the turn and rallied mildly. BIBIANA broke a step slow,
saved ground on the turn, and lacked the needed closing response. SWIRLING CANDY pursued the leader from outside into the turn, and gave way after
three furlongs. MAJIC FLASH broke outward, and could not gain four wide. SAMMY'S TOWN was finished early near the three-path. ALLENDE showed
brief speed, and faltered approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
RALSTON set a rated pace in the two path, opened up in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. GLORY OF FLORIDA stalked the pace inside, tipped
two wide to advance around the far turn, finished willingly to narrow the gap but was unable to reel in the winner. DANVILLE raced off the pace inside,
briefly angled out entering the far turn, quickly angled back in to save ground around most of the bend, made good progress in upper stretch then flattened
out a bit late. TURN ON THE MAGIC raced off the pace two wide, came under the whip near the half-mile pole and lacked the needed response. PRINCE
JAMES stalked the winner in the clear in the three path and came up empty. DAZZLING TRUTHS played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
ALABAMA SLAMMER pressed the early pace outside KHOCU, was under a drive by midway on the turn, entered the stretch three wide, hooked up in a
duel outside JUMP BACK JACK coming to the eighth-pole, and proved best through the closing stages. JUMP BACK JACK raced close up outside the early
leaders, moved inside around the turn letting the top two go, rallied along the rail at the head of the lane, changed leads awkwardly battling inside
ALABAMA SLAMMER outside the furlong marker, and came up second best. MY MAXAMILLION exchanged several brushes with ROYAL BIZ soon after
the start, then bumped with EL GUAPO, saved ground around the turn, shifted out a path or two and was along for third with an even finish. KHOCU set a
pressured early pace, edged away near the quarter-pole, then weakened between the top two finishers after straightening away for the drive. DUEL FUEL
dropped back toward the inside around the turn, then put in a mild run through upper stretch while not a factor. ROYAL BIZ brushed repeatedly with MY
MAXAMILLION up the backstretch, checked sharply racing very greenly along the rail into the turn, and remained outrun. MAUREENS' STAR was through
early. EL GUAPO bumped with MY MAXAMILLION midway up the backstretch, and was outrun four wide. DEPUTY INDY broke two lengths behind the
field, moved inside and remained well in arrears. UNIMPEACHED showed little four wide.
