Footnotes
YESTERDAYSPLAN lacked speed, raced near the inner rail on the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, was taken to the six path in upper stretch,
closed steadily outside horses and took the lead late. NANA'S SHOES circled the turn, floated to the four path turning for home, was lightly bumped by
WICKED SOLUTION near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly between foes. DAZZLE ME set the pace along the rail, opened up in upper stretch and
weakened late. WICKED SOLUTION , a forward factor three wide around the turn, chased the pace in the stretch, flattened out and drifted into NANA'S
SHOES near the sixteenth pole. FLOATING BY , rated down the backstretch, swung to the five path turning for home and failed to rally. MISDRIVEN saved
ground on the turn and gave way. DIAMOND PLAY , two wide on the turn, chased the pace for five furlongs then faltered.

CREAM set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened late. FEARLESS LASSIE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the
drive. FLIRTING MISS lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary response. SALIZA saved ground on the turn and was
not a factor. MISS MORENO hugged the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. REGAL BILLEE was outrun. VERBIEN O. P. dropped back.

DESBORDES sped to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail, saved ground around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear lead near the
eighth pole, raced on her left lead late, dug in and lasted. BROAD STORM lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. CAIRO QUEEN
, along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, was well placed in mid stretch and flattened. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS
saved ground on the turn, angled out for the drive, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. OUR FLIRTATION prompted the pace
outside the winner, gained a short lead in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. SHAKE D MOON , along the rail on the turn, swung to the five path
in upper stretch and failed to sustain her bid. PRINCESS GEORGIA , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch
and weakened. ATHENASWAY was no factor. THIRD CARD DOWN was outrun. HOLIDAY CURLS chased the pace four wide, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
XTREME MAYHEM lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, sprinted to the lead inside the three sixteenths pole, drifted out near the eighth pole and
prevailed while under encouragement. SHACKQUEENKING stalked the pace, raced three wide leaving the turn, bid for the lead between horses in upper
stretch and flattened out. RIPPOLINO circled horses into the stretch and rallied mildly. GOLDEN GULLEY , fractious in the starting gate, raced two wide
inside horses entering the stretch and lacked a rally. SOUL COAXING was outrun. THE BIG K prompted the pace outside WICKED PRANKSTER, gained
the lead on the turn and gave way approaching the eighth pole. WICKED PRANKSTER showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. RAPID
RESPONSE , three wide on the turn, retreated.
