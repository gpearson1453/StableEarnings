Footnotes
GREAT FACES raced close to the pace inside, awaited room on the turn and in the upper stretch, closed along the rail, got up near the sixteenth pole and
drew clear. EURO SUPRISE vied along the inside, inched away into the turn, yielded near the sixteenth pole and held for place. LOVE MY RIDE lacked
room on the turn, shifted out once clear, bid five wide and closed well to earn show. SURE OKIE vied to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. OKIE
NATIVE brushed at the start, pressed the pace, bid willingly and came up empty late. WHY NOT OKIE bobbled and brushed at the start, pressed the pace
to the turn, dropped back and gave way. WILLY WAMPUM lagged early while racing outside, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. YOUNG
SKYWALKER was outrun. ONE EYED JAKE veered out at the start to be away slowly, raced wide and did not threaten.

Footnotes
OFF TRACK stalked the pace while racing three wide, rallied on the turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch, drifted under left handed urging and
just lasted at the wire. SHAKE IT broke in hand and bumped at the start, was allowed to settle and raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch,
closed with a rush, was gaining fast late and was outnodded to just miss. MORHAWK stalked the pace while racing inside, bid willingly to contend for the
lead, didn't have enough late and settled for show in a game effort. SOURNOIS broke in and bumped at the start, raced close to the pace, bid and hung
late. VARNISHED was unhurried early, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. MULE SKINNER raced in the back, bid five wide leaving the turn
and closed well. LISBON raced mid pack inside, bid between horses into the turn, had little left and was not a threat. LOOKIN GOOD was rated early, saved
ground, lacked a bid and was outrun. NOT TODAY SATAN raced outside in an even effort and failed to threaten. NIALL vied two across, inched away on
the second turn, was headed at the top of the lane and stopped. UNBRIDLED POSSE vied inside, tired into the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
WILLY SPECIAL CATS was unhurried early, advanced around the turn, closed willingly and drew off under mild urging. BARNACLE BOY raced close to the
pace five wide, rallied into the turn to challenge and was no match for the winner. SUBSCRIPTION led early, bid between horses on the turn, had little left
and lacked the needed rally. SARACEN raced close to the pace, was in tight between horses, was steadied, taken back on the turn and offered a mild bid
only. POMEROY HAZE moved up to set the pace, weakened on the turn and faded. JUSTINS OMEN stalked the pace while racing inside, got through
along the rail on the turn and failed to respond. SAZERAC REMEDY pressed the pace while racing between horses and gave way on the turn. CLEVER
BOY was not a factor. MI SILVER HAZE was outrun.

Footnotes
LISA SMILES settled behind the pace, was roused on the turn, assumed command, drew away for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. KISS MY
GRITS broke in the air to be away slowly, raced outside, advanced to the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily and finished second best. KISSES FOR APRIL
ducked in at the start to be away slowly, was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well to earn show. REMNANT set the pace to the
turn, weakened and faded from contention. BREW CASA failed to threaten in an even effort. HEIGHTEN was never far back, lacked a bid and was not a
threat. KURIOUS KENNEDY raced close to the pace, bid three wide between horses on the turn, had nothing left and dropped back.
STRAWBERRYCREAM raced close to the pace while racing inside, tired on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes

the start, saved ground, closed well, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. PAYDIEM was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and was
along for show. CALIFORNIA KATIE lagged while racing outside and failed to threaten in an even effort. MOONRISE KINGDOM broke out, was never far
back and lacked a stretch response. ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY was outrun. SCAT FOR THE CAUSE bobbled at the start, had nothing left for the drive and lacked
a stretch response. LADY LUTE bumped at the start, never far off the pace, shifted out on the turn and gave way. CRESCENDO BLING was crowded at the
start, raced inside, was steadied along the backstretch, shifted out on the turn and lacked a bid. IZEAMIDNIGHTSTROLL was hustled along to show speed
to the turn, stopped and distanced the field.

Footnotes
TIZTHEBOSS broke out, sprinted clear to set the pace, was under pressure late and held on gamely. LEATHER AND LACE was unhurried early, saved
ground, bid inside leaving the turn, was in contention late and outfinished in a good effort. EUTYCHIA settled off the pace, raced inside, closed off the rail to
threaten, didn't have enough late and earned show. DIPPING IN was unhurried early, rallied around the turn, bid five wide and closed steadily. SHOBIZ
SUPERSTAR raced in the back, went wide in the drive and finished well. MISS ORIENTA was never far back, offered a mild bid only and failed to menace.
CHECKERBOARD broke slowly, was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. WAPI raced inside, showed speed to the turn and
flattened out. RIVER DEPUTY was not a factor. WILD PROSPECT was crowded at the start, rated along the backstretch and lacked a stretch response.
JULIARD HONOR broke in, chased the pace to the turn, tired and faded. ORATORY GLORY was outrun.

Footnotes
ONOMATOPOEIA raced in the back, rallied on the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. CREATIVE ART was never far off the pace,
bid willingly to loom a threat and was outclosed. INSURRECTION was unhurried early, bid off the rail, was in tight between horses late and finished well to
earn show. CALCULATING KING lagged inside, angled out for the drive and found his best stride late. TOUCHING RAINBOWS pressed the pace three
wide between horses, assumed command on the turn, drew clear and faltered late. LOOKIE LOO was void of early speed, went wide in the drive and lacked
a rally. ELUSIVE BLUEBOY showed speed to the turn, leveled off and faded. COUNT N GOLD stalked the pace while racing outside, bid four across on the
turn and gave way. MOST AMUSING vied inside to the turn, tired and stopped. ORDAINED CAT pressed the pace between horses, was through early and
dropped back.

Footnotes
UPGRADE ME was crowded at the start, lagged early while racing outside, rallied four wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best in a
long drive. BIG TINY was slow early, saved ground, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and closed willingly. M AND M GIRL bid
between horses entering the turn, was blocked and awaited room, angled out once clear and closed in a good effort. MISS AGGIE BLING stalked inside,
rallied leaving the turn, assume command and yielded late, grudgingly. KASSERINE PASS broke out, stalked the pace, bid and hung late to lose position.
TIZ THE STORM set the pace to the turn and gave way. AWARD IT was outrun. LIL MISS DE BUY was checked into the turn, dropped back and had no
further response.

FORTY NINE MODEL set the pace, was under pressure late and held well in a driving finish. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME stalked the pace, went willingly to
the wire and didn't have enough late to get by the winner. NAUTICAL GEM raced close to the pace, bid inside, closed steadily and earned show. NOBLE
LOVE was slow early, angled out for the drive and finished well. PEKA was never far back, closed steadily and gained late. JUSTATAPIN was slow early,
offered a mild bid off the rail, had little left and came up empty. KONA KATIE trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. ROYAL SOPRANO raced outside in an
even effort and was not a threat. CINDY'S PRAYER showed good early speed while racing inside, lacked a stretch response and faded. SWIFTOWN MISS
had brief speed only.
