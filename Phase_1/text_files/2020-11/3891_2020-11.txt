Footnotes
BOUND FOR BROADWAY chased the pace while three deep around the turn, bid for the lead outside ORIGINALY FROM DOT in upper stretch, dueled
with that one and narrowly prevailed. ORIGINALY FROM DOT raced in the two path between horses and dueled throughout in a game effort. CASTILLEJA
showed speed along the inner rail and disputed the pace in a willing effort. ALONG THE WAY bobbled at the break, saved ground on the turn, swung out in
mid stretch, raced on her left lead and failed to be a threat. SAND IN MY SHOES , two wide on the turn, was fanned to the five path by PERFECT KIND
entering the stretch and was not a factor. PERFECT KIND , along the inner rail on the turn, drifted wide entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
GREASEDLIGHTNING stalked the dueling leaders while saving ground mid turn, eased out into the lane, rallied between foes under left handed asking,
took command inside the furlong grounds and drew clear while kept to task. I'M SO MUNNY sped clear early, angled in to set the pace, was joined around
the turn, dueled past the furlong grounds and held well to save the place. I'MTHEKATSMEOW chased outside a rival, angled four wide into the lane, had
dead near mid stretch and hung. NYMUE'S TREASURE rated off the pace, saved some ground into the lane, eased out and offered a mild response. MISS
LAMBORGHINI angled out early, bid to engage the leader after a quarter mile, dueled and gained a short lead around the turn, fought on between runners
p[ast the eighth pole then faded late. BUFF'S IN LOVE chased off the rail, circled four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. LADY ROZINA failed to menace.

BOOM BOOM GONE cruised to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, opened a clear lead mid way on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and
was kept to her business in the drive. BEYOND FOREVER broke sluggishly, was rated in the two path between horses on the backstretch and around the
turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied. FLOATING BY , rated behind horses for six furlongs, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and
rallied. SO INNOCENT chased the pace, raced three wide on the far turn and weakened. LETMESLIDEBYYOU saved ground on the turns, angled out
turning for home and weakened. DANCINGWITHPAYNTER lost ground on the turns and was not a factor. JUMPSTARTMYHEART , four deep the far turn,
was outrun.

TIZ MANDATE , well off the rail leaving the turn, swung to the four path in mid stretch, closed outside horses and was up late. MOSS BOSS chased the
pace, bid for the lead between horses in the drive and just missed. LAST INVESTMENT , fractious going to the starting gate, raced along the inner rail,
swung out in mid stretch and rallied. JUNGLE CRY broke a bit slowly and awkwardly, was well off the pace for a half mile, swung outside and closed late.
GOLDEN GULLEY chased the pace and was steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail near the eighth pole. THE BIG K bobbled at the break, sped to
the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and gave way. LUXERO was no factor. SCOTTSDALE , wide, chased the pace and gave way. DANDY
YANKEE was outrun. DANCE PANTS , three wide on the turn, failed to menace in a dull showing. LEAVE 'EM LOADED dropped back. DYNAMIC DAY

Footnotes
AIN'T DA BEER COLD hugged the inner rail, bid for the lead on the far turn, dueled through the stretch, was brushed by MARKET CAP near the sixteenth
pole, dug in tenaciously, brushed with that one late and narrowly prevailed. MARKET CAP , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace behind horses down
the backstretch, angled to the three path in upper stretch, cut in front of OMATI when drifting near the eighth pole, drifted in near the sixteenth pole brushing
with the winner and just missed in a game effort. ROYAL NUMBER saved ground both turns stalking the pace, swung outside approaching the sixteenth
pole for clear sailing and rallied. ERAWAN, in tight at the break, settled well back, awaited room saving ground near the quarter pole, swung to the five path
in mid stretch and rallied outside foes. BASSO , near the rail into the stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole, drifted in under right hand urging then drifted
out again. OMATI showed speed in the two path, was battling for the lead in upper stretch then steadied to avoid the heels of MARKET CAP approaching
the eighth pole. DEPOSITORY , four wide the first turn, weakened. NO ONE TO BLAME , four wide turning for home, weakened. TIZ GOLDEN , three wide
both turns, weakened. Following an objection by the rider of OMATI, MARKET CAP was disqualified and placed sixth.
