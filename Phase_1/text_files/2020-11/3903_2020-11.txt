Footnotes
MY LILLY PAD got to the rail near the half mile marker, shook loose and was clear on the far turn, was under steady left handed pressure to deep stretch.
ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE broke slowly, moved up four wide early, was three wide on turn and had no late gain. CRAZY BEA saved ground in second flight
and faded late. KEY LIGHT broke slowly, saved ground to mid stretch, angled out and was no real threat. LUCKY IMAGINATION clipped the heels of
REMAIN ANONYMOUS and stumbled in the opening furlong, raced wide and failed to be a factor. REMAIN ANONYMOUS drifted out after start and had
her heels clipped, was three then two wide in second flight then tired. SUNDAY INN, two wide and just off the pace, was left with the rail and tired.
IMPERIAL LADY, between foes, showed little.

PETULANT DELIGHT set the pace inside, fought back after being headed near mid stretch and got the nod. NILEATOR broke right hitting the side of the
starting gate, recovered quickly and joined for command two wide, stuck his head in front near furlong grounds and held on stubbornly. DIAMOND SETTER,
in the four path and outrun early, split rivals on the final turn and was along for show. TERRY'S CHARM, between rivals early, swung out very wide into
stretch and had no late rally. DRUMMER DON, wide and just off the pace, tired. POSTINO'S VOW saved ground in second flight before tiring. UNDER THE
GRAYDAR, in the four path and just off the pace, tired. ATTA KID was wide and failed to menace. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE showed nothing.

Footnotes
STABILIZE in the four path and just off pace, eased out wider through stretch and won going away. VINAIGRETTE dueled for command two wide, was clear
mid stretch but then was no match late. SIZZLING ROMA, racing between foes, bid on the turn and finished evenly. IRON LILLY saved ground while never
far back, swung out near stretch and was gaining late. BANGLE GAL, in the three path while just off the pace, had no closing kick. STARLITE MISSION
broke slowly and was outrun for a half, split foes and failed to menace. GRACE AND PEACE broke slowly, was very wide on the turn and never threatened.
ENCHANTABULL saved ground and failed to menace. DEEP CANYON vied for command inside then stopped. BAYLEAF, three wide and just off the pace,
tired badly. LA FLAMENCA was well placed between foes then was finished on the turn.
