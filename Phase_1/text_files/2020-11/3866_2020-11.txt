Footnotes
CASTLE FIVE accelerated to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the rail rounding the turn, was steadily handled to late stretch then
taken in hand the final yards. TAPTAPTAP was shut off checking leaving the chute then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, angled to the six
path rounding the turn, dug in from the top of the stretch to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. JOOPSTER chased the winner through
the backstretch and rounded the turn just off the rail, was outfinished for second while dueling for third and just lasted in third. PORT MORE steadied early
then picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well to improve his position. ON THIS DAY angled in leaving the chute and gave
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BOLT gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn four
wide then flattened from the head of the lane. WILLIE THE WHALE was pinched back leaving the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn about the four path and finished evenly. BEARCAT KITTEN gave chase and came through the turn about the seven path. KUCHEROV gave chase
through the backstretch then faded on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Castle Five, lodged by the rider of Taptaptap,
though, found no offense.

Footnotes
PEPPA STARR closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on
well. DOOR BUSTER gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and dueled for second in the upper stretch then finished well while gaining on the
winner. MY PRETTY EYES chased the pace inside and improved off the rail rounding the turn then dug in from the head of the lane and held on to share
third. JUBA'S HOUSE gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and dug in down the lane to share third under the wire. LA RUFINA broke outward and
had her heels clipped by Feel The Love then was hustled up to press the early pace, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened the final furlong. SPLIT
THE CHECK pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back off the rail rounding the turn and weakened inside the eighth pole. DYLADDIE
gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and showed little more. OBSCENE chased the pace outside, rounded the turn in the six path
and showed little more. SWISS HORIZON raced well back, appeared to be off stride and was not encouraged. FEEL THE LOVE was shut off and clipped
the heels of La Rufina, and, as a result, lost her rider. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards disqualified La Rufina to last place for causing the incident
leaving the gate.

Footnotes
GOLDEN APPEAL stalked the earlier pace two deep then took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths,
raced clear at the rail rounding the far turn then steadily encouraged to hold on well. BLACK STEEL rated just off the pace inside the first turn, started a
three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail then dug in down the lane and just lasted for second. CHARITABLE
VISIT raced six wide into the first turn then settled off the pace entering the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, eased outward inside the sixteenth pole and just missed second. LOOKIN' SMART saved ground off the early pace then picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. PAPA RALPH J settled off the
pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, drifted into the stretch and showed little
more. SCOTTISH MAN raced off the pace in the four and five paths the first turn, left the turn outside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole then
flattened stride about the three path of the far turn. FEISTY AND SASSY raced five wide into the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole then faded
through the far turn. STROLLANOTHERTIME was not a factor. AUTS REVOLUTION set the early pace inside, was caught approaching the three eighths
pole and faded down the backstretch.

Footnotes
MY LOVELY GIRL chased the earlier pace four wide and took the lead at the quarter pole, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn to
discourage the stretch effort of Moon Me Again and held off the late arrival of NICE N' BROAD, who broke awkwardly then picked up the chase toward mid
track, rounded the turn about the four path, closed well to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. MOON ME AGAIN was hustled along
inside to take the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the quarter and relented the final sixteenth. GANDARI broke a step slow then
picked up the chase inside, angled to the six path rounding the turn and finished evenly. MANAROLA gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn
about the four path and finished evenly. SPRING LASS gave chase saving ground then flattened stride leaving the turn. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT gave chase
outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and showed little more. DARK TRICKS was hustled along with the lead the opening three sixteenths of a
mile, continued chase off the rail on the turn then weakened. DRIVE IN was not a factor. NO STONE UNTURNED was hustled along with the pace while
two deep and between horses but was roughed from contention approaching the quarter pole and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
SHAMROCK KID chased the pace inside and improved at the rail rounding the turn, angled four wide approaching the top of the stretch and dug in to get up
the final strides. RING THE BELLA set a pressured pace inside, raced clear leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides while holding onto second.
COMMAND THE CAT chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, angled two deep into the stretch, dug in to be a late threat and, while
outfinished for the win, was closing on the runner-up. SEA LOVER pressured the early pace from the two and three path, but dropped back into the stretch
and flattened stride the final sixteenth. WE SHOULD TALK chased the early pace outside, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly.
MYWALKTOFREEDOM chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. BUCKED TOOTH gave chase toward mid
track, came through the turn about the six path then flattened stride. BARNSTORM chased the early pace toward the outside, saved ground into the turn
then angled out approaching the head of the lane and showed little further. TOP HAT TITAN gave chase off the rail then weakened into the lane. BIG
HAMBONE gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the seven path then weakened.

wide entering the stretch and dug in to get up later yards. MAJESTIC SEAS chased the early pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail then angled to the
four path toward the head of the lane, dug in past the eighth pole and took second at the wire. MORGAN COUNTY chased the pace inside, raced at the rail
rounding the turn and got up for third the final yards while nipped from second under the wire. NOT A TRICK was hustled along between horses to set a
pressured pace, dug in from the head of the lane but was caught flattening stride later yards. BEST SHOT pressured the pace and raced at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn then flattened stride later yards. SCYTHE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five and six paths
and finished well. EUTAW STREET gave distant early chase, saved ground on the turn then flattened through later yards. INDIAN SOUND chased the
pace, drifted to the eight path on the turn and showed little more. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased the leaders through the backstretch then rounded the turn

Footnotes
PAINT IT GREEN angled in to stalk two deep and moved to even terms toward the three eighths pole, dueled with the nod into the far turn, drew clear in the
upper stretch and was steadily handled to widen. RAELYN'S STAR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
off the rail, eased three wide into the stretch then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. VINTAGE GIN angled to the inside to rate a slim early lead,
was met at even terms nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, dropped back through the
upper stretch then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. WAKES UP HAPPY saved ground the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished well widest. WHIZ PASS raced off the
pace in the two and three paths then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little in the
stretch. RUN ON ENERGY settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn about the four
path but proved empty in the lane. RAINBOW RIVER stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole then weakened at the rail rounding the far turn. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME steadied at the rail leaving the first turn then bid only mildly from the three
eighths pole. WALKNTHEPLANK angled out through the first turn and settled outside into the backstretch, then weakened through the far turn. LIZZIE'S
LAST saved ground through the opening turn then faded down the backstretch.
