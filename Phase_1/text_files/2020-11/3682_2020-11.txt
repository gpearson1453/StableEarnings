Footnotes
LOPIN JOE was reluctant to load, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew clear. BRIGHT WAY pressed the pace while racing three across, lacked the
needed late rally and finished second best. LATENITE GOLD broke slowly, moved up between horses to contend, vied to the sixteenth pole and faltered. W
F RIP TIDE was never far back, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT bore out along the backstretch, advanced to the turn,
swung wide and lacked a bid. CLABBERS WIN was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and improved position. SMOOTH BLUES raced inside,
was checked repeatedly into and on the turn and dropped back. MR. MCFEELY failed to threaten in an even effort. MOJAZZ was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
BLUE BEES set the pace to the turn, responded to pressure, drew clear and extended his lead while kept to task. WAYLAY pressed the pace, challenged
for the lead on the turn, swung wide, fell back and was no match late. ATTILA'S LEGEND rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and closed
well to get up for show. QUANTICO JOE stalked the pace while racing along the inside, shifted out for the drive, bid and came up empty. JEDI FEVER
showed good early speed, dropped back and offered a mild late bid to improve position. TOX broke slowly, offered a mild bid near the inside and improved
position. MOVE IT MISTER swung wide leaving the turn, lacked a bid and was outrun. IMPUTED was outrun in an even effort. SKEETER WHO stalked the
pace three wide, fell back on the turn and faded through the stretch. RAMBLIN TOUCH was not a factor. BISCUIT SNATCHER had the rider lose his irons
at the start and failed to contend. DRINKIN FIRE WATER raced in close between horses, fell back and was checked on the turn and had no further
response.

ISLE BE GABBY saved ground, shifted out and was roused into the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging.
PROSSER'S KITTEN chased the pace in a steady effort, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. MS HIGHSPEED was unhurried early,
advanced along the rail on the turn, had little left and settled for show. MIND CHANGER set the pace with a clear lead to the second turn, tired and gave
way. RUN AND TELL DAT was outrun in an even effort. CATTY DOM raced in the second flight three wide, tired on the turn and gave way. TELLINGLY
trailed the field.

Footnotes
FLY FIRST CLASS vied between horses early, was steadied, taken back, angled out on the turn, bid willingly, dueled in tight quarters late and proved best.
PUT YOUR PANTS ON was never far off the pace, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, dueled in tight quarters late and was outfinished in a
good effort. SENDITLIKECHILLY angled out, closed with a rush, was gaining late and got up for show. MR VIEW raced inside, lacked room from the turn to
late stretch and closed once clear. BERNIN SENSATION was steadied after the start, angled out in the upper stretch, bid and came up empty. CRUMAN
TAPOTE moved up four wide, dueled to mid stretch and faltered. GATHERING EVIDENCE dueled to mid stretch and faltered. E BAR GOLD broke
awkwardly to be off slowly and raced evenly. VIDAKS BACK dueled past the eighth pole and faltered. BLANK IT had an unfair start and was declared a
nonstarter. SWITCH BACK broke out, was in tight after the start and was not a threat. SOLID GOLD BAR was steadied after the start and failed to contend.
Following a stewards' inquiry, BLANK IT was declared a nonstarter.
