Footnotes
SNICKET bumped at the start by LUCKY LIZZIE who broke out a step, chased along the inside in aim of the leader, was briefly hard held off that rival's
heels nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch briefly put to urging before having the inside seam shut down and was forced to steady at
the three-sixteenths off the heels of MUNNINGS MUSE, got roused as the rail opened a furlong out and rallied on through to issue a challenge showing
good courage to take command in the final strides and prevail on the wire. BEAUTIFUL KAREN coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside
in the two path, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, came in under an off sided stick to the
two path forcing MUNNINGS MUSE to be taken over her heels at the sixteenth marker, dug in knocking heads to the finish and was caught in the final
jumps to the line. MUNNINGS MUSE coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the aforementioned foe to
the outside, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, came in slightly shutting down the rail and forcing SNICKET to steady off her heels at the
three-sixteenths, got headed a furlong from home, had BEAUTIFUL KAREN come inwards directly in front and was guided out over her heels at the
sixteenth pole while weakening in the late stages. CALIDAD stumbled at the start recovering outwards and conceding about two lengths to the front, chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home and tired. LUCKY LIZZIE broke out a step at the start bumping
SNICKET, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. VIENNA CODE chased four wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS chased five wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STRAW INTO GOLD squeezed in the shadow of the starting gate, was sighted pulling on the bit entering the main course, tucked along the rail soon
afterwards, was patiently ridden thereafter tracking the front runners while venturing onward along the inside route, got cued up angling three wide spinning
onto the head of the stretch, got taken in hand lugging in right around the three-sixteenths pole, settled down and became a professional by the beginning of
the final furlong, closed the gap on the one to catch with strong energy, finally wresting away the decision near the wire. RUSE pursued the pace towards
the two path, at times drafting behind the leader, went into the lane and was given his cue, out-dueled VODKA LEMONADE to emerge as the new leader by
midlane, came under aim from the top one soon afterwards, was determined to the end but got nailed. ACTION JACKSON got moved to the outside after
the field had been sent on its way. tipped wider on the backstretch, eventually departing it from path three, commenced the stretch one path farther off the
rail, rallied with willingness to be along for the show. BOSS BEAR tucked along the rail, rode it until the quarter pole, got spotted in path two at the top of the
lane, narrowed in. VODKA LEMONADE away without apparent mishap, quickly established control, was rated along showing the way mostly from path two,
and whenever not in it by trespassing onto the outer edge of the inside route, got cued up for the drive in response to impending challengers, was reeled in
a few strides later, steadily backed away. ARROWHEART kept watch on the front runners from along the rail, slipped to the outside leaving the
three-eighths pole, went two wide into the stretch, got outfinished. DREAMPOINT underwent a two wide pursuit, came into the lane, gained but without
making an impact. HE'S A LUCKY DEVIL stalked the pace from path two, fanned out six wide from upper to midstretch becoming the widest of all, had no
offering. HANGOUT strung out three wide on each bend, angled five wide into the lane, folded. MIGHTY MEISTER pocketed, faltered. SCOTTY took the
inside route, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, came up empty. KANITHAPPEN chased the pace two wide, swung towards path five for
the drive, gave way.

Footnotes
EARNED SUCCESS three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command just
inside the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive inside the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat growing leg weary and just held on at the finish.
VICAR'S LEGEND grew detached saving ground at the tail of the field when outrun early on, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside through the final furlong to threaten for it all and just missed at the end.
TALE OF MIST got brushed at the start by EARNED SUCCESS and then by BREEZE BURNER, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. SUMMER BOURBON chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. FLASH DRIVE coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home and took to the rail straightened away, dug in and was collared inside
the three-sixteenths, weakened in the late going. ETHAN HUNT broke in at the start bumping PROFESSOR SNAPE, chased three to four wide under a ride
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PROFESSOR SNAPE bobbled at the break then got bumped by
ETHAN HUNT breaking in a step, chased two to three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
BREEZE BURNER broke in at the start brushing TALE OF MIST, chased four wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper
stretch and weakened.

HIEROGLYPHICS settled along the inside after the field had been released, kept watch on the front runners from the pocket, continued along on the same
set-up all the way to the end of the second bend, got cued up for the drive home, out-hoofed MR. ALEC for path three as the twosome traversed through the
furlong grounds, forged to the slimmest of leads, bumped with the runner up as they battled each other with vigour with approximately a sixteenth to go, saw
them trade some leans thereafter, gamely got the job done. MR. ALEC took up the chase from path two, had WINNING FACTOR take over the role of
primary pursuer as the second fraction was being finalized, sat within striking distance keeping watch from path two, got set down nearing the quarter pole,
slithered into path three, lost position to the winner in the general area of the eighth pole, saw a duel between them spark off shortly afterwards, bumped
with then exchanged some leans with the nemesis from the sixteenth pole onward, wound up one denied. CONVICTION TRADE pursued the pace two wide
during the opening phases, tipped wider and travelled in path three on the far turn, got sent out into path five in upper stretch, rallied for the show. WINNING
FACTOR strung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, pounced upon BLAMELESS coming up to the midway point on the backstretch, vied on even terms
from that juncture to midlane, proved no match for the first two finishers, weakened after releasing the advantage. ARTHUR KITT (GB) saved ground early,
raced towards path two on the second bend, came into the lane, lacked the necessary response. BLAMELESS contended for the top from along the inside
to the eighth pole before giving way.

Footnotes
WHITE FROST secured the pocket, got rated along keeping watch on the front runners within striking distance, was cued up slipping to the outside coming
up to the quarter pole, took path three for entrance into the lane, closed the gap, altered into the four path in midlane for further racing clearance, maintained
her momentum and continued to make up real estate, struck the front end with approximately seventy yards to go and edged away. LIJANA gathered after
breaking slightly to the outside, pursued the pace three wide, challenged in earnest as the widest of three front runners on near even terms with other
spinning onto the head of the stretch, wrested away control, came under aim from the winner springing from the eighth pole, relinquished well inside the
sixteenth marker, had plenty left to salvage second. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS off the rail throughout, travelled three wide on turn two, commenced the
stretch one path wider, mustered up a mild response to claim the show award. EVVIE JETS underwent a two wide journey, went into the stretch, gained
steadily for the final significant slice of the purse. FOOL YOURSELF strung out three wide towards midpack, angled five wide into the lane, made no
headway. MISS BONNIE T failed to fire appreciably after undergoing a ground-saving journey. TIC TIC TIC BOOM took the inside route, stepped into the
lane and rallied milldy. ACTUALLY rated along prompting the pace from path two until the end of the second turn, bid from between rivals entering the
stretch, wasn't up to the task at hand and backed away. LITTLE NUTTER loped two wide during the opening phases, raced in the three path on the far turn,
fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, made no impact. COWORTH PARK rode the rail to no avail. DAME OF MALTA
chased the pace two wide for nearly three-quarters, got moved into path three for the drive, had no offering. BELLA BETTINA showed the way from the rail,
was put to the test by a pair of opponents turning into the lane, caved in.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC PATTERN got bumped at the start by SILVER TOKEN who broke inwards and in turn bumped BEE CATCHER, got leaned on and pinched
between foes briefly after the start, settled three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, advanced mildly to mid pack into the far turn and through to
the quarter pole when swinging four wide into upper stretch put to urging, rallied to issue a challenge and take command coming inwards a path just inside
the eighth pole, edged away under a light drive and was taken in hand seventy yards from home holding safe from a late closing rival. BEE CATCHER
bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from SILVER TOKEN, chased two to three wide from near the rear, got set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to coming surging late at the winner but was staved off safely to the finish while along clear for the place
honors. RIVER KNIGHT three then two wide through the first turn establishing the front midway, showed the way in hand along the inside down the
backstretch, tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and was collared inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. TIERGAN saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, had NINJA DUST
lean inwards at the seven-sixteenths attempting to take over the rail position and was placed to light coaxing to keep his inside route, got leaned on from
that station through to the three-eighths before being mildly shuffled back, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last
major share. K. K. ICHIKAWA tracked the pace along the inside, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
SILVER TOKEN broke in at the start bumping TRAFFIC PATTERN into BEE CATCHER and leaning on those foes placing TRAFFIC PATTERN in tight
between briefly after the start, raced three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three
wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. HARD COUNT forwardly placed two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late going. KID CHOCOLATE chased along the inside, came under coaxing just
off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NINJA DUST tracked the pace just off the inside, came
inwards slightly and leaned on TIERGAN from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths placing that rival in tight along the rail, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. BLIZZ two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing tipped four wide at the
seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and trailed. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter and half mile fractions were hand timed.

Footnotes
WOW BROWN took up the chase two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, closed in, appeared to poke a head down in
front by the eighth pole, fought fiercely matched up with JEMOGRAPHY from that station onward and gamely prevailed. JEMOGRAPHY cut over to the
inside route approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed put until the end of the bend, angled five wide entering the stretch, straightened away
and kicked into his best, gained ground readily, got engaged in a spirited tussle with the winner during the final furlong, battled hard to the end but wound up
denied. NOTORIOUS FLIRT pursued the pace three wide on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, mustered up a response sufficient enough to
secure the show. SARATOGA PAL at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out four wide on the turn, got steered out into path six
from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, inched his way up to grab the last major check. BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE in sharply springing from the
starting gate, was forwardly placed proceeding along the backstretch, fell back during the run around the bend, with the tempo having softened, was put to a
hold prior to going two wide into the lane, lost additional ground during the ensuing furlong on its own power, saw the pilot resort to encouragement right
around the eighth pole, tipped out towards path four a sixteenth later, made some headway eh route to minor spoils. RIKEN pressed the issue from path two
for the opening half, narrowly struck the front as the second split was about to be posted, was turned loose in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker,
relinquished soon afterwards and backed away. THE REVENGER hustled from the gate, was put to a ride once more sparring with RIKEN on the turn, got
headed as the half was being completed, faltered. ROLL WITH MY POSSE three wide entering the turn, was sent out five wide exiting it, had no offering.
BEACHSIDE one-paced saving ground for a half, was moved out three wide into the lane, trailed.

Footnotes
NORTH DAKOTA tracked the pace just off the inside among the main body of the field behind a spurting away leader, came under coaxing tipped three
wide at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly on the outside in tandem with RED
KNIGHT to his inside and was up in the final jumps to score. RED KNIGHT three to four wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well in concert with the aforementioned foe rallying between foes through the final sixteenth
and missed at the end. ZIYAD (GB) coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in pursuit forwardly placed among the main flight, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take first run at the once well clear leader taking command a furlong from home, dug in
under a drive under growing late threat and was caught by a pair in the final strides. SADLER'S JOY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed well through the stretch to the finish to be up for the last major share.
DOCTOR MOUNTY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
kick but was outfinished. AQUAPHOBIA three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered up a
mild bid but was outfinished. POSTULATION four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outkicked. REAL FACTOR coaxed from the gate, spurted away in hand along the inside, came under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive growing leg weary and got displaced a furlong out, weakened in the late
stages. TINTORETTO (GER) tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made
no headway. FAME TO FAMOUS four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. CHANGI tracked the spurting leader showing the way for the main body of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths,
cut the corner into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
EMPIRE EXPRESS guided onto the inside route after the start, inherited the pocket early on the backstretch, got rated keeping watch hardly within striking
distance, closed the gap during the run the far turn as the pacesetter began to show small signs of fatigue going about its ambitious mission, got roused
cutting the corner into the stretch, continued to make up ground, muscled its way towards path two in the general area of the eighth pole, resulting in a
couple of foes, each making no discernable headway at the time themselves, shifting wider, gobbled up the leader a few strides later, then held on late to
fend off the second place finisher. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY took up the chase two wide after stumbling at the start, found refuge along the inside route after
departing the backstretch, remained on hold mired in traffic stepping onto the top of the lane, continued to idle along stuck behind others, slipped towards
the outside after finally attaining room with approximately a sixteenth to go, closed well, but fell short. SELFMADE hung out three wide on the clubhouse
bend, worked out a tuck closer to the rail midpoint on the backstretch, was still in path two in pursuit of the front runners on the subsequent turn, angled
back into path three for the drive, mustered up a mild response en route for third. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE two wide heading for the first turn, circled by
DAITHI to take over, cut over to the inside, spurted off to a commanding lead, lost much of that lead on the second bend, spun into the lane, was reeled in a
short distance beyond the eighth pole, stayed on sufficiently so to earn the last major check. BRICCO saved ground for the opening six furlongs, got ridden
two wide into the lane, shied to the outside as the winner was itself maneuvering to the outside in midstretch, flattened out. BIELEFELD rode the rail until the
quarter pole, swung out four wide for the stretch run, gained but without making an impact. SPIRITUAL KING chased the pace two wide, was given its cue
for the stretch drive, shied out and away from a shifting EMPIRE EXPRESS near the eighth pole while not making any headway at the time. OPEN
LENGTHS two wide travelling on the first turn, was towards the inside on the next one, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, failed to fire. DAITHI
forwardly placed along the inside, was under a firm hold conceding the top to JUSTINTIMEFORWINE on the opening bend, tipped two wide at the top of the
backstretch and went on to stalk the aforementioned rival from afar, kept at it for three-quarters and folded. TRUE PALACE loped along the rail for over
three-quarters, went on to take a four wide stroll into the lane to no avail. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter and half mile fractions were hand timed.
