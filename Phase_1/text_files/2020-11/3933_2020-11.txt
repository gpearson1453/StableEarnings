QUENCH MY THIRST bore out following a sharp break, stayed inside horses while making the pace for about three-quarters then faltered. CLINIC had
position along the rail but lacked the needed closing response. MARTINI KID was caught wide around the first turn, made a three wide run around the final
turn then flattened out. BUSTIN THE BANK made a mild run in the two path into the stretch then tired. FIGHTIN PHIL chased the pace two wide into the far
turn then stopped. PAPA JOEL wasn't far back early between horses then stoped. TRICKED UP was outrun. BLACK JACKET was no factor. LUCID
DREAM was reluctant to load then trailed.

Footnotes
SWEET MAGIC MOMENT settled inside, swung out three wide nearing the stretch for room, closed outside and was up in time. SUSI SOLE chased, moved
two wide to command nearing the stretch, drew out in early stretch then gave way late. BELLA INVASION was slow early, came out three wide on the final
turn while moving but lacked a strong closing response. DATA DOLL made the pace close to the inside to the stretch then tired. SEEKING THE THRONE
raced two wide and tired. DIXIE QUEEN lagged then passed tired ones. FLYING PLEASANTLY stopped. AAMAAL was reluctant to load, stopped and was
vanned off after the race.
