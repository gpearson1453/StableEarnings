Footnotes
FORT MARSH came inward in the opening strides, quickly cleared to the lead, set the pace while positioned three wide on the turn, opened up when driven
in the lane, and held. TINDERELLA settled toward the rear, hugged the rail on the turn, bid inside into the lane, drifted out midstretch, and continued to gain
to the finish. GO YEOWOMEN settled toward the rear between horses, raced three wide near the rear on the turn, came two wide into the lane, and rallied
to prove best of the rest. PARA VIVIR tracked the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, proved no match for FORT MARSH into the
lane, and was outfinished. KINGSBURY DREAM chased well off the inside early, continued midfield positioned four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
lane and kept on mildly. WILDWOOD SCAT settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, and passed inside tiring horses in the lane. LADY WARRIOR
chased midpack down the backstretch and three wide on the turn, raced four wide between horses in upper stretch, and flattened. REND LAKE BABY
chased the leading trio early, tracked five to six wide on the turn, and weakened in the lane. LUCKY FEVER was sent to track the leader outside of PARA
VIVIR early, briefly took closer order outside FORT MARSH into the turn, proved no match past the three eighths, came three wide into the stretch and
weakened. ME TOO MO was reluctant to load, hit the gate and veered out in the opening strides, settled outside near the rear, floated further outside into
the turn, remained closer to the outer rail than the inner rail around the far turn, floated even closer to the outer rail into the lane, and never threatened.

Footnotes
TURFMEISTER was bumped by RECKLESSNESS in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the chasing flight through the far turn, drew closer inside of
RECKLESSNESS from past the eleven sixteenths, raced at the inside of the tracking flight into the second turn, bid outside of AGGRO CRAG approaching
the five sixteenths, headed him past the quarter pole and drove clear. NEXT MONDAY chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, continued to
chase down the backstretch, improved to join the tracking flight three wide into the clubhouse turn, bid four wide past the three eighths, was driven three
wide into the lane, proved no match for TURFMEISTER but kept on best of the rest. RECKLESSNESS broke out and bumped TURFMEISTER, tracked the
pace through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, raced between horses in the tracking flight into the far turn, lost ground three wide past the three
eighths, kept on outside in the lane and passed a weakening horse late for the show. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) cleared to the lead, saved ground through the
first turn, continued on the lead on the backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, was confronted approaching the five sixteenths by TURFMEISTER
and NEXT MONDAY to his outside, was headed past the quarter by TURFMEISTER, and weakened. DARK WOOD (IRE) chased three wide through the
first turn, settled in second last for the backstretch run, raced in the two path on the far turn, and mustered no bid. PRUDENT HERO broke inward, soon
trailed, raced well behind the field while taking both turns in the two path, was mildly driven in upper stretch, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CAT ATTACK was well rated at the outside of the leading flight, took over under a hand ride past the quarter pole, bounded clear, felt one strike of the right
handed crop after drifting out a bit past midstretch, and continued full of run to the wire. BIT O BODIE chased inside of READY AT MIDNIGHT into the
clubhouse turn, settled back outside of MIKE'S LADY in the second-last flight down the backstretch, continued patiently in the four path on the far turn,
came four wide into the lane, and rallied for place. FORTY PIECES raced at the inside of the leading flight, was pushed along to keep up with CAT ATTACK
through the far turn, proved no match for that foe into the lane, continued to give chase, but lost the place past the sixteenth mark. MIKE'S LADY settled
toward the rear of midpack, inched forward to midfield on the backstretch, raced in the two path around that bend, was taken four wide in midstretch, and
rallied mildly while racing a bit greenly. READY AT MIDNIGHT chased outside of BIT O BODIE through the first turn, advanced three wide into the
backstretch, chased behind the second flight for the backstretch run, was pushed along for a bid into the second turn, took that bend in the four path, was
urged three wide into the lane, proved no match for CAT ATTACK, and flattened out in the final furlong. JULIAISON settled at the rear, raced two wide in the
rear flight down the backstretch and through the far turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. SCENT OF SUCCESS tracked the
leading pair, continued at the inside of the tracking flight in the two path on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and was outpaced from midstretch.
SILVER SULLY settled toward the rear, raced at the inside of the second-last flight down the backstretch, continued in the two path on the far turn, and
mustered no bid in the lane. SHE'S MY RIDE chased the leading trio early, inched forward to track the leading pair outside of SCENT OF SUCCESS down
the backstretch, continued in range between horses through the far turn, and weakened between horses in the lane. DRAKAINA settled near the rear, raced
at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, and had no response inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
WAKE UP JOE was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, and held gamely under a drive in the lane. RUN AWAY BETT tracked the
leader inside of MAY WE ALL down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, loomed two wide in the stretch, but could not get past WAKE
UP JOE while drifting out late. NYOMAN raced two wide in the chasing flight early, chased in the four path on the turn, was taken four wide into the lane,
drifted out further but nonetheless rallied. MAY WE ALL raced two wide in the tracking flight early, continued three wide in range on the turn, proved no
match for WAKE UP JOE and RUN AWAY BETT into the lane, and flattened out under a drive. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN came away a bit awkwardly, soon
trailed, raced in the two path on the far turn, and passed between tiring horses in the lane. PLEASANT MOON settled at the rear of the main group, raced in
the five path on the turn while still near the rear, was driven three wide into the stretch, and offered no rally. CHIEF OAKIE DOKIE raced at the inside of the
chasing flight, gradually began to lose ground past the five eighths, saved ground toward the rear around the turn, and came up empty inside under a drive
in the lane.

Footnotes
LAND MARK DEAL was bumped soundly by SPECIAL PRYCE in the opening strides and then pushed into POLITO as a result, chased inside of POLITO
early, tracked in the pocket while saving ground on the turn, rallied inside of CRAFTY JACK into the lane, and held sway under a drive. CRAFTY JACK set
the pace while pressured early, inched clear past the three eighths while racing in the three path, was engaged in upper stretch by LAND MARK DEAL to
his inside, and kept on while proving unable to contain that foe in the final furlong. OPUS EQUUS tracked the pace three wide, was driven into the lane
while still three wide, gave chase willingly to the wire but did not have enough to reel in the leading pair. WAVE'NDUMONI was away slowest, steadied in
the opening strides after SPECIAL PRYCE bumped LAND MARK DEAL in front of him, soon trailed, raced in the three path with the rear flight on the turn,
was driven inside in the lane, and rallied mildly. COCO BRAVADO settled near the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, and offered no kick between
horses in the lane. POLITO was bumped by LAND MARK DEAL in the opening strides after that one was bumped by SPECIAL PRYCE, chased outside of
LAND MARK DEAL early, was driven in the four path on the turn and five wide into the lane, and came up empty in the lane. SPECIAL PRYCE broke out
and bumped LAND MARK DEAL in the opening strides, pressed outside of CRAFTY JACK, began to flatten out into the turn, lost ground in the three path
around the bend, and had nothing more for the drive. MOON FLASH settled in second last, raced in the rear flight in the four path on the turn, offered no bid
in the lane and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES was well rated on the lead, kept on unfazed as LEMON BLITZ applied mild prompting into the backstretch, continued kindly on the
pace in the three path on the far turn, and drew off under a drive in the lane. COWBOYS DREAM tracked between horses through the clubhouse turn,
settled back to chase between horses for the backstretch run, was pushed along for a bid into the second turn, was driven in the five path near the five
sixteenths, proved no match for the winner into the lane but kept on best of the rest. LEMON BLITZ tracked three wide through the first turn, advanced to
put token pressure on READTHECLIFFNOTES into the backstretch, tracked the pace in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane between
horses, proved no match for the winner and was outfinished for the place. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced at the inside of the tracking flight through the first turn,
continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was driven into the lane but weakened. PENTIMENTO chased
three wide into the first turn, continued four to five wide down the backstretch, chased in the six path on the turn, kept on four wide into the lane and came
up empty under a drive. DOMIKATE settled in the rear flight inside of LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS, was driven into the lane, and offered no bid.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS hopped at the start, settled two wide in the rear flight, continued in the four path on the far turn while still in the rear flight, went to
a drive in upper stretch, and offered no response.

pole and held sway. YO Y ME broke in and bumped NOT CHOPPED LIVER in the opening strides, tracked well behind the leading trio outside of
MINISTER'S GLORY down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, rallied four wide and gained to the wire.
STORMY PACIFIC chased outside of MR. LUV MAKER on the backstretch, continued midpack in the five path on the turn, rallied four to five wide in the
lane, and narrowly missed place. HALO HUNTER was sent for speed, vied outside of GIRLOLAMO'GLORY, was overhauled by LONG STATION past the
furlong pole, and flattened out. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY broke inward, was sent to dispute the pace inside of HALO HUNTER, vied inside of that foe on the
lead until they were passed by LONG STATION just inside the furlong mark, and flattened. HELLOFAGUY raced at the inside of the second-to-last flight,
saved ground through the turn, was taken four wide into the lane, came out further and offered a belated six wide rally. MR. LUV MAKER came out and
bumped NOT CHOPPED LIVER in the opening strides, chased inside of STORMY PACIFIC down the backstretch, continued to chase in the two path on
the turn, and took mildly closer order three wide between horses in the lane. COME ON DOVER was reluctant to load, settled toward the rear three wide,
swung out and was driven six wide into the stretch, floated further out and passed tiring horses eight wide. MINISTER'S GLORY tracked well behind the
leading trio inside of YO Y ME, saved ground through the turn, was driven inside into the lane, rallied mildly to midstretch, and flattened late. ANDREAS
