while just lasting for the place. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE chased the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded along the
rail but just missed the place. AREYOUINABAND forced the early pace outside but could not keep pace. OPEN TAB could only improve position. C C
CROWN'S CHOICE went evenly. PAC FOR HAWAII was no factor. SPLENDOR HOUR had a steady fade. LEGALLY BINDING vied from the outside early

Footnotes
EXTON stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily inched forward up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded
when sat down for the drive and was along in time. POPS LEGACY pressed the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
responded entering the drive and was up for the place. MOMENT off a step slow, rushed up to duel from the early margin, remained engaged up the
backstretch, gained a clear margin entering the second turn, remained clear at the eighth pole but could not last. FORGOTTEN COAST unhurried early from
the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded but was too late. SI FAMILIA could only pass tired ones. CHAOSMOS forced the early pace
outside and faded. BELLARMINE chased the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. RANDY PAUL was no factor. DON'T SPLIT TENS was
finished after going a half. MAJID dueled from the inside and gave way.

DRAX unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded to duel with
MAYAN GHOST through the drive and was just up over that one late. MAYAN GHOST dueled from the inside, early, gained a clear margin up the
backstretch, was engaged by the winner entering the second turn, dueled with that one but could not match strides. TROPHY DADDY dueled from the
outside early, chased the pace up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but was no match late while best of the rest. MY CALL up close early from
the inside, had nothing left for the drive. MY HARVEY chased the early pace inside and tired. MONEY LUSHKA was never close. K FOR KOHEN had little
interest.

Footnotes
PRIVET MOON broke sharp from the inside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, opened a clear margin at the eighth pole and held sway. AWESOME GERRY chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the
second turn, responded and was getting to the winner. GENERATOR forced the early pace from the outside, made a bid and rallied late for the show.
DREWHUSTLE forced the early pace inside but had nothing left. SAINT SCOTTY was never close. DRAIN THE CLOCK up close early from the outside,
broke an iron up the backstretch, lost rider and walked off.
