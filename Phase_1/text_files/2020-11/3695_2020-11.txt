Footnotes
KING'S HOUSE set the pace two wide, fought back after relinquishing near mid stretch, regained in deep stretch and slowly inched clear. IRONBOUND
saved ground dueling, stuck his head in front near furlong grounds, resisted gamely and gave way grudgingly. THOMAS KNIGHT, three wide and just off
the pace, angled in through stretch and rallied. METAPHORICAL broke slowly, raced between foes early, eased out through stretch and rallied.
DODDSPRIVATELABEL, three wide, was never a serious threat. SHAFT OF LIGHT, between rivals and just off the pace, had no rally. DRAXHALL
WOODS broke slowly and failed to menace. COLORADO GRANDSLAM, fractious in the gate, lunged at the start, saved ground and tired. ASK CHUCK
was never a factor.

Footnotes
JAMIE'S WANDERLUST dueled between rivals for the early lead, battled two wide on the turn, edged away nearing the furlong marker and held on well
under urging. ADHWAA raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside and gained late to get up for
second. OUR DIXIE BLUE dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch, yielded and saved the show spot. BROOKLYN
HEIGHTS raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied in the three path and weakened in the final sixteenth. BIG BROWN EYES raced
off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. ALICE HELEN was outrun. CORBALLY dueled three wide for the early lead, gave way on the turn and stopped.

lapped on winner, fought gamely but just couldn't go by. LATE BREAKING NEWS, between rivals early, waited briefly for room near quarter pole, moved out
and then drifted wider through stretch and held on gamely. GRIT'N'GRIND saved ground to stretch, eased out a bit and split rivals in early stretch and
closed. KING KOA angled to the rail after the start, steadied in tight entering the first turn, challenged on the final turn and then gave way. KINGSVILLE
broke slowly, raced in the four path and failed to menace. MOON GATE WARRIOR, four wide and just off the pace, tired. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ, three wide
and just off the pace, tired.

WICKED AWESOME raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied outside of HEY MAMALUKE turning for home, dueled outside in the
final furlong and wore down her rival after a long drive. HEY MAMALUKE was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, made a rail bid nearing the far
turn, took over, drew clear, dug in gamely inside when challenged in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly at the end. DIXIE SERENADE was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace, moved up inside at the quarter pole and rallied mildly for third. DREAMER'S MOON set the pace racing a bit off the inside,
dueled briefly entering the far turn, then faded. GETOUTTAMYWAY raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BOB'S MY UNCLE broke slowly, was three wide early, raced between rivals on backstretch, came four wide into stretch, took the lead leaving furlong
grounds and slowly inched clear. THREE PHASE broke slowly, was between foes early then moved out three wide, went to the rail on the far turn and
finished well. SPEED SYNDROME was extremely wide while outrun, continued very wide and closed. FIVE MORE MINUTES set the pace in three path,
remained and factor to deep stretch and then weakened late. ASPHALT PAVING prompted the pace two wide and faded. ARMAMENT saved ground to
stretch, swung out very wide and passed faders. TOMATER GATOR, two wide in second flight, tired. GRASSHOPPIN, wide into and rounding the first turn,
raced just off the pace then tired. HARPOON broke slowly and then showed nothing. FIST OF THOR saved ground just off the early pace then stopped.
THE RIDER OF THREE PHASE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST BOB'S MY UNCLE FOR NO PARTICULAR INFRACTION DURING THE
RUNNING OF THE RACE. THE CLAIM WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.
