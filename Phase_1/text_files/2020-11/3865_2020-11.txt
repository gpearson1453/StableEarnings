Footnotes
COMING UP ACES ducked out at the start carrying out MIGHTY CONTENDER, was quickly righted to dispute the pace along the inside racing into the
backstretch, kicked clear entering the far turn and held sway on a widening margin under firm encouragement. DEORA STORE tracked just off the first flight
along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, then continued with a steady bid racing into the lane to prove best of the others. SEMI
CHARMED DAY, reserved inside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, switched out on the backstretch, swung five wide racing into upper stretch
coming under pressure to advance, shifted to the rail nearing midstretch and continued well enough to earn a share . SUPREME IRENE, reserved outside
foes in early stages, angled to the rail after a half tracking off the second flight, gained along the inside to split foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. MIDNIGHT LEWIS, held up between foes in the last flight early, angled four wide racing into the stretch while being roused to advance but
had no closing bid. TO THE BANK, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit in that path to the
far turn and gave way nearing the lane. BILLY NOT WILLIAM settled between foes in early stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch but failed to
menace. MIGHTY CONTENDER, carried out at the start, pulled his between foes to force the pace racing into the backstretch and emptied out racing into
the far turn.

Footnotes
THE GEEK was urged between foes, then along the inside prompting a rival's pace in the opening quarter, was held up momentarily when caught in close
quarters leaving the midway point of the turn, was urged to bid for command along the rail when presented an opening racing into upper stretch and edged
forward late to prevail in time under left handed pressure. MACHO CLASSIC broke readily to force the pace outside rivals in the opening stages, edged
forward racing into the turn, dueled between foes past midstretch resisting the winner to the end but proved only second best. HE'S WILD hopped, then was
shuffled a bit at the start, recovered to track off the first flight between foes, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge but flattened out
in the closing stages. Z U AT THE RACES, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched out racing into the turn to advance in close
quarters between foes, then angled four wide in late stages while lacking the needed late response. ZACROSS settled last while angling to the inside and
never seriously menaced. KING'S STORY was a brief factor tracking off the first flight racing three wide on the backstretch but faded early.

AND WON settled outside rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gained position three wide between rivals racing into upper stretch, angled to the
inside when presented an opening leaving midstretch and continued with a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement.
WAR CHEST broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, was prompted to resist several challenge whiles shifting out
racing into upper stretch, contested the issue to late stages and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. KISS MY NOTE tracked
just off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, advanced three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command racing into the lane but was
outkicked by the top pair. MEMORY BANK, reserved in the last flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady late
response to gain position to the end. CANDY STORE tracked off the second flight outside rivals, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and continued
evenly between rivals in the closing stages. MY BARILEY settled between foes in the last flight and made some belated progress three wide between foes
late. HONEST TO GOODNESS tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out to bid four wide nearing upper stretch but quickly
flattened out. UPHAM angled to the inside early stalking just off the first flight under light restraint, saved ground to upper stretch, was urged to advance
inside foes but lacked the needed late bid. BAROQUE, urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. PUBLIC SAFETY
tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half but faded early.

Footnotes
DAZZLING DIABLO was hustled away to a clear advantage soon after the break while angling inwards a bit, held sway racing a bit off the rail into upper
stretch and maintained a safe margin under firm handling. LASTEN IMPRESSION tracked the pacesetter outside rivals as part of the second flight in the
opening stages, angled to the inside entering the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. BEE HAPPY ATTACK tracked off the
second flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position while prevailing for
a share. PACKED HOUSE broke out brushing JUNIOR SPRADLIN, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes, shifted four wide racing into the
lane and gained some position in an even effort. LONESOME DREAM switched off the inside early while being prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter racing
into the turn, continued in the three path to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. JUNIOR SPRADLIN, bumped, squeezed between foes, then shuffled
back at the start, failed to menace thereafter. CRAFTY OAK'S RUN angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing through the backstretch but faded
early. HELLFIRE broke inwards exchanging bumps with JUNIOR SPRADLIN and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SQUIRRELY MIKE was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing into the first turn, continued to set the pace on a narrow margin
outside a rival through the backstretch, edged clear racing into upper stretch and just held OFF TO THE BEACH to the end under firm encouragement. The
latter was rated inside foes as part of the second flight in the opening half, steadily gained contention while shifting out three, then four wide nearing upper
stretch, came through close quarters splitting foes just off the inside in late stages but continued willingly to the end to challenge the winner nearing the wire.
BE AN INSPIRATION, came through close quarters racing into the first turn, was rated between foes in second flight through the backstretch, was prompted
to advance between foes just off the inside while caught in tight quarters entering the far turn, then leaving the second bend but continued to make a mild
gain along the inside late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE, forwardly placed three wide between racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path
racing into the far turn, switched outside foes entering the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BE YOUR OWN HERO was settled inside a rival in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide on the far turn to make a menacing move nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive.
BERACUDA HEART, caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to a forward placing, made brief progress in that path to gain terms with
the pacesetter nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. DIRTY BAD BOY settled outside a rival in the last flight early and failed to menace.
DISTINCT THUNDER, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace in the opening four and a half furlongs, gave way racing into the far turn. NORTHERN
THRILL, held up off the first flight racing three wide into the first turn, retreated early.

SAINT ALEXIUS, came around traffic in the opening stages to prompt a rival's pace, took over nearing the bend, went clear while angling to the inside, then
maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. STOPSHOPPINGAMY, bumped soundly at the start, dropped out last recovering stride, gradually
gathered momentum just off the inside racing into the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued willingly inside foes to prevail for the place
honors. TRANS MISSISSIPPI broke readily, was urged prompting the pace just off the inside in the opening stages, conceded the lead to track a rival racing
into the bend, switched outside that foe while being urged to challenge racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. WILDWOOD MAGGIE
settled well off the leaders while switching out four wide racing into the turn, angled six wide entering the lane but continued with some interest to gain some
position. LOGI tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and faded in late stages. SEVEN SEVENTEEN tracked off the first flight
between foes racing into the bend and came up empty entering the stretch. MUWAAN MAT broke outwards bumping STOPSHOPPINGAMY, was righted to
track off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and gave way entering the lane. GODSGIFT, caught four wide tracking just off the second
flight racing into the turn, lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
KIPPER DOODLE broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace just off the inside on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, then came under stout
pressure racing through the stretch to held DUSTY MILLER safe to the end. The latter angled to the rail tracking the leaders as part of the second flight
racing into the bend, came through inside the leader to challenge in upper stretch, continued in close quarters through late stages but finished willingly to
prevail for the place honors. COUNTRY ASSETS tracked off the second flight between rivals racing into the turn, split foes just off the inside in late stages
and continued willingly to prevail for a share. MORA VALLEY, forwardly placed just inside the pacesetter in the opening stages, switched outside that foe
racing into the turn while prompting the pace to upper stretch but weakened late. KLONDIKE ANNIE was rated off the second flight along the inside and
continued evenly into the stretch. THAT LUVIN FEELING, reluctant to load, then restless in the gate, raced four, then five wide as part of the second flight to
the stretch and steadily faded late. LUCKY AT JUSTICE settled between foes off the second flight racing to the turn and failed to menace. AMERICAN BIZ
settled outside foes in early stages and proved no threat. BRECHIN'S COMMAND made brief pursuit of the pacesetter three wide between foes into the turn
and gave way into upper stretch. SINGING ALLI hesitated slightly at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA tracked the pacesetter four deep as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, steadily gained on that foe three deep
nearing upper stretch, lugged inwards despite left handed pressure in the closing stages but wrested a narrow advantage from MIZ BLUE in time under firm
handling. The latter broke sharply, sprinted clear while angling to the inside racing into the turn, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly to late stages hut came
up second best. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH shifted out three wide early while being urged in pursuit of the pacesetter, continued to close the gap between
foes nearing upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SISTER RULER, off a step slowly, settled between foes racing to the turn, split rivals nearing
upper stretch, then shifted four wide in the closing stages while gaining some position. WHITE LIES settled between foes dropping off the second flight
racing to the turn and continued with interest to improve position between rivals into the lane. COWGIRL KIMMIE, caught in close quarters just after the
start, settled inside foes, then shifted four wide racing into the turn but lacked a rally. TIZALADYBUG pulled her way between foes in second flight racing
through the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the turn to make brief progress after a half but flattened out in the drive. PERFECT MINE hopped at
the start, settled last early and proved no threat. SIERRA SUMMER tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the turn and soon faded. RED VENUS
tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the three furlong marker and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
TETSU, bumped lightly at the break, angled inwards dropping off the second flight racing into the backstretch, steadily gained position on his own courage
while shifting out racing into the far turn, moved to challenge the pacesetter in tandem with GALINDO nearing midstretch, then wrested the advantage and
kicked clear late under some right handed pressure. The latter tracked the leaders three wide between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to bid for command nearing midstretch but proved no match for that rival late. BEAST MODE,
bumped soundly at the start, settled last to the backstretch, split foes while angling four wide racing into the lane and continued to improve position. AL
TAWEEL, caught four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn to gain some position racing into the lane
but had no late bid. TRES GENERACIONES, urged inside foes disputing the pace into the backstretch, dispatched rivals to gain a brief advantage racing
into upper stretch but gave out in the drive. ROLL OUT tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. GIANT'S
FORREST broke out bumping at the start, was urged to position in second flight but retreated early. Z U SOON dropped back early. MARCO'S DREAM was
urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes nearing the far turn and soon gave way. DRIVER DAN swerved
out at the start bumping BEAST MODE, was righted, then urged three deep into the backstretch to briefly gain terms with the first flight prompting the pace
but was through after a half.
