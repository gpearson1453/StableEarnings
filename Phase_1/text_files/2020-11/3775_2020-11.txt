then came over in front of rivals at the furlong marker and drew clear. KRISTI'S COPILOT set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way into
the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole, dug in gamely between rival in midstretch and held on for second. LOST IRON raced three wide early, stalked the
pacesetter, chased on the far turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, lacked room and was forced to check passing the eighth pole, then continued on
for third. GUNS OF STEEL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail and was
outfinished. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY stalked two wide, then chased and closed belatedly outside. PRINTER raced three wide off the pace, advanced
entering the far turn, rallied three wide past the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, then was bumped by DRUMMER DON and forced to check at the
eighth pole. IMMUNITY raced off the pace inside and failed to respond. EDEN RIDGE was bumped at the start and outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry, along

ZONE, in the three path WHILE just off pace, took the lead in early stretch, resisted gamely and just failed. MOUNTAIN TREE was in the three path, went
between rivals on the far turn, moved out wider but had no late kick. JUMP SHOT stumbled badly leaving the gate, saved ground while outrun and passed
faders. RISING STORM, two wide, was blocked near quarter pole then fell back. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN saved ground just off the pace then tired.
RACEHORSEINARED broke slowly and raced very wide. YES IT'S BONIFIDE set the pace in three path and had little left. MANAGING RISK broke slowly
then raced very wide.

MACH TRIAL chased two wide, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch drive, took over and pulled away under urging. CAPE MAY FERRY set
the pace on the inside, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the stretch and held on for the place spot. SHAFT OF LIGHT chased inside, moved up
inside on the turn, made a rail bid at the top of the lane and finished evenly. SAMADI SKY chased between rivals, came two wide into the lane and was
outkicked for the show spot. WHITE BLUFF reluctant to load, raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and bested the others. REFUSEING raced off
the pace, had a ground saving trip and passed tired ones. SUNRISE SATURDAY raced off the rail, off the pace, went five wide at the quarter pole and did
not factor. KID MAC COOL chased four wide, came five wide into the lane and faded. SMART ROYAL T chased three wide and faded. ADULATION chased
between rivals and gave way. SMART AND TOUGH chased five wide, continued five wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ECLIPSED MOON, off slow and outrun early, rallied wide on the final turn and into and through stretch, closed determinedly and finished in a dead heat with
FLATEXCE. FLATEXCEL set the pace inside, relinquished near mid stretch, fought back and regained in deep stretch, wasn't able to hold off ECLIPSED
MOON and finished on even terms with that rival. DANCE FOR ORO, just off the rail and just off the pace, eased entering the stretch, stuck his head in front
near furlong marker and fought gamely to the wire. DONNIE BRASCO, just off the rail, rallied on the final turn, eased out through the lane but had no late
kick. JONES TAXI saved ground to the far turn, eased to the outside but was too late. EASTPORT, very wide into and rounding first turn, remained wide
and was no factor. GAMBIT prompted the early pace two wide then gave way. LEGACY'S PRINCE saved ground and dropped back. MASS APPEAL, in the
six path, showed little. LI'L DUDE L DO IT, wide and just off the pace, was finished after a half. SPIDER JORGENSEN failed to menace.

outside and was along late for the win. BIRD KING raced three wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained
command, then was no match for the winner. RUBY BLEU set the pace on the inside, then dueled with FOREST FIRE, weakened in the lane and held for
third. KOAN raced three wide early, went four wide past the half mile marker, chased and failed to rally. ZIPPY raced two wide off the pace, then inside and

Footnotes
SOUPER FLY OVER set the pace between, moved in on the turn, drifted out a bit while clear through the stretch and won driving. FACTOR THIS IN saved
ground early, moved out wide into stretch, took up chase but failed to sustain his bid. REGAL QUALITY, in the four path, split foes on the turn then angled
out but was too late. EMPEROR JOHN raced very wide and passed tiring foes. CREDIT CYCLE was never a serious threat. FIRE MISSION, wide on the
backstretch, went between foes on the turn and was no factor. NICK THE CARDSHARK, three wide and just off the pace, tired. MOE TROUBLE raced
between foes while just off the pace, gave way.
