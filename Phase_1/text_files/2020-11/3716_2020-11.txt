Footnotes
CLASSICAL MAGIC sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, shifted off the inside
racing into the lane while being roused to turn back ARCH FLYER and edged forward late under firm right handed pressure. STORMY EMPIRE, pulling
hard outside foes tracking off the second flight into the backstretch, advanced three wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival
for second. ARCH FLYER, urged to a forward placing prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into the stretch to
strike the front midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. THAT LUVIN FEELING tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, saved
ground throughout but steadily faded in the closing stages. TEARS FOR PAULA tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, was eased back after
a half to track off those rivals and lacked a closing response. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE switched outside a rival while appearing to drift out despite correction
racing into the first turn as part of the last flight and failed to menace thereafter. ENCHILADA worked her way to the inside tracking off the second flight early
but offered no rally.

Footnotes
MANHATTAN LEGACY broke out and bumped MIKE'S LADY in the opening strides, tracked the pace two wide, headed the leader near the quarter pole,
cleared under a drive and held while kept to the task. RUBY ROUND HERE tracked the leading pair inside of MANHATTAN LEGACY, saved ground
through the turn, was taken three wide in upper stretch, drifted further out and chased on second best. BULU bobbled out of the gate, settled in second last,
improved position inside when pushed along on the turn, and kept on under a drive in the lane while proving no match for the leading pair. ABBMAR broke
out and lightly bumped CATCHING TIME in the opening strides, chased in the three to four path on the turn, kept on near the center of the track under a
drive in the lane but lacked the needed kick. MIKE'S LADY was bumped soundly by MANHATTAN LEGACY in the opening strides, trailed in the two path on
the turn, and passed tired horses. SILVER SULLY was pushed along four wide midpack down the backstretch, weakened in the six path on the turn and had
nothing further in the lane. CATCHING TIME was lightly bumped in the opening strides by ABBMAR, cleared to the lead while racing keenly, saved ground
through the turn, began to weaken past the three eighths, was headed near the quarter pole and faded inside. PER RULING 204108 FROM THE ILLINOIS
RACING COMMISSION, MANHATTAN LEGACY WAS DQD DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

SMART SET angled inwards while being urged to a forward placing prompting the pace in the three path racing into the turn, shifted in nearing midstretch
while exchanging solid contact with the pacesetter but continued resolutely to wrest command from that foe and kick clear under brisk handling. BELLE
BREZING broke inwards bumping GUEST IN Y HEART, was righted to tracked outside foes in the second flight racing into the turn, angled four wide racing
into upper stretch and continued willingly to prevail for the place honors. TIZ SUSAN ANN tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight,
saved ground to the lane and prevailed for a share while no match for the top pair. GUEST IN MY HEART, bumped at the start, settled last while angling to
the inside racing into the bend, swung out six wide entering the lane and found her best stride late. SUPERSTAR DIVA, reserved dropping well off the
leaders, shifted out to advance in close quarters three deep between foes in the stretch but gained position to the end. WILLOW MOON sprinted to the lead
while angling to the inside, held sway on a narrow advantage to upper stretch, ducked out under left handed pressure exchanging contact with the eventual
winner midstretch and quickly gave out. WINNAGER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the bend then continued evenly to late
stages. CHROME ATTACK angled inside tracking off the second flight and lacked the needed late response. RANK AND FILE tracked off the second flight
between foes and steadily faded in the drive. BOURBON 'N DITCH tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into the
lane but had no rally.

Footnotes
WARRIORS GEM pressed outside of ONE WAY HOME, encroached outside that foe past the half mile mark, vied outside him around the turn and into the
lane, led for good near the three sixteenths, drove clear in the five to six path, and held. NYOMAN settled at the rear, took closer order when pushed along
in the three path on the turn, chased behind WARRIORS GEM to midstretch, was taken inside of that foe past the furlong mark, kept on with interest but
could not reel the winner in. BEST YOU EVER SEEN tracked behind the leading flight, was taken three wide into upper stretch, continued in range to
midstretch but was no match in the final furlong. CAN'T SAY NO stalked outside the leading pair down the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn and
into upper stretch, was in range to the furlong mark, and offered no kick late while drifting out. SUNNY'S STORM settled in second last, chased five wide
through the turn and into upper stretch, and lacked a bid. ONE WAY HOME set a pressured pace, vied inside of WARRIORS GEM on the turn and into
upper stretch, was no match for him past the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn on a narrow advantage, edged forward racing into upper stretch, then
shifted off the inside in the closing stages while maintaining a safe margin under firm handling. KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF broke readily to force the pace
outside a rival racing into the turn, proved no match for that foe late but continued with a grudging effort to edge a rival for the place honors. GREELEYS
ICE, urged to a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the leaders, saved ground into the stretch and continued willingly while being just outkicked for
second. STORMINSIDE settled last outside foes in early stages, was held up momentarily avoiding close quarters racing into the turn, angled five wide
entering the stretch and was going well late. DRAMA STAR settled between foes in the last flight early, angled inside leaving the turn and improved position
between foes just off the inside late. LITTLE BALTAR, restless in the gate, broke slowly, tracked off the second flight between foes, then along the inside
racing into the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch but had no final bid. LEE'S LUCK tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn,
was fanned four wide into the lane but had no rally. ROMEO O ROMEO was rated off the second flight racing a bit off the inside into the turn and continued
evenly between foes to late stages. COUNTRY COOL ducked out at the start, was settled outside foes racing to the turn and was fanned six wide into the
stretch while proving no threat. FRENCH MINDED angled to the inside racing as part of the last flight in the opening stages, was held up avoiding close
quarters nearing the seven sixteenths marker while going a bit erratically and lacked a further response. TIO CHUY angled inwards to track just off the
leaders between foes in second flight, but faded from contention early.

SOVIET chased outside of FINAL CALL early, was pushed along into the turn and responded with three-wide improvement, was driven four wide into the
lane, sustained a rally, and got up three wide in the final strides. SPECIAL PRYCE was sent for speed inside, set the pace in the two path on the turn, kept
on under a drive in the lane but was caught in the final jumps. POLITO tracked the leading pair inside of OPUS EQUUS early, saved ground through the
turn, race into the lane at the inside of the tracking flight, ran on under a drive inside, altered outside of SPECIAL PRYCE near the sixteenth, sustained his
bid and narrowly missed between horses. OPUS EQUUS tracked the leading pair outside of POLITO, chased between horses on the turn, came into the
lane between horses, chased on with continued interest but was outkicked. COCO BRAVADO veered out at the start, settled at the outside of the rear flight,
raced in the three path on the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch, was bumped by FINAL CALL approaching the three sixteenths as that one drifted
out, and chased on mildly. SMART TRIAL was wrangled to the rear, saved ground through the turn, and offered no rally in the lane. FLORIDA TWO STEP
was sharply away, stalked outside of SPECIAL PRYCE early, tracked the pace in the three to four path on the turn, flattened three wide into the lane and
continued to weaken. FINAL CALL chased inside of SOVIET at the rear of the main group early, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, was taken
four to five wide in upper stretch but drifted out even further under a drive, bumped into COCO BRAVADO and clipped heels with that foe approaching the
three sixteenths, stumbled, unseated his rider, was apprehended by an outrider further down the stretch and walked off the course. THERE WAS AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
FOLDS OF HONOR was urged between rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch while
increasing the margin, then just held the late challenge of TAP'S BIG SHOT to the end under left handed encouragement and firm handling. The latter
momentarily delayed proceedings when requiring an equipment adjustment before the start, settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, then
made steady progress four wide racing through the stretch to just miss while exchanging light contact with SNOOSE GOOSE approaching the wire.
SNOOSE GOOSE, urged to a forward placing three deep prompting the pacesetter into the bend, continued in that path into the lane but was outkicked in
the closing stages while exchanging light contact with TAP'S BIG SHOT nearing the wire. IDAHO TORNADO, urged to a forward placing along the inside
prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn, switched a bit off the inside racing into the stretch contesting second but faded in late stages. WELLFIELD,
held up last in the opening stages while angling to the inside, shifted out to improve position between rivals in the final three sixteenths. BOLD ATTACK
angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, faded in the drive, then was vanned off the course following the race. MAJOR BIZKIT
settled between foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. MEMORIES OF ARTIE bobbled at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders
racing four wide to the turn but was through after a half.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES set the pace inside of PENALTY SHOT, edged clear of that foe past the three eighths, went to a drive approaching the three
sixteenth mark, drew away under a drive past the sixteenth, and was let up late when the affair was decided. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled in second last
through the first turn, improved to midpack past the three quarters, switched three wide near the three eighths, continued three wide into the lane, and
chased on while no match for the winner. PENALTY SHOT was hustled for speed, attended the pace outside of READTHECLIFFNOTES, proved no match
for the pacesetter past the three eighths, went to a drive in upper stretch, kept on between horses but was outfinished for the place. MALIGATOR settled at
the rear, took closer order approaching the far turn, rallied in the two path on the far turn, sustained that bid inside in upper stretch, and flattened out in the
final furlong. MUCH CLASS was bumped by HANNITY in the opening strides, floated four wide through the first turn while tracking the leading pair,
continued in range of the leading pair down the backstretch and into the far turn, was outpaced from the three eighths while racing four wide around the far
turn and offered no more in the lane. HANNITY broke out and bumped MUCH CLASS in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair through the first turn,
lost position into the backstretch, was pushed along from last approaching the half mile mark, came up empty in the two to three path on the turn and was
no further factor in the lane.

Footnotes
DUSTY MILLER tracked off the first flight three wide between foes from out of striking distance racing to the turn, steadily gained contention between foes in
that path racing into upper stretch and wore down BINDING TIME at the wire to narrowly prevail in an all out drive. The latter tracked just off the first flight
while shifting off the inside in the opening stages, made steady progress advancing between foes to challenge for command racing into upper stretch,
gained the advantage midstretch, then grudgingly resisted the winner but just failed to contain that foe. LILLET, off a step slowly, then shuffled out of close
quarters at the start, steadily regained position inside foes racing into upper stretch, then shifted off the inside to split rivals three deep in the closing stages
while exchanging light contact with TRUE TO JEANINE but continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. EADS BRIDGE angled to the inside tracking
off the first flight racing into the bend, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. TRUE TO JEANINE settled off the second flight along
the inside in the opening stages, shifted out racing into the lane, was fanned four wide midstretch while exchanging light contact and had no closing
response. LADY MAGNA, brushed at the start, was a brief factor tracking off the second flight racing four wide to the turn but faded early. ANNIE TIME
GIRL, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, raced between foes in the last flight into the turn but lacked a rally. MY MISS MARILYN was hustled clear
of the field while angling to the inside in the opening quarter, held sway on a clear margin racing into the turn but emptied out abruptly after a half.
LEISHLANICK was urged along outside foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out.
