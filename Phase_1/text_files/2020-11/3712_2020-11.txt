Footnotes
REFI NOW broke in and bumped GHOSTER at the start, stalked just off the leader from outside, bid alongside rival at the quarter pole, took control in upper
stretch and kicked clear. STONE'S RIVER stalked the pace inside, angled out into the three path on the turn, finished willingly through the final furlong but
could not threaten the winner. GHOSTER bumped leaving the gate, set the pace up the backstretch, angled in on the turn, headed at the quarter pole, lost
the lead in upper stretch, weakened and lasted for the show. CRASH CORRIGAN dwelt in the beginning and came away slowly, trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced along the inside then moved out three wide, showed a late effort and missed the show. FLACTEM LEGACY stumbled leaving the gate,
dropped back early, went three to four wide around the turn and had little left for the drive. FLASH OF GLORY tracked off the inside, three wide around the
turn and faded. DEPUTY GARY broke out a bit at the start, traveled in the two path through the turn and proved no menace. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED
THE START OF CRASH CORRIGAN AND RULED HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DONUT GIRL stumbled leaving the gate to come away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early going, raced two wide then angled in on the far turn, moved back
out into the two path nearing the stretch, angled out in the lane, closed outside the leader and drew clear. NEW HEAT in range early from the two path, went
three wide into the stretch, bid three wide in the drive, got outkicked by the winner and saved the place. KLEEN KARMA tracked the pace from inside, two
wide into the stretch, angled out and put in a mild late bid but missed the place. CASSIE BELLE forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground into the
lane, lacked room next to the fence and steadied briefly at the eighth pole, shifted out with a sixteenth to go and bumped rival and finished willingly.
EMPRESS OF FIRE sped to the front, set the pace from inside, led clear to the eighth pole and yielded in the final sixteenth. ALMOST A FACTOR traveled
at the back of the pack, raced outside a rival or three wide, angled out in upper stretch and finished evenly. SHERILINDA stalked the leader from outside,
took aim two wide into the stretch but flattened in the final furlong.

MISS KITNESS set the pace with pressure to the outside, vied with rivals midway around the turn, led through the lane with ENRICHED BY DEB to the
outside and held foe at bay. ENRICHED BY DEB bumped leaving the gate, stalked outside the top pair, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole but lacked
the needed late kick in the final furlong. DANIEL THE DREAMER broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, went six wide into the turn then angled in a
path to come off the turn five wide and bested the rest. NORMA'S LOVE veered out and bumped rival at the start, raced five then four wide around the turn
and lacked a rally. HEART RIVER broke out and bumped at the start, raced outside a rival and two wide around the turn, angled out late and improved
position. EVER VIGILANT veered out at the start, pressed the pace from outside, vied between foes around the turn and retreated in the drive. APACHE
PASS bumped, forced out, and steadied in the beginning, raced at the back of the pack inside a rival, saved ground into the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
COALINGA ROAD settled early, saved ground then came a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled back to the fence and bid inside the leader, then surged
clear under urging. BRIX raced off the pace, took the turn four wide, six wide in upper stretch, rallied and earned the place honors. MR. BROWNSTONE
tracked off the inside, went three to four wide around turn, summoned a mild late bid and got outkicked for second. RICKEY B vied for the lead from inside,
held a short lead to the eighth pole and flattened in deep stretch. ZIPPER MISCHIEF vied between foes for the lead to the stretch, challenged outside the
leader in the lead and weakened late. PERFECT FANNY off a bit slow to begin, lacked room and steadied off heels early, went two to three wide into the
lane, angled to the inside and lacked a rally. HIT THE SEAM vied for the lead outside a pair of rivals into and around the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
AWHITESPORTSCOAT tracked the top pair off the inside, floated out by rival into the stretch, headed AUTUMN DAY at the eighth pole and edged rival
under a drive. AUTUMN DAY showed good early speed from the outside, set the pace under pressure, cleared rival around the turn, headed by the winner
at the eighth pole and got outfinished in the late stages. R CHA CHA stalked outside a rival, drifted out into the stretch, bumped by rival at the top of the lane
and stayed on for the show. BLACK STORM chased outside a rival, raced two then three wide on the turn and produced a mild rally to earn a minor award.
BURN ME TWICE chased three wide then angled into the two path on the turn, moved down to the rail in the stretch and lacked a bid. LUCKY ROMANO
pressed the pace outside the leader, lost contact around the turn, drifted out and bumped rival at the top of the lane and weakened. VICTOR'S SHOW went
five wide through the turn and never threatened. QUALITY LINE saved ground around the bend and was always outrun.

SEPTEMBER SECRET stalked the pace up the backstretch, lacked room inside past the quarter pole, altered out into the two path, came out at the
sixteenth pole and surged late to get up in time. DYLANS WILD CAT steadied off heels early, advanced four to five wide around the turn, took over in upper
stretch and led through the drive but flattened a bit late while drifting out. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked the pace from inside then two wide on the turn,
rallied along the fence in the drive but got outkicked. GOVERNOR GOTEVEN dueled outside a rival for the lead, gained a short advantage at the
five-sixteenths pole, came off the turn three wide, lost command in upper stretch, re-bid with a sixteenth to go and finished gamely to the wire.
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE stalked off the inside, closed in three wide on the turn but proved no match in the final furlong. STARLIGHT STROLL settled
early on the backstretch, traveled along the inside then angled four wide around the bend and lacked a rally when called upon. WILL TAKE A KISS broke in
and brushed rival, tracked the pace from off the rail, checked at the three-eighths pole, went four to five wide into the stretch and weakened. SUPER GAME
showed early speed between the top pair then dropped back to chased, went two to three wide into the lane and tired. LOVE WINS brushed from the
outside at the start, dueled for the lead from inside, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE CAT settled off the pace, ridden along into the far turn, bid outside a pair and outside a rival into the stretch, took over in upper stretch, cleared
at the eighth pole then inched away in the late stages. WARRENS CANDY GIRL broke out and bumped rival, raced two wide around the first turn, went
three to four wide around the far turn, took aim at the leader but could not match the winner in the final furlong while proving second best. MISS EVER
READY bumped both sides at the start, traveled in mid-pack early, bothered by rival shifting out at the five-sixteenths pole, went three wide into the lane and
finished willingly for the show honors. BIG STRETCH broke in and bumped rival, traveled along the inside, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
out into the two path, then finished evenly in for a minor award. PRINCESS SADIE up close behind the leader early, took over past the five-sixteenths pole,
angled to the rail after clearing inside rival, got overtaken in upper stretch and weakened after. SIDEWAYS SUANCES broke out, pulled early into the first
turn, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch and never threatened. ST HELENA came in and bumped rival at the start, forced out and bumped
rival at the five-sixteenths pole, came off the far turn three wide and never responded to urging. MEDUSA'S GAZE off slow from the far outside, dropped
back early and was always outrun. PINK PHLOX broke in and and got pinballed between rivals leaving the gate, recovered quickly to sprint to the front, set
the pace inside to the far turn, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the lane. DON'T RUB IT bumped and bobbled at the start, raced two
wide then moved out on the backstretch, bumped by inside rival at the five-sixteenths pole and had little left for the drive.
