Footnotes
CAP ROCK MINER brushed with a foe at the start, stayed well out in the track while showing speed early, dropped from the four path to the two path on the
first turn, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, moved clear while inside on the far turn, responded well under a drive into upper stretch, came under a
right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out near the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to
his inside lead and held gamely under strong handling. SON OF A SAINT was restless in the gate, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three
wide, settled on the outside, advanced four to five wide under urging on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, made a outside bid in upper
stretch but was out-kicked while able to get the place. SKYCRAFT brushed with a rival at the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, was urged
along on the backstretch, saved ground under strong urging on the far turn and improved position to get the show. GRAND MARAIS went three then four
wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response then missed the show. GO FOR MOONSHINE broke a bit awkwardly, raced two path to the inside on the first turn, settled off the pace,
was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn and also lacked the needed response. HIDEAWAY HERO went four wide on the first turn,
settled well off the pace, angled out leaving the backstretch, was ridden along while four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. BEAUTY BOY was unsettled at the start, showed early speed, raced in the five path early on the first turn then dropped to the four path, disputed
the pace on the outside of the winner, was ridden along in the two to three path on the far turn, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and capitulated.
TRAPPER PEAK went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back quickly leaving the backstretch and faltered then was distanced in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
SIR POKERFACE was away awkwardly, settled well off the pace, went four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong and closed strongly to get up under good handling. AMAZING AMERICAN showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped
back while inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the
place. FIRST METAL COUNT broke in the air and was off slow, rushed up then contested the pace on the outside, moved clear in the two path on the turn,
lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and tired but held the show. SILENT CRY broke a half-step slow, raced at the rear of the field, went four then five
wide on the turn, was driven eight wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy but missed the show. DOUG'S BUG chased the early pace, was
taken under a vigorous hold behind horses midway down the backstretch, continued under stout restraint to the three-eighths, saved ground through the
turn and weakened. IDE B A WINNER broke a half-step slow, was urged along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path, came between horses into
the final furlong and failed to threaten. MARTIN G chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and
tired. COMMON LAW CAT was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, raced well back the field, went five then six wide on the turn and was no
factor. SHAQ JACK was urged along on the outside, dropped from five to three wide on the turn and had nothing left. TOO MUCH BOURBON was well
spotted towards the front, raced in the two path under urging on the turn and came up empty. CLEVER RACER was urged along off the pace, went five
wide on the turn and failed to respond. AMAZING SOUND came outward while off slow, spotted the front several lengths, moved up on the far outside, went
five wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, took the

Footnotes
MRS. JUDY showed good speed, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dueled gamely with the runner-up in the final furlong
and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. HALFGLAMOROUS jostled with a rival at the start, disputed the pace between horses in the two path, dueled
gamely with the winner in the final furlong and was denied while able to get the place. DELTA TRAVELER chased the leading trio on the outside then four
wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled outside the top two under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to
get the show. SUMITUP disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, dropped back along the rail with three furlongs to run, saved ground into the stretch,
drifted out near the furlong marker then back in around the sixteenth-pole, kept on well to the wire and just missed the show. LUCKY LINDA jostled with a
rival at the start then dropped back while crowded, was urged along well back in the field, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted three wide late on
that bend and improved position without threatening. SINGING N' PRAYING was urged along towards the front, angled in leaving the backstretch, went two
to three wide on the turn and came up empty. OPPS MY BAD broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, tipped six wide
into upper stretch and failed to rally. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the
whip and failed to threaten. G'S A LOOKER was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. OURS FOREVER broke a
half-step slow, was urged along near the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn and also failed to respond. IBEGTODIFFER was off slow and spotted
the front a few lengths, raced on the outside while ridden along, went six wide on the turn and was no factor. A. K. A. GRAMS was slow into stride, lugged

Footnotes
PROXY went to the front, set the pace on the inside, shook clear under pressure into upper stretch, drifted out near the three-sixteenths then was
straightened by the rider, responded well in the final furlong under a left-handed whip and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. AFWAN
bumped with a rival at the start, swerved out into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was rated off the pace, went around the far turn in the two
path, swung out while asked for his best into upper stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. KINETIC SKY went four to five wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along leaving the backstretch, went five five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while up for the
show. GO WEST was reluctant to load, went three wide on the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired. PLUCKY STRIKE went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn,
drifted in near the furlong marker and came up empty. OXWOOD broke a step slow, was caught five wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, was
urged along while three to four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. K RULES bumped with a foe the start, was rated inside through the first turn,
settled more kindly on the backstretch, came up empty on the final turn and retreated. RUN FAR was fractious in the gate, became very rank under restraint
early then checked into the first turn, continued rank through that bend and showed little.

NITROUS bumped with two different opponents early, settled off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, made a bid
inside the three-sixteenths, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. MANNY
WAH settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to garner the place. MR
MONEY BAGS bumped with a rival early, chased the pace on the outside, went two wide for most of the turn then shifted three wide, pursued the leaders in
the stretch and finished with good courage but missed the place while able to get the show. LANDESKOG showed good speed on the outside, disputed the
pace, moved clear in the two path at the three-eighths then dropped closer to the rail, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner just
inside the furlong marker and weakened. TRINGALE bumped with a rival early then was taken in hand, tugged at the bit under restraint, dropped back late
on the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide to go around a tiring foe, swung five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. BOBBY'S WICKED ONE showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back with
three furlongs to run and stopped then was placed under a protective hold in the final furlong.

under a drive in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. SWEET BLINDNESS went five wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside, advanced
four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
BY THE BOOK rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, made a brief bid around the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but held the show. AUDREY'S TIME was taken in hand early, tugged at the bit while eager
under restraint in the four path on the first turn, continued to pull under a hold, moved up midway down the backstretch, steadied off heels at the half-mile
pole, was asked while three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. ALLIACEOUS traveled around the first turn
in the two path, settled well back in the field, was urged along in the two path for most of the far turn, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, came
five wide into upper stretch then moved further out and failed to respond. LEMON CHILL was sluggish early and dropped well behind, raced six wide on the
first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn and was no factor. FORT POLK went around the first turn in the two
path, was rated off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. WIDOW OF NAIN went four wide
on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. LIL ASHLEY B. went

outside into upper stretch, made a bid near the furlong marker then powered away under steady handling to prove much the best. SMITTYS BARRACUDA
was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. PLATINUM SKY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went four
wide on the turn and got up for the show. STRUMMER broke a half-step slow, raced well back in the field, rounded the turn in the two path, steadied behind
horses at the five-sixteenths, reached her best stride in the stretch and improved position to just miss the show but earned the last spot in the superfecta.
SHADES OF TRUTH chased then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired
then lost the superfecta. INAWIC was ridden along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, was carried out near the
furlong marker and failed to threaten. G'S SQUEEZE broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven
five wide into the stretch then carried out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. FUHR MEO came out at the start and broke a step slow, was urged
along towards the back, went five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch, was carried out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.
