Footnotes
SENSE OF SELF was prompted to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, switched outside that
foe after a half while moving to prompt that foe, pressed the issue on the far turn, shifted to the three path racing into upper stretch gaining a narrow
advantage and just held QUINN MURPHY to the end in an all out drive. The latter, reserved along the inside in early stages, advanced to contention along
the rail midway through the backstretch when presented an opening, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly inside foes to
the end to just miss. GOOD MONGOLIA, urged clear while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, dueled for
command on the far turn into the lane resisting the eventual winner to late stages but yielded late. POUR GIRL tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight to the far turn, shifted out in the closing stages and continued with a mild bid to edge rivals for position. LAUNCH AWAY, reserved in early stages,
advanced three wide on the backstretch to gain terms with the first flight racing into the far turn, prompted those foes through the second bend and flattened
out in the drive. CHLOBEE tracked the leaders along the inside early, conceded some position under patient handling after a half, swung out four wide
leaving the far turn while being urged to advance but lacked the needed closing bid. ICE ATTACK tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was held
up momentarily in close quarters after a half and dropped out of contention early.

Footnotes
PISTOL BOX came under some prompting along the inside from the outset while dropping well off the leaders racing into the first turn, switched off the
inside entering the backstretch to race between foes, swung five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn advancing on the leaders, moved to gain a
narrow advantage while shifting inwards racing past midstretch but maintained the lead to the end under firm left handed encouragement. ZANFORCE
raced four wide into the first turn stalking just off the first flight, continued to race just off the leaders to the second bend, moved to challenge three deep
nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner while prevailing for the place honors. TALKING ZIP was
urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes, then along the inside to upper stretch but weakened late.
MUSIAL settled near the inside in the opening half, advanced in tandem with several foes while shifting out leaving the far turn, lost some momentum when
caught in traffic midstretch but continued with interest to improve position to the end. SWITHERAL, a bit outpaced despite some prompting racing three
deep to the backstretch, gained some momentum while angling four wide nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid between foes but lacked the needed late
kick. SUPERMANS CAPE, in touch with the first flight three deep attending the pace racing to the backstretch, prompted those rivals after a half, pressed
the issue between foes into upper stretch and gave out late. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke awkwardly, settled last early and failed to menace. HINTON,
a bit reluctant to load, was urged along the inside disputing the pace in the opening half, gave way racing into the far turn, was pulled up entering the lane,
then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
GAGOOTS was rated off the second flight while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, gained striking distance three deep racing into upper
stretch while continuing under patient handling, shifted four wide nearing the furlong marker while being urged to challenge, lugged inwards under pressure
but wrested the advantage under firm right handed pressure. WILLTOBELUCKY sped to the fore while angling inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin,
dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn, resisted grudgingly to turn back several challengers but couldn't fend off the winner. MKAR THE
FAST, restless in the gate, was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn while held up in close
quarters midway through that bend, shifted out exchanging light contact with TWO COOKIE RULE in upper stretch but angled four wide in the closing
stages continuing to gain position to the end. ROCKET HOTSHOT, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, was reserved near the inside to the
backstretch, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. SILENT STEVE hopped at the start, was settled
last along the inside early, angled out five wide racing into the stretch, altered course several times while racing in traffic to late stages but continued with
interest. WISE KHOZAN, pulling against restraint in early stages, switched outside the leaders racing into the first turn while tracking just off those foes,
advanced to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out while being gathered up out of close quarters leaving midstretch. DEJOHN
settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. BRAVO BRAVO, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to gain
terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the lane and gave out in the drive. TWO
COOKIE RULE broke inwards bumping BRAVO BRAVO, was collected to track off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued in close
quarters through the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch and quickly came up empty. MOHAWK LEONARD angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
racing to the backstretch, then faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
AUNT DOROTHY broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, forged clear under some prompting from her rider in
upper stretch and widened the margin under hand urging. NURSE SADIE, slow to gather stride, settled well off the field racing to the turn, split foes racing
into upper stretch, angled four wide racing past the furlong marker and wrested the place honors in the closing stages. TANGO CITY tracked just off the
second flight between rivals in the opening quarter, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but was outkicked for
second. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, faded in the drive. WAR COLORS
tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded entering the stretch. COLOROFACLOUD settled
outside foes off the second flight racing through the backstretch, raced four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. LILL QUEEN B tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing into the turn but had no closing bid.

Footnotes
KURINGAI was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position racing into the far turn, shifted off the
inside to split foes nearing upper stretch, angled back to the rail to bid inside the pacesetter in upper stretch, then came through close quarters to wrest the
advantage and edge forward in time under strong left handed pressure. I DON'T WANT TO GO, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn,
dictated the pace on a clear margin into the second bend, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid while exchanging some light contact late but came up second
best. MARIA ROSE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled in to gain position inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside in upper
stretch and split foes three deep in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. PAULETTE, urged to a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the
pacesetter in the opening half, shifted out on the far turn while being urged to challenge nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. VICTIM,
caught four wide racing into the first turn gaining terms with the second flight, tracked the leaders three deep between foes into the second bend and faded
into the lane. ANNIE TIME GIRL, held up off the second flight racing into the first turn, angled to the inside on the backstretch, continued evenly inside foes
to upper stretch and emptied out late. LITTLE CHICK settled last to the backstretch, shifted out six wide entering the lane and passed some tiring rivals.
AUBREY, forwardly placed between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, eased back from that position nearing the backstretch, shifted out four wide
after a half while being urged to advance but lacked a rally. BE AUTHENTIC was rated off the second flight outside foes, was caught five wide after a half
and never gained striking distance. TROPHY BRIDLE settled into stride while shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the
lane but proved no threat. HERO ALEXANDRA proved no factor.

Footnotes
ITSALLABOUTYOU, caught in close quarters four deep between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening stages, angled sharply to the rail approaching
the turn, saved ground on the bend steadily gaining position inside foes racing into upper stretch, tipped out three wide in late stages and wrested a clear
advantage in time under strong left handed encouragement. GALAHAD KID, off a bit slowly, settled last to the turn, angled inside steadily gaining position
racing into upper stretch, then shifted off the inside to split foes in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place honors. LITTLE BALTAR tracked off
the first flight five wide in early stages, steadily advanced four wide into the lane and continued willingly while just missing for second.
KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF, urged through close quarters at the start prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened late. RIPE
ATTACK came through tight quarters at the break, then angled to the inside pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command to
upper stretch and gave out late. DRAMA STAR tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight, shifted five wide into the lane and steadily
faded. GUARD YOUR GRILL angled inwards leading the second flight on a narrow margin through the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief, three wide
bid nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. STORMINSIDE ducked a bit at the start, was held up while his rider corrected his course and
failed to menace thereafter. KYZAN going erratically between foes nearing the turn, was taken up entering the bend and raced wide to the lane.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S HONOR was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable margin racing to the turn, forged clear racing into the stretch and
widened late while being kept to brisk encouragement. GIVIN UP NONE tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter, angled inside
rivals racing into the turn and proved best of the others in the drive. PRINCE ABUBU settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted out five wide racing
into the turn while being prompted to advance and drifted late. WILLOW RIDGE tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch
and improved position inside foes late. SUPRISE CAT, a step slow into stride, angled six wide racing into the stretch and altered course avoiding a drifting
rival while never proving a serious threat. JUST RUN tracked off the second flight outside foes racing into the turn but offered no rally. DEMAND RANSOM,
urged to forward placing between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. W W TRAFALGAR was prompted to a forward
placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter through the backstretch but was spent after a half.

Footnotes
IMPRESSED broke out making light contact with LYKAN at the start, was rated between foes in second flight while shifting inwards a bit nearing the turn,
was prompted to advance shifting three deep racing into upper stretch, then took over late under some right handed pressure. ARCHIEMYBOY stalked just
off the first flight three deep racing through the backstretch, moved to challenge for command in that path after a half, gained the advantage racing into
upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner while just lasting for second. LYKAN, brushed at the start, was held up out of close quarters while angling to
the inside after the opening furlong, steadily gained position while swinging out four wide racing into upper stretch, then found his best stride in the closing
stages to just miss for second. FIRERY TALE, bumped at the start, settled along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and improved
position between foes late. TOUGH STUFF, urged along the rail pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way in the drive. GHAALEB THE
GREAT, caught five wide in second flight racing to the turn, faded early. OIL MONEY broke outwards bumping FIRERY TALE, was quickly righted to force
the pace outside a rival, dueled between foes into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. OMAR ATTACK, caught momentarily in close quarters at the
start, dropped out early and trailed the field to the stretch. RED HOT DEVIL made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide between foes and gave way entering
the turn.

Footnotes
CRANKSHAFT broke readily to dispute the pace inside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, then edged clear into upper stretch and maintained a
safe margin under firm left handed encouragement. SPINSTER ROAD, pinched between foes at the start, recovered quickly to gain a position between foes
in second flight, angled to the inside racing into the turn, continued in pursuit to late stages but proved only second best. YOU'RE IN COREY, bumped at the
start, was righted, then urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened late. TAP'S BIG
SHOT, caught five wide dropping off the second flight in early stages, made steady progress four wide on the turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed
late bid. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked a rally. PRUDENT HERO proved no
factor. RECKLESSNESS swerved out at the start bumping YOU'RE IN COREY, and dropped back early. WELLFIELD settled outside foes in the last flight
early and failed to menace. MEMORIES OF ARTIE, off slowly, was hustled four wide between foes to gain contention after the opening quarter, continued
with a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly in upper stretch.
