STARRININMYDREAMS veered in a bit at the start, stalked the pace early three wide, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch,
dug in and gamely prevailed at the wire. ANGKOR was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early from between horses, was off the rail into the lane, under
a long drive in the stretch and was out-nodded at the wire. JOE FRAZIER set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch
run. PRIVATE ISLAND chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and lacked a rally in the stretch drive. TEXAS RULE was taken out at the
start and no factor thereafter. EL SOBREVIVIENTE was bumped and bothered at the start, through after a half.

Footnotes
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes, dueled inside of THE BIG S through upper stretch, drifted out at the furlong pole and bumped that
rival inside of that marker, then prevailed in the battle. THE BIG S dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, dug in gamely through the lane to hold
an advantage, but was bumped by an inner foe passing the furlong pole, then was bested by that rival in the late stages. FULL AUTHORITY tracked the
group of leaders from the two to three path around the turn, progressed behind them in upper stretch, tipped four wide approaching the furlong pole, and
sustained a bid, but did not have enough to catch the leaders. ONE NATION saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, came into the lane in the four
path before shifting to the six path in midstretch, then stayed on for a minor share. ROB THE RICH vied for the lead three wide, sustained menacing position
through upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong pole. THE FEATURE stalked the trio of leaders from the four path around the turn, but chased them
through the lane without making a bid. SPIN RATE was outrun.

BOB'S EDGE dueled along the inside of MACRON, kicked clear from that foe at the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. MACRON dueled for
the lead outside of BOB'S EDGE, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the furlong pole, and held place to prove second best. QUANTUM LEAP broke
outwardly, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, shifted to the six path turning for home, and rallied willingly outside of foes through the
lane to just reach show at the wire. GHOSTLINER gained ground from midpack four wide around the turn, but leveled off and chased the leaders through
the lane, and was nailed on the wire for show. SUPREMACY got a bit rank behind horses in midpack into the turn, tracked from the three path around the
bend before shifting five wide turning for home, then chased the leaders evenly through the lane. O BESOS was off slow and hopped a bit at the start, raced
far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and rallied through the lane but. CANDY MAN ROCKET stalked four to three wide, but yielded on his left
lead in upper stretch. SPEITFUL SAM chased the pace three to two wide and from between horses around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole.
SOUND MONEY saved ground from midpack, but weakened through the lane. HARRISON'S ROSE was outrun. EYE OF HORUS hesitated at the start,
then never got involved. OXFIRE saved ground off of the pace, and weakened.

Footnotes
SEVEN NATION ARMY rallied four wide around the turn, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, determinedly cut that foes margin through the final
furlong, wore down that foe approaching the wire, and just got up. HOLLIS dueled for the lead two wide, easily put away his inner counterpart in upper
stretch, drew clear to a wide margin through midstretch, but was worn down by an outer foe in the late stages, and got nailed on the wire. MOJO MAN was
taken back by the rider at the start, trailed the field in the three path into the turn, shifted to the six path while progressing turning for home, and sustained a
rally to reach show. ADMIRAL LYNCH got outsprinted early on despite strong rider encouragement, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, shifted
to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to factor while improving. WELLABLED dueled for the lead inside of HOLLIS, but weakened under light
encouragement in upper stretch. SMOKIN NITRO tracked from midpack while tucking from the four path to the two path around the turn, but faded through
the lane. JOHNNY UNLEASHED chased the dueling leaders from the three path, but was done early.

Footnotes
POLISHED GEM stalked the leaders three wide around the turn, bid outside of MILANA in upper stretch, drew off approaching the furlong pole, and was
ridden out to the wire. MILANA stalked two wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was quickly surpassed by the winner in upper stretch,
and proved second best. PERKS D'ORO tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, failed to produce bid, but was clearly third best. KEITANY
saved ground far off of the pace and improved. CUPP OF CLASS was off slowly, took the turn in the two path far off of the pace, and failed to factor.
LUCRESSIA was off slowly, trailed in the three path into the turn, and failed make an impact. DOUBLE DARE YOU set the pace, but was headed at the five
sixteenths pole, and wilted. JERSEY LILLIE lied forwardly placed along the inside early on, but steadily faded. TRAIL TOWN QUEEN was done early.
