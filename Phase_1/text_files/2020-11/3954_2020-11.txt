Footnotes
SUPERSTITION closest in pursuit in the early going, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside GREG'S DIVA inside the furlong grounds and wore
down rival to get up late. GREG'S DIVA sped to the front and angled to the inside, roused at the three-sixteenths pole, met challenger from the outside in
the final furlong, fought gamely to the wire but could not stave off the winner. AN EDDIE SURPRISE chased three then two wide on the turn, tipped out and
outkicked GIDGETTA for the show. GIDGETTA in range along the inside, saved ground around the turn and got edged for the show. NU PI LAMBDA
mid-pack early between rivals, traveled two wide into the stretch, angled out then had the rider lost his whip mid-stretch and lacked a rally after.
AFFIANCED stalked in the two path and failed to produce a bid in the drive. ALL QUALITY unhurried in the early going while steered over to the inside,
went inside a rival then was in tight and steadied past the five-sixteenths, saved ground into the lane and never responded to urging. EQUAL MEASURE
settled off the pace, angled out into the stretch and failed to rally. RESPECT MY CANDOR traveled off the rail, went between foes at the quarter pole and
proved no menace. KOOKIE GAL trailed the field early near the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and never threatened. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL reserved in
the early going, came out a bit in upper stretch and faded. DEVILS DANCE chased from outside, went four wide around the turn, five wide into the stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
MORE BUBBLY bumped leaving the gate, vied from between rivals, edged clear into the stretch hand drew away under strong handling. AIR JOCKEY
bumped at the start, well placed off the inside behind the speedy quarter, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly but failed to threaten the winner.
HE BE MOJO RISIN stalked outside a rival, raced four to five wide around the turn and was along for the show. ANATOLIA attended the pace four deep,
dueled midway through the turn and into the stretch, lost contact with the winner and also lost the whip in upper stretch and weakened. CHOSEN MOON
broke in and brushed rival in the beginning, stumbled early then dropped back, raced wide up the backstretch then angled in on the turn, steered back out
into the drive and was never a factor. WILD CAT CANYON vied for the lead from inside, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole and faded in the
drive. A J ROCK away quickest from the gate, sped to the front then vied three deep and between rivals, chased the leaders three wide into the stretch and
had little left.

Footnotes
CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) settled off the pace, raced two wide then moved out three wide on the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide
into the lane, rallied to the front mid-stretch and finished strongly under a drive. DU JOUR broke in and bumped rival, traveled three wide around the first
turn, three deep on the backstretch, moved out and was fanned five wide into the lane, rallied but was not enough. AIRMAN settled between rivals, angled
four wide into the stretch, angled out past the eighth pole and got up for the show honors. THE GREAT ONE sped to the front and crossed over to the
inside, led with company to the outside then inched away leaving the backstretch, led clear to the eighth pole then got overtaken in the furlong grounds and
weakened late. MISS BELLA CIAO bumped at the start, traveled near the back of the pack, swung five wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally. GOT
CURLY chased three deep then outside a rival on the far turn, ranged up three wide at the quarter pole but flattened out in the late stages. MOUNT
PELLIAR tracked the pace from inside, waited for room at the quarter pole, lacked room in upper stretch, angled in late and improved position. DIXIE'S
TWO STENTS forwardly placed near the inside, saved ground into the stretch and weakened. DRIVEHAPPY pulled early while between rivals, remained
between foes to the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch and weakened. K P AIM HIGH pressed the pace from
outside then chased the leader leaving the backstretch, entered the stretch two wide and weakened. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) saved ground into the
lane and was never a factor. SPACE ODESSEY was always outrun.

JUST GRACE vied between foes for command up the backstretch, put a head in front at the five-sixteenths pole, inched away leaving the bend, lost
command past the eighth pole and stayed on well proving second best. GIVE ME A HINT chased three then four wide around the turn and held the show.
ROLINGA raced off the pace, angled into the two path on the turn, traveled between foes approaching the eighth pole and kept on to earn a minor award.
MONGOLIAN WINDOW chased outside a rival, went four wide into the stretch, came out some in upper stretch and failed to threaten. DESTINY'S
JOURNEY broke well, shifted in and raced a bit greenly early, went up to vie for the lead from inside, could not keep pace with the top pair past the midway
point on the turn and gave way in the drive. SUMMER LOVE vied for the lead three deep, chased three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BEER CAN MAN stalked inside, saved ground to the stretch, shifted outside the leader in upper stretch, rallied to the front and held CAISSON at bay under
urging. CAISSON raced off the pace, three wide or outside a rival, went four wide into the stretch, rallied through the lane but was not enough.
COMMANDER KHAI sped to the front and controlled the pace early, inched away from outside rival, coaxed at the three-sixteenths pole, yielded to the top
pair in the late stages but saved the show. EBEKO (IRE) settled along the inside, angled two wide leaving the far turn, moved back inside in the stretch and
missed the show. BIG FISH raced outside a rival or three wide, angled out into the stretch, six wide at the top of the lane and showed late interest to gain
ground in deep stretch. PARTY GAME (IRE) traveled off the pace early on near the inside, angled out into the lane, raced seven wide in upper stretch and
showed a mild response in the final furlong. ROYAL PRINCE chased three into the stretch, was tight between rivals at the eighth pole and kept on to the
wire. COTOPAXI (IRE) mid-pack in the early going, steadied behind off heels at the three-eighths pole, angled to the inside, angled out in the stretch and
failed to rally. HARLAN ESTATE came away a bit awkwardly at the start, tracked two wide, dropped back around the second turn, came out a bit in the
stretch and weakened. COASTAL KID chased early then moved up to prompt the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader on the backstretch, chased
two wide into the lane and weakened. WOOTTON ASSET (FR) angled five wide into the lane, eight wide upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
VIADERA (GB) allowed to settle in the early stages, raced outside a rival or two wide to the lane, chased between foes in upper stretch, tipped out at the
eighth pole, rallied late and nailed BLOWOUT at the wire. BLOWOUT (GB) showed early speed and moved to the rail, lost the lead on the backstretch and
chased the leader to the stretch, drew alongside rival at the eighth pole, took a short lead and led through the final sixteenth but got nailed at the wire.
JULIET FOXTROT (GB) chased two to three wide around the first turn, went to the front and took the lead past the five-eighths pole, cleared inside rival and
angled to the inside, showed the way along the rail into the drive, held a short lead over BLOWOUT at the eighth pole and was outkicked in deep stretch.
SHARING tracked a bit off the rail, moved into the two path then three wide into the lane, was within striking distance in upper stretch, finished willingly but
lacked the needed late punch. MAXIM RATE settled along the inside, saved ground into the stretch and finished evenly. TAMAHERE (FR) raced two wide
around the first turn, angled five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SHE'S OUR CHARM went three wide into the first turn then raced outside a rival,
came four wide into the stretch and flattened. BODHICITTA (GB) trailed the field from inside, angled out into the two path into the far turn, steered out
around the bend and exited four wide and never got involved.

ESCAPE ROUTE stalked off the rail, closed in four wide around the turn, vied three deep into the stretch, dueled with SWIFT AS I AM late and edged rival
on the line. SWIFT AS I AM stalked off the rail, bid three wide into the stretch, dueled with ESCAPE ROUTE in deep stretch and lost the photo. NONE
ABOVE THE LAW tracked off the rail, bumped from the outside and steadied at the half-mile pole, raced three wide then angled in some into the stretch,
showed late effort and bested the rest. RUTHIES RACER chased three wide into the stretch and lacked a serious bid. DENNIS CELERY broke in and
bumped rival at the start, came out and bumped rival in upper stretch and showed a mild response to improved position. FROM THE GET GO steadied
briefly early, traveled two wide then three wide into the stretch, came out at the eighth pole and could not rally. WEDDING GROOM had good early speed,
cleared inside rival and angled to the inside, clung to a short lead into the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. C'MON JENNA stumbled
leaving the gate, chased between foes then four wide into the stretch and weakened. BEN WADE bumped in the beginning, lacked early speed, came out
into the stretch and was never a factor. JAKE THE GREAT showed early speed from the inside, chased the lone leader to the turn, started to weaken
around the bend and faded. REFI NOW broke in, bumped inner rival at the half-mile pole, raced three deep around the turn then came five wide into the
stretch, bumped by rival in upper stretch and tired.
