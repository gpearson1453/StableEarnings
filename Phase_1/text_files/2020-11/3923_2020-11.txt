Footnotes
MAU MAU bumped and leaned on an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside while tucked in the pocket around the turn, awaited clear racing room
along the rail turning for home, surged when the pace setter drifted off of the fence in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, and prevailed
over an outer bidding foe. NILES CHANNEL lunged inwards and was jostled between horses at the start, tipped to the three path to commence a rally
approaching the five sixteenths pole, got floated six wide turning for home while continuing his advance, drifted inwards passing the furlong marker while
clearing inner foes and produced a bid as MAU MAU did the same along the inside, but was denied by that rival. LEMON AND DIEM set a pressured pace
inside of a trio of foes around the turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch while clinging to an advantage, but allowed racing room for the eventual winner
in the process, then weakened between foes at the furlong pole. AUTOPILOT lied close up two wide, shifted five wide turning for home to produce a bid as
NILES CHANNEL ranged up, but was outkicked by that foe and an inner surging rival approaching the furlong pole, and failed to reach the pace setter for
show. SHAKA was urged along while trailing down the backstretch, took the turn in the three to four path before shifting seven wide in midstretch, and
improved past tired foes. SHANANIES PAYNTER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. NIGHT CANDY
prompted the pace four wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch, then was pulled up while galloping out and was vanned off. CREASY bobbled
a bit at the start, recovered to vie three wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
HICKERSON was bumped and a bit crowded between horses at the start, advanced from midpack through the turn to lie in range of the pace four wide and
between horses at the five sixteenths pole, cleared inner foes turning for home before producing a bid for the lead outside of PAYSTER, blew past that foe
at the furlong pole, and drew clear under driving pressure. BOLD DELIVERY was off slowly, took the turn two wide and off of the pace, tipped to the seven
path in upper stretch, and offered a late kick to reach a dead heat for place. GOODTIME ARTIE rated off of the pace in the three path into the turn,
commenced a rally while shifting to the five to six path turning for home, then sustained the bid to chase HICKERSON through the lane, but was nailed on
the wire by an outer foe and dead heated for place. PAYSTER stalked four wide, bid for the lead into the turn, took over and drew clear approaching the five
sixteenths pole, but tired in midstretch, got headed inside the furlong pole, and weakened on his left lead. STRIKEITORTAPIT lied forwardly placed in the
five to six path around the turn, but chased the leaders through the lane before getting outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole. SURMONT advanced
from midpack to be in range of the pace five wide and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but only managed a chasing rally before flattening out.
MECHANICVILLE saved ground, but to no avail. T J MUNNINGS dwelt at the start, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and improved
without menacing. KILSHEELAN hopped at the start, railed the field around the turn, and improved late. THE GREATEST EAGLE got antsy waiting for the
gates to opened, dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but weakened at the three furlong pole and stopped through the lane. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES
stalked three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, but proved no match for his outer counterpart approaching the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened. PLONDER dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole and stopped.

Footnotes
SILVER STATE stalked outside of the pace setter, inched closer turning for home to produce a bid at the quarter pole while getting floated to the five path,
forged an advantage from his inner game counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear from that foe under driving pressure passing the furlong pole,
and was kept to task to the wire. SHASHASHAKEMEUP set a moderate and lightly pressured pace along the inside, drifted to the four path approaching the
quarter pole in order to float the bidding SILVER SLATE out, but was headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, resisted to the furlong pole, but gave
way. STRAIGHT SHOT tracked the leaders three wide around the turn, drifted to the six path approaching the quarter pole to stay outside of those rivals,
but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch. KAZIRANGA took the turn in the two to three path while trailing, then failed to threaten the leaders while
surpassing a tiring foe, then pulled up in distress while galloping out, and was vanned off DENNIS' MOMENT bobbled slightly at the start, tracked from
midpack along the inside, saved ground around the turn but failed to produce a bid through a large rail opening in upper stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
LOCK UP cleared off early on, added to his margin in hand around the turn, and was ridden out to the wire without being threatened.
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER brushed the gate at the start, saved ground far off of the pace into the turn, shifted from the two path to the five path turning for
home, and sustained a rally through the lane to reach place. KING OF THE NITE lied forwardly placed three wide, forged place passing the quarter pole,
chased the clear leader through the lane without making much progress, then was surpassed by an outer foe in the late stages. DR. ROGER took the turn
two wide while off of the pace, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole, shifted inwards, and stayed on
for a minor share. MANITOWISH was off a step slowly, took the turn in the three to four path while under urging and off of the pace, then stayed on late to
threaten for minor rewards. COPA stalked the clear leader two wide, but weakened passing the quarter pole. FILIPPO got outrun. BARAKAT saved ground
from midpack around the turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SHE CAN'T SING prompted the leading duelers three wide, took over in hand at the quarter pole, drew off when let out a notch passing the three sixteenths
pole, and widened her advantage handily. JILTED BRIDE tracked the pace from the four path around the turn, advanced to reach place passing the quarter
pole while attempting to range up alongside of SHE CAN'T SING, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, chased her through the lane, and
proved second best. NEVER FORGET took a solid bump from an inner foe at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked two wide around the
turn before shifting three wide turning for home, then stayed on for a minor share. TIPSY GAL broke inwards, recovered and rushed through the opening
furlong to duel for the lead inside of HONORABLE MEMORY, but was headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, quickly proved no match, and
yielded. HONORABLE MEMORY dueled for the lead outside of TIPSY GAL into the turn, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. JEN TAKE
CHARGE bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, saved ground around the turn, but weakened.

BLOSSOM ROAD set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes at the three furlong pole, repelled MY GIRL LEXI passing the quarter pole and
drew off under driving pressure, then was wrapped up through the final furlong. SHES GOT IT steadied very mildly while in a bit of tight quarters early on,
tracked from midpack two wide, inched closer three wide and between horses turning for home, and stayed on to reach place inside the furlong pole, but
failed to threaten the leader. MY GIRL LEXI stalked three wide and between horses, bid for the lead at the three wide at the three furlong pole and forged an
advantage approaching the five sixteenths marker, but was repelled by her inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, chased that foe through the lane,
flopped back to her left lead while losing place passing the furlong pole, and held show. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI tracked the pace in the five path around
the turn, gained mildly turning for home, but leveled off through the lane. HONEST INTENTIONS saved ground while forwardly placed, but failed to produce
a bid. MISHPOCHA stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with those foes approaching the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened. ANDREA'S ANGEL lied forwardly placed four wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. UNIVERSALLY
bumped the gate and was off slowly, then got outrun.

Footnotes
FUNNYBET chased the pace early from the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane, rallied in the stretch, altered off the rail nearing the eighth pole, continued
the bid and drove past the leader in the final stages. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL set the pace from the outset with a very loose lead, stayed on the inside into
the lane, remained clear down the lane but was ran down and yielded in the final stages. STRIPPING chased the leader, raced off the rail into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch run. TONAL VISION chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. DUTCH
TREAT was never a threat. HASHTAG WINNER was never a factor. MALIBU MARLEE was in tight and steadied shortly after leaving the gate. HAT TIP
was steadied shortly after leaving the gate. CHANNEL PRINCESS was steadied along the first turn.

Footnotes
BODEXPRESS tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane, continued the bid nearing the three
sixteenths pole, stuck a nose in front, inched clear inside the eighth pole and held sway in the final stages. CODE OF HONOR raced back early on, was in
the three path into the lane, made a bid four wide near the three sixteenths pole, continued the rally late in the stretch but did not have enough for the
winner in the final stages. OWENDALE was bumped entering the first turn while three wide of foes, raced in the six path into the lane, made a bid seven
wide near the three sixteenths pole, came in near the eighth pole, continued on with the bid, was slightly bumped late but finished willingly in the final
stages. COASTAL DEFENSE was unprepared at the start, raced along the inside down the backstretch, was being steadied long, stayed on the rail into the
lane, made a bid down the lane but flattened out late in the drive. MR FREEZE chased the pace early, took over and led the field from the three eighths pole
to the three sixteenths pole but faltered late in the drive. SILVER PROSPECTOR raced five wide along the first turn and raced back early on, was in the five
path into the lane, made a bid six wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened late in the drive. BY MY STANDARDS chased the pace early, was in
the four path into the lane, was blocked behind a wall of foes in the upper stretch, altered out near the three sixteenths pole and leveled off late in the drive.
BOURBON CALLING was never a threat. CRAFTY DADDY was never a factor. TITLE READY was always back from the inside. MULTIPLIER came out at
the start, was in the six path into the lane and lacked a bid in the stretch run. AURELIUS MAXIMUS was bumped at the start, chased the pace early on, was
in the four path into the lane, made a bid five wide near the three sixteenths pole but faded down the lane. PLUS QUE PARFAIT was never involved from
the inside. PHANTOM CURRENCY staggered at the start then was rushed up to the set the early pace, was overtaken near the three eighths pole and
caved down the lane.
