Footnotes
SIZZLING JAMIE set the pace under pressure from LINFIELD, was two wide to the stretch, got headed in mid stretch, fought back and took a short lead a
sixteenth out then was nabbed for a tie on the wire. LINFIELD pressed the leader three wide to the stretch, pushed to a short lead in mid stretch, was
headed again a sixteenth out but fought back bravely to deadheat on the line. ONE EYED ROBIN hesitated and broke about five lengths last, trailed to the
second turn, was three wide to the stretch and finished willingly. LITTLE JOHN was settled to the second turn, raced off the rail to the stretch and lacked a
closing response. BERNIE'S BIG BOY chased the pace from the rail for six furlongs then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SOBER chased the pace to the turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down SHOUT IT OUT and WATCHFUL EYE
late. SHOUT IT OUT set the pace while racing on the rail to the stretch, responded when headed by WATCHFUL EYE in mid stretch then dug in but could
not stall the winner. WATCHFUL EYE pressed the pace to the turn, rallied three wide and was on terms in mid stretch then hung in the late stages. ROCKA
DOCKA NOLA hesitated and broke about four lengths last, trailed three wide to the stretch, angled in to the rail and closed willingly in a good effort.
COASTARANDO had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then was also gaining ground late. KRISTIN'S PICNIC got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned
four wide to the stretch and came on some late. LA PERLITA NEGRA also was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but could not offer the
needed late respnse. CAMELLIA CITY had speed inside to mid turn then stopped.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES went right to the front, set the pace in the two path to the second turn, turned back YEAR OF THE OX and edged clear again to
mid stretch then held under steady urging. GOOCH EXPRESS was settled to the half, bid three wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but
bested the others. SOUTHEAST ASIA also settled mid pack to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late
response. HERDSMAN was outrun for a half mile, raced two wide and closed the gap on the second turn but flattened in the final furlong. HAWK'S RISING
had no speed, trailed to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. YEAR OF THE OX stalked the winner to the second turn, made a run at that one two
wide, was turned back and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LA REINE'S LEGACY had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then pushed away to mid stretch but was kept to task to the line. KATE BOSS
was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and closed steadily to be second best. FICTIONAL was chasing to the turn, also came three wide
to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. MARVELOUS MARVELLA was outrun to the turn, raced two wide then shifted out for
room in upper stretch and came on late. ARDTREA attended the pace early then pressed two wide, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. COLD
BREW KELLY was chasing early, got fanned four wide on the turn and did not rally. GOOD TIME DOLLY also chased the winner, saved ground to the
stretch but came up empty in the drive. GOPREACHIT had speed to the turn then tired. DANCE WITH KRISTIN brushed the gate coming out and was
never a factor.

TAMMY'S WINDOW had no early speed, bid three wide to the stretch then eased out, rallied once roused and closed steadily to prevail. PRORIKA attended
the pace outside a rival and two wide to the stretch, responded to inch clear to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but held second. BE LIFTED UP
trailed to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then gradually picked off rivals in the drive. SUGARSEEKER got outsprinted early, had to circled four wide to
the stretch but could not threaten in the late stages. POPULAR APPEAL was chasing the pace three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response.
PRINCESS ASHLYN hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. FIERY CAUSE also chased
the leaders, was two wide on the turn but tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HOT SOCKS set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and held under steady urgingt. MIDNIGHT LUCK broke a bit slow,
trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then shifted out in mid stretch and closed willingly. ON ICE pressed the winner to the second turn, was
two wide to the stretch, got outdkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. CHASE AND COLORADO settled for a half mile, was two wide to the stretch then
also shifted out for room and was making up ground belatedly. INSANIAMANIA chased the winner three then two wide to the stretch but could not make an
impact in the drive. WILD BOAT RIDE tracked the pace to the second turn then saved ground but was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. HEAVENLY
TIGER had no speed, was four then three wide and not a factor. BILLTOWN BANNER was very wide throughout and also not a threat. GOLD N GRAND
settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but gave way. GREGS CITY ZIP stalked the pace for five furlongs then tired.
