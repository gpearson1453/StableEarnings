Footnotes
EXCELERINA (IRE) settled in the two path, lacked room trying to split runners near the five-sixteenths pole and had to check, steered out and came four
wide into the drive, bumped rival in upper stretch, then surged to the front and won going away. SUNNY MORNING (FR) pulled early along the inside,
tugged forward up the backstretch, waited around the far turn and into the stretch, angled to the inside and put in a rail bid but was outkicked by the winner.
TMORROWISALONGTIME stalked on the inside early, moved off the rail on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn, bumped with rival in upper
stretch and kept on for the show. SPEEDCUBER was a bit rank first time through the stretch, was closest in pursuit behind the leader, took aim two wide
entering the lane, bid three wide in upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong. WASHINGTON SQUARE cleared early and steered down to the rail,
set the pace clear into the lane, collared in upper stretch and gave way. ANGEL OF FREEDOM tracked off the rail, trailed into the lane and had little left for
the stretch run.

UNSOLVED MYSTERY was off alertly to grab the early lead, set the pace to the turn on the inside, felt mild pressure around the turn, cleared that rival
entering the lane, then drew off under hand urging. MUY CHISTOSA turned his head and came away a bit slow at the start, was up close in the two path
early, put in a mild bid from outside on the turn, could not keep up into the stretch, flattened in the drive but was still clearly second best. LOVELY LOLA
trailed early and angled to the outside, went outside rivals four then three wide on the turn and weakened. KJOS KID checked off the heels of the leader
early, tugged along the inside to the turn, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. DUXONTHEPOND tracked off the rail, went three wide into the turn,
dropped back while moving to the two path around the bend and tired.

PARTYOFSIXTEEN broke a step slow and bumped lightly with inside rival, went to duel briefly for command before taking control, vied with a pair of rivals
on the turn, cleared at the top of the lane and inched away under urging. BIG WELL broke best from the gate, traveled up close early outside the top pair,
bid three deep on the turn, lost contact with the winner at the top of the lane and chased that rival to the wire. TODAY MATTERS received a light bump at
the start, was forwardly placed under coaxing on the inside, tipped two wide while losing ground on the turn, kept on through the lane and gained the show.
DUTCH BUS broke well from outside, raced in range well off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a serious bid. WHISKEY VISION stalked off
the inside, went two then three wide around the turn and could not rally. PRINCE ZIGGY dropped back early, angled to the rail and saved ground through
the turn but failed to menace. THE BOSS HARTY was off slow to begin, sent early and went up to duel briefly for command then pressed from outside, lost
touch with the top pair approaching the quarter pole and faded out of contention. SAMBA FLAVOR broke slow and tossed his head at the start, navigated
the turn five wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
JACK SIXPACK set the pace on the inside under pressure, shook free around the far turn, then drew away in the lane. EREBUS prompted the pace from
outside, moved up to duel briefly then pressed up the backstretch, could not keep contact with the winner and chased two wide through the second bend,
kept to task in the lane and proved second best. AGADOR SPARTACUS attended the pace three deep, chased the winner three wide through the far turn
and held the show. FORE FLAG stalked in the two path then moved inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to find more in the furlong grounds. DARK
MARCUS was off slow to begin, checked along the inside at the three-quarter pole, remained inside then swung out leaving the far turn but could not
summon the needed rally. VANISKY stumbled badly at the start, traveled three deep around the first turn, tracked outside a rival on the backstretch, shifted
into the far turn, losing ground in the process, went two then three wide on the far turn, then failed to rally in the lane. AWKWARD MORNING was off slow to
begin, went two then three wide on the first turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUICK BUCK vied three deep early on then dueled for command from outside, battled through the turn two wide, took over and cleared in upper stretch and
held the runner-up at bay. HEAVEN'S MUSIC came away well then dropped back off the pace, angled down to the rail on the turn then tipped back out
leaving the bend, rallied in the drive and drew alongside the winner in the final sixteenth but could not go by. DICK BEST tracked the pace off the rail, took
the turn four wide and was along for the show. MAGNIFICENT RIDE vied with a pair of rivals from inside, dueled into and around the turn, lost command in
upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. SYZSLAK vied between for the lead early then got crowded near the nine-sixteenths pole and dropped
back a bit, chased the top pair three wide around the turn and weakened. OVER REGULATED broke slow from inside then steadied shortly after, traveled
along the rail into the turn, exited the bend two wide and made no impact. THE SANDY SURPRISE was off slow to begin, lagged behind early, saved
ground around the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
TAMING THE TIGRESS bobbled at the start, was well placed behind the top pair off the rail, swept by the leaders three wide on the turn under confident
handling, was roused past the eighth pole, drew away and was geared down nearing the wire. LITTLE MISS ELLIE was off a bit slow, stalked along the
inside into the turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, finished willingly down the stretch and edged NORTHERN GEM for the place honors. NORTHERN
GEM broke a step slow, steered to the two path then along the rail into the turn, angled out around the bend and came four wide into the stretch, finished
well but was edged by LITTLE MISS ELLIE for second. RIGHTEOUSLY dueled for command from outside, was overtaken at the quarter pole, drifted out in
upper stretch and weakened. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE showed speed then stumbled leaving the dirt crossing, dueled from outside into and around the
turn, got outkicked with a quarter mile left to run and tired in the lane. DONUT GIRL was off very slow and steadied at the start, trailed up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MESSIER vied along the inside with a pair of rivals, inched ahead at the seven-sixteenths pole, shook free from CABO SPIRIT with a quarter mile left to run,
then powered away under hand urging and widened to the wire. CABO SPIRIT vied three deep to the far turn, pressured MESSIER around the bend then
lost touch approaching the quarter pole, churned on through the lane and finished a clear second. WHARTON went three wide around the first turn,
continued off the rail to the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and gained the show. SIR LONDON stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and
went up to vie between rivals, could not keep pace past the seven-sixteenths pole, chased near the inside to the stretch and tired. HAPPY JACK settled on
the inside, tipped three wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRINCIPE CARLO vied between for command to the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, battled TETON VALLEY down to the wire and won the bob.
TETON VALLEY vied for command inside a pair of rivals, dueled with PRINCIPE CARLO past the five-sixteenths pole, battled head to head through the
stretch and lost the bob at the wire. I'M CORFU broke a bit slow and bumped with inner rival at the start, showed brief speed inside a trio of rivals then
stalked up the backstretch, waited behind speedy trio from the seven-sixteenths pole to the five-sixteenths pole, coaxed along a bit off the rail leaving the
turn, angled out in upper stretch, lugged out under left-handed urging and finished willingly to the wire. TRUTH SEEKER broke alertly but outward as well,
dropped back early, angled down to the two path for the turn, steered out and came five wide into the lane, angled out further in upper stretch, closed with a
mild rally and earned a minor award. ADMIRABLY settled inside, angled out past the five-sixteenths pole, exited the turn four wide and improved placings.
JOE DON LOONEY tracked along the inside then two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SMILEFORME steadied off heels early, chased five wide
through the turn and could not rally. SEA TO SUCCESS vied for the lead three deep, lost contact with the top pair past the five-sixteenths pole, came three
wide into the drive and weakened. ROOKIE MISTAKE was off a bit slow and bumped with rival at the start, moved closer up the backstretch and was within
range outside a rival into the turn, navigated the bend four wide and weakened.
