Footnotes
MR LEVI CANYON tracked the early pace, raced five wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for the win. KEY TO THE CITY set a
clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. LOPIN JOE was allowed to settled early, raced six wide
into the turn angled out and finished with a mild late rally. JEWEL OF NAVARONE was unhurried early, raced seven wide and was empty. FLYING
WARRIOR was void of speed, raced three wide and offered no late rally. ZAMBEZI FEVER chased the early pace from between rivals and faded.
