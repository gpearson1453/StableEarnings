Footnotes
BELLA FEMMINA pressured the pace and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear into the lane and was steadily handled to keep
SISTER JOANN at her flank. The latter gave chase and raced at a close disadvantage in the three path of the turn, then finished evenly. PROUDLY
ELEGANT gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn then dug in from the head of the lane to take third later yards. CHARITABLE MISS chased inside, rounded
the turn near the rail and finished well while gaining on third. SONDEOFF closed to the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was
caught at the rail approaching the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn. SISTER SECRET LEE lunged outward and hit the stall gate, gave chase
through the backstretch and rounded most of the turn off the rail, was eased outward toward the head of the lane, left the turn in the four path and showed
little more. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DUNLUCE CAISSLE settled well off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane, lugged in under right hand urging from the sixteenth pole, exchanged light contact with
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE in later yards then pulled ahead of that one approaching the wire, while the latter settled just off the pace toward the inside, eased
out into the backstretch and bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage four wide, dueled to a brief lead in the
upper stretch, drifted a bit to make contact with Dunluce Caissle in later yards, was caught at that point then steadied toward the wire. HERCULES
HARBOR rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled J J Wedgit Man from that point, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, but was caught in the upper stretch and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. LUFTY'S KISSES stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, but dropped back leaving the turn and flattened out. THE DON OF
SQUAN saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. OWL RUN stalked from the
four path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. J J WEDGIT
MAN raced with the early pace two deep then stalked, dueled into the backstretch and raced at a close disadvantage two deep and between horses on the
far turn, though weakened leaving the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Lufty's Kisses, lodged by the rider of The Don Of
Squan, though, determined there was no foul.

MORALITY CLAUSE stalked two deep then challenged at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the
far turn, dueled determinedly through the stretch to take the lead in later yards and just lasted. CHINA CAT settled off the pace toward the inside, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane, came between horses deep stretch and just missed. LADY
MACHO rated a slim lead inside, was met at even terms at the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the
lead in later yards but stayed on gamely to the finish. SHERIFF'S KID settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, eased four wide into the stretch, finished well and was gaining late. MARY'S JEWEL stalked three
wide, bid approaching the three eighths pole raced close in the four path of the far turn but flattened stride later yards. REIGNING FIRE saved ground off the
pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and showed little in the lane.
FRENCH NOUGET rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

REY O REYES took over at the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
dug in under steady encouragement to ward off the stretch effort of KING T'CHALLA, who gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and raced close through
the stretch, though needed more. SMELLSLIKEMONEY gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and finished evenly. R TAP
chased, ran in the five path of the turn and raced evenly through the lane. BUCKS LODGE gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then
flattened stride. FLASH OF DAY chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. GRASPIN' AT STRAWS chased, ran off
the rail on the turn and was not a factor.

MISS WAVE saved ground close to the pace, challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the lead nearing the five sixteenths, moved clear into the far
turn and was steadily handled to draw away. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS raced off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved off
the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. TIZBIT raced off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little more. NAJWA took over at the three quarter pole and angled
to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail nearing
the far turn and faded. HOLIDAY CONNECTION was never a factor.

Footnotes
DAY OF HONOR came through the first turn in the three path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole,
closed the gap in the four path of the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and determinedly held off the later challenge of EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR who
raced well back saving ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed in the five path of the far turn, dug in to take
second later yards and finished well at the outside poll of the winner. HANDS DOWN came through the first turn in the three path then closed to the lead
nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail, was caught mid-stretch then flattened later yards.
LUNAR IMAGE saved ground on the first turn and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path, eased outward in the upper stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. HACKER MAN raced well back saving early ground,
picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, improved position in the six path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. RUN RABBIT settled
well off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid mildly toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride.
TOMMY PIES saved ground, showed little response past the seven sixteenths pole, weakened at the rail on the far turn then steadied off the heels of
DOESN'T MAKE CENTS toward the head of the lane. The latter rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then
weakened at the rail on the far turn. NATIVE COURAGE raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened off
the rail on the far turn. THE BIG K angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught nearing the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the five
sixteenths and faded readily at the rail.
