Footnotes
RAPIDAMENTE rated kindly while three to four wide and tracking the leader, took closer order mid turn, responded when set down in upper stretch and
launched her bid, dueled on a slim lead past the furlong grounds, was kept busy and finally edged clear at the line. SHE'S ALL COURAGE accelerated to a
clear early advantage when leaving the chute, set a rated pace two wide, dug in when confronted past the quarter pole, dueled from there and gave way
grudgingly in the final yards. ICY HARBOR rated towards the inside, edged up mid turn to loom, shifted out chasing the dueling leaders nearing mid stretch
and faded. AREEMAA , taken well in hand early on, saved ground leaving the far turn and lacked a solid rally. ONE NIGHT STAND , four wide between
runners leaving the half mile marker, failed to kick on past the three eighths and faded. LOVE MY CAT lagged inside, swung five wide for the drive but failed
to make an impact. BLESS AND HONOR bobbled at the break, dropped off the pace, faltered through the lane and was eased late. EXPECT THE
SUNRISE , five wide outside runners pursuing the early pace, dropped in some around the turn, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS , well positioned in the three path around the turn, gained command approaching the eighth pole then drew off under steady
handling. HUFFLEPUFF , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, finished willingly. FORTES hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the
three path in upper stretch and had a mild rally. SPECIAL FREEDOM lacked speed, raced well off the rail around the turn and failed to rally. STRIKE
MAGIC set the pace along the inner rail, remained on her left lead in the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SPANIKOPITA , four deep on the turn, gave
way.

Footnotes
JACKIE THE JOKER drafted well back early on and settled off the rail, commenced a run as a duel developed leaving the far turn, cruised up three to four
wide to take aim past the three eighths, forged to command in upper stretch, kicked clear after being set down past the three sixteenths, widened to the
sixteenth pole then held sway while kept alert. CLICK TO CONFIRM stalked outside a rival, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled on a slim lead into
the lane, could not go with the winner past the three sixteenths but gamely found more to cut back into the margin through the final fifty yards.
JERUSALEMA dropped far back while saving ground, swung four to five wide into the lane, straightened and finished with decent energy. JOE MIKE JIM
stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up to a forward position while saving ground, eased out and bid between rivals leaving the far turn, sparred to
the inside of CLICK TO CONFIRM around the turn and into the lane, stayed on willingly to about the three sixteenths then weakened. MONARCH BEACH
was rated back from between rivals early, came under pressure three wide mid turn, pursued into the lane and faded. SOMMER VELVET prompted the
pace outside LOLA FLO, took over into the turn then briefly kicked clear, was joined by a pair of rivals to her outside, stayed on to chase into the stretch
then gave way. LOLA FLO rushed up inside to take the early lead, took outside pressure, ceded the lead into the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
OUTKISSED brushed with GOLDENIZE leaving the starting gate, accelerated along the inner rail to take the lead entering the turn, opened a clear
advantage mid way on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and prevailed under steady urging. KEEPING THE EDGE , well positioned four deep around the
turn, rallied outside the winner. GOLDENIZE brushed with the winner at the start, saved ground around the turn and finished willingly. ZEN MASTER , in the
three path between horses around the turn, lugged in near the sixteenth pole. PRINCE OF FENTON raced between horses around the turn and failed to be
a factor. BURGEE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn, angled out for the drive, worked between horses and passed tired ones. HIS
ROYAL G showed brief speed in the two path and faltered in upper stretch. NANTASKET BEACH , four wide around the turn, was not a factor.
JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT , outrun, swung wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET HOME DIXIE tracked the contested pace four wide, was under a ride past the three eighths, shifted five wide for the drive, made a grinding run to
collar AWARD WANTED in mid stretch, grabbed a short lead a sixteenth later then was fully extended to hold sway. AWARD WANTED , with the pace three
deep and under some rating, dueled outside AWAY TO RETURN from the three eighths, gained a slim advantage entering the lane, got the better of that
rival past the three sixteenths, braced for an outside challenge soon after, ceded command near the sixteenth pole, dueled inside and kept on valiantly.
MISS CHESAPEAKE , five wide outside rivals heading to the turn, circled four to five wide into the lane, advanced between rivals in mid stretch and churned
on while just saving the show. TWEET AWAY ROBIN had speed inside then rated back off the early lead, saved ground making a bit of a run past the five
eighths, dropped back when appearing to want to lug out past the half mile marker, regrouped to advance towards the inside into the lane, shifted out and
came back on between runners in the final seventy yards. AWAY TO RETURN , under a snug hold holding a slim lead between runners early, dueled to the
inside of a foe from mid turn to upper stretch, failed to kick on past the furlong grounds and faded. PETTIGO GIRL , four wide between runners near the five
eighths, angled out well wide for the drive and had belated interest. MI CLEOPATRA AND I steadied when in close soon after the break, settled well back,
angled out around the turn, circled six wide into the stretch, made a run to mid stretch then flattened out. TRUMPET LILLY , in the clear early while not too
far back, was scrubbed along two to three wide mid turn, chased between runners in mid stretch then faded. VIBRANCY , between runners early, swung
well wide for the drive but lacked a rally. LOVE IN HER EYES saved ground, dropped back around the turn and came up empty. MAGGIE'S BID disputed
the early pace inside a pair of rivals, saw those two go clear leaving the half mile marker, stalked to five sixteenths then retreated.

HONOR YOUR MOTHER stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, took command near the eighth pole then drove clear. TARGE sprinted clear leaving
the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail entering the turn, saved ground and weakened the final furlong. SUMMER ODDS , three wide around the turn,
drifted out a bit in upper stretch then drifted in late while rallying. FANCY PRINCESS raced along the inner rail, chased the pace and weakened the final
furlong. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , no factor, swung four wide leaving the turn. KERICS BEAUTY saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the
stretch and failed to rally. MEMPHIS MAFIA , in the two path between horses on the turn, gave way approaching the stretch. DAUNTLESS GAL trailed.

SEANOW sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside while handling some pressure, shook clear mid turn, responded when put to a drive near the
three sixteenths, opened up in mid stretch then dug in to prevail. SPITBALL , between foes nearing the half mile marker, secured the inside and edged up
past the five sixteenths, eased back out leaving the furlong grounds and finished gamely to gain. THE GREAT DANSKY , three to four wide early, chased
outside a rival mid turn, shifted in leaving the eighth pole and had a mild kick. ALGEBRAIC broke a step slow, rushed up soon after and prompted the pace
outside the winner, failed to keep up with that one entering the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. FORTUNE'S FOOL gave hard chase three
to four wide, stayed within range to upper stretch then gave way. JEBOLOGIST , inside foes early, dropped back around the turn.

HIT A HOMER HONEY settled off the pace while saving ground, picked up momentum mid turn, eased out with run past the three sixteenths, progressed
under a drive and between runners near the sixteenth pole and just got up. SKYLAR'S LADY tracked the pace three to four wide, moved up under pressure
in mid stretch, gained a slim advantage leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but was edged at the line. CABRA CHICA broke outward, was
corrected and was hard used early vying outside, shook clear leaving the far turn, angled in to set the pace, widened the margin after a half mile, failed to
contain challenges near the sixteenth pole and faded. CHICA RABIOSA was sent from the inside to dispute the pace, rated back off the leader leaving the
half mile marker, angled out and pursued around the turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. MIZ THE BEST , off the pace, angled four wide
for the drive and failed to menace.
