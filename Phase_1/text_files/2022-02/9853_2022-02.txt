CATALOGUE was off a step slow, moved up from the inside down the backstretch, angled four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to be clear late
under strong handling. EL DIABLO GRANDE chased the top pair early, raced three wide around the far turn and finished second best. DAVE showed good
early speed while racing between rivals and weakened a bit in the final stages. GOOD JUDGMENT dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and made a good late gain. D'YETI MAN was quick to begin to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DANCE FOR RANSOM
raced three wide around the far turn and never was a factor. GOOSE bobbled at the break, raced towards the inside and had no response. DRASTIC was
bumped at the break and never threatened.

SMACKFIRE dueled for the early lead while racing along the inside and held well to prevail under all out pressure. SECRET MISTRESS dueled early on,
raced two deep and finished willingly to the wire. TAKE CHARGE PATTI chased the top pair from the inside, raced three wide through the lane and kept on
to the wire. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS stalked the pace, raced four wide in the drive and showed good late interest. NEBRASKA RED was hustled early,
raced three to four wide and had not enough in the drive. D L'S GIRL dropped back early, raced three wide and had no respponse. EQUIFOX was hustled
from the outside and failed to respond. ADD IT ALL UP was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. TAKE HER TEMP

Footnotes
THEBOYFROMJERSEY was forwardly placed early on, took command down the backstretch and held gamely to prove best under steady handling.
WATER PATROL was allowed to settle early on, moved up four to three wide in the drive and got up for the place position. HOLIDAY MAN pressed the
pace while racing between rivals and weakened late. FULKERSON stalked the pace, raced two to three wide and had not enough. ASTUTE WARRIOR was
bumped at the break, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS was unhurried early, raced four wide in the lane
and had no response. PANIC BUTTON was bumped at the break, raced far back early and never threatened. RENVYLE was bumped at the break, raced
six wide at the eighth pole and never threatened. FERRARI ROAD dropped back early and failed to respond while racing four wide. ETERNAL FORCE vied
for the early lead and tired readily.
