Footnotes
BACK ALLEY JAMMIN saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch while commencing a rally between horses, outkicked rivals
while claiming place at the furlong grounds before shifting course to the five path in pursuit of the clear leader leaving that junction, flopped back to his left
lead entering the final sixteenth, but sustained his charge to reach the leader approaching the wire. ARGYBARGY BUCK vied for the lead outside of a rival
while intentionally staying a path away, then drew off in the three path entering the lane, managed a clear margin into the final sixteenth, but was reeled in
late. RY DONT LIE stalked behind the leading pair while in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, but was
outkicked by an inner rallying rival for place approaching the furlong grounds, then chased the top pair home while securing show. HALF CAPPUCCINO
pressed three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders entering the lane, and failed to menace. RUN TO BLADE vied for the lead along the inside of
ARGYBARGY BUCK, but gave way entering the lane, and weakened. THAT VEGAS BOY chased under urging from midpack while taking the turn in the
four path and outside of foes, ,fanned to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally on his left lead. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY raced in midpack in the two
to three path around the turn while between horses, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but tired on his left lead. C. C. MAC was last away and never
got involved. LOUISIANA LEE showed little.

Footnotes
MR. UNIVERSE broke a step slowly at the start and trailed the field around the first turn, gained in the two path and between horses around the far turn
before tipping to the five path in upper stretch, rallied well to bid for the lead along with an outer DEER CROSSING at the sixteenth pole, led shortly after,
dueled with that foe to the wire, and held gamely. DEER CROSSING settled off of the pace in the four path, got floated to the eight path while outside of
foes entering the lane, rallied outside of rivals in midstretch to bid along with an inner MR UNIVERSE at the sixteenth pole, battled with that foe through the
late stages, but was fended off. TAMBOURINE STAR rated far off of the pace while shifting down to the three path around the first turn, tucked to the rail in
the early part off the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn before shifting to the two path in upper stretch, gained to attempt a show bid among
rivals at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes at the furlong grounds, altered course outside of the tiring early-pace setters a
sixteenth out, and kept on to reach them for show late. CUSTOM BOBBY'S prompted the pace three to two wide, vied around the far turn, sparred through
upper stretch while flopping leads multiple times, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes at the sixteenth pole, then lost show late. JANETS JAY JAY set
the pace inside of a vying CUSTOM BOBBY'S, sustained a long duel while gamely clinging to a minor margin through midstretch, but yielded in the final
sixteenth. EVERLOVINGHAND tracked from the four path, pressed outside of the leading pair into the far turn, but gave way entering the lane. SY
MICHAEL broke a step slowly between horses at the start, raced far back along the inside, shifted to the five path down the backstretch, got outmoved
around the far turn before tucking back to the three path approaching the lane, then passed tired foes. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS stalked along the inside,
bumped an outer rival into the far turn, but failed to bid, then caved in the final furlong. SEEHOSS stalked two wide, but bumped with an inner foe causing
him to steady into the far turn, then weakened in the four path in upper stretch. INTHEALY raced in midpack while hung in the five path into the first turn,
shifted to the four path around that bend, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane before weakening.

Footnotes
MAKATI PHIL set a clear pace from a chasing AW SHUCKS, held sway from that foe after shifting a path off of the rail in upper stretch, then inched away as
that foe tired in the final sixteenth. AW SHUCKS stalked outside of the clear leader, chased that foe through upper stretch without progressing, then lugged
inwardly passing the furlong grounds, tired through the final sixteenth, but lasted for place. RAHFEES MAN saved ground off of the pace, claimed show
from outer foes approaching the three sixteenths pole while chasing the top pair, altered course outside of a lugging AW SHUCKS approaching the final
sixteenth, but leveled off and failed to reach that rival for place late. TOO MUCH BOURBON trailed the field three wide, then moved up without making an
impact. MR. NASTY TIME chased the leading pair from the three path, but weakened through the lane while hanging on his left lead. PILLAGE DA
VILLAGE laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. DONNA'S COURT stumbled at the start and lost his rider, then galloped around with the rest of
the field before walking off.

Footnotes
JUST BLAZE rated off of the pace along the inside, gained in the two path in upper stretch, split foes three wide at the furlong grounds, bid for the lead
along with an outer HERE COMES KYLE approaching the final sixteenth, dueled between horses through the late stages, and prevailed gamely. HERE
COMES KYLE tracked from off of the pace in the three to four path, tipped to the five path and outside of the leading group entering the lane, rallied to bid
along with an inner JUST BLAZE nearing the sixteenth pole, dueled through the closing stages, but was denied. CHANNEL WON stalked two wide and
between horses around the turn, shifted outside of the leading pair to the four path entering the lane, grinded away on his left lead to reach the front at the
three sixteenths pole after making first-run, led entering the final furlong, but shifted outwardly soon after while meeting a pair of outer challenges, lightly
brushed a foe in the final sixteenth while dueling, but yielded late. HUG THE MUNNY chased along the inside, but lacked a bid. SPECTROLITE tossed his
head at the start while breaking flat-footedly, rushed between horses early on to set the pace inside of a vying foe while staying a path off of the inner rail
around the turn, then weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. W W KAN DO briefly pressed outside of the leading pair early on, but faded in
the four path around the turn. PURE VALOR vied for the lead outside of SPECROLITE while in the three path around the turn, but weakened between
horses at the quarter pole. OUTERBANKS bobbled slightly at the start, then lost touch with the field down the backstretch without rider encouragement, and
was eased through the lane while being distanced, then walked off.

Footnotes
TULANE TRYST took a bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked the dueling trio while comfortably many lengths off into the turn, ranged up outside of
them while well in hand to loom large four wide entering the lane, assumed command under mild coaxing passing the three sixteenths pole, willingly drew
off in midstretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. HE'S IN CHARGE dueled for the lead outside of a pair of foes through quick fractions,
forged a narrow advantage entering the lane, but failed to match strides with an outer bidding TULANE TRYST at the three sixteenths pole, managed place
while tiring through the final furlong, and lasted for that position. SANTA CRUISER laid off of the pace two wide and outside of TULANE TRYST, got floated
from the three path to the five path turning for home by that rival, then chased that foe home while surpassing tiring inner rivals, but failed to reel in a foe for
place. SUPER COMET broke a step slowly while bumping an outer foe at the start, trailed the short field, came into the lane in the four path, and passed
tired foes. PIRATE RICK dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT dueled for
the lead inside of a pair of foes while under a loose rein, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STOCKPILER settled far back in the two path, was held up behind rivals into the far turn, shifted three wide around that bend, then four wide entering the
lane, rallied in the final furlong to reel in the tiring leading pair in the final sixteenth, and cleared late. MR. CUNNINGHAM established a loose advantage
around the first turn, held sway from a chasing BEAU NOIR (IRE) through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead while tiring in the final sixteenth, and
was surpassed by an outer rallying rival approaching the wire, then lasted for place. BEAU NOIR (IRE) stalked the clear leader from the outside, chased as
the main pursuer through upper stretch, but was outkicked for place in the final sixteenth, then failed to return to be unsaddled, and was vanned off. KING
TUFF saved ground at the rear of the field, shifted three wide entering the lane, split foes while diving two wide at the three sixteenths pole, but leveled off
after flopping back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL raced far off of the pace in the four to three path around the turns, and
improved. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) required a pre-race shoe repair while in the paddock, trailed the field two wide, took the far turn in the three path, and
passed tired foes in the lane. LIONESQUE laid off of the pace along the inside, but came under a drive three wide into the far turn to claim show around that
bend, but weakened in upper stretch. CO CONSPIRATOR tugged inside of rivals to a stalking position into the first turn, but faded passing the half mile
pole. SILVER NUGGETS settled off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turns before fanning to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally.
CHOPPED tracked from the two path early on, but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
CHARDONNAY set the pace, led inside of a vying rival while backing down the pace into the far turn, dug in to hold an advantage entering the lane,
responded to shake clear again at the three sixteenths pole, then lasted to the wire. SKRATCH KAT tracked from the two path, gained three wide around
the far turn to press the leaders turning for home, but failed to keep pace with those rivals passing the quarter pole, drifted outwardly in midstretch, yet
regained stride shortly after, surged late in hopes of making a late bid, but ran out of ground. AIN'T BROKE pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, but
failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, chased thereafter, but lost place in the closing stages. GREAT ADVENTURE
rated far back in the two path, tracked from the rear in the four path around the far turn, then moved up outside of rivals in the final sixteenth. MALIBU
KENDALL stalked outside of the leading pair around the first turn before tucking behind them entering the backstretch, saved ground from the pocket
around the far turn, but lacked a bid, and faded. BOMBARRA GOLD saved ground off of the pace early on, advanced to a two wide tracking position around
the far turn, but tired through the lane. DASHING HERO hesitated at the start, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
ATTORNEY TIM tracked in the three path, chased three wide while under urging and not progressing around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane,
picked up stride in midstretch, rallied with a sustained charge through the final furlong to bid inside the final sixteenth, and got up at the wire. FENWICK
STATION stalked two wide, then outside of the leading pair around the far turn, grinded away through midstretch in pursuit of a clear BIG LAKE, ranged up
to bid entering the final sixteenth, dueled to the wire as an outer ATTORNEY TIM lunged, and got outfinished. BIG LAKE bumped an inner foe at the start,
set the pace, showed the way from a vying outer foe around the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch, but met a pair of bidders in the final sixteenth, and
was bested late. PALAZZI laid off of the pace in the two path, inched closer to tracked two wide around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, but
lacked a kick to split rivals approaching midstretch, dove inwardly for clear sailing at the furlong grounds, but leveled off while chasing on the rail through the
late stages. ARTIE'S RUMOR broke a bit inwardly at the start, prompted the pace two wide, bid turning for home, but was repelled and failed to keep pace
with the leader in upper stretch, then faded between horses at the furlong grounds. IOYA AGAIN was pinched between horses at the start, raced at the rear
along the inside, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. RECONVENE bumped an outer foe at the start, raced at the rear two wide, and
got outrun. FORTUITY stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPY A STAR chased from midpack along the inside, altered course from the four path to the three path while circumventing a wandering HOODWINK
entering the lane, rallied inside of LUCKY LINZ in midstretch with multiple lengths to find on the leader, then wore that foe down in the final sixteenth, and
drove clear. ZERO POINT ZERO stalked three wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, drew off at the quarter pole, but tired in the final furlong, was bested by a
rival in the final sixteenth, then just saved place. LUCKY LINZ laid off of the pace two wide, got fanned to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on
outside of SPY A STAR in midstretch, but failed to match rallying strides approaching the final sixteenth, and ran out of ground to catch a tiring foe for place.
GOLDEN ACCOUNT broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace along the inside, then passed tired foes for a minor share. VERRAZANO ISLAND was off a
beat slowly, trailed the field around the turn, and passed tired rivals in the late. SURE BABY laid off of the pace three wide, but floated to the seven path
entering the lane, and lacked a rally. SKY FACTOR dueled for the lead along the inside, but offered little resistance to an outer bidder at the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened thereafter. HOODWINK dueled for the lead two wide, failed to keep pace between horses turning for home, drifted outwardly entering
the lane, and stopped.
