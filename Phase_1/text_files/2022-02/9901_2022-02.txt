Footnotes
C F JOHNATHAN was sent for early positioning out of the gate, vied inside of a rival, shifted a bit off of the rail entering the lane, which allowed for SIR
POKERFACE to offer a rail challenge in upper stretch, but repelled that foe's bid in midstretch, and held sway to the wire. SIR POKERFACE bumped with
an outer rival soon after the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground before attempting a bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, but was kept at bay
and proved second best. SEMI CHARMED LIFE vied two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. MY GUITAR broke
in and bumped an inner foe soon after the start, stalked while forwardly placed two wide and between horses around the first turn, chased outside of the
leading pair around the far turn, got floated four wide entering the lane, and tired. MY LITTLE FLACO stalked three wide around the first turn, but weakened
after a half mile. STAR APPEARANCE hopped before being pinched between rivals soon after the start, and never got involved.

COFFEE COUNTY bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, steadied to avoid running up on the leader's heels approaching the five

back to his left lead leaving the furlong grounds, and inched away. CANDY SHOPPER took a solid bump from an inner rival at the start causing him to
nudge an outer foe soon after, saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on in midstretch, shifted outside of HOTPIN approaching the final sixteenth, and
reached that foe on the wire to claim place. HOTPIN set the pace along the inside, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, gave way to the thereafter, then
got nailed on the wire for place. SINGLE SHOT pressed two wide around the turn, but was floated three wide entering the lane, and yielded passing the
quarter pole. COURTMAN never got involved. FIREINTHESTORM chased three wide under mild urging around the turn, drifted to the five path entering the

Footnotes
PRINCESS RENEE moved forward just before the gates opened and almost broke through, tracked from midpack along the inside, swung to the seven path
passing the quarter pole, rallied down the center of the track to reel in the tiring leader a sixteenth from home, and drove clear. VALERIE VALESKI set a
clear pace in the two path, was driven to sustain a clear margin approaching the five sixteenths pole. hung on his left lead while holding sway through
midstretch, but was overhauled by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole while, and held place. RIVETRIX chased outside of the leader while in the four path
around the turn, then got outkicked by an outer rallying rival for place in midstretch, and kept on. TIDDLY stalked in the two path around the turn, then hung
on his left lead through the lane and failed to produce a bid. VEILAZIG trailed along the inside, and moved up through the lane. I LOVE TO RACE took the
turn in the four path while off of the pace, and made little impact. ELLA'S LIL STAR never got involved.

Footnotes
FED MONEY stalked in the three to two paths around the turns, bid inside of the drifting leader at the three sixteenths pole along with an outer ULTIMATE
IRONY, then held gamely from that chasing foe through the lane. ULTIMATE IRONY tracked two wide, then from the three path while outside of FED
MONEY around the far turn, bid inside of the leader along with that foe at the three sixteenths pole, chased while not quite able to reach his inner
counterpart's throatlatch through the final furlong, and saved place from an outer rival on the wire. CALL ME PLUCKY leaned a bit inwardly at the start,
tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, swung to the seven path leaving the quarter pole, grinded away with a mild rally through
midstretch, but produced a late kick in the final furlong to close in on the leading pair late, but missed reaching place. EVIE'S PRINCE hopped slightly at the
start while breaking half a beat slowly, lagged behind the field around the first turn, closed the gap into the far turn while in the two path, then moved up
between horses in the closing stages. CARTIER CAT saved ground off of the pace, but lacked a kick to produce a rail rally through the lane. BALTIC FLEET
set the pace in the two path before widening his advantage passing the three quarter pole, maintained a wide margin in the three path around the far turn
before being guided to the five path at the quarter pole, but drifted to the six path in upper stretch while weakening on his left lead. GUNNER PAUL laid off
of the pace three wide, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF NEANY broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked behind the leaders from the two path, tipped outside of them into the far turn,
produced a three wide sweep to the front with a quarter mile to go, showed the way from THE GREY BEAUTY entering the lane as that foe battled on, but
shifted a bit outwardly in upper stretch to create separation, and drew clear entering the final furlong. THE GREY BEAUTY was squarely bumped by an
outer rival at the start, vied inside of DREAM TOWN early on, got headed by a bidding DREAMING OF NEANY approaching the quarter pole, disposed of
her outer early pace-setting counterpart before shifting ground outwardly to engage the leader entering the lane, dug in through upper stretch, but yielded
leaving the furlong grounds. AKIANE'S SOLDIER leaned in and brushed the gate at the start, settled at the rear along the inside, saved ground before
improving inside of foes entering the lane, claimed show at the three sixteenths pole, and chased the leading pair home. DREAM TOWN vied two wide, got
outkicked by an outer bidding foe approaching the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. HERE COMES LOVIE laid off of the pace in the four path around
the first turn, tucked to the inside approaching the half mile pole, chased the leading trio from the two path around the far turn before tipping back to the four
path turning for home, but tired in the five path under no rider encouragement through the final furlong. START WELL stalked three wide, but weakened in to
the far turn. GLORY TO ME laid off of the pace two wide, but was outrun.

FLEETRIDGE prompted the pace two wide from the four path around the first turn, cleared his inner counterpart at the seven sixteenths before tucking to
the rail into the far turn, met that rival's re-challenge around that bend, got headed entering the lane, but fought back to reclaim the advantage again in
upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch, flopped back to his left lead as SMOKEY HARBOR menaced at the sixteenth pole, and held gamely. SMOKEY
HARBOR settled off of the pace in the two to three path around the turns, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied to take aim on a clear
FLEETRIDGE in midstretch, ranged up a sixteenth from home, but was fended off late. ONE TIME GEM set the pace inside of a vying FLEETRIDGE while
a path off of the rail around the first turn, allowed that rival to clear off into the far turn to re-engaged from the outside, briefly regained an advantage entering
the lane, but yielded to his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then got outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and safely managed show
thereafter. EAST LEX bumped with an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path around the far turn, then to the
five path approaching midstretch, and stayed on to reach a minor share approaching the wire. AMENDED tracked along the inside, but failed to threaten the
leaders while chasing through the lane. LOOKIN HIGH stalked in the three path around the first turn, then in the two to three path arond the far turn before
tipping to the four path at the quarter pole, but was outkicked for minor placings by an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. PAYNT BATTLE
rated far back two wide, then saved ground while improving around the far turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but failed to factor.
BORGOBYTHESEA bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three path before being hung in the five path around the far turn,
and failed to menace. VINCITORE rated at the rear in the two path, then in the four path around the far turn, but made little impact. REDIVIVUS raced at the
rear in the five to three path, and was outrun. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN tracked in midpack in the four path, drifted to the six path entering the lane, and

SIMPLY VALID set the pace inside of a prompting LOYAL TO THE GAME, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, drew off while resenting right handed
cropping through midstretch causing him to shy a bit inwardly each time, then flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, and was driven home
to seal the deal. LOYAL TO THE GAME prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart while drifting
outwardly in upper stretch, and proved second best. MRTANDROSEYSBOY backed out from between horses approaching the three furlong pole to lay off
of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path and outside of foes entering the lane, and moved up to claim show at the furlong grounds.
GOROSTIETA'S LOVE chased the leading pair along the inside while under steady urging, but lost show to an outer rival leaving the furlong pole. HERO
DRAGON never got involved. OLD FORTY FIVE broke outwardly, tracked from midpack three wide, then from between horses entering the lane, and tired.
HE IS WORTHY broke a step slow, was outrun throughout while showing little and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
FOLIAGE stalked along the inside, altered course three wide and outside of the leading pair at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds,
and kicked clear shortly after. RATIFICATION was fractious loading, tracked in the two path while inside of foes around the turn, tipped to the three path in
upper stretch, and stayed on to reach place on the wire. TWENTYONE N CHANGE set the pace along the inside, proved no match for the eventual winner
passing the furlong grounds, gave way, and got nailed on the wire for place. AHIMAAZ prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner
counterpart at the quarter pole, and faded. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL got caught in the four path while off of the pace, shifted to the seven path at the quarter
pole, and failed to threaten the leaders. MERCABO COVE tracked in the three path around the turn, and weakened under light encouragement through the
lane. SHANGHAI TRICK hopped at the start significantly costing him early positioning, then trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
PROXY bobbled a bit at the start, tracked from off of the pace two wide, commenced a gain entering the lane with many lengths to find on the dueling
leading pair, shifted outside of them in upper stretch, ranged up to them at the furlong grounds, swept past leaving that station, and drew off under mild
urging. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) pressed the pace setter from the outside through quick splits, dueled with that foe around the far turn as they kicked
away from the rest of the field, sustained the battle through midstretch before being overpowered by an outer bidding foe leaving the furlong grounds, then
prevailed for place. TREASURY set a quick pace inside of a pressing AMERICAN TATOO (ARG), dueled with that foe around the far turn, but offered little
resistance to an outer rival's bid leaving the furlong grounds, then was bested in his battle for place. BLUE JAYS lagged well behind early on, shifted to the
six path entering the lane while still trailing, and stayed on willingly. STARRININMYDREAMS tracked along the inside of PROXY around both turns, then
chased along the rail without menacing through the lane. GUILLAUME stalked three wide, but faded turning for home. SCARLET FUSION raced off of the
pace four wide around the first turn, and made little impact thereafter. SERMONONTHEMOUNT laid off of the pace three wide early on, and never got
involved.
