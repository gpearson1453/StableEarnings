Footnotes
AL BROWN stalked the pace three wide, took closer order as a duel developed around the turn, circled five wide and responded when given his cue into the
lane, rallied on his left lead and under pressure to take command leaving the mid stretch, kept on under a drive and drew clear. RUN FAST disputed the
pace outside ZORB, moved to near even terms leaving the far turn, was floated out a bit while battling into the lane, sparred between runners leaving mid
stretch and kept on gamely to earn the place. ZORB advanced inside foes to take command, set a pressured pace into the turn, went head and head with
RUN FAST from the three eighths, drifted to about the three path into the lane, straightened and continued the fight past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. TRIGZ TOO broke awkwardly, rated off the leaders while about four wide, was under pressure three wide into the lane and churned on.
CHAMBO , well placed saving ground and in range of the embattled leaders, was coaxed along past the five sixteenths, eased out leaving mid stretch but
failed to generate a solid kick. DAPER'S DRINK drafted well back off the early pace, saved some ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SISTER SUPREAM set a pressured pace along the inner rail, asserted herself in upper stretch and eagerly drew off while kept to her business. SMART
EULEE lacked speed, raced in the two path inside horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. HELIACAL RISING
raced in the two path on the turn, lacked the necessary rally and passed tired foes late. MARKET OF STOCKS , three wide chasing the pace around the
turn, gave way. BOSS ANGEL prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered in mid stretch. MO FIRE circled horses on the turn and faltered.
IMAGINTHEKISS broke slowly, hugged the inner rail down the backstretch and into the turn then faltered mid way on the turn. ROYAL FLUSH GIRL ,
caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
MAMA G'S WISH , bumped between rivals at the break, was coaxed along early on and edged up off the rail, shifted out wider around the turn and swept
six wide into the stretch, leveled off nicely under left handed asking, forged to command outside rivals leaving mid stretch, spurted away and was mildly
hand ridden the final seventy yards. I'M GITTIN THERE was eased back from between runners near the half mile pole and found herself well back, was
under a hearty ride off the rail leaving the three eighths, came five to six wide for the drive and closed willingly outside runners to gain the place. MY BOSS ,
away alertly, dueled two wide and to the inside of MISS CENTRAL, clung to a slim lead to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MISS CASEY , off slowly,
lagged off the early pace while saving some ground, eased out around the turn, worked between runners past mid stretch and continued on with interest.
SHE'S A BIG DEAL stalked the duel between foes, raced three to four wide in upper stretch, shifted in and came up empty. MISS CENTRAL drifted out at
the break and bumped with a rival, edged up in hand and joined MY BOSS, dueled outside that one into and around the turn, drifted to about the four path
into the stretch, corrected and stayed on to mid stretch then faded. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , bumped at the break, moved up outside rivals and stalked
three deep, angled five wide into the stretch, remained a presence to mid stretch and faded. MUSIC MANDATE was sent up to the inside of rivals and
prompted the pace, checked out of a tight spot nearing the turn, regrouped and pursued to the quarter pole then gave way.

Footnotes
TITAN'S WILL , quickly clear after the break, set the pace slightly off the rail, opened up in mid stretch and was under urging in the drive. LOST MY
VOWCHER , off last, checked in tight quarters between horses leaving the backstretch, circled foes five deep leaving the far turn, rallied and drifted in near
the eighth pole. HAYNE'S FEVER , along the inner rail most of the trip, was well positioned in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened.
BAHAMA CHANNEL , four wide the first turn, advanced in the two path leaving the backstretch and flattened out in the drive. WILLIAM CROTTY , never a
threat, passed tired horses late. AMEN CORNER offered a mild advance in the three path between horses on the far turn then weakened. MILITARY HOP ,
six deep the first turn, advanced in the two path leaving the far turn and faltered in upper stretch. SEIZE THE DAY , in the five path between horses the first
turn, faltered on the far turn. FACTOR THIS IN , wide the far turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA BELLA , away alertly, patiently tracked the leader around the turn, responded and went on the attack past the five sixteenths, was roused
clear in upper stretch, wandered outward a bit inside the furlong grounds, was corrected with right handed asking and held firm. IF THEN flashed speed
then drafted back off rivals past the five eighths, rated into the turn, steadied briefly off heels near the three eighths, dropped down and advanced along the
rail into the lane, eased out past sixteenth pole to work between foes, dove back in and finished gamely to earn the place. DATS A SUPERSTAR had speed
inside, stalked inside around the turn, eased out and chased between runners past mid stretch, kept on willingly and narrowly got the show. MAGIC IN ME ,
off the early pace, picked up momentum and advanced three wide leaving the far turn, gave hard chase outside foes past mid stretch and kept trying.
MARTHARITA , off the pace while inside foes near the half mile marker, shifted three wide but lacked a rally. GOOD STORY took over between runners
near the five eighths then cleared off, dropped in to set the pace, could not resist the winner leaving the quarter pole, stayed on willingly to about mid stretch
then weakened. EMBRACE THE WHINNY , off the pace while between runners, raced off the rail into the lane and failed to menace. SHE SO COOL saved
ground leaving the half mile pole and failed to threaten. FEEL THE GLORY , in hand early raced three deep nearing the turn and faded. PER RULING
#22-084 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, CALIFORNIA BELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
NASHVEGAS prompted the pace down the backstretch and into the turn, gained a three deep lead approaching the stretch, opened up under urging in mid
stretch and was not threatened late. NO MORE TALK , in the three path turning for home, rallied between horses. POINT DRIVEN , four wide leaving the
turn, offered a mild advance to mid stretch then gave way. CAPITAN FOFO bumped with UNEQUIVOCAL leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside
the winner, raced in the two path on the turn and faded in the drive. UNEQUIVOCAL , bumped at the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn and checked in
tight quarters at the head of the stretch. FORT FORTITUDE , shuffled back leaving the backstretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RIPPOLINO , four wide around the first, remained well wide while tracking, bid four wide outside foes near the three eighths, spurted clear past the five
sixteenths, repelled an inside challenge near the three sixteenths, kicked back clear under stout left handed encouragement and proved best. JACK GAVE
BACK settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide soon after, straightened and closed willingly to nab the
place. DR. FERBER stalked inside, got through advancing near the five sixteenths, threatened the winner soon into the lane, altered out leaving mid stretch
and kept on with interest. MAID THE JOURNEY stalked the pace, bid three wide between foes nearing the three eighths, forced the issue past the five
sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. SHOULDA HAD IT , keen early, cleared off and set the pace two wide, was taken on from both sides
leaving the three eighths and weakened. SOUPER EMPEROR , off slow after having his head turned at the break, settled in the clear soon into the
backstretch, was under pressure around the final turn but failed to respond.
