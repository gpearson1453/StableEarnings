Footnotes
KARAN'S NOTION stalked the early pace three to four wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and edged clear to prove best under a drive. GHOST
GAME dueled for the lead on the inside and was outfinished by the winner while staying on for the place gamely. ALL THREES was rated off the duel early,
then was rank on the inside by the half mile marker, then kept on the inside on the turn and was boxed by the quarter pole, angled off the inside when
straightened, then had to check leaving the furlong marker, then closed fast late to miss the place award, rough trip. ALPHA CHI RHO dueled for the early
lead and made a three wide bid on the turn, drifted out slightly by the furlong marker and faded late. SEMPER FI was rated along three wide and came five
wide into the drive but had no kick. STONE COURAGEOUS was allowed to settle and was on the inside on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
EL BOCHINCHE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take a short lead, then had a long drive and exchanged bumps with
BIRTHDAY WISH in the furlong grounds and prevailed late. BIRTHDAY WISH dueled for the lead on the inside, then exchanged bumps in the furlong
grounds, fought gamely to the wire to just miss. PASS IT ON was allowed to settle early, was on the inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally, bested
rest. ALL ABOUT AUDREY chased the pace three wide and weakened. SUNDAY SWAGGER was reserved early on the inside and came five wide into the
drive but had no rally. SUZZETTE STAR dueled for the lead two wide and weakened. The rider on BIRTHDAY WISH claimed foul against the winner for the
run in the stretch, after the Stewards reviewed the replays the race was left as is.
