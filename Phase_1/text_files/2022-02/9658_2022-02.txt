the furlong marker and drew clear late to prove best under a drive. BOSSY CAT was rated along early, then made a four to three wide move on the turn, but
needed more in the drive while gaining the place award. CHILLING SECRET was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid between rivals on the
far turn to gain command by the quarter pole but flattened out. JOZANI R V F was void of early speed, then found best stride late. LOVEDISC vied for the

EQUAL JUSTICE broke sharply and quickly showed to the front and crossed over to the inside, then shook clear leaving the turn and drew out in the drive
to prove best under a mild drive. WHAT'S TO BLAME tracked the early pace two wide, then shifted out four wide leaving the three eighths marker, then
came four wide into the drive and finished willingly to gain the place award. I SEE THE STARS stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on
the turn and flattened out, lost place award late, bested rest. HESASMOKIN pressed the early pace four wide and weakened. KUDURO stumbled badly at
the start then was five wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. BREITHORN was well placed on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S DREAM dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew out in the final furlong to prove best under a
drive. COUNTESS SHANAKILL chased the early pace three to four wide, swung out five wide for the drive and was along for the place award. SUNSHINE
BAY was with the pace and made a mild bid three wide leaving the turn but faded the final furlong. SEEKING THE THRONE was allowed to settle early,
advanced on the inside on the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid on the inside. ABOVE THE LINE dueled for the early lead on the inside and
weakened. BEST CAUSE failed to respond. FAIRFIELD chased the early pace two wide, then was three wide on the turn and swung out four wide for the
drive and was empty. GRAY LOLLIPOPS failed to menace. The race was delayed fifteen minutes because COUNTESS SHANAKILL had to return to the
paddock for broken equipment.

Footnotes
WICKED SOLUTION vied for the early lead on the in side, then was rated off the pace and well placed on the inside down the backstretch, made a two wide
bid leaving the five sixteenths, drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best. NEARLY MISSED stalked the early pace and made a
three wide bid on the far turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch but saved the place award. PRIDE IN THE BIZ chased the early pace, then was
four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the lane and was along for the show spot to best the rest. ALLISON K was settled back early, then advanced
five wide on the far turn and came seven wide into the drive and passed the faders. GIZMO'S DESTINY passed the tiring rivals. LOLANITA chased the pace
on the inside and tired. BIRD TRAFFIC was settled early on the inside, was roused leaving the half mile marker and had no response.
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace and drop down to the inside and then gave way after six furlongs.
