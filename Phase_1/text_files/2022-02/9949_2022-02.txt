Footnotes
GALILETA was hustled to the lead, set an uncontested pace, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, and held. LOVELY LINDA stalked the pace two wide,
raced three wide into the lane, found her best stride in the final furlong, gained steadily on the leader late but missed. THECHAMPISFLORING stalked the
pace inside of LOVELY LINDA, came into the lane between that foe and SWEET RYAN, lacked the needed kick to engage the leader in the lane, flattened
out late but held the show. FOXY CARMELA chased three wide, swung four wide into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, kept on willingly in the lane
but missed the show. WILLING TO BURN was slow into stride, trailed near the center of the track down the back straight, improved three to four wide
around the turn, and chased on mildly seven wide in the lane. KISSABLE U raced toward the rear early while a bit keen, improved to midfield inside of
SWEET RYAN into the turn, took up sharply approaching the three eighths and dropped back to last, was driven into the lane, and passed tiring horses late.
GOLD ROSE settled near the rear two deep early, was urged toward the rear around the turn, swung six wide under a drive into the lane and lacked the
needed rally. SWEET RYAN chased midpack, was joined from both sides past the half to chase between horses, came into the lane in range inside of
THECHAMPISFLORING, but emptied out past the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
GRAY ADMIRAL broke well, raced three wide in the stalking flight into the clubhouse turn, took the lead from the three quarters, set the pace comfortably
down the back straight while positioned five wide, continued on the lead through the second turn, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, and held sway
while drifting out. MARKET KING shook to the lead into the clubhouse turn, was relegated to stalk after GRAY ADMIRAL took the lead outside him near the
three quarters, continued to track the leader around the far turn and when driven into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, but narrowly held onto
the place between horses late. HOUSE LIMIT settled inside near the rear through the clubhouse turn, continued between horses near the rear down the
back straight, chased inside around the far turn, swung out near the quarter pole and went to a drive, boxed on with interest four deep down the lane, and
narrowly missed catching MARKET KING for the place. RONAMO was last away, settled at the rear, raced three wide with the rear flight down the back
straight, continued four wide toward the rear around the far turn, responded when driven in upper stretch, angled in as he rallied, and narrowly missed the
place inside of MARKET KING. MIKE OPERATOR raced at the inside of the stalking flight into the first turn, was wrangled back to midpack inside
approaching the backstretch, continued to chase inside foes around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch, edged a bit closer, but flattened in the final
furlong. GAGE HAS A GRAY chased three deep through the first turn, raced five wide down the back straight, was urged three deep into the far turn, and
offered no bid. STEAL HOME raced in the stalking flight between horses into the first turn, tracked the leading pair two wide down the back straight, and
weakened from the half mile mark. DON'TTEASETHETIGER settled toward the rear, raced four wide through the clubhouse turn and six wide down the
backstretch, and was outpaced from the half.

Footnotes
JOY IN GRACE came in and bumped COASTAL RUN in the opening strides, chased inside well behind the leading pair in the opening furlong, took closer
order inside from near the five eighths, engaged inside the leader into the turn, vied on the pace inside around the bend, kicked clear under a drive in upper
stretch, drifted out, but still found enough to hold off OUR LITTLE TIGER. The latter chased inside early, rallied inside foes in the two to three path past the
three eighths, tipped out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, separated well from the rest of the field but missed reeling in the winner.
STREET SHADOW settled near the rear, continued in the two to three path toward the rear around the far turn, was driven into the lane, rallied mildly
between horses and proved best of the rest. SMOOTH RITHMS led early, was engaged from both sides approaching the half, attended between the leading
pair around the turn, proved no match approaching the quarter pole, and chased on under a drive while finding no late kick. CRAZY GOOD chased between
horses down the back straight well off the leading pair, floated into the five path around the far turn while racing toward the rear, and lacked the needed rally.
COASTAL RUN was awkward into stride after being bumped in the opening strides, chased the leading pair three wide in the opening furlong, engaged four
wide approaching the half mile mark, vied for the lead three wide around the turn, was no match for that foe from the quarter and emptied out. MISCHIEF
MAMA stalked outside of SMOOTH RITHMS early, came three wide into the bend, but weakened steadily from the three eighths. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ
settled at the rear, was urged outside of STREET SHADOW while racing in the six path around the turn, but offered no bid.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR GOLD tracked the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, bid on the leading flight approaching the half while
racing just outside of STORMING WARRIOR, raced between horses in the leading flight around the far turn, vied outside of STORMING WARRIOR in
upper stretch, wrested the upper hand for good approaching the sixteenth mark, and held between horses. SINGLE BARREL chased between horses
through the clubhouse turn, raced two wide in the tracking flight into the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn but slow to respond, chased three
deep around that bend, began to improve approaching the stretch, swung seven wide into the lane, found his best in the final sixteenth and missed.
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND stalked outside of TOP ROCKET, was four wide in the leading pair after STORMING WARRIOR and LOOKIN FOR GOLD came
up the inside approaching the half, raced three wide in the leading flight through the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch, chased on willingly six wide in
range under a drive in the lane but was outkicked. AUTISM SIBLINGS raced two wide in the rear pair through the first turn and down the back straight, was
driven in second last in the three to four path on the far turn, swung eight wide in upper stretch, rallied, found his best stride in the final sixteenth but came
too late. TOP ROCKET shook to the lead inside, was engaged from the inside by STORMING WARRIOR and LOOKIN FOR GOLD near the half, raced
three wide in the leading flight around the far turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter, continued under vigorous hand urging after his rider lost the crop
near the quarter, kept on with interest between horses in the lane but was outfinished. STORMING WARRIOR was taken to the rear early, improved inside
into the first turn, bid inside down the backstretch and engaged at the inside of the leading flight near the half, vied inside around the far turn, led narrowly in
upper stretch, but weakened late. TALKIN MALICE was keen three deep around the clubhouse turn, raced at the chasing flight three deep near the rear into
the backstretch, improved position slightly to race between horses in the chasing flight around the far turn, but flattened approaching the quarter and was no
further threat in the lane. EMPIRE WICKET raced at the inside of the rear pair, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the back straight, was pushed
along at the inside of the chasing group around the far turn and weakened inside down the lane. MUSKYMAN raced four deep in the chasing flight around
the clubhouse turn, gradually lost position toward the center of the track down the back straight, trailed in the five path around the far turn and had no

Footnotes
STITZY tracked the leading pair inside while racing a bit keenly early, tracked the leading trio down the back straight and into the far turn, continued to track
inside around that bend, was driven for an inside bid into the lane, took the lead near the furlong mark, and kicked clear late. SKY JUMPER stalked the
leader, took closer order near the half, raced outside of N. K. ROCKET MAN in the leading flight around the far turn, headed that foe near the quarter,
continued to vie with the leading flight into the lane, was no match for STITZY inside the furlong mark, came in and bumped VICENTE'S SHADOW in the
final furlong, and got the nod for place. VICENTE'S SHADOW settled at the rear early, was at the inside of the rear flight around the back straight, began to
improve approaching the far turn, gained well past the three eighths, sustained his rally between horses in the lane, was bumped by SKY JUMPER inside
the furlong mark, lost some momentum, continued to fight on nonetheless and lost the nod for place. NOLONGERAHOBBY chased between horses early
and three wide into the first turn, chased two wide down the back straight, was pushed along for a bid between horses on the far turn, engaged the leading
flight four wide into the lane, was no match for STITZY from near midstretch, and was outkicked for the place. N. K. ROCKET MAN was keen to the lead
and soon clear, was engaged while leading two wide around the far turn, was headed near the quarter, still fought on between the leading flight to the
furlong mark, and weakened late. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) chased three wide early, settled back toward the rear into the first turn, continued near the
rear down the back straight and while positioned three wide on the far turn, improved past the three eighths, was in range of the main pack in upper stretch
but emptied out in the final eighth. BLUE AZUL chased inside early, inched forward through the first turn to track the leading pair outside of STITZY,
advanced further down the backstretch to stalk the leader outside of SKY JUMPER, gradually lost position three wide on the far turn and had no further
response after being driven into the lane. CALIBOGEE raced two wide at the rear early, continued at the rear down the backstretch and in the two path
around the far turn, and offered no bid. THE STEWARDS PERFORMED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, THEY DISQUALIFIED
SKY JUMPER FROM SECOND TO THIRD FOR BUMPING VICENTE'S SHADOW. THERE IS NO SEVEN EIGHTHS TIME AND THE FINAL TIME IS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
OUTLAW DAISY tracked the leading pair inside early, was pushed along between horses into the turn as CURLIN BLESSING advanced inside, raced in
range two wide around the bend, shifted four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive between horses, took the lead outside of SMILING SALSA near
the sixteenth and proved best. SMILING SALSA stalked outside of CHOCOLATE FRECKLES early, continued to stalk that leader in the three path on the
turn, engaged near the quarter, put the pacesetter away near the three sixteenths pole, was engaged by OUTLAW DAISY inside the furlong mark, and
could not hold that foe at bay late. EYES FOR GOLD settled at the rear, began to improve outside of the field past the half, rallied three to four wide on the
turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, continued her run and proved best of the rest. CURLIN BLESSING chased inside early, improved inside of
OUTLAW DAISY into the turn, raced at the inside of the tracking flight around the turn, proved no match for the leaders into the lane, and chased on mildly
while drifting out. TEMPORARILY bobbled in the opening strides, chased well off the inside down the back straight, continued to chase three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the lane, and could not find the needed kick. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE was hard to settle early, settled near the rear inside of LIP'S OF
WINE, was pushed along into the turn, raced in the two path around the bend, was driven inside down the lane but lacked the needed rally. CHOCOLATE
FRECKLES was sent for speed between horses, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was engaged by SMILING SALSA near
the quarter, lost the lead to that foe near the three sixteenths and weakened between. LIP'S OF WINE settled near the rear outside of KYNLIE'S EMPIRE,
was relegated to the rear into the bend, trailed in the four path, swung six wide under a drive into the lane and offered no bid.

Footnotes
PERFECT FANNY chased between horses, was sent for a bid on the leading pair near the three eighths, sustained that bid three wide under a drive in the
lane, and wrested the lead in the final forty yards. BIBLEMAN was sent to the early lead, led in the two path on the turn, was driven two wide to keep on
from upper stretch, made a game try but could not hold off PERFECT FANNY in the final stages. RICKEY B raced six wide in the chasing flight, was driven
into the lane while still six wide, finally found his best stride in the final sixteenth and made a good belated gain. HOTFOOT tracked the leading pair at the
head of the chasing line early, continued at the inside of the chasing line into the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, kept on between horses
but was ultimately outkicked. CAPITAL EXPENSE tracked the leader inside down the back straight and through the turn, attended the pace inside in upper
stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. SMARTY RIVER PANTS settled at the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven up the rail for a bid in
the lane and made a mild rally. CAPTAIN SCOTTY chased four wide between horses down the back straight and into the turn, continued to chase four wide
in the lane, but was outfinished. OUTLAW raced five wide between horses in the chasing line down the backstretch and on the turn, remained five wide in
upper stretch, and lacked the necessary late kick. MIAMI CROCKETT chased three wide between horses, flattened approaching the turn for home, and
never mustered a bid.

Footnotes
BOLD REY sent to a long and clear lead in the two to three path, drifted back and forth in the lane but had enough to hold. JUST GRACE was prominent
early inside, settled back to chase inside into the clubhouse turn, chased well off the leading pair inside of SUBTLE RIDE into the backstretch, began to gain
from near the three eighths, broke away from the field to make steady gain on the leader down the lane but ran out of track. LILA'S LUCKY LADY settled
near the rear inside of EBB AND FLOW into the first turn, continued near the rear down the back straight and around the far turn, rallied between horses
from upper stretch, and proved best of the rest while never threatening the top pair. STARLIGHT TWIST settled at the rear, continued to trail in the two to
three path on the far turn, swung out near the center of the track in upper stretch, and offered a mild rally. SOJOURNER TRUTH was bumped by
CALLMEJESSIEJAMES in the opening strides, chased outside of JUST GRACE early, chased with the middle of a strung-out field down the back straight,
edged forward around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane between horses, could not match the leading pair in upper stretch and was outfinished late.
BONITA RAPIDS was squeezed between horses early, settled toward the rear outside DADDYS LITTLE GIRL through the clubhouse turn and into the back
straight, chased four wide on the far turn and kept on mildly in the lane. SUBTLE RIDE tracked the leading pair outside of CALLMEJESSIEJAMES early,
gradually lost position down the back straight, raced midfield between horses around the far turn, and lacked a rally in the lane. DADDYS LITTLE GIRL
settled toward the rear inside of BONITA RAPIDS early, chased with the middle of a very strung out field down the back straight and through the turn while
still racing at the inside, was relegated near the rear while still inside into the lane and lacked a rally. EBB AND FLOW settled near the rear outside of LILA'S
LUCKY LADY early, continued in second last down the back straight and while saving ground around the far turn, was driven inside into the lane and offered
no response. CALLMEJESSIEJAMES broke outward and bumped SOJOURNER TRUTH in the opening strides, tracked well behind the leader inside, went
to a drive into the far turn while still tracking well behind the leader, and steadily weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS NO
QUARTER TIME AVAILABLE.
