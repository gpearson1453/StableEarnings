Footnotes
PENETRATOR broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, shook clear late in the turn and drew out steadily through the lane
while kept to pressure. ROYAL CONSORT prompted the pace while three wide, closest to the winner turning for home, proved no match for that one, clearly
second best. CONTRABANDISTA fell well back after the start, continued to lag into the turn, swung widest for the drive, along for the show with some
belated interest, not a threat to the top two. ARISTOCAT in mid pack early off the inside, dropped to the inside late in the turn, went evenly through the lane
in lacking a closing response. HUMERO D'ORO off a step slow, moved up and turned in an even effort while racing in the two path. EL POTENTE pressed
the winner early along the inside, began to give way late in the turn. PUBLIC RECORD in the main body outside, three to four wide exiting the turn, had
nothing for the run to the wire. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO remained always back. CAN MAN DO in the second flight for a half, gave way through the lane.

Footnotes
JERRY'S EIGHTY stalked the leaders in the run up the backstretch outside, ranged up closer to challenge four wide entering the stretch, long drive to the
wire, proved narrowly best under brisk handling. BIG BOSS BEN broke on top, raced with the pace early between foes, continued to vie into and through the
stretch, proved stubborn to the end. SWIFT TAP also with the pace from the start, pressed three wide into the turn, put a head in front late in the bend,
continued to do battle through the lane between the top two and also gave ground grudgingly. SPEAK UNITY last away, of speed for a half, came five out to
six wide turning for home, improved position down the middle of the strip, not a threat to the top three. STEALTH FIGHTER in the second flight while off the
inside, came three wide into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch run. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL failed to menace outside. DEALMEINBUD made little
impact in remaining always back. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY flashed early foot along the inside, began to falter late in the turn.

SOUTHERNER with the pace from the start after breaking well, got clear late on the first turn, rated the middle half, drew off toward the inside through the
lane without feeling the crop to win ridden out. GRAVES MILL ROAD forwardly placed outside, moved closest to the winner late in the final turn, proved no
match for that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. TIZ MCNAMARA within striking distance just off the inside, in some traffic midway on the final
turn, steered out three wide late in that bend for room, unable to do much with the top two through the lane, clear of the others. MEGA MAX void of speed
for five furlongs while saving ground, continued along the inside through the second bend, improved position without posing a serious threat. STUD PUPPY
in mid pack while just off the inside first turn, went three wide through the second bend, improved position slightly with some mild late interest. STRIKE A
BEAT lost footing just after the break, raced well back, three to four wide second turn when advancing, flattened out the final furlong. RECKLESSNESS off
the early pace inside, moved closer up the rail late backstretch, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. MOON IN THE SKY remained always
back. OREGON COUNTY away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner into the first turn, chased that one onto and up the backstretch, began to
weaken in the second turn. MR. COUGAR tired while racing three wide. SEASIDE BOY remained always back in showing little. MAS TAKELA off a step
slow, was finished after a half, continued to steadily fade.

Footnotes
ALL IN SYNC forwardly placed off the inside, in traffic into and through most of the turn, switched out for room when straightened for home, closed under
confident handling to narrowly gain the nod at the wire. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE in the second flight inside the winner into and through the turn, also moved
out a bit for room when the real running began into the stretch, challenged between foes while once again inside the winner late, missed. BANJO BEAR
broke sharp to show the way up the backstretch while being rated, responded when confronted late in the turn, put that foe away to increase advantage a bit
past the furlong marker, challenged by the top two late, proved stubborn to the end. PRESSURE forwardly placed and three wide, remained in striking
position into and through upper stretch, lacked a closing punch. FORTY STRIPES lacked speed in the two path, also found lacking when the real running
began. DRIFTER last away, remained always back in failing to threaten. BACK TO NORMAL chased the early leader off the inside, lodged a brief bid
outside that one turning for home then gave way soon after.

Footnotes
BEER CHASER never far back outside, ranged up outside the leader late in the turn, set down for the drive, wore that rival down late under firm handling.
SALADO broke on top, cleared early, continued to show the way by daylight early turn, responded when the winner came alongside late in the bend, dueled
past the furlong marker and gave ground grudgingly in the late going, remained comfortably clear for the place. LATIN CASINO mid pack and outside, raced
three down to two wide through the turn, proved no match for the top two in the run to the wire, comfortably clear of the rest. APPRAISAL prompted the
issue for a half toward the inside, had little left for the stretch run. ERNIE BANKER raced in mid pack while between foes through the turn, failed to muster a
rally when called on for the drive. NIP N TUCK went one paced along the inside, also failed to respond. WISE KHOZAN off a step slow, failed to menace.
DARKNESS TREMBLES in the second flight early, stopped late the turn, jogged in far back.

Footnotes
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch under a light hold, clear with a half mile to run, shrugged off a foe late in the
turn, clear again upper stretch, drifted out when switched to a left handed crop past the furlong marker, held the runner up at bay under right handed urging.
PATTERN BET settled early off the pace and the inside, advanced to be closest to the winner turning for home while in the three path, chased that same foe
nearing the furlong grounds, came in as that rival came out, could not get to that one late, far clear of the others. RUN FEARLESS raced in mid pack and
outside, four wide through much of the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive. SWEETNESS TO chased the winner for a half off the inside and
began to weaken. CHOCTAW CHARLIE in the second flight just off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, went evenly through the stretch.
LIGHTNING HART off a step slow, moved off the inside, three wide when improving into the stretch, flattened out and went evenly the final furlong.
HAMAZING DEBATE void of speed inside, saved ground through the turn, improved position slightly while picking off a couple of tiring rivals. CATCH A
WHIFF prompted the issue early along the inside and faltered. TWENTYTWENTYREDO finished early while five wide into the turn, continued to weaken.
EPWORTH off a step slow, always back.

Footnotes
STANLEY MARKET prompted the pace three wide, lost some ground to the runner up turning for home, got back to that one inside the furlong marker,
edged clear under steady handling. MEGAN'S CLARA broke in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when
straightened for home, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner inside that one a sixteenth out then could not keep up. CHASING SHADOWS in mid
pack outside, in the two path out of the turn, staged a mild rally to be clear for the show, not a threat to the top pair. ITSY BITSY BETTY dueled up front in
the two path, continued to do battle through the turn, could not keep up in the run to the wire. STARRGARITA broke out and a step slow, trailed, came four
wide out of the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. LITTLE BIRD FLASH one paced while four then three wide through the turn.
FORTUNA ADIUVAT was never dangerous while racing off the inside. BITTER VIXEN in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, tired from those
early efforts. SUPER WONDER GIRL off a step slow, was always outrun. DIXIE PENNY was never a threat.

Footnotes
ZOZOS away in good order, pressed the leader from the outside, joined that one late in the final turn, cleared nearing the furlong marker, roused, drew off.
ELUSIVE TARGET forwardly placed while moving just off the inside into the far turn, fell back off the top pair into the lane, set down, showed good
determination to be up for part of the place while not a match for the winner. BAROSSA broke alertly, showed the way through the first turn, rated in the run
up the backstretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner out of the final turn inside that one, proved no match in the run to the wire, fully extended to
last for the dead heat for place. WICKED GENIUS in some traffic behind the pace through the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, three wide
through the final turn, continued to even fashion to the wire in lacking a closing kick. RUGGS brushed start, raced within striking distance outside, four wide
through the final turn, came up empty when called on for the drive. CAN'T BEAT ME brushed at the break, settled in the main body off the inside, three wide
most of the way, also lacked a serious closing response. WE ALL SEE IT lacked speed in racing in mid pack, also failed to produce a rally when called on
for the stretch run. VODKA N WATER raced back and outside, five out to six wide through the final turn, remained back. LONG CROW in tight at the start,
raced back and was never involved. BUREAU tired while racing toward the inside. CHARTER OAK off a step slow, was always outrun.

Footnotes
ICE ORCHID closest to the leader outside, three path second turn, collared that rival nearing the furlong marker, drew clear then held the runner up safe
under steady handling. SWAP SHOP within striking distance, continued to stalk outside into the far turn, four wide through that bend to lose ground to the
top two exiting the final turn, roused, finished willingly to annex the runner up spot while slowly getting to the runner up late. FAITH'S REWARD away in
good order, drew clear through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, offered brief resistance to the winner through upper
stretch then drifted and weakened, lost the second spot late while saving the show. STAR TABLE lacked early foot, advanced in some traffic midway on the
second turn, steered out to be four wide into the lane and staged a mild rally to be gaining for the show. MADELYN'S MAGIC saved ground when back off
the pace in the first turn, worked way out to be four wide when improving out of the second turn, failed to sustain that advance in the run down the lane.
RUN THE TAP settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a closing kick. OPENING NIGHT broke outward and a step slow, lacked speed while four wide
into the first turn, four wide again through the second bend, remained back. DUNVEGAN DOLL made little impact from well back. SWEET BEAUTY
forwardly placed off the inside, backed up through the stretch. FAST AND FEMININE finished early, trailed home.
