the second flight, angled out on the turn, bid four wide and was outfinished for second. ANATOLIA dueled past the eighth pole and was unable to sustain
her bid. BIG STRETCH raced close to the pace while racing outside, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid.

BLAME THE DEVIL got away well, set a pressured pace to the upper stretch, drew off in the upper stretch and held safely under mild urging. JOKER MATT
pressed the pace, fell back on the second turn, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. PRETTY LOUD was unhurried early, raced outside,
rallied around the turn to challenge for the lead, fell back, leveled off and settled for show. LUVTHEONEURWITH stalked the pace while racing inside,
shifted out for the drive and finished evenly. GURKHA RIFLES was blocked and steadied on the first turn, held a good position and had nothing left for the
drive. HASTA LA VISTA was not a factor. SURFER BLAKE pressed the pace while racing inside, tired into the second turn and was not urged late.
AWEZEE lunged and veered out at the start, trailed the field and showed little.

SQUARED STRAIGHT dueled throughout and proved best. CROOKED FINGER RAY dueled inside throughout and was outfinished in a game effort. THE
METAL MAN stalked the pace, bid three wide on the turn, didn't have enough late and held for show. TIME TO ZOOM raced close to the pace, bid four wide
on the turn and lacked the needed late rally. NEVADAN bumped at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside and lacked a stretch rally.
GOLDENEYED bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. RAOFTHESUN went widest in the drive and outrun. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH
was hustled along inside, had brief speed only and did not threaten.

Footnotes
CRAZY GOOD bid inside on the turn, assumed command and drew off under mild urging. JEWEL OF DENIAL lagged early, closed well inside and earned
place while no match for the winner. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY set the pace to the turn, fell back, faded through the stretch and just lasted for show.
ASEAAWINNER stalked the pace, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. ROCKSIE HARTBRAKER showed speed to the turn, was checked and
stopped. SKY HIGH VERONIKA raced wide and failed to contend. PORTUGUESEPRINCESS raced outside, lacked a stretch response and was not urged
late.
