FAST AND FEVEROUS settled off the early pace, advanced two then three wide on the turn, moved out five deep turning for home and was put to a strong
drive, took over outside the furlong marker, powered clear then was eased up the final seventy yards. BROADWAY ROMANCE settled outside off the pace,
moved with and outside the winner three then four wide on the turn, came out six deep in upper stretch, was second best. NICOLE'S TALES dueled outside,
went three then four wide on the turn, weakened. ZIPPING BOMBASTIC was hard to load, dueled inside a rival but off the rail in the two then three path on
the turn, came up empty. UNDER RAPPES failed to threaten racing mostly two to four wide. RONA CHROME was hard to load, chased behind the dueling
leaders, shifted in entering the turn to save ground on that bend, faded.
