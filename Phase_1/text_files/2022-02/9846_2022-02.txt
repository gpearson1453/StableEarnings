Footnotes
STOTLAND stumbled leaving the gate, pulled and steadied early along the fence, tipped outside the leader on the first turn, bid outside with three furlongs
remaining, kept the pressure on into the stretch and wore down the runner-up in the final sixteenth. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS sped to the front and angled inside,
challenged by rival into the far turn, maintained a short lead into the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly in the end. BALDORO went four then three wide
on the first turn, bumped rival near the half-mile pole, chased three then two wide on the second bend and held the show. KLIMTOGLORY pulled and was
rank in the early going then settled inside, bumped with rival at the three-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally. BROTHERLY LOVE
got bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path then further off the rail, bumped lightly with rival near the half-mile pole, bumped inner rival into the far
turn, went two to three wide into the stretch and could not rally. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW off a bit slow to begin, pulled a bit while trying to be reserved,
went four wide into the first turn then angled to the two path, steadied off heels late on the first turn, went three wide around the second bend and made no
impact. LOOKOUT POINT angled to the rail early, steadied off heels on the first turn, steadied once more into the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
failed to menace. MISSING MAURICE broke in and bumped rival at the start, pulled early then went three wide on the first turn, checked off heels around
the bend, lost path in upper stretch while drifting in and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
KIMMER stalked the top pair up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole
and gamely prevailed. WALL STREET TRADER bumped leaving the gate, dueled outside BESAME MUCHO early then cleared that rival entering the turn,
led two wide through the bend, relinquished the lead at the furlong pole, then fought back gamely to the wire but had to settle for second best. BESAME
MUCHO got bumped on both sides at the start, dueled inside WALL STREET TRADER early, lost touch with that rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased
along the rail into the turn, tipped to the two path around the bend, raced three wide in upper stretch and kept on for a clear third. TAP UNION was coaxed
early on chasing the top pair, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked a late bid. FRISCO GOLD broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, was
crowded between rivals shortly after, chased off the pace, three wide on the turn and never responded to urging. GEBO chased along the inside, started to
climb at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back on the turn, exited the bend two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
EVER SMART stalked the pacesetter on the inside, cut the corner into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and surged clear. VIVANDO was off slow from
inside, tracked along the rail to the stretch, tipped out near the sixteenth pole and got up for second. KHLASS (IRE) came away slow, steadied off heels
early, advanced three wide through the turn and gained third between rivals. M IS FOR MAGIC tracked between foes early, traveled two wide into the turn,
shifted out leaving the bend and came four wide into the stretch and missed the show. LAURA MARS (IRE) broke a step slow then went up to clear the field,
showed the way through the turn and led a bit off the rail into the stretch, continued clear into the furlong grounds but was caught at the sixteenth pole and
flattened late. WHAT A FEELING steadied briefly between rivals past the five-eighths pole, chased between then two wide on the turn and weakened.
CUBAN CRISIS (GB) came away well, stalked the leader in the two path, raced three wide in the lane and weakened. BUY AMERICAN raced in range three
wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and came four wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
CON ON THE RUN stumbled leaving the gate but still came away quickly, set the pace under pressure, cleared CLAMPETT on the turn, then drew away
under right-handed urging and steady handling. CLAMPETT brushed with TOWN BOY leaving the gate, went up to press the pace from outside, lost touch
past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the stretch and stayed on to prove second best. TOWN BOY brushed with CLAMPETT at the start, was
well placed outside the top pair up the backstretch, took the turn four then three wide and lacked the needed bid. KING APOLLO chased well off the rail,
navigated the turn five then four wide, was along for a minor award but failed to threaten. BRIGHT LEAF bobbled a bit at the start, raced between rivals then
six wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and could not rally. STREET ART stalked from outside then angled down to the rail, saved ground to the
stretch and faded. FORT BRIDGER trailed to the turn, went three wide into the bend, came out and entered the lane six wide and was always outrun.

Footnotes
KEYFLOWER (FR) was off a bit slow to begin, stalked in the two path, asked three deep on the far turn, took over past the eighth pole, cleared past the
sixteenth pole and held safely in the end. MORAZ stalked inside then shifted to the two path for the far turn, moved out in the lane, closed well but could not
get to the winner. ROCKING REDHEAD was rated in the two path in the early going, bid outside the leader with three-furlongs to go, dueled around the far
turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and held on for the show. GOLD FOR KITTEN stalked the pace from inside,
exited the far turn a bit off the rail, lacked room behind the top trio in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and finished willingly for a minor award. NEW
HEAT was off slow from outside, angled down to the rail, moved out on the backstretch, was coaxed three wide on the far turn then angled five wide leaving
the bend, summoned a mild rally but never threatened. HOGANS HOLIDAY raced between foes into the first turn, was put in tight quarters at the
three-eighths pole, angled out in the lane and showed a mild response. CORDIALITY set the pace on the inside, dueled around the far turn, lost command
in upper stretch and weakened late. ZEYARAAT traveled along the inside near the back, saved ground on the far turn and lacked any response in the drive.
SASSYSERB traveled three wide around the first turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SCARY FAST SMILE settled off the pace, checked inside a rival past the seven-sixteenths pole, stayed inside and closed in around the turn, shifted out into
the stretch, reached the front at the eighth pole and kicked clear. ATOMIC DROP sped clear from inside, padded the lead on the turn then held a
diminishing lead entering the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and chased the winner to the wire while well clear of the next rival. MIDNIGHT
SPECIAL chased three deep up the backstretch, went four to five wide around the bend, had no late kick and saved the show. SQUALOTORO was off slow
then lost his path at the start, trailed well off the rail to the turn, raced five wide on the bend then angled in at the quarter pole and missed the show.
RECKONING DAY chased between foes early on, went three to four wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane. PYEONG CHANG chased off the rail
then two wide around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SUMTER sped to the front and moved to the rail, set the pace under pressure from BARSABAS, shook free from that rival in upper stretch, drew away past
the eighth pole and held well over the late charge from the runner-up. HANDY DANDY broke well then settled in a stalking position two wide on the first turn,
got blocked behind a rival at the nine-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, drifted in and brushed BARSABAS
near the sixteenth pole and closed well for the place. CROSBY BEACH came in and bumped rival in the beginning, was rank into the first turn, checked
midway around that bend, steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground on the far turn, checked off heels in midstretch, tipped out and got up for third.
DON'T SWEAR DAVE brushed with rival at the start, checked between foes on the first turn, chased four wide into the lane, angled out and missed the
show. BARSABAS pressed the pace from outside to the top of the stretch and flattened in the late stages. ECHOSMITH (IRE) was pulling while rank early
and into the backstretch, saved ground behind the leaders to the stretch and lacked a late bid. RED ROAD broke out and bumped rival at the start, steadied
into the first turn, pulled and was rank into the backstretch, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the lane, improved position in the
stretch, then bled following the race and walked off. DOITFORANDREW (GB) got sandwiched at the start, was rank early and pulled the rider to a forward
position up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and weakened. OPTIGOGO was off slow and broke out, steered down to the inside, angled out
into the stretch, steered out further at the top of the lane and failed to make an impact. EPOCH brushed with inner rival at the start, tracked three then two
wide around the first turn, bid three deep at the half-mile pole, stayed alongside on the far turn, chased the top pair three wide into the lane and gave way.
FAST DRAW MUNNINGS pulled early to the half-mile pole, raced wide through the far turn, took a bad step leaving the bend and was not percevered with.
