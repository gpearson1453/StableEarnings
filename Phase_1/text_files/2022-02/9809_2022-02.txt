OPPS MY BAD sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, drifted out down the home stretch and was kept to the task. LOVE TO LEARN lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MISS INVASIVE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the
final turn and weakened. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO had an awkward start, left far behind, moved up on the outside around the second turn and passed tired
ones. BLAZING CHARM raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. LIL ALLIE DANCER lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn
and was never close. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL broke in, bumped at the start, racing in the back, moved up wide around the turn, made an outside rally and drove clear before the
wire. CAMP HALO raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside, took the lead, couldn't hold off the winner, but held on for second. C C
CROWN'S CHOICE raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid, finished willingly and was outfinished for second. SANDY'S WAGER void of early
speed, gained ground late, but was no factor. OKLAHOMA STAR raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, weakened and lacked a late
kick. RICH DREAMS raced near the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. DO ME A FAVOR bumped at the start, raced near the
back and showed little. MAMAS GONE CRAZY pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. FLASHY SASSY shot to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and stopped.

and was a clear second. JACKIE MOON lacked early speed, came around the turn four wide, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. LA'
HOPPER pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, weakened and was no threat late. HELLO HEARTBREAKER raced within contention, came
around the turn five wide, faded and finished evenly. ETBAUER'S SECRET showed early speed and was finished early. BOUJIE ONE bumped repeatedly
in the early going and was never a threat. FULL OF GLORY bumped repeatedly in the beginning and was never close. COWBOY WAY raced in the middle
of the pack and faded. CROOKED BANKER always raced near the back and showed little.
