Footnotes
SPLICER was four wide on the first turn, advanced around the far turn three wide, bid inside VINTAGE GIRL once straightened away for the drive, and drew
clear late. VINTAGE GIRL raced close up early, took over with a three-wide run midway on the far turn and moved clear, then proved no match for the
winner through the last eighth of a mile while clearly second best. BITTY BABY came away alertly despite taking several strides to find her footing, clipped
heels behind COUNTESSOFLOVELACE and had the rider lose the right iron heading to the first turn, lagged well back up the backstretch, rallied four wide
approaching the stretch and was along for the show. BLAME THE VETS turned in an even effort three wide. MIAMI SOUVENIRS steadied away from the
gate, raced far back for six furlongs, circled five wide into the lane and improved without making an impact. SAY NO MORE was no factor in the second
flight throughout. ENOUGH RAIN was never prominent. MOCLIPS led early before yielding up the backstretch, and had nothing left after six furlongs.
BRAIN TRUST was under a firm hold but tugged his way to the lead outside rivals regardless before going a half-mile, got displaced for command on the
second turn and promptly retreated. COUNTESSOFLOVELACE was finished after a half inside.

NEW YORK STYLE set the pace along the rail, shook clear leaving the quarter pole and drew off while ridden out. WHISKEY SUNRISE pressed the winner
two wide, was no match for that foe in the lane and lasted for the place. WICKED TEMPTATIONS lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn,
angled widest in upper stretch and was along for the show. EMICRACK (CHI) chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. DIMENNA had some
speed inside, was under a drive around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
OMIXOCHITL raced four wide heading into the first turn and tracked three deep up the backstretch, moved up to engage HARD TO CAPTURE for the lead
late on the far turn, took command turning for home, drifted out wider then straightened under right-handed pressure and finished going away. RADIANT
GEM was allowed to settle two wide through the early going, picked up the pace two to three wide around the far turn, hustled up five wide into the upper
stretch, angled in a few paths under pressure and gained second best. OPENTHEGATE rated outside just off the early pace, made a move with three
furlongs left to run, gained closer contention then began to weaken in final stages and lasted for show. PRETTYKEEN settled and saved ground up the
backstretch, shifted three wide approaching top stretch, finished with interest and narrowly missed show. WINNING LAUGH tracked the pace along the
inside through early stages, began to flatten out moving through the far turn then gave way in the lane. HARD TO CAPTURE set the pace up the
backstretch, got collared by the winner late on the far turn and steadily weakened. TOURASTAR stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, ran on two wide
through the far turn then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
ALIZEE waited behind horses on the turn, found a seam in the two-path at the top of the stretch, rallied inside rivals and was up in the final stride. LUCKY
GIRASOL shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, rallied to a short lead outside MS BIG SPRING in deep stretch, but was nipped at the wire. MS BIG
SPRING broke sharply and set the early pace well off the rail, moved to the two-path clear around the turn, shifted back out a bit still in command a furlong
out, then yielded. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT raced forwardly three to four wide early, and lacked a closing bid. VEIL moved out five wide approaching the
stretch, and had no rally. DON'T MAKE ME BEG fanned six wide coming off the turn, and remained outrun. DRINKS ON ME faded inside after a half-mile.
KITTEN'S COVERGIRL gave chase to MS BIG SPRING for a half, and tired.

LENA THE LION settled in range three wide, steadily gained through the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. BLACK
SWAN stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and settled for second best. SOUPSTER saved ground in
midpack, angled three wide in upper stretch, had a clear path between foes, lugged in and steadied near the sixteenth pole, straightened out and had a mild
gain between. I LOVE MAGEL lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and rallied outside to just miss third. BLIND SIGHT raced well back
three wide and rallied belatedly. RAHTID failed to menace while racing four wide. BONNIE'S THE BEST was outrun while racing two wide. PRETTY DEVIL
played no factor while racing two wide. MAMA LONGLEGS sped to the front, set a clear pace inside and wilted in the lane. SANGFROID was outrun inside.

GRAINGER COUNTY was well placed tracking the three way duel into the turn, tipped out wider turning for home, given cue four wide in the upper stretch,
kicked by the embattled duo under right-handed pressure and finished going away. NEW YORK'S FINEST broke on top then dueled between foes through
the turn, battled on gamely outside of FOREST SURVIVOR into the final furlong then got overtaken by the eventual, stayed on and got a nose up for place.
FOREST SURVIVOR dueled inside of a duo around the turn, continued to battle inside of NEW YORK'S FINEST into the final furlong then got overtaken by
the winner and got nipped for place. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM raced four wide in the back although not too far back, tucked inside around the turn, cut the
corner into the stretch run and offered no late bid. LIVING VICARIOUSLY attended the pace in opening stages, dueled three deep around the turn then tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
SOUPER ALL STAR tracked the dueling leaders from afar early, closed in rapidly and took over from outside after six furlongs, dug in when challenged from
outside by CAUSINGAHULLBALOO into the stretch, and prevailed after a long drive. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO stumbled at the start, settled at the back for
a half-mile, rallied to contention four wide approaching the stretch, bid outside SOUPER ALL STAR turning for home, and came up clearly second best.
ISLA BONITA raced two to three wide on the turns, and outfinished STARSHIP NANA for the show spot. STARSHIP NANA raced three to four wide, lodged
a mild bid after six furlongs, then could not keep pace with the top two and was outfinished for third. LADY JAE broke a step slowly, and never factored
inside. CENTSLESS DRAMA dueled outside NURSE JUDY through enervating fractions, and was finished after six furlongs. NURSE JUDY dueled inside
CENTSLESS DRAMA through a sharp pace, stopped on the far turn, bore out into the stretch and was eased up to the finish.

BRAMBLE BERRY set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MUSIC CITY STAR pressed the winner two wide,
reached near even terms near the quarter pole but was no match in the lane while staying on to be a clear second. COREY settled off the early pace,
advanced three wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. WE MISS SUSIE chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. MERSEYSIDE had
her head turned at the start and was off about three lengths behind the field then trailed outside.

Footnotes
ALADO was forwardly placed around the first turn then vied outside of PREFECT up the backstretch, shook free with three furlongs left to run, widened to a
clear advantage through the far turn, came two wide into the lane, stayed sharp under steady urging and finished clear. MEYER raced three wide into the
first turn then rated just off the early pace, headed in pursuit near the quarter pole, dug in three wide between foes a furlong out, split foes and finished
second best. VOLIERO raced four wide heading into the first turn then angled inside to save ground and settled in the back, picked up the pace late on the
final turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and captured show. OUR COUNTRY raced four to five wide heading into the first
turn and settled while rated through early stages, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, sustained a four wide bid into the stretch then ran on evenly
in final stages. RALLY SQUIRREL tracked the top flight up the backstretch, launched a bid midway around the far turn, continued in contention past the
furlong marker then gave way. PREFECT led the way around the first turn, vied inside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides
through the far turn but remained in contention along the inside then faded late. SEIZING THE DREAM saved ground through early stages, was ridden
along three wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. HAIL TO THE CHIEF tracked the top flight while saving ground up the backstretch, flattened
out around the final turn and continued to tire in the drive.
