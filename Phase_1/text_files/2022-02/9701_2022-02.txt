COUNT AGAIN sat off the pace early on in the two path, spun three wide into stretch, rallied alongside the runner-up past the sixteenth pole and drove past.
SUBCONSCIOUS stumbled leaving the gate, angled outside SNIPER KITTEN early, raced forwardly placed in the two path, bid alongside on the far turn,
dueled into the lane, took over then cleared approaching the eighth pole but got run down by the winner in the late stages. READY SOUL stalked in the two
path, coaxed around the far turn, chased within striking distance in the drive but failed to find more in deep stretch. DELAWARE (GB) settled inside, crept
closer up the backstretch, remained along the rail through the far turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to threaten. SNIPER KITTEN broke alertly and
crossed to the inside quickly, showed the way to the far turn, headed by SUBCONSCIOUS approaching the quarter pole, lost command at the top of the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) was off slow from the outside, angled down to the two path, trailed three wide into the
stretch and made no impact.

BIG SWEEP dueled for command along the inside, held a short lead over the challenging trio around the turn, inched clear approaching the eight pole and
held gamely in the final sixteenth. DEL MAR DRAMA was well placed early outside the dueling leaders, bid three deep around the turn, challenged between
foes through the lane and finished willingly to the line. SHARAPOVA hopped at the start to come away last, chased behind the top trio well off the rail, bid
four deep around the turn, fought outside the top pair in the stretch and finished a game third. FOUNDER'S DAY hit the stall door leaving the gate, went up
to duel for the lead outside a rival, vied between foes around the bend, lost touch into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DISCO BALL vied for the lead from inside then dueled up the backstretch, inched cleared around the turn, drifted out through the lane and held over the
runner-up. SHAAZ broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied four deep early then chased outside a rival past the five-eighths pole, chased three deep
around the turn, got floated out by DISCO BALL through the stretch run, steadied in the final sixteenth and continued gamely outside the winner to the wire.
CALIFORNIA STREET dropped back early, raced along the inside into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, put in a mild late bid and gained the show.
TOUCHDOWN BROWN broke in and bumped rival in an awkward beginning, trailed a bit off the rail into the lane, showed late effort and rounded out the
superfecta. MOTOWN MUSIC sat off the pace in the early stages, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend, kept on through the final
furlong but never threatened. SUMO got bumped from outside at the start, went up to vie between runners then dueled from outside past the five-eighths
pole, kept the pressure on to the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact approaching the quarter pole and weakened along the rail. NOBLE REFLECTION got
bumped from outside at the start, vied three deep early then chased past the five-eighths pole, went two wide around the bend and tired. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER ABOARD SHAAZ AGAINST DISCO BALL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH,
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED DISCO BALL FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT SEVERAL PATHS, CAUSING SHAAZ TO STEADY
REPEATEDLY AND COST HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
FORT BRIDGER stumbled at the start, went up to duel for command from inside, held a short lead into the stretch, cleared in upper stretch and held the
runner-up at bay. FORGOTTEN VOWS chased from outside, took the turn four wide, drew alongside the winner and finished gamely to the wire.
AWESOME RHYTHM broke slow and came away last, tracked along the inside and moved closer up the backstretch, brushed rival into the turn, chased the
top pair into the stretch and finished evenly late to hold the show. STATE OF THE UNION raced up close outside the top pair into and around the turn, could
not summon the needed late kick but kept on for a minor award. BESAME MUCHO dueled for the lead from outside to the stretch and weakened in the
furlong grounds. PAULAS CAUSE was hustled from the inside early but dropped back to last early on, saved ground through the turn, improved placings but
made no impact. MR BUG Z was in range early off the inside, went three wide into the turn, moved out and came six wide into the lane and lacked further
response. KING ROB was forced to steady between rivals early, chased two wide leaving the backstretch, got brushed entering the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and weakened. BIG EVENT chased well off the rail up the backstretch, dropped back while four then three wide on the turn and came up empty
in the drive. TAP UNION sat off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ENCROACHMENT was closest in pursuit through the early stages, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside with a furlong left to run, took over at
the sixteenth pole and held the runner-up at bay. GREGORY'S PRIDE traveled three deep around the first turn, advanced up the backstretch, chased three
wide to the lane, bid three deep in the stretch but was denied. CANE CREEK ROAD sped to the front and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, was
challenged by the winner at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead approaching the final sixteenth and held the show. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) raced in
midpack early on, traveled two wide then moved inside, moved closer around the second bend, tipped out in the stretch but could not gain a clear path
through the final furlong. CARMELITA'S MAN traveled between foes off the pace then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, altered from behind a rival
entering the far turn, asked three wide around the bend and summoned a mild rally. NILES CHANNEL settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and
lacked a serious bid. ADARE went three wide around the first turn, steadied at the three-eighths pole, coaxed two wide around the turn and could not rally.
BIG FISH was off slow to begin, trailed on the inside, went two wide into the far turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MERNEITH was off alertly to take control, set the pace along the inside to the lane, felt pressure from CE CE in upper stretch but kicked clear again with a
furlong to go and drew away under urging. CE CE angled out into the clear early, chased three deep on the turn, bid from outside in upper stretch but was
turned away entering the final furlong and had to settle for second best. KALYPSO stalked the leader along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch and
was no match in the final furlong. PARK AVENUE tossed his head at the start and broke a step slow, raced up close outside MERNEITH early, lost a bit of
ground in the two path around the bend, then weakened down the lane. FULL OF GRACE tracked off the rail early, trailed past the five-eighths pole, went
four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO stalked outside a rival, drifted out a bit on the dirt crossing, drew alongside at the three-sixteenths pole, cleared with a furlong remaining
and held well. TIZ PLUS tracked along the inside through the turn, chased within striking distance in the final furlong but lacked the needed late punch.
VANTASTIC raced between foes early then outside a rival, came five wide into the stretch and rallied for the show. COULTHARD (IRE) tracked the lone
leader outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and got edged for the show. GREGDAR raced three deep off the pace
early on then outside a rival on the turn, exited the bend five wide and finished willingly in the furlong grounds. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) broke slow,
lagged behind early, went two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the bend and produced a mild rally to improve position. CREW DRAGON traveled near
the back of the pack down the hill, moved to the inside for the turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not rally. EXULTATION broke a step slow,
traveled in mid-pack on the inside, tipped out into the stretch and lacked a rally. WHOOPING JAY sped clear and crossed to the inside, remained
unchallenged to the stretch, then was collared quickly at the top of the lane, offered no resistance and gave way. EASTERN OCEAN stalked in the two path
around the turn, moved out a bit in the lane and faded.

Footnotes
EXPRESS TRAIN steered out early then rushed up between rivals, applied a bit of pressure in the middle stages, challenged EIGHT RINGS on the far turn,
took over past the five-sixteenths pole, fought with LAW PROFESSOR into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and drew away. LAW PROFESSOR had early
speed four deep into the first turn, moved to the three path and stalked outside the top pair, bid three deep around the far turn, got outkicked by EXPRESS
TRAIN nearing the eighth pole and stayed on to prove second best. EIGHT RINGS hustled from the gate, cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed
the way up the backstretch with EXPRESS TRAIN to the outside, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up into the stretch, weakened
in the lane but was able to hold the show. SPIELBERG was a bit fractious in the gate, raced at the back outside a rival, steered out wide on the backstretch,
angled in entering the far turn, traveled two wide then tipped three wide leaving the bend, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE unhurried in the beginning from inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. AMERICAN THEOREM showed speed between rivals
then got put in tight and had to check entering the clubhouse turn, steadied again past the three-quarter pole, steered well off the rail on the backstretch
then angled down to the three path entering the far turn, came in a bit more and chased two wide into the stretch and tired in the lane.
