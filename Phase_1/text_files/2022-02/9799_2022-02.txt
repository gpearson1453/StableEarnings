Footnotes
SCOTTY BROWN vied in initial stages then cleared on top and showed the way around the turn, spun out two wide and widened advantage into the upper
stretch, came under strong handling when DETERMINED FURY ranged up to threaten outside in late stages, shifted out wider a under left-handed drive
and held firm. DETERMINED FURY was well placed tracking the top two leaders in the early going, angled out and headed in pursuit late on the turn,
ranged up to threaten the winner in late stages, shifted out wider, sustained a solid bid but had to settle for second best. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN was ridden
along racing off the top trio, saved ground then came out leaving the turn, ran on three wide with response through the lane and cleared the rest.
AERONAUT was forwardly placed chasing the early leader, sustained a two wide bid through the turn then came up empty near the furlong marker. THE
WILD FLYER lacked early foot and raced in the back, saved ground through the turn and had no response. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WHERE'S JOEY stalked the pace three wide, seized command in upper stretch and drew off while ridden out. AWESOME PUDDING vied two wide for a
half, resisted inside of the winner past the eighth pole and was clearly second best. PRIDE AND PASSION raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper
stretch and was along for the show. AMERICAN MATTERS pressed the pace from the rail and tired in the drive. PACIFIC LEGEND steadied along inside
for three-eighths, angled out near the quarter pole and never threatened. HIGH YIELD KITTEN chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.
ABHAR was outrun inside.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM vied inside BENEFACTOR early, shook clear after six furlongs, and widened through the stretch under a drive. MR TITO'S stumbled
at the start, advanced four wide coming off the turn, and was up outside HARD BELLE for the place. HARD BELLE pursued the leaders three wide to the
turn, rallied into second after six furlongs, then faded through the lane. BLESSED JOURNEY saved ground early at the back, came five wide into the stretch
and passed tired horses for a share. TOWN CLASSIC was no factor two wide. LUSITANO was ridden along inside through the turn, and did not respond.
BENEFACTOR argued the pace outside FINANCIAL SYSTEM for nearly six furlongs, and had nothing left.

MAGNILOQUENT quickly cleared on top and angled inside, held firm around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch then moved back toward the
inside, hopped over a track in the final furlong and remained clear. DEVILLY raced near midpack and hustled along two wide through the turn, tipped wider
for the drive, stayed on with response and gained second best. JUNO SEA raced in range saving ground, cut the corner entering the upper stretch run,
sustained an inside bid and secured show. R GIRL'S WERTH IT broke out and bumped with rival at the start, chased just off the top pair, gained closer
contention around the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. Z FIRST got bumped at the start, raced off the early pace, shifted out wide in the upper
stretch and improved position. HARD ROCK WARRIOR raced off the early speed, was ridden along the rail through the turn, stayed inside for the drive and
lacked the needed kick for impact. GAM GAM JOANN took a solid bump between foes at the start, raced two to three wide off the early speed and lacked a
needed rally. NIXANEFF was ridden along three to four wide, shifted out wide for the drive and failed to move on. LOVIN MAKES CENTS chased in
contention three to four wide then weakened in the lane. MASKED HEROINE raced five wide off the early pace, was ridden along near the inside around
turn and failed to move on. RUFA RED KNOT angled in closer from the outside while forwardly placed just off the leader, chased up close through the turn
then tired in the drive. ALWAYS A PARTY raced in the back throughout. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER tracked outside SIMPLIFY early, poked a head in front after a half-mile, battled through a long drive and went clear late while drifting out.
SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace inside, responded when hooked by DEM A WONDER approaching the stretch, and fought to deep stretch before yielding.
FREE TO FLY eyed the leaders in the clear around the turn, had aim outside into the stretch, but flattened out. LARIMAR raced two to three wide, and had
no rally. AWESOME ANNMARIE was bothered by PLAYERA at the break and slowest away, moved out through the turn and could not reach contention.
PLAYERA broke inward and was slow into stride, and never menaced. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL was through early inside.

Footnotes
MY PHILLY TWIRL was forwardly placed just off the leader in opening stages, got carried out three wide around the first turn, stalked SURREAL FANTASY
up the backstretch, made a bid near the quarter pole, vied for the lead outside of SOUL OF AN ANGEL near the furlong marker then took command, stayed
on gamely and held firm. LOVE HER LOTS settled nicely while rated just off the early pace, given cue four to five wide entering the lane, sustained a steady
bid under strong left-handed pressure, edged closer and captured place. ON ALERT was allowed to settle in the back although never far from the frontend,
picked up the pace three wide around the far turn, launched a two wide bid into the upper stretch, inched way up closer and narrowly missed place. SOUL
OF AN ANGEL secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the top two leaders up the backstretch, picked up the pace along the rail around the
far turn, came off the inside and took over the lead at the head of the lane, fought back inside eventual winner into the final furlong then weakened in deep
stretch. SURREAL FANTASY sped to the lead at the start, drifted out three to four wide around the first turn, set the pace near the inside up the backstretch,
began to lug out late on the far turn, came under a firm hold to edge back and move out, dropped to last, launched a five wide re-bid but needed more for
impact. KITTEN'S COLLUSION settled three wide not far off the early pace, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, sustained bid into the upper
stretch then weakened. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
KHOSEA was unhurried while racing two wide, swung eight wide near the quarter pole, closed widest, took over near the sixteenth pole, switched back to
the left lead soon after and drew clear. KENTUCKY PRIDE was in range inside, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn, took the lead nearing
the quarter pole, quickly cleared, led to the sixteenth pole and held the place. EMMA AND I raced off the pace five wide around the first turn, edged closer
four wide around the far turn, bid in midstretch but was outkicked. CACTUS KITTEN hesitated at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled five wide
nearing the lane and rallied between foes in the lane. KAY'S PROJECT chased the pace four and five wide and lacked the needed rally. ENGLISH
CHARMER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. EAGLE EYE was off a bit slow, advanced between foes nearing the first turn, appeared to clip
heels early on that bend, rushed up between foes, took the lead early on the backstretch, had the saddle slip forward, led two wide from there to the quarter
pole and tired in the lane. LA RUSIA set the early pace along the rail, vied inside down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and came up
empty in the lane. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was outrun inside. BELLE'S KINGDOM pressed the early pace two wide, rated back early on the backstretch,
tracked three wide, re-bid between foes midway around the far turn but retreated through the lane.
