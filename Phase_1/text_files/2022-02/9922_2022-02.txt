Footnotes
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rounded the opening turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took over
three wide midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to draw off. BOCA BIRDIE rated close to the early pace off the rail, closed to a slim lead nearing
the three eighths pole, was caught between horses midway on the far turn then dueled for a clear second. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG rounded the first turn
about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then
flattened the final furlong. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW rated close inside, bid between horses approaching the three eighths pole, gave close chase from that
point and ran at the rail on the far turn but weakened into the stretch. BUFF N saved early ground, bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
in the four and five paths, though showed little more. CITY PRINCESS took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the
pace but was headed nearing the three eighths pole and faded toward the far turn. CHOPRA mostly saved ground.

NOT FOR GOLD accelerated to take over at the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear
of Meet Ms Bobbi Rae past the eighth pole, was steadily encouraged through the lane and just lasted. MISS MORGANTOWN gave chase, rounded the turn
in the three path, dueled through the stretch to take second the final strides and was gaining on the winner. Q'S SONG gave chase, steadied in tight near
the rail approaching the quarter pole, came through the turn in the three path, was outfinished for second but got up for third the final strides. MEET MS
BOBBI RAE engaged in close chase and loomed a solid factor two deep on the turn and through late stretch before flattening stride. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE
gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. CALLING INDIA set the pace the opening furlong, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the turn. IAMTHEBESTTOO gave chase and mostly saved ground. HOLLYWOOD
BROWN gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn and never factored. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Miss
Morgantown, lodged by the rider of Q's Song. This race was hand timed.

the three path of the far turn. ROOKIE SALSA settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE SONDE entered the first turn five wide and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
improved in the three path of the far turn, took the lead three wide into the stretch, dueled clear and held on well. MASTER THIS exchanged contact with
River Warrior Rvf leaving the gate then saved ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, angled to the five
path leaving the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. BRIGHT DAWN settled back off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn widest and was outfinished for second.
JAXJAXXORJACKS rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole but gave up the nod at the five sixteenths, contested near
even terms near the rail on the far turn then weakened passing the eighth pole. RIVER WARRIOR RVF exchanged contact with Master This leaving the
gate then stalked in the two and three paths, challenged near the three eighths pole and had a slim lead at the five sixteenths, dueled to even terms two
deep most of the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. STRONG LIL KOKORO rounded the opening turn four wide and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. WARRIOR'S ESTATE steadied off the heels of
Jaxjaxxorjacks at the rail into the first turn and rated close through the turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened nearing the far
turn.

Footnotes
TALKTHETALK broke a bit awkwardly then steadied and settled off the pace in the three and four paths, rallied to the front approaching the three eighths
pole, dueled clear of Courageous Grace midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted. JUST A BIT SASSY rounded
the first turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five
path, drifted wider leaving the turn but dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner. EARNED THE SHOT settled back off the
rail on the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail into the far turn, angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane and
finished well. BIG MAMBA rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, had range
on the leaders in the four path of the far turn, but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. COURAGEOUS GRACE was bumped outward and into Hardscratch
leaving the gate then jostled a stride later, rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
challenged at the five sixteenths and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, then weakened leaving the turn. WILD CAPPUCINO raced
off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five and six paths of the far turn.
LADY KAZA took a slim lead at the rail past the three quarter pole, was met into the first turn, gave up the lead toward the three eighths pole and faded
through the backstretch. DINNER AT FIVE broke out to make contact with Courageous Grace then rated close off the rail, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, though weakened at the rail into the far turn. NANCYSAIDSO stalked the earlier pace two deep and raced at even terms into the first turn, was
caught past the three eighths pole and faded through the backstretch. HARDSCRATCH was bumped and jostled at the break and never factored.
