Footnotes
GYPSY'S SOULMATE vied along the inside around the first turn, allowed his outer counterpart to go on entering the backstretch, stalked outside of that rival
thereafter, bid into the far turn, vied between horses while in the three path turning for home, then drew off entering the lane. WISH UPON A STAR broke
inwardly, raced far back along the inside, moved up to midpack down the backstretch, tracked two wide around the far turn, split rivals three wide
approaching the furlong grounds to bid for place, but bumped an outer BOURBON ST TAPPIN in the process, lugged out and bumped that rival again a
sixteenth later, then edged away for place. BOURBON ST TAPPIN broke a step slowly and mildly checked to avoid trouble from an outer rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three path, gained down the backstitch to bid three wide turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner entering
the lane, then took a bump from an inner foe approaching the furlong grounds, battled on for place thereafter, but was bumped again by that rival a sixteenth
out, and settled for show. NOW NOW MAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, stalked the leading pair from the three path, tucked to the rail
down the backstretch while being relegated to midpack, tracked along the inside around the far turn, bid for place inside of rivals approaching the final
furlong, but was outkicked by outer foes and flattened out. COHERE bumped an inner rival soon after the start while put to a bit of tight quarters, took the
two path route while off of the pace, and failed to factor. THE THREE KS took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start vied two wide early on before
clearing into the backstretch, then showed the way from a pair of outer bidding rivals around the far turn, but weakened between horses passing the
three-sixteenths pole. BITSY'S OTHER HALF was pinched back and shuffled back between horses soon after the start, then never got involved, and was
eased through the lane. FORT BONZ broke inwardly, tracked in the four path, but was done early, and eased turning for home. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REVIEWING THE ACTIONS OF WISH UPON A STAR AND BOURBON ST TAPPIN IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN WISH UPON A STAR BEING
DISQUALIFED AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
TUGBOAT was slow into stride, saved ground far off of the pace, rallied inside of rivals entering the lane, claimed place at the furlong grounds before tipping
out passing that marker to take aim outside of the clear and drifting leader, then drove past that foe in the final sixteenth, and cleared. ZUMRA BAYOU sped
clear, maintained a clear advantage while drifting outwardly in midstretch, but was worn down by an outer rallying rival in the final sixteenth. STOP SHOP N
DROP raced in midpack along the inside, took back from tight quarters at the half mile pole, tracked along the rail around the turn, bid for place inside of
JANISTHEBEAUTY at the quarter pole, squarely bumped that rival soon after before pushing her way to the three path, but was outkicked by an inner foe at
the furlong grounds for place, vied inside of a pair of foes for show thereafter, then was bumped by the previously mentioned foe at the sixteenth pole, but
secure show. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA tracked in the four path around the turn, bid for show outside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, but shifted
inwardly approaching the final sixteenth, herded JANISTHEBEAUTY into STOP SHOP N DROP at that marker, then took a brush in the aftermath, and
secured fourth. JANISTHEBEAUTY stalked in the three path around the turn, took a bump from an inner STOP SHOP N DROP passing the quarter pole
before being pushed a bit outwardly soon after, vied for show between horses after being outkicked by an inner foe in midstretch, but was herded inwardly
by an outer rival approaching the final sixteenth causing her to bump an inner foe at that marker, then brushed her outer counterpart in the aftermath before
being outfinished by those foes. LA FEME JOLIE trailed around the turn, then passed tired rivals. CONSERVATVE VALUES failed to factor. MY GAL
CHARLOTTE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, but was shuffled back behind a tiring MEMPHIS MELTOWN turning for home. MEMPHIS
MELTDOWN chased in the two to three path into the turn, then weakened between horses turning for home. CUSTOM GUITAR broke sharply, but was
outsprinted early, raced off of the pace in the five path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, then tired and was eased through the final furlong. THE
TRAINER OF JANISTHEBEAUTY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF STOP SHOP N DROP AND CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG; CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.

GRAND DESIGN cleared around the first turn, opened up a wide lead down the backstretch, and added to his margin while being driven home through the
final furlong. DA GOLD ROOM settled far back two wide, tracked from midpack along the inside around the far turn, bid for place inside of a pair of foes
passing the quarter pole, gained that position at the three sixteenths marker, and held it to the wire. MR. QUALITY stalked two wide, then from the three
path around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner bidder for place in upper stretch, kept on thereafter, but failed to reach that rival for place. TIO BLAS
stalked along the inside, then from a path off of the rail while inside of a rival around the far turn, but tired between horses approaching the final furlong.
CHARMING BULLET raced at the rear along the inside, steadied behind an injured rival passing the half mile pole, then improved around the far turn.
THUNDER AHEAD tracked four wide, but weakened into the far turn. THE BIG IRISHMAN was never involved. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY was hung out in the six
path while off of the pace around the first turn, then began to tire after a half mile before steadying behind an injured rival inside the half mile pole. WHITE
MIST tracked in the two path, but sustained an injury at the half mile pole, lost his rider soon after, then was vanned off. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY SHOWN

Footnotes
MALIBU MARIE broke a step slowly, tracked two wide, improved to stalk down the backstretch, bid into the far turn as an outer NANA'S GREY ranged up
alongside, led approaching the five sixteenths pole after the pace-setter stopped, then cut the corner entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, and held
from an outer rallying rival late. DALLAS VOLUNTEER laid close up along the inside into the first turn, but was keen around that bend, retreated to midpack
entering the backstretch, shifted two wide approaching the half mile pole, tracked around the far turn, claimed place from outer rivals at the furlong grounds,
tipped outside of the clear leader soon after, and rallied to produce a late bid, but was fended off. LADY CLARE rated at the rear along the inside, gained
four wide around the far turn to bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, then flattened out while getting
outkicked by an inner foe for place at the furlong grounds. NANA'S GRAY tracked three wide, pressed around the far turn, then from between horses turning
for home, but tired in upper stretch. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN vied in the two path into the first turn, stalked an outer clearing rival from the inside entering
the backstretch, but faltered entering the far turn. LOLA FLO prompted three wide into the first turn, cleared approaching the backstretch, but weakened
inside of rivals approaching the five sixteenths pole, then was eased through the lane while lugging out.

DROP DEAD SEXY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, dueled inside of that foe thereafter, sustained the long duel through the lane, and narrowly
prevailed. BELEOUT bounced between horses at the start, sparred outside of DROP DEAD SEXY thereafter, sustained a long duel through the lane, but
just missed. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN stalked the dueling pair from the three path, but failed to gain on them late, and was best of the rest.
GRACELEADSUSHOME raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then failed to threaten through the lane. A G'S CHARLOTTE raced at the
rear two wide, and failed to factor. IRONIT bumped with an inner foe at the start, then chased the dueling leaders from the inside, but weakened on her left
lead through the lane. LOVE RAN RED was outrun.

Footnotes
BOMBDIGGITY set the pace inside of a pressing RIDE THE PLAN, but responded when shaken up in upper stretch, drew off readily, and pulled further
away under wraps through the closing stages. RIDE THE PLAN pressed the leader from the outside, inched closer turning for home, but quickly proved no
match while failing to keep pace passing the quarter pole, but safely maintained place through the final furlong. UNBRIDLED D'ORO chased along the
inside, bid for show inside of rivals at the quarter pole, gained that position at the three sixteenths marker, and held it to the wire. VEGAS BLUE broke
slowly, laid off of the pace, gained three wide into the turn, then four wide turning for home, but leveled off in the five path in upper stretch. DIAL IT UP A
NOTCH tracked three wide, but tired between horses at the furlong grounds. JOAN'S WAY brushed the gate, raced at the rear four wide into the turn,
swung to the six path entering the lane, but made little impact. FINE COTTON tracked two wide early on, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SMOOTH stalked two wide while close up among foes into the first turn, but took back to midpack entering the backstretch, came under all out
urging into the far turn, chased the leading pair around that bend, tipped outside of them entering the lane, then sustained his charge via a long drive to
surge past the tiring leader entering the final sixteenth, and cleared. FLYING FRED laid off of the pace in the two path, followed MR. J MCKAY's early move
approaching the five furlong pole to gain a stalking position, ranged up to that foe to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with
that rival at the quarter pole, got outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, then kept on to regain place on the wire. MR. J. MCKAY stalked along the inside,
around the first turn, moved decisively between horses leaving the three quarter pole to gain an advantage approaching the five furlong pole, showed the
way from a pressing rival around the far turn, shook clear of that foe at the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, was
surpassed a sixteenth from home, and then got nailed on the wire for place. UNORTHODOX trailed along the inside around the first turn, gained five wide
around the far turn, then stayed on to secure a minor share. DOVER STRAIT tracked three wide, but was shuffled back behind a pair of tiring rivals around
the far turn, altered to the five path and outside of foes entering the lane, then stayed on without threatening the leaders. XTREME V. I. P. hopped at the
start while breaking a beat slowly, stayed in the five path while far off of the pace around the first turn, tucked down the backstretch, saved ground and
improved inside of rivals around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. TENOR pressed four wide early on, stalked down the backstretch, but
weakened at the three furlong pole. CRAZY GENIUS prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses around the far turn. GOLD BEAR
dictated terms inside of foes around the first urn, but was headed at the three quarter pole, wilted approaching the half mile marker, then was pulled up
entering the lane, and walked off.

Footnotes
BERNABREEZY settled far back in the two path, tracked around the far turn before swinging six wide entering the lane to circle the leaders, rallied to bid at
the furlong grounds, and drove clear. MARIAH'S FORTUNE dueled for the lead inside of HAZY COMMAND, shook clear passing the quarter pole, but was
confronted by BERNABREEZY at the furlong grounds, failed to match strides with that rival soon after, and was second best. SEQUIST laid off of the pace
along the inside, crept closer to stalk turning for home, smoothly tipped outside of the leader entering the lane, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, got
outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and chased the top pair home. WATERWORKS tracked from the three to two path, ranged up outside of the
leading pair while inside of another rival turning for home, but flattened out four wide in upper stretch. BIRD EMPRESS stalked in the two to three path,
ranged up outside of foes turning for home, but weakened between horses five wide in upper stretch. MISS CHAMITA trailed along the inside and never got
involve. HAZY COMMAND sparred for the lead three to two wide, dueled into the far turn, but weakened between horses after drifting three wide entering
the lane.
