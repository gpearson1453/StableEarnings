Footnotes
INTELLIGENCEREPORT five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the turn into
contention swinging three then two wide into upper stretch, seized command with three-sixteenths to go, shied out under a sole left handed crop while
drawing clear to the finish and was geared down near the wire. HALF BIRTHDAY established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside,
came under some pressure through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, got collared at the
three-sixteenths, kept on to chase the winner home preserving the place honors at the finish. DARE TO BE GREAT crossed to the two path shortly after the
start and gave chase from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was along for
the show honors offering up a mild bid to be best of the rest. CRISPY GAL forwardly placed three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. ROCK LOBSTER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, swung
four wide for home and never got involved. KOKUTAI hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went six wide
into upper stretch and tired. LONDON PEARL chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CORKMAN bumped with a foe at the start then dropped back, moved out at the rear then settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn then
gained under urging, took the lead into upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead to outside the furlong marker,
swapped to the proper lead when switched to a left-handed crop at that point and drew away under steady urging to prove much the best. JERUSALEM
GATES was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, gained under urging passing the half-mile pole, took the lead while dropping from the five path to
the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, lost the lead under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. MR. FIDGET was urged along towards the back, moved from three to six wide on the turn,
remained on his inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. FAR AWAY LOOK hit the outside of the gate at the
start, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and came up empty. COACH BAHE
bumped with a rival at the start, bumped repeatedly with YANKEE EMPIRE early, pressed the pace between horses, vied in the two path under urging on
the turn and tired. YANKEE EMPIRE broke out at the start, bumped repeatedly with COACH BAHE early, pressed the pace on the inside while tight against
the rail, dropped back while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn and capitulated. FOTIS set the pace under pressure, lost the lead with a
half-mile to run, came up empty on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
JULIANA'S ROSE bumped at the start by STEPPIN' HAWK due to pressure from TALENTI breaking outwards, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, advanced to take over command swinging four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. OUR JESSICA four then three
wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths nudging SALUKI to the rail, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to be along safely for the place honors. DUCKPHAT six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, went three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, tipped out five wide for home and improved position to be along clear
for the show honors. STEPPIN' HAWK got bumped at the start by TALENTI and in turn bumped JULIANA'S ROSE, raced three wide in closest aim of the
leader, advanced on that rival getting put to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch loosely between foes, then weakened in
the final furlong. SALUKI chased just off the inside until nudged inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and tipped out
four wide into upper stretch, then offered no response. TALENTI broke out at the start under coaxing and bumped STEPPIN' HAWK into JULIANA'S ROSE,
showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under challenge midway on the turn and was placed to coaxing in response, was under threat near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding the front straightened away, then tired to the finish. LUCKY GIRL chased along the inside
coming under urging with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MOSIENKO brushed with a rival just after the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole,
rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging to prove much the best.
VIOLENTIAM settled on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. MAZAL EIGHTEEN was well placed just off the pace, was
asked in the two path on the turn then driven three wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths but also proved no match for the winner then just
missed the place while clear for the show. TOWERING ORBIT set the pace under pressure, lost the lead outside the three-eighths, dropped back into upper
stretch and tired. CANDY MONET broke very awkwardly and was off a step slow, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
BLAME IT ON MARY pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two path outside the three-eighths, was asked for her best in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. SNICKET stumbled severely at the start and unseated the rider.

REGAL QUALITY settled on the outside, was roused in the five path on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the
furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. DADDY KNOWS disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent,
was asked in the three path on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, fought on with the winner in the final furlong but was outfinished while clear
for the place. MICROSCOPE was last to commence, settled at the rear, shifted from the rail to the three path on the turn, moved out just inside the furlong
marker, came between horses late and got up for the show. KUMAR was lightly rated off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on
the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. FAST BREAK disputed the pace on the outside, was
asked in the four path on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. AMERICAN RULE angled in towards
the rear early, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE MAN shied crossing a shadow on the track early, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe under urging, vied along the rail on the turn, shook
clear under a drive into the final furlong and extended the advantage under strong urging to prove much the best. EMINENCY settled on the outside, was
asked four wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. STATE PLANNING was urged along towards the
back, moved in inside the five-eighths, started the turn in the two path, shifted four then five wide later on the bend, drifted inward in upper stretch and
improved for the show. BEACH BOY AL pressed the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. BARREL OF QUESTS settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused outside the
five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch then drifted inward around the three-sixteenths and came up empty. DEVIOUS BANKER broke in at the
start, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn, dropped back late on the bend and capitulated. INFEASIBLE broke in
at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. HE'S GOT IT was urged along off the pace, moved out
around the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TIMMY ME BOY was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, raced well back while urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole and had
nothing left. DEVIL'S EDGE raced well back in the field, went around the turn in the two path and showed little then was eased in the final furlong but walked
off after crossing the finish.
