Footnotes
BOURBON BAY showed good speed, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, re-engaged the pacesetter in the three path on the turn, surged to the
front just inside the five-sixteenths then shook clear, drew away under one tap of a down-turned crop in upper stretch and proved much the best under a
moderate hand ride to win ridden out. BLAKE B. was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came under a drive into upper stretch and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MANDATORY PAYOUT was sent hard from the start, moved up to set the pace under pressure to
his outside, went clear with five furlongs to run, was challenged again while in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner just inside the
five-sixteenths and tired while able to get the show. BINGO JOHN came outward at the start while hustled, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on
the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. THE BIG GREY broke a step slow, angled in at the rear with six furlongs to run, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and was no factor. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY settled towards the rear under some urging, passed the
half-mile pole under stronger encouragement, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

DIRECT ORDER five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive inside the
eighth pole, the rider sneaking a peek back just prior to taking command a sixteenth from home, then edged away in hand under his own power to the finish.
ITS ALL RELEVANT coaxed from the gate to the front, showed the way in hand just off the inside and spurted away to a widening lead getting very lightly
coaxed along through the turn through swift splits, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under growing threat to the outside
while beginning to grow leg weary and was caught a sixteenth from home, then held clear for the place honors. BINKSTER chased four to five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and stayed on one paced to the finish. AMERICAN LINCOLN chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, offered up a mild bid. MUSICAL AMERICA coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under a ride
from midway on the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. THREETHEHARDWAY four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BIG MOUNTAIN
coaxed from the start, raced along the inside briefly before tipping out three wide while in closest aim of the leader, got shaken off nearing the turn and
tucked inside with half a mile to run, retreated coaxed along through the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
KEPT WAITING bumped solidly with a foe at the start and was last to commence, established a good position just behind the wall of leaders, stalked in the
two path on the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear, drew away under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased
up late while much the best. FIGHT ON LUCY leaned out at the start and brushed the gate then bumped lightly with an opponent, was urged along at the
rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out just inside the furlong marker and finished with
late energy to garner the place. RUVIES IN TIME pressed the pace down the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn and tired while clear for the
show. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING settled just off the pace, was roused while dropping from the five path to the three path on the turn and came up empty. MY
ROXY GIRL bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased the pace between horses, made a bid with a half-mile to run, dropped back in the five path on
the turn and came up empty. BASTET bobbled at the start then bumped solidly with a foe, was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her
outside, shook clear in the three path midway through the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and capitulated. VIOLENT VIXEN chased
the pace on the outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, dropped back in the six path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ROSSA VELOCE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the rail near the
eighth pole and gained clearance when BEAUTIFUL KAREN floated out at that station under a left handed crop, rallied up the inside to take command a
sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish. BEAUTIFUL KAREN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside down the
backstretch, floated to the two path midway on the turn placed to coaxing and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and came
under a left handed crop a furlong out drifting out slightly while under challenge to the inside, got collared at the sixteenth marker and ran on to preserve the
place honors. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY broke in awkward and was taken in hand at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two
to three wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HAPPY SOPHIA
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BUSTIN BAY
coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response.
GRUDGE hustled from the gate, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide for
home and weakened in the final furlong. WASP chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. PRAIRIE FIRE saved ground in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and made no impact. ELECTRIC YOUTH coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside near the rear of the field briefly before losing her action
nearing the five furlong marker, got placed to a protective hold and was guided outside and eased up before being pulled up near the half mile pole and was
subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN HOTTIE settled on the outside, was urged along while moving from the four to six wide on the turn, jostled with a foe outside the quarter-pole,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, closed well on the tiring pacesetter into the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides to narrowly prevail on the
wire. CHAMPAGNE POETRY settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was asked while inside early on the turn, shifted three wide around
the five-sixteenths, pursued the leader while still on her inside lead to just before the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point, gained on the
tiring pacesetter into the final sixteenth, took the lead about seventy yards from the wire but was denied while clear for the place. LADY MILAGRO went to
the front, showed the way on a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked for her best in upper stretch, extended the advantage into
the final furlong, led while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while clear for the show. LANDSLID bumped with a rival early, was
urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MISS INTERPRET
brushed with an opponent at the start, bumped with another rival early, was urged along at the rear, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide near
the three-eighths then dropped back to the inside and was no factor. KNOWING GLANCE was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the
turn, bumped with foes on both sides outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left. JET FORCE broke a touch awkwardly then brushed with a foe, tracked
the pace down the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the turn, bumped with KNOWING GLANCE outside the quarter-pole then was taken up and
capitulated.
