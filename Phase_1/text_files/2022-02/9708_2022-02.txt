Footnotes
BIG CITY BANE stalked the pace while outside of rivals to the second turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the second turn, was put to firm urging in
mid-stretch and made a late push to prevail. HULA KING disputed the early pace with MONSTRODAMOUS, then was given rein to take the solo lead into
the second turn with that rival in close pursuit, maintained a narrow advantage into the stretch run, was caught inside of the sixteenth marker but kept on to
secure second. SOUTHEAST ASIA stalked the pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, was boxed in on the second turn approaching the
quarter-marker, continued to find traffic in upper stretch, found room in the final stages and closed in the end to claim the show. CURRY NATION was
content to settle while saving ground to the second turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and made a good rally in the late stages to just miss for third.
MONSTRODAMOUS was away well and prompted the pace under a snug hold to the half-mile marker, saved ground through the second turn and was
outkicked in the stretch, just missing for the show. CLARENCE HEADS was away a bit slowly and settled off of the pace while outside of rivals, was four
wide on the second turn and did not mount a late rally in the drive.

Footnotes
MR BOTANICALS stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide bid leaving the second turn to collar the top pair and drew clear in the end.
LOVE OF THE SPORT tracked the pace through the second turn from a two wide path, could not match strides with the winner leaving the second turn and
was outkicked in the drive while holding for second. SENOR DEL CAMPO settled off of the pace through the half-mile marker, slipped to the inside along
the second turn, crowded DREW BIG in the final sixteenth and was nipped on the wire for second, while well clear of the rest. DREW BIG was away in good
order and set the fractions while being prompted to the second turn, was collared by the winner leaving bend, was tiring when forced to take up in the final
sixteenth and gave way in the late going. SPOONLEY was rank along the first turn, pulled on the rider into the backstretch run, was four wide along the
second turn and gave out in the late stages. U S TALE saved ground while stalking the early pace, lost contact along the backstretch run and lacked a late
response.

UNTHROTTLED stumbled at the start, was away quickly and set moderately fast fractions while being prompted, extended the lead along the second turn,
had the lead cut into in the final sixteenth but was urged along to hold for the win. GEE GEE WHIZ was pinched at the start, was allowed to settle through
the run to the half-mile marker, saved ground along the far turn and closed well in the late stages to secure the place. KNOWN settled in the early going,
was steered four wide along the second turn and made a good outside rally in the stretch to claim third. KALINE sat just off of the pace while maintaining a
two wide path, gained ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the late stages, while just missing for the minor awards. HAMMERING LEMON
attended to the moderately quick pace from a three wide path, came under a ride nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the drive. RULER OF
ANGELS settled off of the pace while outside of foes and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
SUNRISE JOURNEY was away alertly and showed good early speed while setting quick fractions, was kept to task through the lane and edged clear in the
end. COLORMEMONEY tracked the quick pace from a two wide path, was outkicked by the winner in the stretch and just held for second over an oncoming
rival. FOSTER BOI stalked the pace while two wide between foes, was in tight quarters midway through the turn and closed well in the late stages, just
missing for second. SUNSET DRAGUNN saved ground while chasing the pace and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. LYMEBYRD chased the pace
outside of rivals, mounted a four wide bid approaching the quarter-marker but flattened out in that effort in the drive and weakened in the final furlong.
PRINCE DE PRINCE chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn and tired in the drive.

RAMONCITA LIGHT was away alertly and was sent to set the pace through the turn, had the lead cut into in the final furlong but was firmly urged along and
held to prevail in the end. SEGURO tracked the leader from a two wide path along the turn, steadily closed in the stretch but could not reel in the winner
while besting the rest. ALL MY HOPE was a bit slow in the early going, chased the pace outside of rivals through the turn, came under a ride nearing the
quarter-marker and offered a mild late rally. GEE STREET saved ground while chasing the pace through the turn and weakened in the late stages.

LET'S REJOYCE was away alertly and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead leaving the bend and drew
clear in the end. TORPEDO AWAY chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn and closed well in the stretch to claim the place. HONEYMOONZ OVER
tracked the quick fractions from a two wide path on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run and was edged out for second. RINSE AND REPEAT saved
ground while chasing the pace to the turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. BEAR CHUM (AUS) was forwardly placed while stalking the pace
from a three wide path on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. COPPER HALO was a bit slow in the early going, was
steered five wide along the turn while chasing from the rear and was not a factor.

BETTOR TRIP NICK was away alertly and sped to the front while carving out fast fractions, maintained a clear lead through the turn and drew away in the
end. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD saved ground while stalking the pace through the turn and closed well in the stretch to get up in time for second. CLEM
LABINE sat off of the pace while two wide on the turn, angled out for the drive and rallied in the stretch to win the nod for third. WAR GAMES lunged at the
start, pulled on the rider a bit on the run into the first turn while tracking the pace, kept a two wide path while close up into the stretch run and was outkicked
in the late stages, just missing for third. HEY MATE chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn, improved position into the stretch run and gave way
in the late going. ITALIANO chased the pace outside of foes along the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA lunged and broke in at the start, recovered nicely to speed to the front and set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead
off of the turn and was ridden out in the end. POWER SURGE chased the pace from the rear while saving ground, maintained a rail trip into the drive and
closed in the late stages to be best of the rest. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL bumped I AM YOURS at the break, tracked the pace from the midflight while two
wide and passed tiring rivals in the stretch to claim third. LOVELY COLLEEN prompted the quick early fractions through the turn and gave way in the late
going. DRESS REHEARSAL chased the pace outside of foes to the turn and tired in the stretch. I AM YOURS was bumped by TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL at
the break and was away slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and did not offer a late rally. SHES BOUT A MOVER chased the pace from a three wide path
to the turn and faded in the late stages. PER RULING # 3 FROM THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD, SHES BOUT A MOVER WAS
DISQUALIFIED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.
