Footnotes
SUPER LUCY never far back, rally four wide on wrong lead into the stretch, switched back and cleared in the final furlong. GOOD ALTERNATIVE raced
outside all the way, rallied on for place spot in the stretch. THROMBOCYTOPENIA no speed to turn, ran on widest for the show spot in the stretch. MAGIC
LEMONS quick start outside, settled to turn, rallied wide missing show. SWEET GINGER sharp to the front, stayed to stretch, weakened in final furlong.
EUROPA unhurried from inside, never reached contention. AMAZING DANCER chased leader to the turn, gave way readily, weakened in stretch.
CROWELLA well off rail while never close. EVIE inside to turn, backed up in the stretch run. MINNIEMOREPROMISES never menaced. JUST FINE BY ME
never a factor. COMPRESSED ENERGY between horses to turn close up, stopped in the stretch. Internal fraction was unavailable due to timer malfunction.
