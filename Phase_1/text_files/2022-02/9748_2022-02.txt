Footnotes
WENDY WILECAT broke a step slowly, tracked from off of the pace into the turn, gained four wide and outside of foes turning for home before drifting to the
five path entering the lane, then rallied to wear down the clear leader in the final sixteenth, and drove clear. BOTH OURS set the pace along the inside,
shook clear of pressing rivals approaching the lane, then held sway through midstretch, but was bested by an outer rallying rival in the final sixteenth.
SAYANOTHERPRAYER broke outwardly at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader entering the lane to take aim in upper stretch, but
hung on his left lead, and failed to progress thereafter. LAWSUIT LUCY tracked two wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe at the five sixteenths pole,
came into the lane in the four path, and stayed on mildly for a minor share. MON DANSEUR bumped an outer foe at the start requiring the rider to take hold,
raced far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up without threatening. GERRIE LOU broke a
step slowly, and failed to factor. JIG TIME BANDIT took a bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. JULIA'S
CHANCE was outrun. CARLOS LOVES TEE pressed the pace two wide into the turn, but weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF WILL tracked in midpack in the two path around the first turn, shifted outside of rivals down the backstretch, inched closer four to five wide
around the far turn to bid in the six path in upper stretch, assumed command leaving the three sixteenths pole, then drew off in midstretch, and widened
under wraps through the late stages. MO CREDO settled far off of the pace along the inside, then in the three to four path around the far turn before
swinging to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach place late. FLASHBACK WIND trailed in the two
path, improved inside of rivals before chasing along the inside around the far turn, gained show from outer foes at the furlong grounds, then caught a tiring
rival for place while getting outfinished by another foe late. BOLD DANCER bobbled a bit at the start, vied two wide before clearing at the half mile pole,
showed the way along the inside around the far turn, but offered little resistance to an outer bidder in upper stretch, held place to the sixteenth pole, but
faltered late. ALL MIKE NO MAE bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, chased two to three wide around the far turn, but drifted out
through upper stretch while fading, then shifted back in and bumped RONALDS GATSBY again at the furlong grounds. RONALDS GATSBY bumped with
an inner foe at the start, vied along the inside early on, allowed an outer rival to clear at the half mile pole, stalked before tipping two wide approaching the
lane, but faded in upper stretch before being bumped by an outer rival at the furlong grounds. OLE STUD MUFFIN stalked two to three wide, but weakened
four wide and between horses around the far turn. BLAZE OF GRAY got rank and bumped an outer rival while off of the pace in the three path around the
first turn, and made little impact. JUDGMENTAL took a bump from an inner foe while in the four path and off of the pace around the first turn, then never got
involved.

Footnotes
WORLD WAR bumped with n inner foe early on, set the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, dictated terms with a clear advantage down the
backstretch, then drew off while drifting outwardly through the lane. HERE COMES LOVIE bounced around between horses in the opening furlong before
achieving an inside stalking position into the first turn, then chased the outer leader from the rail through the lane while maintaining place. MY NANNY'S A
HOOT lunged inwardly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path turning for home, then to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied
to claim show from an outer rival entering the final sixteenth. AKIANE'S SOLDIER stalked three wide, pressed from the three path around the far turn, but
failed to keep pace with the leader while shifting ground outwardly in upper stretch, and lost show at the sixteenth pole. CHARGED TEMP saved ground far
off of the pace, swung to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. MIZZEN MONARCH tracked four wide, but tired through the lane. AVERI EVER
AFTER was outrun. SPIDER LEGS bumped with an outer foe early on, stalked two wide and from between horses while a bit keen around the first turn,
backed out before chasing from midpack around the far turn, then faded through the lane.

LONG AND STRONG set a clear pace around the turn, inched further away entering the lane, shifted ground outwardly in midstretch, and held sway from
chasers on both sides. SCARY LARRY stalked along the inside, chased the outer leader from the rail while dueling for place with ONCOMING TRAIN
through the final furlong, and prevailed. ONCOMING TRAIN pressed the clear leader from the three path and under light urging around the turn, shifted
ground outwardly in midstretch to counter that foe's drift, sustained his chase while battling for place many paths away from SCARRY LARRY, but missed
that position. MIDNIGHT SHIFT tracked three wide, shifted course outwardly in upper stretch, then dove back inside of a drifting ONCOMING TRAIN
approaching the final sixteenth, but lacked a bid. STORMING LION was outrun.

Footnotes
SWANAGE set the pace while staying a path off of the inner railing, shifted to the four path entering the lane, drifted outwardly while inching away in
midstretch, then continued to drift while lasting from an inner bidder late. GLITTERARY bumped with rivals on both sides while being put to crowded
quarters at the start, saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, then took the far turn in the three path and between horses, came into the lane in
the four path before altering course to the six path for clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, then rallied on his left lead in the final furlong to attempt a bid
inside of the leader in the late stages, but missed. BLAME THE GODS broke a bit inwardly, stalked in the three path and between horses, pressed around
the far turn before floating to the five path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, got
outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, met an inner foe's bid for show soon after, but clung to that position to the wire. NOFANSINTHESTANDS rated
off of the pace in the two path, then chased along the rail to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but missed reaching that position. TOURRISTA bumped an
outer foe before shying from that rival at the start, tracked in the four path around the first turn, tucked to the two path into the far turn, then chased from
between horses through upper stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. CARSON'S PRINCESS stalked three wide while in the four path, but fanned to
the six path entering the lane before failing to keep pace with the leader leaving the quarter pole. BEAUTIFUL BELLA trailed along the inside, shifted to the
three path in upper stretch, and moved up between horses. PERFECT DIVA stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but weaekened.
RUNAWAY HENNY bumped with an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, faltered to be far off of the pace before taking the far turn in the
four path, then swung to the eight path entering the lane, but failed to factor. CHINATOWN NANCY bumped an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the
pace early on, shifted to the four path down the backstretch, then from the five path to the seven path entering the lane, but tired.

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM tracked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, searched for racing room before splitting foes at the furlong grounds,
and drove clear shortly after. FLASHY BREW stalked the dueling pair from the three path, ranged up turning for home, but stalled entering the lane while
hanging on his left lead, changed over approaching midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, then kept on to secure place.
SOUL SONG tracked two wide, gained four wide turning for home, but leveled off in upper stretch, then bested tiring foes for show. QUEST FOR AVETTE
dueled for the lead two wide, led entering the lane, but proved no match for an outer bidder passing the furlong grounds, and faltered in the final sixteenth.
LOVEU AND PROUDOFU dueled for the lead inside of QUEST FOR AVETTE, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, then kept on but failed to re-rally.
C'MON VE broke slowly and multiple lengths behind the field, then never got invovlved. HALFMOON REEF was outrun.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT HURRICANE broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from the three path, grinded away behind rivals before splitting the leaders
approaching the final sixteenth, and gained an advantage late. SHARP DOUBLE EDGE dueled for the lead two wide, led at the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by an inner bidder in the final sixteenth, and just saved place. LEVEE PROUD took a significant bump from an outer foe at the start, stalked in the
two path, smoothly tipped to the four path in upper stretch for clear sailing outside of the leading pair, but only managed to chase before being outkicked by
an inner rival in the final furlong, then kept on late, but missed reaching place. RUMBLE READY stalked outside of the leading duelers, shifted to the five
path entering the lane, got outkicked by inner rivals in midstretch, and chased evenly. HARMON KILLER BREW failed to make an impact. KEYS
INCLUDED tracked along the inside, but faltered into the turn, then failed to factor thereafter. B D VALESKI dueled for the lead along the inside, but yielded
entering the final furlong, and weakened. CORRENTE DE OURO never got involved. TIMELESS JOKE hopped at the start, raced off of the pace, checked
behind a faltering foe into the turn, took the bend in the four path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but went wrong inside the quarter pole, was
quickly pulled up while injured, then was vanned off.

Footnotes
CIROC O CLOCK dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, shook clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held thereafter. P T'S FLASH broke
multiple lengths behind the field, saved ground far off of the pace, rallied along the rail to be behind the leaders in the final furlong, tipped two wide a
sixteenth out, and produced a late bid outside of the leader, but did not have enough. DOCTRINAIRE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but
failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in midstretch, then lost place late. K T'S JILTED GROOM chased in the three path, swung to the six path
entering the lane, grinded away in upper stretch, but leveled off at the furlong grounds. OUR SEXY A. P. tracked from the two path, tipped to the four path
entering the lane, and chased while lacking a kick between horses. BROOK IS GOLDEN broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then failed to
factor. RICHARDS DREAM made little impact with a wide trip. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY took a bump from an inner foe at the start, trailed into the turn, then
improved. BIG BOSS MAN dueled for the lead three wide, but faded while drifting to the five path entering the lane. CRYPTORITHM never got involved.
