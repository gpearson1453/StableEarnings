Footnotes
JUNIOR BUG perfect position to turn made a three wide run into stretch to clear and held on to the wire. AGNELLI never far back to turn, rallied into stretch,
gaining but too late. RAF no speed to the turn, rallied outside, bothered near the three sixteenth pole and still moved up. ORB OF THE BORO chased pace
to the turn, swung out at the three sixteenth pole but evened out in the stretch. UNDER THE COUVERS popped gate prestart, sprinted clear at once, held to
stretch but weakened. HART WELL failed to menace. SIR NUISANCE never threatened. FRANCO'S TEAM had a terrible start outside, rushed up to
contend, faltered.
