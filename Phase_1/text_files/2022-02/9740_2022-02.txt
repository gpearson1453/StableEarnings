Footnotes
LOYAL LOUIE sat behind dueling leaders in the clear, tipped out three wide to launch a bid turning for home, overhauled LUCKY AS A SEVEN from outside
in deep stretch and drew clear. LUCKY AS A SEVEN vied inside AWESOME FAMILY for three-eighths of a mile, disposed of that one leaving the turn and
drew clear, could not deny the winner entering the final furlong and saved the place. RED MULE was outsprinted early, swung five wide coming off the turn,
and rallied with good energy on the far outside to narrowly miss the runner-up spot. HIGH PRESS raced two to three wide between rivals on the turn,
advanced mildly in upper stretch but could not sustain the bid. VALHALLA AIR BASE saved ground for three-eighths of a mile, came two wide into the lane,
and faded. TIZ ROMANTIC raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. AWESOME FAMILY contested the early pace outside LUCKY
AS A SEVEN, and gave way at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
CANDY'S DREAM raced inside and applied pace pressure to TORN JEANS out of the chute, continued to force the issue then took command entering the
turn, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and held clear under steady urging. LUNAR BLAST was forwardly placed and stalked the top pair
up the backstretch, commenced a three wide bid around the turn, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of the the winner in the lane but had to settle for second
best. MISS ITALY raced in the back and saved ground through early stages, tipped out and hustled up near the quarter pole, ran on three to four wide into
the lane and churned on for a share. SHADILEE raced in contention tracking the early pace, was ridden along going by the half mile marker and into the
turn then gave sway. QUEEN DOMINA tossed head up and hopped in the air at the start, came away slowly, tugged in early stages while being rated then
settled and offered no bid when called upon. TORN JEANS set a pressured pace, vied with the winner going by the half mile marker, got collared for the
lead shortly after and began to tire.

the winner but stayed on to remain well clear of the rest. ON A TOUR saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and was along for the
show. NOBLE INTENTIONS chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. CARIBBEAN KITTEN was bit rank at the start and around the first
turn, set the pace along the rail and gave way readily around the far turn. CHEZ PAREE was outrun while racing two wide. ALL ABOUT KATHERN was
through early and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
PEACE OF EKATI stalked outside EMBOLDEN early, poked a head in front after six furlongs, then dug in to repel THRESHOLD through the stretch.
THRESHOLD steadied behind horses on the first turn, edged closer to the leaders three wide when roused on the second turn, challenged outside PEACE
OF EKATI through upper stretch, but could not get past. NOBLE INDY was hustled away from the gate, got beaten to the top by EMBOLDEN and steadied
inside that rival going to the first turn, saved ground until moving to the two-path in the stretch, and was up outside EMBOLDEN for the show spot.
EMBOLDEN set the pace for six furlongs, and gave way inside.

Footnotes
SARAWAT broke on top then conceded position to THE BEAST and tracked rival through early stages, moved up two wide late on the turn, took command
in the upper stretch, widened advantage under steady pressure and remained clear. MR MAC QUHAE was ridden along off the early pace, ranged up three
to four wide near the quarter pole, drifted out wider in the upper stretch, sustained a steady outside bid for the winner and cleared second best. THE BEAST
moved up the inside and took over the lead soon after the start, showed the way into the turn, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch, weakened but
remained well clear over the rest. STRONG AGAIN tracked in range through early stages, was ridden along three wide through the turn then gave way. DR.
CERFOLIO chased the top two early leaders, ran on through the turn then came up empty. UNICO raced in the back and saved ground, shifted off the
inside leaving the turn and never threatened. STONE AGE chased four to five wide through early stages, failed to respond around the turn and dropped
back in the lane.

Footnotes
BRONX dueled inside of CHROME FINISH, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear while ridden out. SIXTY ONE was pinched back at the start, trailed
inside early, advanced along the rail around the turn and finished well to be clearly second best. CHROME FINISH dueled outside of the winner for a half
and weakened in the drive. COMMITTEEMAN stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. MR. COOL was bumped on both sides at the
start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. NAVY PIER broke a bit awkwardly then bumped with SIXTY ONE just
after the start, raced off the pace four wide and played no further factor. KING TARZAN broke in and bumped MR. COOL into SIXTY ONE, chased the pace
two wide, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE IVY established control at once, rated along inside for a mile, was roused approaching the stretch to remain clear, and proved best under
steady urging. SONG OF INNOCENCE prompted the pace outside the winner throughout, and was clearly second best. FEDERALIST PAPERS was
unhurried early, advanced between horses on the third turn, had aim outside the leaders into the stretch, and was one-paced to the finish. BIG BAD DIVA
moved out three to four wide on the final bend, and could not gain in an even effort. VIVA LA RED saved ground most of the way, and never factored.
KATE'S KINGDOM stayed close inside to the final turn, and faded.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME tracked the pace up the backstretch, came under a ride just past the three-eighths pole, sustained a steady bid into the upper stretch,
dug in three deep at the furlong marker, took command and edged away. TIGER was forwardly placed out of the chute and stalked the pace up the
backstretch, given cue two to three wide into the upper stretch, roused forward into striking distance a furlong out then failed to kick on with the winner.
FRIENDLY FELLA settled nicely rated just off the early pace, hustled up four wide around the turn, sustained bid into the stretch run and just missed place.
KHOZY MY BOY stalked the pace up the backstretch, commenced a two wide bid through the turn, continued in range into the lane but ran on evenly.
CONVERTER vied for the lead in the opening quarter then cleared on top and led the way into the turn, fought back in the upper stretch then got collared
leaving the furlong marker and gave way. BRACCIO DI FERRO settled off the pace and saved ground, shifted out five wide for the drive and lacked a
needed rally. NACHO PAPA rated not far back up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and weakened in the lane.

FAST AS FLIGHT set a clear pace a bit off the rail and held clear under a drive. WATCH IT raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far
turn, could not seriously gain on the winner in the winner but stayed on to be a clear second. MOZAY was in range while racing three wide was one-paced
through the lane. CADENCIA stumbled at the start, saved ground off the pace, briefly went three wide to pass rivals around the far turn, angled back to the
rail near the five-sixteenths, made some progress in upper stretch but flattened out late. SITTING PRETTY failed to menace while racing two and three
wide. PHARAOH'S JEWEL raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and faded through the stretch. SALIT played no factor
while racing two wide. AGENT OF FORTUNE stalked the winner in the three path and was through after a half. ALWAYS EDEN hopped at the start and
was outrun inside. ANDIE ONE saved ground in range and was through after a half.
