LAST RENEGADE was crowded at the start, was unhurried early and saved ground, advanced along the rail around the turn,dueled for the lead and inched
away past the eighth pole. TENGO SED was crowded at the start, pressed the pace, lacked the needed late response. PROFOUND ONE broke in, set a
pressured to the turn, drew off for a clear lead, responded when challenged to duel, hung late and held safely for show. ELLIE THE NURSE broke sharply,
stalked the pace to the turn and stopped.

THE BLACK STRAT set the pace with a clear lead and held safely under left handed urging. THIRSTY KISS chased the pace, failed to rally despite strong
urging and was no match for the winner. BLAME THE DEVIL raced mid pack in an even effort, failed to threaten and finished best of the rest. SPINNING
RED was not a factor. BEL RAGAZZO failed to contend.

Footnotes
ZERO DOWN set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and proved best in a long drive. COASTAL KING stalked the pace while racing inside, bid
along the rail on the turn to challenge, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. EIGHT MAKAR bobbled at the start, lagged early,
offered a mild bid off the rail, couldn't gain and settled for show. GONE SOMEWHERE was in tight at the start, went six wide at the top of the stretch, lacked
a bid. THE THIRD RING pressed the pace while racing two wide to the turn and gave way. SILVER KID raced wide early and was outrun in an even effort.
ELIJAH SCHNELL was fractious in the paddock, broke slowly, raced in the back and lacked a bid. ROADSIDE raced outside, showed brief speed only and
dropped back steadily.

WARFRONT FIGHTER stalked the pace, bid willingly to duel and drew clear late under strong urging. TENGAS MASTERPIECE set a pressured pace, drew
off on the turn for a clear lead, responded when challenged to duel and yielded late to finish second best. WINNING MAGIC was never far back, offered a
mild bid inside and was along for show. PATH TO PARADISE broke out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace, fell back into the turn and was not a
threat. EZ RULER was not a factor. SUPER INTENSE was outrun. M G M'S LUCKY bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged on the turn and
stopped.

Footnotes
SHARK HARBOR stalked the pace while racing between horses, angled in on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held well. EXPRESS
PERMISSION stalked while racing outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and was gaining late. COLAVITO dueled to the turn, fell
back, continued willingly to the wire and held for show. TOP ROCKET lagged early, closed well inside and gained late. BY MOONLIGHT was taken back on
the turn, angled out, bid nine wide and closed well. INCLUDE HOO failed to menace in an even effort. PREMIER LEAGUE went widest in the drive, lacked a
rally and was not a threat. MUSKYMAN was not a factor. TIGER'S SONG dueled to the turn, dropped back and gave way.. EMPIRE WICKET was outrun.
