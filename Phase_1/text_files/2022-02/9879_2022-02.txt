SAINTS N MUSKETS vied for the early lead, drove clear entering the home stretch and was kept to the task. SHE'S GONE D'WILD raced within striking
distance, made a late bid, couldn't catch the winner, but was a clear second. TECATE TIME unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside entering
the final turn, angled out down the lane, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. SMOK'N RITA void of early speed, raced outside around the
second turn, moved up, but was no factor. SABER CUT raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside and faded. TRACK SMART
bobbled at the start, flashed brief speed, saved ground and dropped back. WHO DAT GREY showed early speed and stopped.

Footnotes
BOATING PARTY raced within striking distance, made a late inside bid and drove clear before the wire. M AND M'S CUSTOM sprinted to the front, drove
clear, led until late, couldn't match strides with BOATING PARTY for the win, but held on for second. LAST BATTLE raced within contention in the
beginning, eased back, made a late wide bid and missed second. DURITZ lacked early speed, made a late gain and was outfinished for third. MAJESTIC
SOCIETY raced near the back in the early part, came around the final turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. GUN WAR raced in the middle of the pack,
weakened and was no threat late. ROBTADI STORM raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside and faded. GONNA
GETCHA raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never close. LUNDI pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn
and dropped back. VALIANT DEFENDER always raced near the back and showed little.
