Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER sped to the front, set the pace on the inside into the turn, inched away around the bend, put to right-handed urging in the drive,
remained clear into the final sixteenth and held in the closing moments. SEASON TO REMEMBER was off a bit slow to begin, got blocked behind a rival at
the three-eighths pole, angled inside that runner on the turn, steered out in upper stretch and rallied to get up for second. CASILLALATER stalked along the
inside to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, drifted out in the final sixteenth and lost the place. KEEP YOUR COIL stalked widest up the
backstretch, went three wide around the bend, gave chase through the stretch, then was put in tight quarters and checked nearing the wire. SUEZAAANA
raced up close outside the pacesetter early, dropped back between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
SHE'S BULLETPROOF broke slow and got bumped at the start, settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn, moved to the rail then two wide into the
stretch, rallied to the front in midstretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and held off ROSE MADDOX in the final strides. ROSE MADDOX was off slow
to begin, unhurried up the backstretch, traveled two wide into the turn, eased out and exited the bend four wide, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed
well and kept gaining to the wire. CARMEN MIRANDA was off slow from outside, sat off the pace in the early going, went three wide into the turn, moved to
the two path then tipped three wide leaving the bend, closed through the final furlong and got outkicked for second. YOUTEYOURHONOR shifted in and
bumped rival leaving the gate, bid three deep on the turn but took a bad step into the stretch, then churned on to hold a minor award. GRITTY GIRL set the
pace up the backstretch, met the challenge from YOUTEYYOURHONOR around the bend, cleared into the lane, was overtaken midstretch and weakened
in the final sixteenth. MUNNY PENNY raced up close early, flanked the leader into the turn, chased that rival two wide to the stretch and weakened.
GIANNA'S WILD CAT was off slow to begin, took a bad step crossing surfaces, chased inside off the pace, had little left for the drive and was eased late
and walked off. DISTORTED DIVA dropped back between foes early, trailed along the rail through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUNATIC controlled the pace in the early going, traveled along the rail into the turn, moved out to the two path around the bend, drew away into the stretch
and padded the lead under confident handling to win easily. SCREAM AND SHOUT chased in range of the leader outside a rival, navigated the turn three to
four wide and bested the rest. WILD ARCH sat off the pace, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path, lugged out under left-handed urging
near the eighth pole and was along for the show. PHILLY LISHES stalked closest to the leader up the backstretch, went two to three wide around the bend
and weakened. TIPPY TOP tossed her head and came away a bit slow, chased outside a rival off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE cleared early and angled inward to be rated on the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, roused with a furlong left to run, urged once
right-handed in the final sixteenth and stayed clear to the line. BUYBACK bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from inside, tipped
out at the top of the stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong and was clearly second best. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the beginning,
traveled along the inside the moved to the two path, angled out in the stretch and was along for the show. CHASINGSERENDIPITY tracked the pace in the
two path, was coaxed around the far turn and came three wide into the stretch and failed to launch a late bid. BRITTLE AND YOO stalked the pace in the
two path or outside a rival, tipped three wide at the top of the lane but flattened in the final furlong. TOURNESOL got squeezed between rivals early,
traveled along the inside through the clubhouse turn, went two wide on the second bend, tipped three wide into the stretch, angled out further in the lane
and made no impact. WHISTLER'S STYLE bumped with rival at the start, got bumped by CLEARLY GONE and squeezed between rivals early, saved
ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. KLEEN KARMA pulled early along the rail first time through the stretch, chased along the inside to the lane, got
crowded a bit in midstretch and weakened. CLEARLY GONE bumped inner rival early while four deep, steered down to the two path after, exited the far turn
three wide, moved out in the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
CLASSICAL ROMANCE was forwardly placed up the backstretch, coaxed along with three-eighths remaining, split foes at the quarter pole, bid inside the
leader at the top of the stretch, kicked clear and won going away. HEAD START broke well, was up close outside, pressed leaving the backstretch, headed
rival on the turn, inched clear around the bend, led three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on to save the place. SUE ETTAS
GHOST trailed four wide through the turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. TAPIT DOUX raced in range three to four wide on the turn, bid from
outside at the three-sixteenths pole but faltered in the final furlong. CORUSCATION broke a step slow then got hustled to the front, set the pace inside
HEAD START up the backstretch, dueled with that rival on the turn, lost touch past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
KO SAMUI (IRE) stalked between rivals, tipped three wide on the far turn, bid three deep into the stretch, pressured TUSKEGEE CAT through the final
furlong, dug in late and won the bob. TUSKEGEE CAT was closest in pursuit in the early stages, bid two wide into the drive, took over in upper stretch, held
a short lead into the final sixteenth and lost the bob at the wire. WAR AT SEA forwardly placed inside, angled out in the stretch, launched a late bid three
deep and was a game third in a blanket finish. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT pulled on the first turn then rated on the inside off the pace, tipped two wide on the far
turn, moved out further in the stretch and put in a mild late bid. BROTHERLY LOVE took over quickly, angled to the inside, challenged into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. MITAD DEL MUNDO broke slow, stalked inside, came out and bumped rival at the
five-sixteenths pole and kept on down the stretch. WIN THE DAY got bothered by BALLADEER and steadied into the first turn, was unhurried on the inside,
moved out in the stretch and kept on through the lane to improve position. HOODLUM was off slow to begin, went two wide into the first turn, came four to
five wide into the stretch, drifted into rival and steadied in upper stretch and could not rally. LIL BRO COOP shifted out into the first turn, tracked between
foes, two wide on the far turn, three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. BALLADEER broke out, shifted in entering the first turn, got forced out at
the five-sixteenths pole, raced greenly in the lane and failed to menace. SWEET SAVANT tracked three wide, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

SECRET TOUCH was away well to take the lead and moved inside, set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared around the far turn, led through the
lane, then got challenged again by SYNTHESIS late and was able to hold on. SYNTHESIS tracked three wide around the first turn, raced up close outside
the top pair in the middle stages, bid outside into the far turn, could not keep up around the bend, came back on in the final sixteenth and missed.
UNBROKEN STAR was off slow and bumped at the start, was guided off the rail nearing the first turn, went four wide around the bend, moved within range
up the backstretch, chased four wide through the second turn and flattened out to third. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was off a bit slow and bumped with inner
rival at the start, chased two wide around the first turn then went up to press the pace from outside, got shuffled between into the far turn, chased along the
rail into the lane and weakened. FRENCH GETAWAY was off a bit slow to start, went four wide around the first turn, angled in entering the far turn and
saved ground to the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
FLY THE SKY broke slow, pulled into the first turn, traveled three wide then moved to the two path, rallied four deep in the drive, took over late and
prevailed. BIG BUZZ was off slow and lost his path at the start, lagged behind early, advanced three then four wide on the second turn, angled six wide in
upper stretch, rallied from outside but could not get by. KEYSTONE FIELD was rated in the early going in the three path then traveled between runners,
waited for room through the far turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch but was put in tight quarters shortly after, found room along the fence and
launched a rail bid but was no match for the top pair. ABSOLUTE UNIT broke well from outside, stalked three wide on the first turn, raced up close three
deep on the far turn, led briefly with a sixteenth to go but was soon overtaken and yielded the place and show. HAPI HAPI was closest in pursuit in the two
path, took over past the three-eighths pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch, lost the lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. LIBERAL (IRE)
settled inside, angled three wide with a quarter mile left to run, lacked room in upper stretch, tried to angled in to a clear path but steadied off heels at the
eighth pole, found room and kept on through the final sixteenth. BEE CATCHER got crowded and was forced to steady soon after the start, went four wide
around both turns and flattened in the drive. IRISH HEATWAVE stalked the pace inside, checked off heels at the three-eighths pole, remained blocked
behind a rival and checked again leaving the bend, found room in the stretch but could not summon the needed late bid. FLY NIGHTLY tracked two wide
early then moved inside, got blocked on the far turn and had to steady briefly into the stretch, moved out in the lane and could not rally. BUILDER set the
pace on the inside, was overtaken past the three-eighths pole, chased the leader into the lane, checked hard in upper stretch and faded.
