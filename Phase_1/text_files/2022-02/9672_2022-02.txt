PERCEIVED was coaxed from the gate to get the lead, set the early pace under pressure to the inside, moved clear with six furlongs to run then drew off,
remained well clear in the three path around the turn, responded well when asked inside the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch under total
command and drew off under wraps to win as the rider pleased. KID CHOCOLATE angled out at the rear early, was urged along on the outside, moved in
late on the backstretch, was hard ridden while two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop and safely secured second
while no match for the winner. JACOBA pressed the early pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back at the three-quarter pole then switched to the
outside, fell well behind the leader under urging, went around the turn in the five path and capitulated.

EASY TO BLESS four then three wide in pursuit, assumed command near the three-eighths pole from an embattled duo, remained patiently handled
slipping away to the quarter when angled five to six wide into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive getting geared
down in the late stages. TARA'S TALENT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing three
furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and was allowed to finish under her own power through the final
sixteenth while well clear of the rest and along second best. DEALING JUSTICE hustled from the start, dueled from the two path down the backstretch with
SPUN D'ETAT to her inside trading light brushes and bumps, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths and was displaced in tandem with her main rival
near the three-eighths, faded and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. SPUN D'ETAT hustled from the gate, dueled inside of
the aforementioned foe trading brushed and light bumps, got overtaken in concert with her main pace rival near the three-eighths and was placed in a bit
tight along the rail by DEALING JUSTICE, angled out four wide at the head of the stretch and faltered.

PENDOLINO was a bit slow into stride, moved up then tracked the pace comfortably on the outside, gained to make a bid with a half-mile to run, took the
lead leaving the backstretch, inched away in the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped to the two path coming to the
quarter-pole, responded well under the crop in the stretch and held at big odds under strong urging. SWEET MISSION settled on the far outside, moved
closer late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a vigorous drive in the stretch and was second best.
CHAYSENBRYN was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the
show. LEFT LEANING LUCY was hustled from the start, settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail at the
quarter-pole and failed to threaten. KERIK moved out leaving the chute, raced well back on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch then drifted further out and was no factor. SHANES PRETTY LADY was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace, lost the advantage to the
winner leaving the backstretch, dropped back in the two path on the turn and faded. ALPINE QUEEN brushed with a foe leaving the chute, was urged along
off the pace, chased while moving from three to five wide on the turn and capitulated. A RING THING was hustled from the gate, settled under some urging,
moved closer late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, turned into the stretch in the two path and had nothing left.

on the turn and faltered. PER NYS GAMING COMMISSION RULING AQ 10-2022; PENDOLINO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM PURSE MONEY.

FORTY TWO ACE pressed the pace on the outside, moved further out in the track while drawing even with the leader around the half-mile pole, took a short
lead in the five path on the turn, shook clear under a drive outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. BLU GROTTO broke out at the start,
dropped well back while showing no speed, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to garner the place.
EXTREME was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the six path around the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened but held the show. GROUP HUG bumped with a foe at the start, moved out early then settled on the outside, was roused four wide
on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. PIER FORTY was urged along towards the rear, started
the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MISTER CANDY RIDE bumped with a rival at the start,
settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
HIGH TIDE was hustled from the start, moved up to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the three path while losing the lead on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CONFECTIONER settled just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped to the rail outside the
quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the crop and also tired. ROYAL TRYST was bumped on both sides at the start then dropped back, fell well behind
the rest of the field, went two to three wide on the turn and trailed.

three-sixteenths and again at the eighth pole before being corrected with a right handed crop rallying to take command just inside the sixteenth marker and
prevailed at the end under her own momentum to the finish. NORMAN QUEEN broke in at the start bumping HIGHWAY QUEEN, showed the way in hand
