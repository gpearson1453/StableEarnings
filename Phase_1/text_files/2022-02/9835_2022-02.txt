Footnotes
COACH HUDSON vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. HESACALENDARBOY
challenged on the front end, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT raced near the back, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the top two and was along for third.
BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE void of early speed, had an outside trip and was never a factor. THE KUKRI lacked early speed and was never a threat. MY
LITTLE JUNIOR flashed early speed, faded around the final turn and was finished early.

PRADO'S PRIORITY dueled for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the lane and was ridden out. TWO B dueled on the
front end, saved ground, couldn't keep up with the winner late, but was best of others. WEDINGTON raced within contention, saved ground around the turn
and proved no match for the top two. CORN POP raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. BRIAR lacked early speed, raced
outside around the turn and was never a factor. THE HEAT IS ON void of early speed and was never close. FAMOUS YANKEE pressed the early pace and
dropped back.

MOORAC raced within contention, came around the second turn on the inside, made a rail bid and drove clear. MOSTLY AWESOME unhurried in the
beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MEMORY MAGIC
steadied early, getting in tight quarters, quickly moved up, pressed the pace and missed the place position. BIND ME UP dueled on the front end, saved
ground and weakened. TESUQUE lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn, moved up, but was no factor. FABULOUS GIRL raced in the
middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and put forth an even effort. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY raced near the middle of the pack, weakened and
was no threat. OH MY OH showed early speed and dropped back. LADY RAD always raced near the back and showed little.
