Footnotes
STONES ROAD accelerated to the lead inside past the three eighths pole, dug in with the advantage at the rail rounding the turn and was steadily handled
to hold on. REAL APPEAL set the pace the opening three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in from the eighth pole and was gaining steadily on the winner. MEDAL GENIUS gave chase, raced near the rail on
the turn but couldn't improve in the lane. TRUENO FUERTE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little further.
WARRIORINTHEHOUSE chased through the backstretch, drifted to the six path on the turn and proved empty in the stretch. EX RATED gave chase to no
avail. COOK THE BOOKS saved ground.

Footnotes
SO RED THE ROSE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn and held well under steady stretch encouragement. LADY MADISON settled close in the three path, started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths
pole, remained a factor off the rail on the far turn but ultimately, had to settle for second. MACKENZIE'S STAR broke awkwardly and rounded the first turn
off the rail, eased outward into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SHE
FIGURES saved early ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. BUFF N stalked off the rail,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. HOUSE OF LOVE ran in the four path the opening turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

and was kept alert from there. SECRET SWIRL gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted into the stretch but dug in to
take second later yards. JUBA JUNIOR gave chase toward the inside, improved at the rail on the turn and came along for third later yards.
NEEDNOEXPLANATION steadied lightly early then chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled to the four path into the stretch then flattened the
final sixteenth. JOKES R FLYING took the lead on the chute then drew clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was
caught past the eighth pole then weakened the final sixteenth. SPINISH gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little further.

CARSON CASTLE took the lead nearing the half mile pole, rated clear and finished of her own initiative. TRIPLE GALA gave chase, raced at the rail on the
turn, angled to the four path leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final strides. DENALI D'ORO steadied from tight quarters early then gave chase
from the half mile pole, rounded the turn at the rail, flattened stride late yards and was nipped from second nearing the wire. CHEROKEE CASTLE gave
chase, rounded the turn about the four path, angled to the seven path into the stretch and finished evenly. DEREKA'S BLUFF gave chase outside, rounded
the turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. SISTER JOANN came slightly in early, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the
turn then flattened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Carson Castle, lodged by the rider of Denali d'Oro, though, found no cause for
change.

Footnotes
PARISHIONER broke clear and contested the pace from the half mile pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the turn and dug in determinedly to eke out
the nod over HE IS BONAFIDE through the final yards. The latter contested the pace from the half mile pole, dueled at even terms nearest the rail on the
turn and dug in gamely, though, grudgingly relented the final yards. SMELLSLIKEMONEY gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly.
FLASH OF DAY gave chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn, was eased to the four path into the stretch and finished evenly. INSURRECTIONIST was
pinched back at the start but picked up the chase leaving the chute, ran in the four path of the turn, drifted outward nearing the head of the lane, left the turn
widest and finished evenly. QUANAH was bumped in across the path of Insurrectionist leaving the gate then gave only distant chase and raced near the rail
on the turn. POWER G was not a factor. ANALYZE ME broke inward to make contact with Quanah then saved ground.

Footnotes
ZAINO BOYZ took the lead on the chute and angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was kept alert through the
stretch. KUKULKAN engaged in close chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then settled for second best. GRAN CITY chased through the
backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in through the stretch to take third later yards. UPHEAVAL broke in to
make contact with INSPIRING JUSTICE, angled in to pressure the pace and rounded the turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. The latter was
bumped inward and into That's History leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the six path of the turn and showed little further.
BARNSTORM gave chase toward the inside, eased outward through the turn and entered the stretch about the six path and showed little further. THAT'S
HISTORY was bumped inward and into FLUENT IN SARCASM then gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and was carried further
outward into the stretch, while the latter exchanged contact with AUBURN MILL, was pinched back leaving the gate and raced well off the pace, rounded the
turn about the three path then drifted into the stretch. AUBURN MILL exchanged contact with Fluent In Sarcasm leaving the gate and never factored. A
Stewards inquiry and a subsequent claim of foul against the riders of Inspiring Justice and Upheaval, resulted in the disqualification of Upheaval to seventh
place for causing a chain reaction impacting several horses to his inside leaving the gate.

HEATED bobbled leaving the gate then hustled to take over between horses approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested
the edge two deep on the turn, briefly gave up the nod to MISS WAVE at the eighth pole, but dug in under determined handling to recover the advantage
and edge further ahead nearing the wire. The latter pressured the pace inside and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dueled to
a slim brief lead at the eighth pole and dug in gamely through the lane before reluctantly ceding. LUNAR PRAYER gave chase toward the inside, rounded
the turn near the rail and raced evenly through the stretch. LADY LICIOUS pressured the early pace, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened
leaving the eighth pole. NAJWA gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened. LACOUGRA chased outside, rounded the turn about the three
path then weakened. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
JAXJAXXORJACKS rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was steadily
encouraged through the lane. LET'S GET PHYSICAL stalked inside on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dueled clear of OFFICER APPEAL mid-stretch and settled for second best. The latter broke in to make contact
with Lil Toughman and rounded the opening turn in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened inside
the eighth pole. JACKLIGHTING settled just off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on
the far turn. LIL TOUGHMAN was bumped and shuffled back shortly after the break, rounded the first turn in the four path, raced well off the pace leaving
the turn and showed little response. MR. HOSTLER was bumped shortly after the start, stalked the early pace off the rail and challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
CHAINSAW AL engaged Split The Pack from the start and dueled through the backstretch, put that one away past the quarter pole, kept the advantage at
the rail on the turn, drifted toward the top of the stretch but dug in under determined handling to eke out the edge over R TAP, who gave chase toward the
inside and raced near the rail on the turn, dueled gamely from the head of the stretch but reluctantly ceded later yards. CORRELATE raced well back toward
the inside, improved at the rail on the turn and finished well to take third the final jump. SPLIT THE PACK contested the pace from the start and dueled
through the backstretch, dropped back leaving the quarter pole, drifted into the stretch and flattened later yards. MORE PLEASE chased outside, ran in the
four and five paths on the turn then flattened the final furlong. TEMPESTA chased between horses to the five sixteenths pole then faded off the rail on the
turn. NODUS, FAIRPIT and RUNNING ROY were not factors.
