Footnotes
ESCAPE FUND chased the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path on the turn, secured command at the head of the stretch then drew away
under brisk urging. MINNETONKA , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, took aim on the lead entering the stretch then steadily weakened.
ALWAYS SOMETHING sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and weakened through the lane. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL , fractious in the starting
gate, bobbled slightly at the break, raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. FEARLESS LASSIE circled the turn, was four deep entering the
stretch and gave way. UTTERLY ENCHANTING , along the inner rail around the turn, swung out in upper stretch and gave way. TORCH CARRIER ,
outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn.

Footnotes
MICE AND MEN , three wide outside rivals stalking the pace into the turn, was put to a hearty ride mid turn, shifted four wide soon after and was toiling a bit,
found more from between rivals in the final yards and got up. TOM TERRIFIC broke awkwardly, regrouped and rated within range while saving ground,
eased out past three sixteenths, worked his way between runners to threaten in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. WHIRLIN CURLIN , taken to
rate early, moved up leaving the far turn, advanced between rivals to take aim on the leaders, shifted out then drifted five wide soon into the stretch,
corrected and ranged up outside runners leaving the eighth pole, challenged for the top then hung. PASCAL CHANT , brushed at the break, set a pressured
pace inside, shook clear leaving the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SUBJECT TO CHANGE moved up to the outside of
PASCAL CHANT early on and forced the pace, vied around the turn and into the lane, failed to keep pace heading to mid stretch and faded. MY SACRED
PLACE , wide, was not a factor. MYSTIC TIMES was steadied back from between runners early then failed to menace.

DATHOSS accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and was kept to his business in the
drive. REMEMBERING WILBUR saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. HAPPYIZE lacked speed,
raced along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. HAMPDEN LANE , in the two path behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path entering the
stretch, steadied on a rival's heels in upper stretch, angled in near the eighth pole and finished willingly. MR. NINETEEN , three deep chasing the pace
around the turn, weakened. BALTIMORE BULLEIT lacked speed, swung to the seven path entering the stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired
ones. WINSTON'S GOLD , in the two path leaving the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and failed to sustain his move. BOSS MAN J J , urged
along leaving the backstretch, raced inside horses on the turn, chased the winner and weakened. HOWARD'S ROCK , two wide on the turn, swung to the
six path turning for home and faltered. RHUMJAR , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
LUNA BELLE broke a step slow then was taken off the inside and edged behind foes, steadied off of a rival with four and a furlongs remaining, regrouped
and gathered momentum mid turn, worked between horses then swung six to seven wide into the lane, responded when put to hand encouragement,
unleashed a furious run to reel in rivals, forged to command with about a sixteenth to go and drew out smartly while only under some steady hand asking.
SHE IS WISKY settled off the pace while saving ground, came under pressure and moved up past the five sixteenths,, swung out five wide into the stretch,
closed under pressure and moved to near even terms inside the eighth pole, kept on gamely while no match and was well clear of the rest. SANDY'S
GARDEN took over to the inside of rivals leaving the chute, set a rated pace while handling pressure from two foes around the turn, shook clear when asked
soon into the lane, switched over to her left lead near mid stretch when wandering a bit, could not fend off challenges heading to the sixteenth marker, got
back over to her correct lead and faded. QUALY settled off the pace while three wide, came under a ride mid turn, angled out near mid stretch and churned
on. BUFF MY BOOTS prompted the pace three deep, saw the leader get away a bit soon into the lane, kept on willingly to creep back into the fray past the
furlong grounds but failed to kick on from there. MOODY WOMAN , four wide nearing the half mile pole, circled six wide into the stretch but failed to
threaten. BENEATH THE STARS prompted the pace two wide, fought on between runners mid turn, lacked a punch from the head of the lane and gave way
through the final furlong. MONEY'S WORTH dropped in early and pulled her way forward to track the leading trio, failed to kick on under a ride while two
wide mid turn and weakened.

KISS THE GIRL settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up under some coaxing heading to the far turn, eased out a bit then checked off heels
when lacking room nearing the lane, regrouped and forged through a seam between runners nearing mid stretch, secured command soon after, shook clear
under strong handling then held firm. ARTFUL SPLATTER prompted the pace outside SMOOTH WITH A KICK, came under a ride past the three eighths,
dueled then gained a slim advantage while three wide into the lane, was hooked from her inside by the winner approaching the eighth pole, wandered
outward a bit late but fought valiantly to the wire. MISS LESLIE broke a step slow, settled well off the rail, took closer order leaving the far turn, ranged up
four wide into the lane to have dead aim but failed to seriously kick on through the final furlong. SMOOTH WITH A KICK broke alertly and took command
heading into the first turn, set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. GOLDEN
PLUME , well placed tracking off the rail, moved up a bit after a half mile, came under a solid ride and pursued between foes leaving the three eighths, failed
to go on with the leaders approaching the stretch and faded.

GALERIO , four deep the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, gained the lead entering the stretch,
opened a clear advantage in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously. FOREWARNED , stalked the pace racing along the inner rail for six furlongs, was taken to
the four path at the head of the stretch and gamely closed outside the winner. GENTLEMAN JOE disputed the pace outside WORKIN ON A DREAM and
weakened the final furlong. TREASURE TROVE , raced well off the duel down the backstretch, worked between horses in mid stretch and passed tired
ones. TORCH OF TRUTH lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and failed to rally. WORKIN ON A
DREAM hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch and faltered. BOBBY G , outrun, drifted five wide turning for home then drifted in near the
three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
GLASS CEILING broke a step slow, edged up between foes leaving the chute and prompted the pace outside JAKARTA, stayed latched to that one around
the turn, came under a ride when drawing on even terms into the lane, took a slim advantage under strong handling in mid stretch, remained in an all out
battle to the wire and grimly prevailed. JAKARTA , quickly to the front and secured the inside, set a rated pace while taking outside pressure, dueled from
the quarter pole, ceded the lead with a furlong to go, stayed on gamely and just wasn't quite good enough. FILLE D'ESPRIT edged up to the inside of rivals
early on then steadied back near the three quarter pole, recovered and rated inside, took closer order into the turn, eased out for room nearing the quarter
pole and set her sights on the top pair, shifted further out leaving mid stretch and steadily gained. KAYLASAURUS was rated off the pace while saving
ground, attempted to ease out with some run past the five sixteenths but steadied briefly when hemmed in, edged up past the three sixteenths, eased out
some and continued on with interest. PRODIGY DOLL , four wide and within range, gathered some steam past the five sixteenths, pursued into the lane
then came up empty in the final furlong. BELLE OF THE NORTH , unhurried early while well back, came under a ride saving ground past the five sixteenths,
eased out some but failed to seriously kick on. REGAL RETORT chased off the rail, circled five wide into the lane and faded. BOLD CONFECTION stalked
two to three wide, was under pressure mid turn, steadied out of close quarters near the quarter pole then dropped back. An objection by the rider of
KAYLASAURUS against FILLE D'ESPRIT for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not allowed.

CORDMAKER , in tight quarters soon after the break, stalked the pace in hand down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around the turn, found room
inside WAR TOCSIN, entering the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out despite right hand urging inside the eighth pole, continued to get out
near the sixteenth pole and lasted. WAR TOCSIN sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch, was floated out by
the winner near the sixteenth pole, altered course inside that one in deep stretch and gamely closed. SIR ALFRED JAMES chased the pace between
horses down the backstretch and into the turn, was shuffled back near the three eighths pole, was taken to the inner rail turning for home and rallied.
SHACKQUEENKING , steadied in close quarters soon after the break, chased the pace between horses and weakened through the stretch. AIR TOKEN ,
five deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. THREES OVER DEUCES , in the four path between horses chasing the pace to the stretch, gave
way. TIMELESS BOUNTY , outrun, was taken to the six path in upper stretch. An objection by the rider of WAR TOCSIN against CORDMAKER for alleged
interference leaving the eighth pole was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

MY WAY OR ELSE , well back while saving ground and under early rating, came under pressure after a half mile and picked up some momentum, shifted
out six wide for the drive, closed steadily under right handed asking, struck the top in deep stretch then drew clear. R TRUE SENSATION sped to the front,
set the pace two wide, turned away a threat entering the lane, shook back clear past the three sixteenths, held on to late then gave way grudgingly.
CONGRESS HALL , off the pace while three wide, moved up into the stretch, angled in advancing, bid inside foes near the sixteenth marker but flattened
out. DANNY DEEP CUTS stalked the leader three wide, bid to engage past the five sixteenths, vied five wide in upper stretch and weakened.
SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) chased the pace, got through along the inside to make a run in upper stretch, failed to kick on near mid stretch and
weakened. LIFE IN FLASH was outrun. FAMILY FORTUNE dropped back around the turn.
