Footnotes
LIVING FOR TODAY dropped inside to save some ground in the first turn, unhurried up the backstretch, closer far turn when steering three wide, dueled
into the stretch while remaining in the three path, disposed of the runner up inside the furlong grounds and drew clear under steady handling. HIGHTAILING
settled off the pace toward the inside, three out to four wide advance far turn, dueled outside the winner into and through upper stretch then could not match
strides, clearly second best. MILLIGANMIKEANDME lacked speed off the inside, advanced in the two path second turn, proved no match for the top two
down the lane, finished up best of the rest. ITALIAN TWIN forwardly placed while racing three wide in the first turn, lodged an early move to take over in the
three path before a half. briefly clear then faltered when confronted in the second turn. FAST SOPHIA pressed the issue early just off the inside, dropped
inside when beginning to weaken in the second turn, continued to retreat the final three furlongs. LADY PRIEST off a step slow, trailed, never a threat. MISS
ALLIE GRACE asked a bit early, vied up front along the inside, stopped and was distanced after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
PUNCHY GIRL broke on top, took over in the two path first turn, took over before a quarter, stretched out in upper stretch, lugged stretch, held the runner up
comfortably safe late. SULWE settled off the pace and the inside, 2-4w 2nd turn, rallied to be clear for the place while getting to the winner. SWEETNESS
TO prompted the pace along the inside, chased the winner into the lane, proved no match for the winner nor could she match strides with the runner up late.
HAMAZING DEBATE within striking distance just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. CHAI TEA saved ground to no avail. CHOCTAW CHARLIE
prompted the pace early three wide, steadily faded. CALICO TABBY last away, remained always back. DERONDA finished early, far back, distanced,
jogged in.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY TICKET in the second flight early, saved ground through most of the turn, steered out exiting the turn, bid inside the furlong grounds, edged clear
under steady handling. FREER broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, extended advantage through the turn, briefly responded when challenged by the
winner nearing the furlong marker, slight drift, gave ground grudgingly to that one, clearly second best. OUTCOME within striking distance early off the
inside, three wide turn, went evenly through the stretch while having little for the top two. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR settled off the inside, traffic midway on
the turn, improved slightly while never a serious threat. WARNING LABEL lacked speed off the inside, three wide turn, shifted out a bit further for the drive,
lacked late kick. MOUNTAIN PINE off a step slow, raced back off the inside, three to four wide turning into the lane, improved position while angling in.
SAMURAI ISLAND prompted the pace well wide, four out to five wide late in the bend, weakened in the drive. CONFESS chased the runner up early in the
two path, gave way through the stretch. JUSTDENNIS near the back while racing the two path, failed to respond in the drive. RAZOR RAY off step slow,
trailed, showed little.

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE away in good order from the outside, cleared to the two path into the first turn, showed the way down the stretch the first time firmly in hand,
continued to rate the second half mile, asked a bit for some run turning for home, extended his advantage into the lane, steadily drew out under a firm hand
ride to win ridden out. CUPID'S CLAWS settled off the pace and the inside, tracked three wide through the second turn, moved closer four wide midway on
the final bend, proved no match in the drive, clear for the second spot. TENFOLD in the second flight off the rail, three wide through the third turn, along for
the show. ALLEGE tracked the winner from along the inside, came up empty for the drive. ORIGINAL INTENT fell back to trail after the start, lacked speed
while saving ground, continued inside through the final bend, made little impact through the stretch. DYNADRIVE chased the winner for eight furlongs three
wide, began to weaken into the final turn, continued to give way through the stretch.

Footnotes
PURE SILK in mid pack and unhurried early, steered out a bit to be three wide far turn, roused from between horses into the lane, closed with good resolve
to be up in time. UNDECODED vied up front three wide through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn in the two path, shook
clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner late, remained well clear for the place. MISS ALPHA BELLA with the pace closest to the rail
in the first turn, remained within striking distance the middle half, two path through the second turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick.
DEDE'S TRICK within striking distance behind the pace in the three path first turn, continued outside and was three wide through the final bend, also went
one paced through the lane to be found lacking in the final furlong. MADAM PIE five wide into the first turn when back off the pace, remained outside and
was four wide through the second turn, lacked a significant closing response as well. MOONSHINE LILY lacked speed off the inside, improved slightly while
not a serious threat. GAME OF INCHES broke back, three out to four wide late second turn. MOONLIGHT BLAZE off a step slow, remained always back.
POOLSIDE MANNERS vied early inside the runner up and between foes, saddle slipped backstretch, remained forward despite that and her rider looking
especially uncomfortable into the far turn, gave way soon after then continued to fade down the lane with her rider unable to apply pressure. MY DADDY'S
TRAINER finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
SUMMER STORM broke in good order, showed the way into and through the turn in the two path, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept to
pressure. TAPALONG pressed the winner in the three path to that one's outside, proved unable to match strides with that one stretch, held sway for the
place late. LIL MISS HOT MESS forwardly placed while outside, four wide when remaining forward through the bend, remained outside, lost whip late, not
enough for the place. COULD YOU forwardly placed early while between foes, dropped inside turn, went evenly to the wire. FANCIFIED in the second flight
while three wide into the turn, set down for the drive, failed to muster a response. LOVELY LADY LEXI behind the pace while racing inside, bumped with
HOPTOWN HONEY into the turn, bobbled slightly, fell back, went one paced through the stretch as well. HOPTOWN HONEY in the second flight while
between horses, checked in traffic into the turn bumping with LOVELY LADY LEXI fell back and did not recover. SANDY SANGRIA off the early leaders
while outside, four wide into the turn, moved closer briefly then flattened out in the drive. HIT IT TWICE off a step slow, remained always back. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF HOPTOWN HONEY AGAINST
FANCIFIED FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THAT POINT OF THE RACE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER chased the leader after moving off the inside, came three wide into the lane, challenged with less than a furlong remaining, edged clear
late under firm handling. JACK VAN BERG broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear to show the way in the two path, remained clear into the lane, offered brief
resistance to the winner then could not match that one late. FLAT LUCKY back off the pace and the inside, angled in a bit to race the two path out of the
turn, rallied for the show and was getting to the runner up late while remaining toward the inside. YODEL E. A. WHO broke back, lacked speed inside,
continued to save ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position while not a threat to the top three. MO'S MOJO forwardly placed
for a half while in the three path, had little left for the stretch run.. ULTIMATE in the second flight early, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. WAR
DETONATOR void of speed outside, raced four wide into the turn, failed to menace in the drive. SUBSTANTIAL off slowly, remained always back. LONG
TERM THINKING raced in mid pack while saving ground, backed up.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT BLUE dueled up front off the inside, put that foe away midway on the final turn, responded when the runner up came alongside soon after,
dueled upper stretch, slight drift outward, brush, proved best in a game effort. SUPER CONSTITUTION unhurried for five furlongs toward the inside, steered
out steadily to be three wide when advancing late in the second turn, challenged outside the winner into the stretch, brushed with that one near midstretch,
outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. ANTIGRAVITY lacked speed off the rail, raced five wide into the far turn and through that bend, staged a
mild rally to annex the show, not a threat to the top two. JOHNY'S FIREBALL broke back, lacked speed, improved off the inside into the lane, no real threat.
DR JACK in the second flight off the inside, came four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke in good order, dueled up front
inside the winner, began to weaken in the second turn, continued to fade stretch. LAST MARTINI last away, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. GAME DAY PLAY forwardly placed for a half, gave way. RESTORING HOPE in the second flight outside, four
wide into the far turn, began to back up soon after. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MRS. BEANS in the second flight for a half inside, steered out to be three wide for the drive, collared the leader past the furlong marker, proved best under
firm handling. DUSTY HILL broke sharp, cleared toward the inside, showed the way in the two path into and through the turn, responded when challenged a
furlong out, proved stubborn to the end. MAHOMEY lacked speed in mid pack, saved ground through the turn, displayed some modest late interest to prove
best of the rest, not a threat to the top pair. ONE TEN STADIUM within striking distance just off the inside, lacked a winning response when called on for the
drive. SUPER GEEK bothered at the start, raced back early as a result, saved ground exiting the turn, improved position. DOC IRWIN turned in an even
effort racing just off the inside. IMA BLING CAT broke in to bother several rivals, was straightened and raced forwardly up the backstretch, briefly challenged
outside the runner up late in the turn, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. MO BETTA failed to menace while racing three wide. MY
LITTLE TIPSY raced in the main body off the inside, four wide late in the turn, tired through the stretch. MR. COUGAR broke back, fell back to trail, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while always outrun. OJITOS bothered at the start, moved up early outside, four wide into the turn, gave way. CITRUS BAY
bothered at the start, was never involved.
