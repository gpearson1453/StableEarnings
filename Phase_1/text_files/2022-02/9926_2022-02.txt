Footnotes
HEARTYCONSTITUTION in mid pack early, moved outside, advanced into a striking position four wide late in the turn, challenged when straightened for
home, drew clear late under steady handling. LITTLE MOMBO chased the early leader up the backstretch off the inside, advanced and challenged late in
the turn, took over entering the stretch, briefly dueled inside the winner then could not keep up. ARI OAKLEY within striking distance out in the strip, closer
three wide late in the bend, proved no match for the top two in the drive, well clear of the others. THREAVE'S COMPANY behind the leaders off the inside,
continued in the two path through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. GYPSY REWARD off a step slow, trailed early, passed
tiring rivals three wide while not a serious threat. DEVIOUS sprinted clear along the inside, showed the way through most of the turn then weakened when
headed by the runner up into the lane. FIREWOLVES remained back while racing four wide throughout. OUTFORARUN finished early, far back.

FIRST LINE outrun in the early going, began to move closer in the second turn, traffic, three to four wide into the lane, bid a furlong out, proved best.
CASHANOVA off the pace and the inside, closer inside of traffic late in the final turn, brief wait, split foes into the lane, bid inside the furlong marker when
closest to the inside of the first flight, outkicked late, clear second. MOLIERE within striking distance off the inside, angled out four wide when moving to
challenge into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker then flattened out to lost contact with the top two late. INDIAN GULCH four wide in the first turn,
continued well wide up the backstretch, four wide into the far bend, floated five wide into the lane when challenging, held a brief and slightly lead past the
furlong marker then weakened. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER lacked speed, angled out five wide into the stretch, lacked a serious closing kick. RIVER
CACTUS broke back, saved ground through most of the final turn, encountered some traffic into the stretch, came up empty when clear for the drive.
JACK'S ADVANTAGE broke up front, showed the way along the inside, weakened when confronted for the drive. MR. DOUGIE FRESH chased the issue
early off the inside, dueled the middle half mile in the two path, also faltered in the drive.. ANDREAS last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little while

Footnotes
LADY SCARLET prompted the issue early on the outside, four wide into the turn, vied three wide into the lane, put a head in front soon after, extended that
advantage with less than a furlong remaining then held the runner up safe late while fully extended. MARR TIME broke alertly, fell back along the inside,
continued to save ground through much of the turn, angled out three then four wide into the lane to lose ground to the winner. ICY STARE DOWN settled in
mid pack while off the inside, two to three wide turn, set down for the drive, came up empty. PARLANCE with the pace while three wide and between rivals
in the run up the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead through the turn, began to weaken entering the stretch. PEACE PEDDLER broke alertly, set or
forced the pace along the inside for four furlongs and faltered. HOLY JUSTICE saved ground to no avail in remaining back. NO DRAMA MOMMA fell back
soon after the start, moved out a bit, three wide turn, failed to muster a rally. CUPID'S MUSIC off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
PEACE DOG bothered, forced in at the start when ROYAL DE BE veered in, moved up quickly, steered out turn, came four wide when rallying into the lane,
bid past the furlong marker, quickly clear to win going away. ALLO ENRY forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground turn, got through
along the rail to challenge briefly in upper stretch, no match for the winner, determined for the place. MACHO RONNIE broke well, showed the way up the
backstretch off the rail, vied three wide into the lane, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the place. OBVIOUSLY TOO bother and was forced
in at the start by ROYAL DE BE, raced well back, steered out and improved position with belated interest. J'S LITTLE MAN lacked speed, raced three wide
out of the turn, improved only slightly in lacking a closing punch. ROLL DINERO ROLL broke out to bother outer rivals, was straightened to contest the pace
in the two path, was tiring when in tight between foes with a furlong remaining. NORTHERN WOODS prompted the pace three out to four wide into and
through the turn, had little left for the drive. ROYAL DE BE veered in at the break to bother inner rivals, fell well back out in the strip, four wide turn, passed
tiring rivals. PACIFIC HARBOR in mid pack off the inside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. SACRAMENT bothered then steadied at the
start to be off slowly, was never involved. ORBITAL STARR floated out at the break by ROLL DINERO ROLL, moved up to race in the second flight, began
a steady fade before a half. HEART HEADED ARKY bothered then steadied start, steadied again midway up the backstretch, fell far back and trailed home.

Footnotes
SECRET OATH last away, moved out and raced in the second flight three wide in the first turn, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, covered up
into the far turn, steadied midway on that bend in traffic, hit a seam along the rail turning for home, put a head in front immediately after, quickly drew clear,
continued to extend that advantage under steady handling to be kept to task. ICE ORCHID within striking distance off the inside, raced three wide and
outside the winner into the second turn, challenged on the outside of the first flight as the winner was getting through along the rail, proved no match for that
one in the run to the wire, edged clear for the place late. YUUGIRI forced the issue while in the two path and between rivals, continued to apply pressure
entering the second bend, put a head in front six furlongs in, between the top two entering the stretch, also proved no match for the winner to the wire,
outfinished for the second spot. FREE LIKE A GIRL forward and four wide through the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch while remaining
outside, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing punch and proved no threat to the top three. RED QUEEN void of speed while four wide into the
first turn, continued well back, picked off a single tiring rival in the stretch while never a threat. OPTIONALITY broke on top, showed the way into the first
turn closest to the inside, in hand the middle half, stopped when called on for some run late in the second turn.

SECRETARY AT WAR broke in good order, headed up the second flight in the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground turn, slipped through a
narrow opening exiting the bend, gained the advantage, challenged late from the outside as he was drifting out late, gained the nod at the wire. STORMIN
HONGKONG in mid pack while off the inside, raced three wide through most of the turn, set down for the drive, responded and challenged late outside the
winner, hung in the final stride. LONELY PRIVATE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch off the inside, three wide turn, had little for the top two the
final furlong, narrowly saved the show. STOMPING HOTROD off a step slow, lacked speed out in the strip, three wide through the turn, showed some mild
late interest to be gaining for the show spot. SKYSCANNER void of speed for a half, swung out five wide turning for home, failed to muster any late gain
down the middle of the strip. RAVENS REFLECTION broke on top, cleared toward the inside, set the pace in the two path, continued to hold the advantage
nearing the furlong marker after allowed the winner the inside into the stretch, faltered. AMERICAIN JOEY off a step slow, lacked speed in the two path,
passed tiring rivals to the wire while not a serious threat. BIG FUDGE raced in mid pack along the inside, tired in the drive. REPLETE in the second flight for
a half outside, tired while four wide late in the turn. AWESOME SATURDAY off a step slow, four wide late in the turn, tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
CALL ME JAMAL settled off the pace while saving ground, continued inside second turn, steered out for room entering the stretch, finished full of run to kick
down the leader in plenty of time. GREAT ESCAPE set the pace along the inside, asked along midway on the final turn, shrugged off a rival to be clear once
again nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late. IGNITIS four wide through the first turn when off the pace, ranged up to try the winner
from the outside turning for home, flattened out in the run to the wire. COSTA TERRA lacked speed off the inside, angled out to be four wide turning for
home, lacked a closing response while widest through the lane. VODKA N WATER chased the runner up for a half, off the inside, weakened in the drive.
SKY AND SAND prompted the pace off the inside, challenged midway on the final turn, gave way in the drive.

CURLY TAIL settled in mid pack while racing three wide, continued in the three path through the second turn, roused when straightened for home, closed
with good resolve to be up in time. LIFE ON THE NILE broke on top, clear through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch in hand, clear again
when straightened for home, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. WESTERN RIVER lacked speed, came four wide out of the final turn, staged
a mild rally to be getting to the runner up late. QUICK TO BLAME closest to the leader early inside, moved out a bit onto the backstretch while pulling hard,
continued to prompt the up the backstretch and into the far turn, had little left for the drive. RIDER'S SPECIAL settled off the pace, in the two path through
the second turn, shifted out nearing the furlong marker, lacked a closing kick. MILLARD'S SMILE in mid pack while off the inside early, saved ground in the
second turn, also failed to respond when called on for the drive. LUDWIG forwardly placed three wide, tired. GRAND FESTIVAL off slow, outrun while four
wide through the final turn. JACKPOT BOY broke slowly, trailed throughout while well out in the strip in showing little.

SANTOS DUMONT off slowly, moved up to race in mid pack off the inside, in the two path through the second turn, shifted out when straightened for home,
finished with good resolve to be up in time. PATS PROPERTY set or forced the pace inside, headed in the second turn, dueled through upper stretch,

Footnotes
STAYED IN FOR HALF broke very sharp, quickly shot clear, breather turn while maintaining daylight, stayed clear through the stretch under steady
handling. PLAUSIBLE DENILE in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, set down drive, ground out the place late, no threat to
the winner. MUMAYAZ in the second group up the backstretch, saved ground into the turn, eased out to be in the two path into the lane, chased the winner
past the furlong marker, nipped in the final strides for the second spot. BLAME ELI in mid pack, three wide into the lane, improved position with some mild,
belated initerest. SUMMER IN MALIBU in the second flight while racing three wide and between horses, lacked a closing kick. CALL THE MALL in the
second group while between horses, weakened in the drive. BRINGER OF RAIN broke back, lacked speed, improved slightly while never dangereous.
MAGNIFICUS off a step slow, raced five wide in the turn, had little left for the stretch run. ABRIERWIN was never a factor. LUNDBERG in the main body
while four wide turn, tired after a half. CLOWN OIL fell back after the start, showed little off the inside. ALYANAABI lacked speed, four wide through most of
the turn, trailed home in a dull effort.

Footnotes
UN OJO in mid pack while saving ground through the first turn, closer into the far turn while continuing inside, remained in striking position through that
bend, still pursued the two leaders past the furlong marker, late push when vigorously shaken up and drifting out slightly, finished with good courage to be in
time. ETHEREAL ROAD in the second flight outside early, ranged up four wide to contend in the second turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, dueled
past the furlong marker when narrowly showing the way, drifted in late under a brisk righthanded crop, outkicked in the final strides while just lasting for the
place. BARBER ROAD void of early foot, in traffic late in the first turn, saved ground through the final turn when following the leader, moved out a bit then
back inside, once again steered out, split foes late, missed the place in finishing up willingly. KAVOD broke on top, cleared in the first turn, continued to set
the pace up the backstretch, responded when challenged in the second turn, proved stubborn through the stretch, checked up at the wire when put in tight
by a drifting ETHEREAL ROAD. CHASING TIME forwardly placed off the inside, raced between horses in the second turn, fell back a bit and went evenly
through the stretch. NEWGRANGE prominent early to the outside of the pacesettler, moved slightly closer between rivals in the second turn, then had little
left for the stretch run. DASH ATTACK underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, void of speed, raced in the two path through the final turn. improved through
traffic while not a serious threat. BEN DIESEL raced near the back, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. STELLAR TAP lacked speed,
in traffic in the two path first turn, steadied onto the backstretch, continued in the two path into the far bend, three wide entering the stretch, went flat to the
wire. CAIRAMA off a step slow, raced well back, never a factor. TEXAS RED HOT in the main body while racing off the inside, gave way in the second turn
and trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF KAVOD AGAINST ETHEREAL ROAD FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ROLLING FORK never far back, angled in a bit to race in the two path through the turn, challenged between foes into the lane, kicked clear. J. E.'S
HANDMEDOWN back off the pace while outside, raced four out to five wide in the turn, rallied and finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the winner
late. TWISTED DIXIE off the pace and the inside, raced in the two path through the turn, improved position while racing through some traffic. YOU VEE
CEE forward early, moved a bit closer while four wide through the turn, challenged into and through upper stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. NAVY
SEAL back off the pace, came three wide into the stretch when moving closer, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. AFLEET SKY steadied at the
start to race back early, two out to three wide in the turn, improved only slightly with some mild interest down the lane. MO CHOCTAW off a step slow, raced
three out to five wide turn, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE broke alertly, set the pace in the two path then
faltered when headed nearing the furlongs. FIVE O ONE remained back while racing three wide. CAPTAIN DON underwent a shoe repair prior to the post
parade, within striking distance for a half inside, backed up steadily through the lane. HERITAGE PARK prompted the pace in the three path, was tiring
when in tight and floated out slightly turning for home, continued to fade. LEO DEL REO in mid pack early, fell back into the turn, trailed in while four wide
out of the bend.
