Footnotes
TOWSON broke alertly while ducking out, was quickly straightened, vied outside, was collared again on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch then
edged away late. QUIET PLEASE well placed behind the dueling leaders, hooked the winner on the turn, was carried out, led briefly but was outfinished
SPECIAL RISK settled well back outside and continued willingly for the show. HOLA PRINCESS was outrun early saving ground and lacked a rally.
LONDONDERRY chased three wide off the leaders and flattened out in the stretch. FLORENCIA broke slowest then trailed for three quarters and was no
factor. CHANCEE dueled the winner along the inside then was finished by the three eighths pole. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for
interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
SINASHACK cleared the field before the clubhouse turn, set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the final
furlong and held on late for the win. SLEW TANG CLAN raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, commenced a rally nearing the furlong
marker, surged late outside and was gaining at the wire. GREYZER stalked three wide, chased two wide on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch
drive, then rallied late between horses. MOUNTAIN TREE tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, raced evenly in the stretch and lacked a bid.
EYE OF GUNFIGHTER stalked two wide, raced inside on the far turn and had no rally. ILOVECHARLYBROWN raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off
the pace, went three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. SPIRIT WOLF raced three wide early, settled off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and
failed to threaten. ELITE MISSION pressed the pace racing close up early, then chased and faded. BILL'S MAFIA broke awkwardly and was off slow, then
outrun.

Footnotes
EMPRESS IRENE quickly clear inside, widened into the stretch and remained well safe while kept to her task. FINE ONE WON broke slowest, saved
ground throughout and rallied late while no threat to the winner. CONFIRMED GENIUS stumbled at the start, chased inside and finished willingly for the
show. THIS ROUND'S MINE pursued the winner to the stretch and weakened. AWESOME PAL made a brief bid three wide on the turn then faltered.
HOLMDEL PARK lacked speed between rivals and was never in contention. CARAMEL CREAM raced outside off the pace, moved wide on the turn and
faded. BOCA ROYALTY lagged far behind chasing very wide and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CARMELTINI raced close up on the inside, made a rail bid nearing the half mile marker, dropped back some and chased LIL MISS HOTSHOT on the far
turn, re rallied outside turning for home, dug in gamely outside and wore down her rival in deep stretch. LIL MISS HOTSHOT broke outward and was
steadied, set the pace racing a bit off the inside, shook free on the far turn, then dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. WEST
HORIZEN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace, chased on the far turn, raced evenly in the stretch and held for third. PARTY IN THE SAND was
outrun early, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, closed belatedly and was outfinished for the show spot. ANGEL RAPHAEL
was bumped at the start, stalked between rivals and faded. GALILEO'S AFFAIR raced four wide on the first turn, stalked four wide and faded. LANA raced
five wide on the first turn, chased four or five wide and gave way.

BRETT'S WORLD stalked the pace outside, took over when ready into the far turn then drew off handily while geared down late. NIANGUA settled off the
leaders three wide, advanced inside rivals in the stretch to capture the place. GREEN GROWTH chased within range between foes, angled out in the
stretch with a mild bid. STRUM AND PLUCK dropped far behind, moved six wide into the stretch rallying. CATCH MY VIBE hustled to the front inside, lost
the advantage into the far turn and proved empty in the lane. MITHRA broke sluggishly, rallied extremely wide into the stretch while no factor. MASTER OF
WAR stalked the dueling leaders three wide and stopped on the final turn. MOUNTAIN KING saved ground close up early then gave way after the half.

Footnotes
SIZZLING ROMA pursued inside, angled out on the turn then ran down the pacesetter through the final furlong. KAREN'S WAY quickly sprinted clear,
widened on the turn, remained clear to midstretch then shortened stride late. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT dropped back inside then continued on the rail
closing the gap. TWIRLING WIND lacked speed in the two path then offered some late energy while no threat. SNOW FORECAST raced outside in second
flight and flattened out in the stretch. STORMBEAM lunged at the start breaking in a complete tangle losing any chance. ORIGINALY FROM DOT dropped
back outside and was never a factor. KIT KAT KATIE raced in closest pursuit of the leader early then stopped in the stretch. OCEANO ROSSO dropped
back wide and gave way readily.

Footnotes
MALIBU ANTHEM stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, closed steadily
outside, collared the pacesetter and drew clear under urging. CONNOISSEUR showed good early speed, set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled with
the winner in upper stretch, dug in gamely and came up second best. MARIANNA QUEEN raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn,
finished evenly and earned the show spot. ABSOLUTE ANNA raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn, finished evenly in the lane and was
outkicked for third. HOLIDAY RAID raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL stalked two wide, chased on the far turn
and tired. GO METRO GIRL trailed the field and did not factor. STUY TOWN BABY was in tight and steadied behind CONNOISSEUR entering the
clubhouse turn, then tracked on the inside, chased and gave way.

dropped back along the rail then rallied mildly outside. TIO WIL chased very wide down the backstretch and gave way through the stretch. WEEKEND IN

away under urging and was kept to the task. SPARTAK was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn, steadied waiting for
room at the five sixteenths marker, then rallied inside and was clear for the place award. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT trailed the field, advanced inside on the far
turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch. JACKS AMERICAN PIE pressed the pace in the early stages, vied outside on the backstretch, took over on the far
turn, was no match for the winner and faded in the final furlong. FIELD OFFICER raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and had no rally.
