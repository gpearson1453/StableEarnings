ZEATRICAL vied for the early lead, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away and won under steady urging. KAITLYN'S COURT raced near the middle of the
field, saved ground around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. JUST A WIN broke in, pressed the pace, raced four
wide around the first turn, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. LA JAZZ lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around
the final turn and finished evenly. LANDWOMAN'S GIFT raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no factor. TARGET VISION pressed
the early pace and faded. CABEZA DE TORTUGA raced within contention, dropped back and was no threat late. CASTLE CRY void of early speed and
was never close. FEATHERINHERHALO raced within striking distance and stopped. STORM BREACH was not loaded in gates at the start and declared a

Footnotes
SHANGHAI HETTY challenged on the front end, took the lead around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. LUNA Y SOL dueled for the lead,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. LA DANTA raced near the middle of the field, moved up, made a rally
down the stretch and closed on LUNA Y SOL. BLAMEITONTHEJOCK void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. UNTAMED MONEY lacked
early speed and was never close. LUCCA'S LILYBY raced evenly near the back and showed little. SONGS DISCREET CAT showed early speed and
dropped back.

STEPHEN'S ANSWER went to the front, drove clear, lead throughout and finished well. UNION STATION lacked early speed, moved up on the inside
around the second turn, made an outside bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SIR SMACK pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and lacked a finish. YOUNG BULL raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside and finished evenly. GOTTA GO
void of early speed and was never a factor. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR raced within contention, dropped back and was no threat late. COMMON LAW CAT

Footnotes
MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. MISS INVADER lacked
early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide bid, couldn't catch the winner, but got up for second. PRAYERS SAVED vied on the front end,
forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. C C CROWN'S CHOICE showed early speed, raced close throughout, finished inside and
lacked a late kick. RICH DREAMS was an early factor, eased back and finished evenly. FEDERAL COURT raced in the back of the pack and passed tired
ones. VIKING VOYAGE dueled on the front end and faded. OKLAHOMA STAR flashed early speed, saved ground and was finished early. MISS
HURRYUPNWAIT raced near the back, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat.
