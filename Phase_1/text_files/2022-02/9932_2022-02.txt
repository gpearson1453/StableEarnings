BUCK MOON quick to the front outside, set pace to deep stretch but outfinished . FORT MOULTRIE unhurried early, moved up to far turn, rallied along for
show. REAL MONEY tracked top pair to quarter pole, could not go on in the stretch. JUNGLE WARFARE no hurry to far turn, rallied to just miss the super
spot on wire. ARARECO LAKE race an inside trip to no avail. INCORRIGIBLE outside to press pace to quarter pole, nothing left, dropped back. J
BERESFORD TIPTON never menaced throughout. TOSS OF FATE failed to reach contention. BARRISTER TOM stayed close to the half, surrendered and

MONOLOGUE raced off rail to far turn, rallied into the stretch and was all out to prevail in a gutsy effort. SUMMER ANTHEM tracked leaders off rail to far
turn, moved to the lead but could not last and run down on the wire. SIR CLOUSEAU pressed leader from two path, stayed on gamely for the show spot.
ARRONAUTIC no speed to far turn, between horses quarter pole, rallied on. THE GATEKEEPER raced back to the quarter pole, made up ground in the
stretch. MAKIN BANK saved ground to far turn, race evenly with no late response. MASTER LEA inside speed to duel for three quarters, gave way in the
stretch. SHANNONRUN failed to menace. ROBUST good position while never far back to the stretch but faltered in the drive. BOX OF JOE raced widest
into first turn and never responded when needed. FROSTY DREAMS raced an inside trip while never a threat. SOUTHERN SENSE tracked from inside to
quarter pole but gave way in the stretch run.
