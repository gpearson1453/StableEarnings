UPTOWN GUY chased leader to the half, slipped thru and took over at the half and cleared off while easily in command to the wire. SCHENECTADY STAR
good position to the stretch while no match for the winner from inside late. MATTHEWSTHIRTYFOUR had a tardy start, rushed to the turn and only made
up ground to just garner the show spot. ADICCION bounced around at the start, shuffled turn and improved late while never a real threat. SEA LANE raced
evenly throughout while widest into the stretch run. LESTERS DREAM had an awkward start, far back to the turn, never gained in the stretch. MR LIBERTY
tracked to the turn in good position but surrendered and gave way readily from there. BAD GUS never menaced throughout. ROYAL OUTLAW sprinted
clear quickly, overtaken at the half and gave way readily.

MARISSA'S LADY sharp speed to the front, well rated to clear off while geared down in the final sixteenth. BUBBLE ROCK just off leaders to turn, took up
chase to no avail while best of the rest. BEAUTIFUL EMPIRE flashed brief inside speed to turn but weakened in the late going. ROYAL COUNTY sharp
break outside, could not keep up and faded in the stretch. MURGATROYD no speed while widest past quarter pole and never menaced. ZAWISH hustled
along, could not keep up gave way.

path, dueled into stretch and proved no match. QUARIA THUNDER speed to the front, collared in the stretch and held show gamely. THEFABULOUS
MOOLAH saved ground and improved position through the stretch run. SPLIT DECISION tacked inside while never far back with no gain in the stretch run.
BODACIOUS BABY well off rail trip, made a mild middle move but backed up in the stretch. LANTERN'S CANDY bore out start, angled in sharply into first
turn while no menace. LA NEBLINA between horses to the half and backed up from there. SCARTINI MARTINI tracked to far turn with nothing left and
faded back.

Footnotes
BULLBRIAR never far back outside, rallied out of the turn and drove clear strong late kick. BARBARINO unhurried to turn, rallied in the stretch for place spot
while no match. SKY BOLT speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch and weakened late. C F V NOBODYCARES no speed to the stretch, moved up to
improve position late. TEMPESTA chased pace to the stretch but faltered in the late going. PRO BONO no speed and only improved position in the stretch
run. LITTLE CAIRO never a deciding factor. KEEP SCROLLING tried to keep up to the turn but surrendered and faded back. MY PAL JOHNNY brief inside
speed, lost position out of the turn and weakened late. WHITE SILVER SANDS never menaced. BLOWDACOALWHISTLE was off tardy and never close.
KING T'CHALLA through after the half and dropped back readily.
