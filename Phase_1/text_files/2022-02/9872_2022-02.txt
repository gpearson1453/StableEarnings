CAMEO SHORES raced close to the pace to the outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to mid stretch, inched clear and was outclosed in a
good effort. BLAZING MISS JOJO broke out to off a step slowly, advanced to the turn,. bid six wide and finished well to get up for show. WAR MAIDEN got
away well to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and faltered near the sixteenth pole. FOUR SCORE was void of early speed, went seven
wide at the top of the stretch and improved position. OLD WEST stalked the pace while racing between horses, shifted in on the turn, had nothing left for the

MCENTIRE pressed the pace while racing three across, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended the lead under mild urging.
KOWBOYKABIN led around the first turn, fell back on the second turn, lacked a further rally and was no match for the winner. THE BEAT was unhurried
early, saved ground, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid six wide and closed to get up for show. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA raced close to the pace while
racing outside, rallied into the second turn, loomed a threat, came up empty and dropped back. PERFECT WAGER advanced to the second turn, went
seven wide at the top of the stretch, had nothing left and dropped back. CLAVICHORD showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way.
TIZHOTNDUSTY was checked on the first turn and failed to contend.

Footnotes
FAST GALLITO set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel and inched away late to prove best. HOLY CROSS pressed the pace,
challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a long drive. LUGIA raced in the second flight, angled out for the drive,
closed steadily and gained late to narrow the gap. BUHM'S CANDY BOY raced in the second flight along the inside, lacked the needed late response and
lost position. LUCKY CHAMP was outrun. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
ENCODER stalked the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a long drive. COURAGEOUS went six
wide at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up at the wire for place. MOONLITE GRAHAM set the pace, dueled
through the stretch, was outfinished and caught for second. CERNAN challenged three across on the turn, fell back and finished evenly. DARK HEDGES
saved ground, fell back on the turn and came up empty late. DILLON ROCKS raced in the back, closed inside and veered in at the gap. PAYNTER'S BOY
trailed the field.
