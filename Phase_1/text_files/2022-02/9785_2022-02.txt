LATIGO RIO set a clear early pace, raced four wide into the turn, opened up, kept on and held. MANOSO chased the early pace, raced six wide into the
turn, was gaining late and just missed. DECK HUMOR hopped at the start, was reserved off the pace, angled out seven wide and flattened out. LONNIE
TON was allowed to settle early from the inside and was empty. KICK IT was void of speed, angled out and passed tired rivals. REBACK HOME raced in
mid pack early, went six wide and faded. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT was outrun early and retreated.
