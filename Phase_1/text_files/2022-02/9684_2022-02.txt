Footnotes
CURRENT was floated out by DUBBY DUBBIE crossing the dirt and was running head-high tugging the rider along, dropped back a bit to stalk the leader
on the clubhouse turn, drew alongside again on the backstretch, dueled through the final turn and into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely
under right-handed urging and strong handling. RED KING trailed along the inside early, steered off the rail on the backstretch, asked three then four wide
on the far turn, rallied to gain the place but could not threaten the winner. MOODY JIM (IRE) got floated out crossing the dirt, moved back to a stalking
position and took to the rail, went two wide around the second bend, tipped out in the stretch and finished evenly late. DUBBY DUBBIE took control quickly,
drifted out crossing the dirt, set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the lane. KAZAN (IRE)
got floated out over the dirt crossing early, tracked outside the top pair in the middle stages, coaxed three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
NO HANG CHARLIE hustled from the gate and assumed command quickly, took some pressure on the backstretch, put away PERFECTO AMOR on the far
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch then held over the late run from BUD KNIGHT in the closing moments. BUD KNIGHT stalked three wide around both
turns, finished well outside the winner in deep stretch and kept gaining to the wire. STAR SAILOR tossed his head and came away slow from outside,
tucked inside on the first turn, raced off the rail up the backstretch, moved back inside and saved ground to the stretch, showed late effort along the fence
and whittle the gap late. PERFECTO AMOR was up close early to the outside of the pacesetter, applied some pressure on the backstretch, lost touch
nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. MONGOLIAN LEGEND was off a bit slow to begin, tracked four wide through both turns and weakened.

Footnotes
AN AGENT MISTAKE broke in and brushed rival in the beginning, settled off the rail up the backstretch, got boxed in between foes and behind a rival on the
turn, gained a clear path leaving the bend, split foes in upper stretch, surged late under urging to inhale the runner-up and won in hand. TOPOLINA broke a
step slow then rushed up to take then lead while a bit green, inched away around the turn while saving ground, remained well clear into the furlong grounds
but was run down by the winner late. PRETTY RENA was bothered by TOPOLINA coming out a bit and checked early, stalked two then three wide and
could not summon the needed late bid. INDY'S STAR tracked from off the rail, three to four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. ARDIS placed in a good
forward position to the outside of the lone leader, chased two wide around the turn but weakened down the lane. LA CHIQUIS was off slow, got brushed and
checked in tight quarters shortly after, trailed two wide into the lane and was not a factor. A CROWN FOR KITTEN settled early on the inside, coaxed along
leaving the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the late stages.

Footnotes
TAKE A LEAP broke a bit slow then went up to be well placed outside the pacesetter, bid into the far turn, dueled around the bend and took a short lead,
inched clear in upper stretch and held gamely. DISCERNMENT was off a step slow and brushed at the start, stalked the pace from inside then two wide
leaving the clubhouse turn, tipped three wide on the second bend, loomed outside the winner in the final furlong but could not find the needed late kick.
BOSSY SOUL steadied off heels entering the first turn, was reserved in the early going on the inside, tipped two wide on the second bend, continued to give
chase within striking distance behind the top trio in the stretch, angled out with a sixteenth remaining and finished willingly to gain the show. DESTINY'S
JOURNEY sped to the front and led a bit off the rail through the first turn, gained company into the second bend, dueled to the stretch, lost touch
approaching the furlong grounds but stayed on through the final furlong from inside. GOLD INCLUDED was off slow from outside, tracked three wide around
the first turn, four wide on the second bend and weakened. PEACE PIPE brushed with inner rivals leaving the gate, went two wide into the first turn then
steered out to the four path around the bend, remained four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
WILDER THAN MOST was closest in pursuit in the two path, bid outside on the far turn, took over with a furlong remaining and lasted over the runner-up.
WORSE READ SANCHEZ raced off the pace in the early stages, traveled two wide then tipped out in upper stretch, rallied and just missed. BALLY'S
CHARM broke out, sped to the front and steered to the inside, was challenged into and around the far turn, held a short lead to the top of the stretch, was
overtaken at the eighth pole and kept on to save the show. HAPI HAPI stalked the pace off the rail, went two wide into the lane, lacked room at the sixteenth
pole and missed the show. MISCHIEVOUS PATH rated on the inside early, saved ground to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally once
finding a clear path. RIFEY broke slow from outside, was unhurried outside a rival at the back, took an awkward step at the three-eighths pole, trailed two
wide leaving the far turn and was always outrun. GOOD BYE PUTIN was off slow to begin, settled on the inside, swung out into the stretch and weakened.

DIXIE'S TWO STENTS vied between rivals for the early lead, dueled in the two path around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong remaining and won going
away. GRANDCONCOURSE GUY broke inward at the start, vied for command along the inside to the turn, dueled with the winner around the bend, could
not go on with that rival in the final furlong and stayed on to hold the place. SPEED BOAT vied three deep up the backstretch, lost a bit of ground but
remained close behind the top pair three wide on the turn, continued to give chase through the lane but faltered in the late stages. CANDY FURY hit the
gate then got forced in a bit at the start, was well placed behind the early speed battled up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the
drive and weakened. CROSS INDIAN tracked well off the rail up the backstretch, navigated the turn five then four wide and failed to menace. SURF RANCH

Footnotes
CANADIAN PRIDE was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased two wide around the bend, had the rider lose the whip nearing the eighth pole while
drawing alongside the leader, took over in midstretch and drew clear. TOOK CHARGE sped to the front from inside, showed the way along the rail through
the turn, was collared with a furlong remaining, relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on to prove second best. FASHIONABLY FAST stalked from
outside up the backstretch, took the turn three wide and lacked a bid in the stretch. VITTORIO tracked off the rail, went three wide around the turn and
weakened. DIRECT LINE trailed early well off the inside, went four wide into the turn then angled to the rail around the bend and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MADIHA was rank early and pulled the rider into the first turn, went two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked in range outside a rival, inched
closer and was driven three wide into the stretch, took over at the the eight pole, then kicked clear to win going away. ABHITA unhurried in the beginning
from inside, ran up behind a rival and lacked room room into the far turn, tipped to the two path, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to best
the rest. EXACTLY WENDY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, tracked two wide then along the rail on the first turn, went between rivals on the second bend,
got bumped solidly by BONNIE BRAE in upper stretch, angled to the inside and finished willingly to earn the show. BONNIE BRAE went three wide around
the first turn, sat off the pace in the middle stages, angled four wide on the far turn, shifted in and bumped rival in upper stretch and kept on for a minor
award. ROUBAIX sped clear nearing the first turn, was coaxed along on the second bend, led clear into the stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining
and weakened late. BUSKER ALLIE was off a step slow and got bumped at the start, settled inside early, moved out on the backstretch, came out on the far
turn and went four to five wide into the lane and lacked further response. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY ran up on heels and steadied into the first turn, stalked
the pace from inside to the second bend, coaxed around the turn and weakened. LADY SASSAFRAS was hard to load prior to the start, pulled early then
angled outside the leader on the first turn, was closest in pursuit into the second bend, chased two wide to the lane and faded. COMMAND ANNA came
away slow, trailed off the rail and got shuffled into the far turn, exited the bend four to five wide, drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened.
