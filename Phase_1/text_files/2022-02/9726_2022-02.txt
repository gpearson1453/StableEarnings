Footnotes
SUSAN JONES vied for the early lead, was forwardly placed throughout and drove clear deep in the stretch. SABER QUEEN lacked early speed, made a
steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ROARING QUINN pressed the pace, raced close throughout and was outfinished for
second. ALYS EPISODE dueled for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn and weakened. SHE'S MY PRIORITY void of early speed, showed
late interest, finished wide and was no factor. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. JULIO
CHOICE pressed the early pace, entered the turn four wide, angled inside and faded. LUCKY PRIORITY showed early speed, dropped back, finished wide
and was no threat late. SANDRA'S JUEL always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY raced in the rear in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made an outside bid and drove clear late. CARBON
STRYKER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. I'M LOOKING UP went to the front,
drove clear, saved ground, raced close throughout, but lacked a late kick. SCRAPPY ARTIE lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside,
entered the stretch wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LT. BONURA raced within contention in the early going, saved ground around the turn, faded
and finished evenly near the back. RATHER PRECOCIOUS showed early speed and dropped back. KING OF THE COURT always raced near the back,
saved ground around the turn and was never a threat.

BEYOND BROWN went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away and won handily. FLAT ROSE raced near the middle of the field, moved up on
the inside around the second turn, got through on the rail entering the home stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. STORMY
SUNRISE raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. SOCIAL DATE raced within striking
distance, made a mild bid and missed third. PINTLALA pressed the early pace and faded. TABLE ONE lacked early speed, improved position, but was no
factor. GIFTED TALENT void of early speed and showed little. MERLIN'S SISTER always raced near the back and was outrun. OKALANI raced in the
middle of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside and dropped back.

Footnotes
G DON'T KNOW raced within striking distance, moved up wide around the turn and proved the best late. MOVE IT vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. BAYOU BEAUX raced within contention, made a late bid and was outfinished for
second. THE FLUSH KING broke out, pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, made a bid, took the advantage and hung. HOLY SUNRISE
bumped at the start, racing in the rear, showed late interest, but was no factor. HE HAD A SECRET lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, moved
up, but was no threat. ROCKIN ROG showed early speed and made a steady retreat. HOT APRIORITY bumped at the start, raced in the back and was
never close. FELLER void of early speed and was outrun. EMMA'S LOGIC went to the front, drove clear and retreated to the rear.
