Footnotes
TAP FOR ME cleared into the first turn after breaking with the field, set all the pace toward the inside, maintained a comfortable advantage through the
stretch to win ridden out. SALUTE THE FLAG settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the three path through the second turn, chased the winner
into the stretch, proved no match for that one to the wire, clearly second best. CHURCH SERVICE away in good order, tucked inside to save some ground
early in the first turn, remained back in the run up the backstretch, angled out three wide when making a mild advance into the stretch, could do little with the
top two in the drive, clear of the others. LADY COMMANDER chased the winner off the inside in vain for three quarters and weakened. FARASINO void of
speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while three wide and not a serious threat. MARTIQUE MISS forwardly placed early along the inside, two path
second turn,had nothing for the drive. GOLDENA hesitated at the break, failed to menace. MAGGIE'S WILL trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FLATOUTJUSTICE outrun in the early going outside, advanced five wide into contention through the turn, challenged in upper stretch and drew clear under
firm handling. CHICORY BLUE lacked early foot, improved inside of several rivals while in the two path through the turn, dropped to the rail past the furlong
marker, continued to improve go gain the nod for the place. MIAS MOONBEAM pinched back at the start, raced far back for a half, rallied through traffic,
split foes late, finished willingly to narrowly miss the second spot. SEEK N JUSTICE raced in mid pack early well wide, four wide and in traffic through the
turn, roused for the drive while well out in the strip, improved position with a rally of his own. LONELY PRIVATE within striking distance while four wide into
the turn, three wide exiting, finished evenly in lacking a late punch. BOURBON COWBOY forwardly placed while far out in the strip, five wide into the turn,
four wide into the stretch, lacked a late punch. PULL MY CHAIN pressed the issue early, three wide when with the pace through the turn, tired through the
stretch. PRIVATE LAKE broke in and slowly, raced back, four wide into the lane, improved only slightly in the drive. RAVENS REFLECTION narrowly set
the pace along the inside, faltered in the drive. ITS MY BAG BABY broke out to help pinch back MIAS MOONBEAM, remained always back. DARK NINJA
flashed brief early speed between foes, gave way in the turn, well beaten.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE ERICA broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, dueled, headed late turn,continued to battle past the furlong marker,
dug in while closest to the inside of the first flight to narrowly gain the nod in a gutty effort. LICHITA pressed the winner early from the outside, dueled, put a
head in front late in the turn, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, outkicked late to miss between horses. GIRLS A BULLET in the
second flight while between foes in the run up the backstretch, bit closer late in the turn, moved out a bit for room past the furlong marker, late outside, too
late. SHI O'SHI in the second flight while outside, moved closer into the lane, within striking distance a furlong out, hung late. WAR BALLAD last away,
trailed while well wide early, four wide through the turn, lost whip while widest past the furlong marker, improved slightly. SOPHIE'S ANGEL remained back
in lacking a rally. MONGOLIAN LOTUS was never a factor while four wide into the stretch. COURTLY in mid pack early, finished before a half.

Footnotes
GAR HOLE within striking distance early outside, floated out four wide when advancing late in the turn, took over, ridden out. TEMPT FATE prompted the
early leader off the inside, challenged midway on the turn, came out a bit to be three wide into the lane carrying the winner out, proved no match for that one
through the stretch, remained clear for the place. BANDIT POINT void of speed along the inside, steered out three wide when mounting a modest rally
turning for home, finished clear of the leaders. K J'S NOBILITY in mid pack while toward the inside early, moved out slightly late in the turn, went evenly
through the stretch. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN went one paced outside, also lacked a significant closing kick. BLAME J D broke on top, cleared to the inside,
set the pace for a half then weakened when headed by the winner entering the stretch. SKYPED off a step slow then steadied, trailed most of the way then
picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. REEF'S DESTINY forwardly placed up the backstretch along the inside, began a steady
retreat late in the turn. DINNER AT CRUMPIES was finished early while racing just off the inside.

Footnotes
ABDAN with the pace from the start just off the inside, dropped to the rail when clear turn,drew off steadily through the lane under token pressure to win
ridden out while drifting late. HARRY forwardly placed off the inside into the turn, between rivals turning for home, proved no match for the winner, gained
the nod for the place. WORTHTHEMONEY also forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, had little for the winner as
well in the drive, outkicked for the second spot. OUTCOME pressured the winner from the outside for a half, weakened when unable to keep pace with that
one through the stretch. BLUES TUNE back off the early pace toward the inside, came three wide out of the turn, lacked a closing punch when set down for
the drive. REMEMBER NORMANDY broke back, trailed early, improved position toward the inside while not posing a serious threat. CATS GOTTA
CHANCE in the second flight while racing outside, three wide through the turn, had little left for the stretch run. TANGO KILO lacked speed outside, four
wide through the turn, was never dangerous through the lane. MY KINDA TETON outside early when well off the pace, worked way to the rail by late in the
turn, failed to menace in the run to the wire. TIMEFORAWOODFORD bothered then steadied at the start, moved up and was four wide through the turn,
tired in the drive. DOX BIZ came in just after the start, fell back. BIG PETE through early, trailed home.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER with the pace while racing three wide, shook clear of the other speed midway on the turn, remained clear past the furlong marker, held the
runner up safe late under steady handling. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK raced in mid pack while three wide into the turn, dropped in a bit to be in the two path
turning for home, shifted out for the run to the wire, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the winner. TANGO CHARLIE came out just after the start,
vied up front between rivals and inside the winner, fell back off that one midway on the turn, chased that one past the furlong marker, failed to match the
runner up late, saved the show. COLD AS HELL raced with the pace while closest to the inside, gradually weakened from late in the turn on in. AMONGST
FRIENDS fell back trail soon after the start, continued void of speed through the turn, swung out to be five wide entering the stretch, staged a mild rally
down the center of the strip. CHIEF RON off a step slow, raced back early and outside, carried out to be five wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire.
RIBBONS AND MEDALS in mid pack up the backstretch off the inside, steered out four wide when moving slightly closer to the lead pack by late in the turn,
lacked a further response. HERD IMMUNITY bothered then steadied just after the break, remained back while four wide into the lane. U. S. STEEL in the
second flight outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS within striking distance in the early going, began a steady
retreat before a half. ALTERED carried out just after the start, always outrun.

Footnotes
WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE forwardly placed while outside up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, dueled in the two path through upper stretch, kicked
clear late. CHARLOTTES WAY also close up from the start, dueled inside the winner from midway on the turn to inside the furlong marker then proved no
match, remained clear for the place. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL behind the pace inside, two path into lane, exchanged bumps with TROPINKA nearing
midstretch, came out repeatedly the final furlong under continued left handed urging to to bother that foe until deep stretch, getting to runner up late.
TROPINKA forwardly placed between foes up the backstretch, steadied in some traffic into the turn, remained in the second flight while three wide into the
lane, exchanged bumps with AIN'T SHE A PISTOL past the furlong marker, bothered several times by that one in the run to the wire, also was closing the
gap on the runner up in the late going. TRUEBLUEGIRL off slowly to spot the field several lengths, raced back early, in the two path into the lane, improved
position in the run to the wire. EXCULPATE back off the pace toward the inside, two path turn, also improved a bit down the lane without posing a serious
threat. RAINBOWS ARE FREE broke back, trailed well back for a half while three wide, improved as well in passing tiring rivals. FIVEDCONSCIENCENES
in mid pack and three wide, had little left for the drive. RACEDAY ATTIRE raced four wide into and through the turn, failed to muster a rally. RIO LADY
remained always back while four wide into the lane. VITA BONA backed up inside. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TROPINKA
AGAINST AIN'T SHE A PISTOL FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

WILLFUL WOMAN unhurried early off the inside, crept closer into the far turn while between foes, saw that progress stall by midway on that bend, was
shaken up when entering the stretch, closed with good resolve late to be up in time. BLESSED AGAIN chased the early leader off the inside, advanced on
that one before a half, dueled into the lane in the two path, took over nearing the furlong grounds, drifted out, could not contain the winner late.
ITSALLINTHENOTES broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn inside dueled through the second turn and into the stretch, could not match the top
two the final furlong, saved the show. SUN PATH within striking distance inside, moved out a bit for the drive, came up empty. PRETTI XTREME in the
second flight, raced three wide through the final turn, lacked a closing response as well. TURNSTONE back off the pace while three wide most of the way,
did not rally. BREAK CURFEW no threat while racing off the inside. WEST SIDE GIRL last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KINFOLK back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, got out to be six wide into the lane, was regathered and closed with good
determination down the middle of the strip to be i n time. KILGORE forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, edged closer through the
turn, challenged along the rail into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, gained a slight advantage but could not contain the winner. ROLL DINERO
ROLL broke sharp, cleared soon after, continued to show the way turn, allowed the runner up into the lane, dueled with that one past the furlong marker,
gave ground grudgingly the final furlong. ALLO ENRY raced in mid pack early, dropped to the inside when improving through the turn, flattened out and
went evenly through the lane. BRASKA broke back and outside, continued wide, five path through the turn, improved with a mild rally. VISION OF ELIAS
moved out, in the second flight up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, weakened in the drive. RISKY SITUATION void of speed,
moved to the inside late in the turn, lacked a closing response. MOONSHINE SURFER broke slowly, raced back and three wide, improved slightly while not
a serious threat. UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP lacked speed in mid pack, angled three to four wide turning for home, lacked a kick. ACCEL JOE fell back to
trail after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ORBITAL STARR forwardly placed early in the two path, steadily faded. KRUSIN
ROCKET finished early, well back.
