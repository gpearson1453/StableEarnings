Footnotes
ACACIAHELPME tracked off the leaders a bit off the inside racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch, came through when
presented an opening entering the lane to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. SASSY CHARLEE vied with the
leaders three wide between foes in the opening stages, pressed the pacesetter to upper stretch, then continued with a steady effort to prevail for second
late. ADIOS BABY settled along the inside dropping out last racing to the turn, angled out three wide racing through the lane and continued with an effort to
gain some position. I'M A CUTIE dictated the pace on a narrow advantage between foes, then inside rivals racing into the turn, shifted out entering upper
stretch while being roused to go clear but soon emptied out. PAPA DIAMANTE swerved out at the start, was collected, then urged four deep to join the
pace, pressed the issue three deep into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch while drifting inwards. AVE FENIX flashed brief pace inside rivals on
the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BROADWAY PETE moved to prompt the pace inside rivals racing through the backstretch, was urged forward to gain the advantage leaving the midway
point of the turn, edged clear entering upper stretch and widened the margin late under firm left handed pressure. SAVVY LAYLA, in touch with the leaders
between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the inside to track just off the leaders racing into the turn, was prompted to advance in close quarters inside
foes racing into upper stretch, shifted out in the drive making light contact with BLAKENSTEIN then edged that foe for the place honors late. BLAKENSTEIN
was rated last while shifting outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to gain terms with the leaders racing four wide through the turn, shifted inwards
while being roused through the stretch, then brushed by a rival, but was outkicked for second. LAST INVESTMENT, three deep between foes in the opening
stages, was rated off the first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a bid three wide between foes racing through the turn but faded
through the lane. STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON angled inwards in the opening stages to force the pace on a narrow advantage outside the eventual winner,
dueled for command between foes on the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
ISAIAS DREAM was rated along the inside tracking just off the leaders from the outset to the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch readily
advancing to wrest command entering the lane, then quickly took charge and drew away while being kept to firm encouragement. VAN angled inwards
racing through the chute to track just off the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch while continuing in
pursuit of the winner but could not match terms with that rival while prevailing for the place honors. MAGICAL ADVENTURE, reserved while angling inside
racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and continued with interest to improve position. CLEVER FELLOW stalked just off the
pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted three deep nearing the far turn while moving to terms with the leaders, pressed the issue nearing
upper stretch to gain a brief advantage between calls but emptied out leaving midstretch. IN HONOR OF ARTIE settled last along the inside to the
backstretch, angled out racing through the far turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch and gained some position while making no real impression.
EMPHASIZE stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the first turn, tipped out racing through the backstretch to press the issue between foes
striking the front midway through the far turn, then gave way into the lane. HYPE MAN, urged to the lead while angling inside, set the pace on a narrow
advantage to the far turn, briefly disputed the issue inside foes, then gave way into upper stretch. SUNNY SAINT, reserved outside a rival in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, offered no rally.

CANDY CRUSHEM raced in touch with the leader attending the pace between foes into the first turn, continued just outside the leader on the backstretch,
pressed the issue racing through the far turn to gain the advantage and went clear leaving the furlong marker under firm right handed encouragement.
CORT'N ASONG moved to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for
command inside the eventual winner through the far turn to the stretch but proved no match late while best of the others. KIGER, prompted to a forward
placing three deep between foes racing to the first turn, eased off the leaders to track those foes between rivals on the backstretch, was urged to advance
while shifting out three wide nearing upper stretch but finished evenly. IT'S FATE angled to the inside in early stages tracking just off the leaders, continued
inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid. THANK YOU settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch,
then passed a tiring rival in the stretch but never gained contention. UNCLE NED, urged to contend four wide racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders
three deep in second flight through the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) was guided to the inside racing through the chute while reserved off the second flight to the backstretch, appeared to take an
awkward step nearing the second bend conceding some ground to the leaders, swung off the inside nearing the lane while coming under pressure to
advance in tandem with BENS MALICE racing into upper stretch, bid for command four deep between foes racing past the furlong marker and edged
forward late under brisk right handed encouragement. The latter was settled last along the rail racing through the chute, continued unhurried in that position
to the far turn, switched outside the eventual winner gathering momentum in the four path nearing upper stretch, was fanned five wide racing past
midstretch challenging for command but was outkicked. VLADISLAV, urged setting the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage racing to the far turn,
dueled for command while shifting a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair while prevailing for a share. NIGHT
JUMPER, off a step slowly, was rated outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, shifted three wide on the far turn while moving to
challenge the leader nearing upper stretch, then continued between foes in that path through the stretch but lacked the needed final bid. SHIMMERING
LEROID, in touch attending a rival's pace racing to the far turn, gave way into the stretch. HIGH STOCK angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the far turn, then steadily faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
TEXAS MAGIC broke readily to gain a position tracking just off the first flight, continued with a steady advance racing into the turn to close the gap on the
pacesetter nearing upper stretch, took over racing into the lane, continued a bit greenly under right handed pressure but drew clear. MILENITA, forwardly
placed between foes prompting the pace, conceded some position nearing the turn, swung out to the four path in upper stretch and continued with a steady
effort to edge a rival for the place honors late. THATS ALL SHEWROTE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, tracked the leaders
inside a rival into the turn, tipped out to the three path racing into the stretch and continued with interest while being outkicked for second. OSTARA, taken in
hand while swerving sharply just after the start, raced well off the field to the turn and passed a tiring foe in the closing stages. LA LENA, prominent three
deep in the opening stages, was urged clear after the opening three sixteenths, held sway racing into the turn, proved no match when confronted by the
winner and gave out nearing midstretch. SARATOGA LULLABY proved no factor. AS IT SEEMS broke slowly and failed to menace thereafter.

GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB), unhurried inside foes racing along the rail in the opening stages, was checked sharply leaving the chute glancing the rail when
losing his path, recovered to split foes just off the inside racing into the backstretch to gain a position behind the second flight along the inside, shifted out
three deep on the far turn while being prompted to advance, moved to terms with that pacesetter midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage from that foe
in time following a prolonged left handed drive. DRIFTWOOD broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace leaving the chute, was prompted to turn
back some challengers midway through the backstretch, held sway on a clear advantage into the lane and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end.
PATRIOT DRIVE, carried inwards by WINNING FACTOR while caught in tight quarters crossing over the path of the eventual winner, then steadied leaving
the chute, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes racing through the far turn, shifted out four wide in the stretch
and continued with an effort to gain position to the end while earning a share. WINNING FACTOR, three deep between foes racing through the chute, was
forced inwards by AFRICAN HERITAGE into the path of PATRIOT DRIVE leaving the chute, then was held up avoiding tight quarters, shifted out four wide
racing through the backstretch while being prompted to terms with the second flight, shifted inwards racing into the far turn continuing in pursuit of the
pacesetter off the inside to upper stretch but weakened late. CARAMEL CHIP settled last while switching outside some traffic racing to the first turn, angled
out four wide entering the stretch and made some belated progress. OBIWAN angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on the leader three deep between foes after a half but soon faded. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI delayed

Footnotes
MAGICAL WARRIOR, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, shifted in to press the pacesetter through the turn,
forged clear leaving midstretch and was kept to pressure. EL FANTASMA swerved out at the start, was righted quickly, then prompted to a position tracking
the leaders in the four path racing into the bend, shifted inwards racing into the stretch but continued with a steady effort to earn the place honors.
SWIFTWISH, urged to the lead inside rivals to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, dueled for command inside the winner into the stretch
and gave way late. STREET LAMP settled into stride off the inside dropping well off the leaders, angled out four wide advancing in tandem with several
rivals into the stretch and continued to improve position between foes to the end. DADASHEV tracked the leaders behind the second flight racing three deep
into the turn and continued evenly in that path into the stretch. ROCKY DICE settled last on the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the stretch but
had no closing bid. THAT'S MY BOI TOY tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
CINNAMONJAWBREAKER, urged between foes in the second flight pursuing the leaders into the turn, emptied out early.

Footnotes
IRISH DREAM GIRL broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin outside a rival to the backstretch, went clear after a half, then was kept to steady
right handed pressure while drawing well clear late. BEAUTY GENIUS raced three deep in second flight leaving the chute, was carried out by MISS
GHISLAINE racing into the first turn, shifted inwards tracking off the second flight into the far turn, switched out three wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. FARCICAL off slowly, settled last racing to the far turn, shifted out to split foes three wide
racing through the stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a share. MISS GHISLAINE, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, drifted out
racing into the first turn tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to close the gap on the pacesetter racing into the far turn but flattened out in the drive.
BIONDA SUPRISE, reserved between foes to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide
into upper stretch but had no final bid. SAYOH angled inwards racing to the backstretch to track off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and
came up empty nearing the lane. DONTMESSWITHTESS angled to the rail racing through the chute while being urged prompting the pacesetter into the
backstretch, switched outside that foe after half, then continued in pursuit into the far turn but gave way nearing the lane. UNEXPLAINABLE broke in the air
while getting away slowly, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. REAL WILD SOLUTION settled along the inside in the
opening half and offered no rally. TAMI'S ORCHID tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but retreated early.
