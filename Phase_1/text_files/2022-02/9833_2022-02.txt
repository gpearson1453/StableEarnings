Footnotes
MIDMON chased inside briefly early on before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing half a mile from home, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, tipped out with three-sixteenths to go to the five or six path and rallied on the wrong lead drifting out an additional two paths, the rider switching to a
right handed crop a furlong from home, dug in steadily gaining and was up in the final jumps to the wire to score. BOOM ROASTED four wide in aim of the
leader, advanced three to four wide through the turn to apply some pressure coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in
under a drive head to head with EUDAIMONIA and took narrow and brief command seventy yards from home, then got nailed at the finish. EUDAIMONIA
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under pressure through the turn and getting placed to coaxing near the quarter
pole in response, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat fending off the aforementioned rival until headed seventy yards from home,
and was along clear for the show honors. KISS ME SMILE hustled from the gate, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader before advancing to press the
pace through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CREDIT
SUSPENDED broke in at the start bumping CRISPY GAL, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made
no impact. CRISPY GAL got bumped at the start by CREDIT SUSPENDED, who broke inwards, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then five
to six wide through the turn, angled in to spin three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
UNO brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, shook clear just inside the
five-sixteenths, drew off into upper stretch, was given two quick pops in succession of a right-handed crop while widening into the final furlong and proved
much the best under a brisk hand-ride to the wire. MATTY'S MARAUDER broke a step slow, was reserved behind a trio of opponents, drafted behind those
foes while well off the pace in the two path early on the turn then shifted three wide, was roused while moving to the four path inside the five-sixteenths,
came six wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the place. BLACK IRISH was urged along on the
outside, went around the turn in the three path, spun five wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and was best of the rest. RUN CASPER
RUN bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left. BLAME IT ON BRUTUS
bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under urging
late on that bend and faded. RICKYS REVENGE was urged along at the rear, angled in inside the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. MILLEAN was coaxed along on the inside of an opponent, raced between horses under urging on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
faltered.

BIG ENGINE broke out at the start bumping ANSWER IN, raced briefly inside before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, remained just off the
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive rallying along the inside of an engaged
trio to take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched clear to the finish to prevail. ANSWER IN got bumped at the start by BIG ENGINE, who
broke outwards and was in tight briefly conceding two lengths to the front, raced four wide in aim of the top pair before advancing to prompt those rivals
through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on inside the final furlong and ran on
to secure the place honors in the final jumps. SMOOTH B coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under some
pressure from the presence of COST BASIS to the outside, got joined by ANSWER IN through the turn now under pressure from a pair and got placed to
coaxing in response tipped out the rail midway on the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair clinging to the lead
before coming under challenge from flanking rivals inside the eighth pole, succumbed to the pressure inside the sixteenth pole and kept on to preserve the
show honors. COST BASIS three wide in closest aim of the leader, was under a hard held latched on to the outside of SMOOTH B and joined to his outside
by ANSWER IN at the three-eighths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive unable to get
on near even terms with SMOOTH B hanging through the length of the stretch to the wire. COMPETITIVE SAINT stumbled awkwardly just after the start
and was brushed by ANSWER IN who was bumped his way by BIG ENGINE and conceded three lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CLASSIC VINMAN was sent hard from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three to four path while still outside those rivals on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive, drifted in under a right-handed crop at the eighth-pole then brushed with the runner-up, dueled with
that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. HALF BIRTHDAY bumped solidly with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the inside of
two foes, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive, battled under the crop into the final furlong then was brushed by the
winner, fought gamely with that foe to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. PRINCESS RILEY was restless in the gate, broke in and was
off a step slow, dropped well off the pace under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and narrowly earned the show while no match for the
top two. DINI'S DESTINY was a bit reluctant to load, broke awkwardly and was taken up by the rider, spotted the front several lengths, dropped well behind
the rest of the field, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out around a tiring foe near the sixteenth-pole and improved to just
miss the show. MRS. BANKS bumped solidly with a foe at the start, disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. STERLING MISTRESS angled in sharply near the five-eighths, was ridden along well off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and was no factor. OH MY BELLE was a bit reluctant to load, established a good position behind the leading trio, moved in late on
the backstretch, went two then three wide early on the turn, moved to five wide while chasing late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
dropped back into the final furlong and drifted out some while tiring.

EMPRESS chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, shied in under a right handed crop at the
three-sixteenths, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was nailed in the final jumps. KISSES FOR EMILY chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
closed well to secure the show honors. DARN THAT SONG chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide
into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. CELINE THE QUEEN coaxed from the start, crossed to show the way in hand along the inside, came under

Footnotes
SCORPION DYNASTY was urged along on the outside, bumped with MAJESTIC TIGER leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a strong drive, raced between foes into the final furlong, gained on the tiring leader into the final sixteenth and got up at the wire to
prevail. BREAKING STONES went to the front, was well rated on an easy lead, extended the advantage with a half-mile to run, dictated terms while inside
around the turn, was set down into the stretch, drew off under a strong hand ride while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed
crop shortly thereafter, shortened stride significantly under a strong hand-ride while continuing on his inside lead into the final sixteenth, went back to a
right-handed crop late and was denied on the wire while just able to get the place. MAJESTIC TIGER settled off the pace, bumped with SCORPION
DYNASTY leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, came out a bit more under a drive into upper stretch,
drifted in outside the furlong marker then brushed with a foe, gained on the tired pacesetter into the final sixteenth and just missed in a three-way photo
while clear for the show. GHOSTMON was coaxed along on the outside, chased two to three wide through the turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong
drive and lacked the needed kick. LITTERBOX tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back some near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the
turn, pursued the leader under a strong drive in the stretch and lacked the needed response. HALPERT broke a step slow, settled at the rear, fell well
behind the rest of the field in three to four path on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

from command straightened away, proved no match for the top one while running on clear for the place honors. SICILIA MIKE two to three wide in pursuit,
tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BAD GUY
coaxed from the start, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. GANDY DANCING coaxed from the gate, advanced to vie between foes from the two path down the backstretch before emerging
head to head with MISSALPHA into the turn, dueled with that rival to his outside yielding command near the quarter pole, swung three wide at the top of the
stretch and tired. TRUE GOLD coaxed from the start, advanced after the break to vie along the inside of a pair of rivals before being shaken off near the half
mile pole, tipped out three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the
drive. MISSALPHA led early on before being engaged by a pair of rivals five and a half furlongs from home, vied outside those foes from the three path to
the half mile pole before emerging in head to head combat through the turn with GANDY DANCING to his inside, swung four wide into upper stretch fading
and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW bumped solidly with a foe shortly after the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied a bit off the rail while still inside
that foe on the turn, kicked clear when asked for more into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, drifted out inside that
marker then was straightened by the rider, was given one last pop of a left-handed crop just inside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under good
handling. MY BOY TATE was bumped in the hindquarters just after the break, moved in while urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with good courage for the place while no match for the winner. JEMOGRAPHY broke in at the
start, was bumped on both sides shortly thereafter then checked while pinched back between foes, moved out at the rear around the nine-sixteenths,
dropped in to save ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. RUNNINGWSCISSORS
pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back under a strong drive into upper stretch and tired. SOUTH AFRICA
broke awkwardly and was taken up by the rider, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SABREEN prompted the pace four then three wide outside a pair of rivals coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
taking command straightened away, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and held on to score. REELEY PSYCHED six
then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to steadily close in but missed at
the end. MISS FLINTSHIRE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure
the show honors. MONDEUSE pressed the pace from the two path between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command with
five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages. PHENOMENAL
WOMAN seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide for home and passed tired rivals. LITTLE MISS MINION broke a beat slow, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOARING MIST seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, got
taken in hand briefly when TORREN'S TALE lost her rider in front nearing the half mile pole, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BANK STATEMENT showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure
from a pair, came under coaxing into the turn, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths and faded, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, faltered,
and was eased home to the finish. TORREN'S TALE three wide in pursuit forwardly placed behind the top trio, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to
go and ducked in getting corrected before making contact with the rail, received a trio of taps to the right shoulder and bolted nearing the half mile pole
losing the rider in the process, got apprehended after the finish and was walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident
near the half mile pole focusing on TORREN'S TALE before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official. PER NEW YORK STATE
GAMING COMMISSION RULING, SOARING MIST WAS DISQUALIFIED AND MADE UNPLACED DUE TO AN ELIGIBILITY ISSUE
