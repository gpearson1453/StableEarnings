Footnotes
TEE UP angled inwards while being urged to force the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, shook clear nearing the turn while angling to the inside,
tipped off the rail racing into upper stretch and was kept to firm left handed pressure while drawing away. ROLLING MO tracked just off the first flight in the
opening stages, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to edge a rival for the place honors. KENAI COOL
tracked the leaders along the inside from out of striking distance early, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch gaining position but was outkicked for
second. CLEM GEM, a bit outpaced in the opening stages, settled last to the turn, shifted out splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, angled to the four path
entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position. THE OTHER CAT, urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch,
shifted off the inside pursuing the eventual winner into the bend and gave way between foes racing into upper stretch. BOURN WILD AGAIN settled
between foes racing to the turn and never gained contention. RACHEL'S WISH switched outside rivals in the opening stages and came under stout
pressure early but soon retreated.

Footnotes
R TENDERONI tracked just off the leaders off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide after a half, was prompted to advance in that path
racing into the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch and went clear in the closing stages under firm encouragement. JUST LIKE INDY
bobbled at the break, was quickly righted to track off the first flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside to
challenge for command approaching the far turn, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no match late while lasting for the place honors.
BIONDA SUPRISE stumbled at the badly start, settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance and
continued well enough to edge a rival for a share at the wire. TIZ LOTTIE was hustled between foes to gain the lead along the inside racing into the first
turn, dueled inside rivals through the backstretch to the far turn, tipped out while losing some ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch and faded nearing
the wire. DEESSE settled into stride off the inside racing to the backstretch, was fanned to the six path racing into the stretch but made no real impression.
LA BRODY, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pace to the backstretch, continued under pressure nearing the far turn but soon emptied out.
AMERICAN EMPRESS joined the pace three wide racing to the first turn, continued to press the issue four deep between foes into the second bend and
gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

HIGH VIBES, caught five deep racing through the chute, shifted inwards nearing the first turn to be rated off the leaders outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, steadily gained position in that path to upper stretch, then angled
inside the leaders nearing the furlong marker while continuing with steady late momentum to wrest the advantage under firm handling. TIZ NENA tracked
just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, tipped out racing into the far turn to advance on the leaders three deep, bid for command between
foes in that path racing into upper stretch, shifted out into the path of BLUE NEITH bumping that rival racing past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner
while prevailing for the place honors, The latter settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders racing four wide through the
far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, was carried out while being bumped by TIZ NENA racing past the furlong marker and was outkicked for
second while failing to contain the winner. MISS LADY L, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue between
rivals racing into the far turn, gave way into the lane and was vanned off the course following the race. DON'T B RIDICULOUS settled between foes racing
to the backstretch, angled out entering the stretch but made no real impression while gaining some position. VEGAS SLIPPERS sprinted to the lead while
angling sharply to the rail racing through the chute, dictated the pace to the backstretch, shifted off the inside after three furlongs while continuing to contest
the issue but gave way racing into the second bend. BUFFALO DANCER, forwardly placed just off the inside, angled to the rail on the backstretch while
being prompted to wrest a narrow advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way.
TRACKER JACKER, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. ANAHIYA'S DREAM, urged to a
forward placing four wide from the outset to the backstretch, retreated after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF OF BLUE NEITH LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIZ NENA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. MAGIC
SURPRISE WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE ON RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE VETERINARIAN.

LOVED AGAIN was rated in early stages dropping back off the second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while shifting to the four path in
upper stretch, moved to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker, then drifted out markedly under brisk left handed pressure crossing into the path of
MONAASIB in the final sixteenth and just held that foe to the wire. MONAASIB was rated off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, angled
out to the five path racing into upper stretch steadily drawing into striking distance, but was carried out through the final sixteenth while just failing to gain
even terms with the winner. S. MUFFIN broke sharply, sprinted to the lead racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but
weakened once headed. SARATOGABATTLECRY tracked just off the pacesetter four wide on the backstretch, then three wide through the turn, lacked the
needed closing bid, then shifted inwards leaving midstretch making some contact with KINGSWOOD approaching the wire. KINGSWOOD tracked just off
the pacesetter inside foes racing into the bend, faded in the drive and was bumped nearing the wire. AMAZING GRACES JOY flashed brief pace three wide
between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early. KAPHAVATA, outpaced in early stages, raced wide throughout while proving no threat.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MONAASIB LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LOVED AGAIN, ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE, WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED LOVED AGAIN FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

STOLEN HOLIDAY broke sharply, sped clear of the field leaving the chute, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and widened her advantage
in a ridden out effort. BRAMBLE BAY angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and proved clearly
best of the others. GENNIE HIGHWAY ducked inwards at the start while getting away last, switched off the inside while being prompted to gain some
position racing into the backstretch, was urged to split foes three deep nearing upper stretch and continued well enough while drifting well wide late to
prevail for a share. ZARINA settled into stride while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dropped out last on the backstretch, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with interest inside foes while being just outkicked for a share. CLAY'S MOON STONE, urged to a forward placing while prompting
the pacesetter to the far turn, faded between rivals racing into upper stretch. STRIKING CHROME tracked the leaders three deep to the backstretch, was
fanned four wide leaving the far turn and soon gave way.

MORE MUCHO broke readily, tracked off the first flight four deep on the backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders three wide nearing upper stretch and
wrested the advantage in time under brisk left handed pressure. TONE ELISE, bumped at the start, settled in the last flight early, tipped off the inside to split
foes racing through the turn, then continued with a steady gain between foes into the stretch to close the gap on the winner late. BRASS BAND, urged
inside rivals pressing the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside a rival into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while drifting out in late stages.
LOVERS AT MIDNIGHT tracked off the first flight five wide on the backstretch, continued four wide into the lane and finished evenly. STARSHIP MACYS
settled outside foes and continued evenly into the stretch. MAARTY'S DILEMMA, outpaced in early stages, passed inside tiring rivals to gain some position
late. REDZILLA tracked off the first flight inside foes racing into the bend but steadily faded into the stretch. BALLYMENA broke outwards bumping TONE
ELISE, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but had no closing response. ROMA MONA, prominent three deep forcing the
pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. WICKED GAL, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, emptied out
early.

FAST PAYDAY, reserved along the inside dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes leaving the midway point of
the far turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure.
SWIFTWISH sped to the lead through the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, held sway on a widening margin
racing into upper stretch and just failed to contain the winner. LUDO was guided to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued with a steady advance inside foes into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. DANCING SOLDAT tracked the leaders inside foes as part of
the second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid just outside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. ROWDY JESS, bumped at
the start while breaking awkwardly, settled last to the far turn, then switched out five wide in the stretch to make some belated progress. WATCH FOR THE
LUTE tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn, angled to the inside nearing the lane but had no rally. TAPINTOYOURBEER settled outside
foes to the backstretch, was caught wide throughout and proved no threat. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT, urged briefly between foes pursuing the pacesetter into
the backstretch, emptied out after a half. GOLDEN WONDER was urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch and gave way abruptly
after a half. HEAVY WEIGHT tracked the leader between foes in second flight in the opening half, steadily faded nearing the lane and lost his rider when
ducking at the sixteenth marker. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ACE DESTROYER vied for the lead three wide between foes through the backstretch, edged forward outside a rival on the turn and held grudgingly in the
four path to the end under firm right handed pressure. WILD WINTER settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, advanced to
contention shifting out four wide in upper stretch and just edged rivals for the place honors in the final strides while moving to close the gap. MAGICAL
TALE, urged pressing the pace between foes in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders racing into the turn, then shifted out racing into the stretch to
make a second effort between foes while being just outkicked by the top pair. RUMPOLE, urged inside rivals pressing the pace into the turn, weakened
while shifting a bit off the rail in late stages. LOUD N PROUD was settled off the leaders along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground gaining
contention in tandem with a rival nearing the lane, lost some momentum racing in tight quarters midstretch and came up empty in the last furlong.
IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK, urged four wide between foes pursuing the leaders into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. D'ROCK flashed brief pace five
wide in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke readily to dispute the pace while angling to the rail in the opening stages, continued in a protracted skirmish into upper stretch,
was bumped by BABY'S DIALED IN in the closing stages but just held that foe under firm encouragement in an all out drive. The latter angled inwards
forcing the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset into the bend, ducked in leaving midstretch bumping that rival and was just outkicked. DEVINE
CHARGER tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly between foes
to close the gap while narrowly prevailing for a share. LOST MY SOCK angled inwards to track off the second flight near the rail racing into the bend, shifted
out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly while being outkicked for a share. PLUS CHIC angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders in
early stages, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. LITTLE MISS SASSY was rated off the second flight while switching out nearing
the turn and offered no rally. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN raced just off the first flight three wide in early stages while being prompted in pursuit of those foes into
the turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. HIGH ARABIAN broke outwards bumping HALO OF FIRE at the start, was collected to track off the second
flight racing four wide into the turn and soon dropped out. HALO OF FIRE threw her head at the start, then was knocked off stride when bumped leaving the
gate dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
