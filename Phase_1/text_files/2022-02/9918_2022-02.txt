SENSE YOU LEFT prompted the pace three wide, made bid when ready leaving the quarter pole and took command, then drew off in the stretch to prove
much the best, ridden out. THREEWICKEDWISHES was allowed to settle three wide throughout, advanced on the turn and shifted out four wide leaving the
turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. SWANAGE set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed leaving the quarter
pole and weakened, bested rest. JOY OF TREASURE was reserved early, swung out four wide for the drive but had no rally. GOINGTOAGOGO was
reserved early and made a mild three wide move on the turn but came up empty in the drive. EMBARRASSING lacked a rally. VIVIDLY (GB) was settled on
the inside and tired.

UNINVITED GUEST tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled with the pacesetter when straightened, then drew
clear to prove best under a drive. GUT FEELING was reserved early, then advanced on the inside, angled out by the furlong marker and finished well.
RULE THE EMPIRE chased the early pace in between rivals, then advanced three wide on the turn, flattened out late while besting the rest. WORDS OF
WISDOM set the early pace while clear, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. DRAGONFLY JACK chased the
early pace on the inside and weakened. BROTHER HAROLD was reserved early while four to five wide and had no rally. KEYS INCLUDED chased the

MATAREYA set a pressured pace on the inside while being well handled, shook clear leaving the turn and then drew off in the stretch to prove much the
best while being shown the riding crop with the left hand, ridden out. PIPELINE GIRL pressed the winner three wide and proved to be no match for that rival,
while staying on for the place award gamely. REAGAN'S DECISION was sandwiched at the start, then was settled three wide, angled in for racing room by
the furlong marker, but needed more late on the inside. COM' ON SWEET LUV tracked the early pace three wide, then was three to four wide on the turn
and came up empty in the drive. GIMMICK tracked the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S RUMOR was well rated while getting down to the inside, made a two wide bid in the stretch and drew clear to prove best under a drive. MAJESTIC
SIGN stalked the pace and made a three wide bid to shake clear in upper stretch but could not go with the winner late, held place award. DUKE OF
CARTHANIA was void of early speed, came widest into the drive and had a late rally. MISTER BANJOMAN set the early pace while getting to the inside
and weakened in the drive. MCFEELY was allowed to settle early while five wide, then was five to six wide on the turn and came seven wide into the drive
and offered a belated rally. BARLEEWON was bumped at the start, then raced on the inside, swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. BIG
AGENDA was bumped at the start, then raced on the inside and angled out by the three sixteenths and had no kick. FOREVER MO chased the early pace
in between rivals and weakened. PICKING ROSES was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally. CAVE HILL chased the pace three to four wide and
tired. FIREWATER JAKE was fractious in the gate, chased the pace two wide and in between rivals and tired.

bid, but was outkicked late, second best. BODE'S CONNECTION was allowed to settle early while four to five wide, then was along for the show award.
SADIE'S RANSOM set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. COSMIC BELLE was rated along the inside, shifted out four wide leaving the turn,
then angled back in but had no kick. MON DANSEUR was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had no rally. MAC LEGACY was settled
back early, angled out in the stretch and had a belated rally. SAYANOTHERPRAYER lacked a rally. SAVANNAH'S HERE failed to menace. ORDER UP
ANOTHER was settled five wide and weakened. BOTH OURS pressed the pace three wide and stopped. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA was off slowly and then
