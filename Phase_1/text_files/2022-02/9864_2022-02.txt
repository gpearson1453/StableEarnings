Footnotes
HUSHED COURT ROOM set the pace two wide into the first turn, cleared approaching the backstretch before meeting SLIDE's challenge shortly after,
clung to a narrow advantage around the far turn and through upper stretch, then gamely inched away late. DEBS PRAYER laid close up along the inside
into the first turn, backed off to stalk approaching the backstretch, lost position into the far turn, chased around that bend, tipped to the four path entering the
lane, and produced a late kick to gain place on the wire. SLIDE stalked three wide around the first turn, moved to press the leader two wide entering the
backstretch, vied around the far turn, but was turned away entering the final sixteenth, and got nailed on the wire for place. I DONT KNOW EITHER saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ST MARIA tracked three wide while keen and pulling around the first turn, settled down the backstretch, then chased
the top pair around the far turn before tiring between horses in the lane. SAFE KEEPING trailed two wide, and was outrun. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FIGHTVILLE set the pace inside of a pressing LUCKY CRUSADER, shook clear entering the lane, shifted outwardly to met TICOLOUR's bid entering the
final sixteenth, flopped back to his left lead with seventy yards to go, and held firm. TRICOLOUR trailed early on, gained along the rail through the far turn,
tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane with a clearing FIGHTVILLE to catch, rallied to range up to that foe and bid at the sixteenth pole, but was
fended off. STAVANGER laid off of the pace in the two path, then in the four path without progressing around the far turn, came into the lane in the five
path, and passed tired rivals without threatening. LUCKY CRUSADER prompted the pace setter from the outside and in the three path around the first turn,
but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and faded. CURLIN EDGES stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair from the three path around the far
turn, then tired between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
LONG WEEKEND required a shoe repair in the paddock, set the pace inside of a pressing DOUBLE CROWN, shook clear of that foe at the quarter pole,
and drew off through the lane with a strong finish. MANNY WAH stalked along the inside, claimed place from outer foes at the quarter pole, tipped outside of
the clear leader at the three sixteenths pole, and safely held his position while proving second best. WENT WEST tracked three wide, bid for place turning
for home, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position at the quarter pole, then kept on in the four path thereafter to reach show a sixteenth out.
SHADOW MATTER bobbled a bit at the start while breaking a step slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path passing the quarter pole, but
shifted inwardly approaching midstretch, and failed to impact along the rail while moving up a spot. DOUBLE CROWN broke a bit outwardly, prompted the
pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, and tired between horses in the three path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
EMPTY NET brushed an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing HOHOHOHO, inched clear of that foe at the quarter pole, and held well from
that chasing rival to the wire. HOHOHOHO prompted the pace two wide, but briefly failed to keep pace with is inner counterpart at the quarter pole, and
chased that foe home well to prove second best. CANDY'S PARADE took a brush from an outer foe after breaking half a step behind her, settled far back
two wide, shifted four wide around the far turn, then rallied through upper stretch to reach show at the furlong grounds. COINMAKER trailed along the
inside, then three wide around the far turn, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up willingly. PINK CHANNEL stumbled badly at the start and
took a few strides to regain balance, raced off of the pace three wide, moved to a tracking position into the far turn, but was outmoved by rivals on both
sides approaching the five sixteenths pole, failed to threaten. EPHEMERAL stalked in the three to two path around the first turn, chased the leading pair
around the far turn, but was outkicked for show at the furlong grounds, and yielded. MS SATCH MO was rank off of the pace along the inside through the
lane for the first time, retreated to the rear two wide into the far turn, the shifted inwardly at the quarter pole, and made little impact. LETS GO ALL THEWAY
took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked two wide, gained along the rail around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired
through the final furlong. MARAMA bumped an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, then three wide around the far turn before tiring.
NIN TO WIN bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but faltered into the far turn.

Footnotes
EXTRAORDINARY laid close up inside of CLEAR HUMOR into the first turn, shifted outside of that foe approaching the backstretch, pressed before forging
an advantage at the three furlong pole, inched clear at the five sixteenths pole, dug in between horses in midstretch as his inner counterpart fought on and
EKATI'S VERVE menaced three wide, and held firmly thereafter. EKATI'S VERVE stumbled a bit at the start, saved ground off of the pace, launched a rally
inside of rivals turning for home, tipped outside of the leading pair approaching the three sixteenths pole, bid at the furlong grounds, but was fended off, and
saved place on the wire. U S NAVY CROSS trailed in the two path around the first turn, then along the rail around the far turn, swung five wide and outside
of rivals passing the quarter pole, rallied in the final furlong to produce a late bid, but did not have enough to reel in the leaders, and missed reaching place.
CLEAR HUMOR set the pace in the two path around the first turn, tucked to the rail while meeting EXTRAORDINARY's outside pressure entering the
backstretch, but was headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, fought on entering the lane, but yielded at the furlong grounds. LAKE NAKURU tracked in
the four path, stalked entering the backstretch as the leaders slowed, but backed off soon after, attempted to inch closer again turning for home, but
flattened entering the lane, and tired between horses in midstretch. CITADEL tracked in the three path, moved to press between horses entering the
backstretch as the pace softened, but backed off soon after, then chased turning for home before fading between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
X CLOWN stalked the clear leader from the two path, gained in upper stretch to bid at the furlong pole, drew clear soon after, and lasted from outer rallying
rivals late. CLASSY JOHN tracked three wide and in the four path around the turn, grinded away in pursuit of a clear and tiring X CLOWN in the final furlong
while hanging on his left lead, but ran out of ground to reach him. JAKE THE BAND MAN brushed the inner part of the gate before bumping an inner foe at
the start, laid far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly through the final furlong, but did not
have enough to reel in the top pair. BINDING AGREEMENT took a bump from an outer foe at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
CHIMNEY ROCK broke half a beat slowly, trailed in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. GRAVY HOUND sped clear to a wide lead, but tired
in upper stretch as rivals closed in, got headed at the furlong grounds, and weakened. A SONG FOR ARCH tracked in midstretch two wide and between
horses while in the three path around the turn, but lacked a kick in upper stretch before tiring through the final furlong.

OSCARETTE set the pace along the inside, drew off at the quarter pole, an was ridden out under mild urging through the final furlong. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN
bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, tracked three wide, came under a drive between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, got outmoved
by outer rivals as BIG IF TRUE drifted across her path entering the lane, altered out five wide approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on to reach
place on the wire. AUNT JOIE stalked along the inside, gained place from outer foes at the three sixteenths pole, but got nailed on the wire for that position.
SWEET CONFUSION was last away, laid off of the pace four wide, steadily gained outside of foes around the turn, bid for place in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, leveled off between horses, then lost show entering the final sixteenth. BIG IF TRUE pressed two
wide around the turn, but proved no match for the leader while drifting to the three path entering the lane, then faltered between horses passing the three
sixteenths pole. MELODY ROSE trailed four wide into the turn, got floated six wide entering the lane, and moved up. GREEN MONSTER took a nudge
between horses soon after the start, laid off of the pace three wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. CLASSY CHROME bumped an
outer foe soon after the start, tracked along the inside, but faded into the turn. FASHION MOON bumped between rivals soon after the start, tracked two
wide and between horses, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
RED HOT MAMA settled off of the pace in the two path, tracked in the three path around the far turn before tipping to the four path in upper stretch, rallied
with a clear CHIONE to catch in midstretch, reeled that foe in in the final sixteenth, and edged clear late. CHIONE stalked two wide, bid entering the lane,
cleared in upper stretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth, and lasted for place. LIVY B trailed two wide, laid off of the pace in the three path around
the far turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied willingly through the final furlong to miss reaching a tiring foe for place. TIZ AMERICAN
tracked two wide, chased in the two path around the far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane before surpassing the tiring early pace-setter for
place in upper stretch, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong grounds, and lost show a sixteenth late. WILD EMPRESS splayed both of her front
feet outwardly while losing her balance at the start, settled far back along the inside trailed into the far turn, then was all out to pass tiring foes in the late
stages. QUEEN CORDELIA set the pace along the inside, established a loose advantage into the backstretch, but was overhauled by an outer rival entering
the lane, and stopped thereafter. SUMMER MATE stalked along the inside, but weakened into the far turn. DUE TO THE TIMER BEING TRIPPED EARLY,
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED
