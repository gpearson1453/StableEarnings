Footnotes
KADESH stalked the pace three wide, made the lead at the three eighths pole then widened the balance of the trip under mild left handed urging to win as
much the best. SLICK AS ICE unhurried early, rallied determinedly through the stretch in the five path and got up for second. CAROLINA ISLAND was in a
bit tight at the start, allowed to settle, the rider lost his whip past the furlong maker and finished with good courage along the rail. THE WAYNE FACTOR
advanced along the inside before a half, had speed into the stretch while shifting out to the three path then was outfinished. BARREL PROOF dueled for the
early lead along the inside, gained control before a half, had speed into the stretch then weakened. PORT HUNTER was outrun. KLAATU battled for the
early lead two wide and stopped after a half.

CENTRIST unhurried early, rallied determinedly in the six path three wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. MAKES GOOD SENSE broke in
front, set the pace while getting rapid fractions past the furlong marker, drifted to the four path and was was outfinished. BIG TRIP chased the leader into the
stretch, loomed boldly in the five path at the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. NYOMAN well placed, failed to respond. SPINSTER ROAD
trailed.

MASTER broke in front and set the early pace, was headed before the half mile pole, matched strides into the turn three then two wide, took command, set
the balance of the pace and won under a hand ride. JUJU NINETEEN never far back, late through the stretch in the five path and finished second best.
RYEGATE STONE stalked the early pace, dropped back on the turn then came on again late two wide. DONDADA rushed up the inside to battle with the
winner before a quarter, chased that one into the stretch then faded late. FED BIZ THE KIDD was no threat. KY HOT BROWN was no factor. SKIDSTREAM
pressed the early pace between horses two wide, shifted out three wide in the turn then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BLACKTIEANDTUX stalked the pace for five furlongs, accelerated rapidly three wide to make the lead on the far turn, set the balance of the pace and
edged clear under strong handling. CAPTAIN RILEY allowed to settle, closed four wide through the far turn, was brushed at the top of the stretch, dug in
late three wide and got up for second. GRAD BASH unhurried, advanced two wide through the far turn, steadied behind the winner entering the stretch,
angled outward brushing the runner up and was outfinished. MOBIL AT LAST well back early, offered a bid five wide into the stretch then leveled off.
INSPIRED TO ROCK was no threat. JACK BE FAST broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide into the far turn, had speed into the stretch then
weakened. OLE WATASHI prompted the pace along the inside into the far turn and stopped in the stretch. DEER CREEK ROAD had brief speed, stopped,
was eased to the wire and walked off. THE RIDER OF GRAB BASH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
VERIFIED sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back bids from multiple rivals past the quarter pole, quickly opened a daylight advantage in
upper stretch and won under right handed urging. ROSE'S GALAXY broke slowly, loomed boldly between horses two wide nearing the quarter pole then
was no match for the winner but held on for second. SILENT TIGER close up from the start, raced near the inside through the turn, swung out to the seven
path for the drive and closed a gap late in the seven path. EMPTY TALK allowed to settle, advanced two wide into the stretch then leveled off.
OVERBEARING chased the winner down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. SELLING OUT was no
factor. UNCLE MOMO was through early. GIVIN UP NONE had brief speed.
