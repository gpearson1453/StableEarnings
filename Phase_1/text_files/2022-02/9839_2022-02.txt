FOOD BANK HELPER came three wide off the far turn, and rallied mildly for the last major share. NATHANIEL'S HOPE cleared to the lead inside before
reaching the first turn, was nursed along on a short lead for six furlongs, and weakened. MACHO TIME broke slowly and was never prominent. STANNIS
broke slowly and was outrun. PRINCIPE raced three wide on the turns, and tired before reaching the stretch. GRAY WARRIOR faded steadily inside.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL sped to the lead soon after the start and angled inside, held clear racing through the turn, was ridden along two wide into the upper
stretch, drew off under a drive then finished geared down in late stages. RAIN tracked the pace along the inside, launched a rail bid into the upper stretch,
came out a path under a drive, stayed on with response and finished second best. BEAUTY QUEEN was forwardly placed tracking the leader in the two
path, was ridden along three wide through the lane and held show. LUNAR BLAST raced inside off the second flight heading into the turn, was ridden along
the rail in the stretch and narrowly missed show. INFATUATING raced three wide positioned off the second flight entering the turn, failed to progress under
pressure then steadily faded. CHEZ PAREE raced in the back four wide through the early going, came five wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
PROTONIC POWER bobbled at the start, raced off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn, closed down the center of the track and was up
and clear late. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA set a clear pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out under steady left-handed urging in the lane
and yielded late. PORK CHOP chased the pace from the rail, had a wide open path inside through the lane and could only gain incrementally. POSEIDON'S
SON hit the starting gate, raced off the pace four wide and had a mild gain between foes. SHEA D CAPTURE stalked the pace two wide and weakened in
the drive. NEGLIGENCE was in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. THOUSAND LETTERS played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SNACKSTER vied inside YEGUITA QUEEN for a half-mile, dug in along the rail through a long drive, withstood a wave of challengers and was edging away
at the end. YEGUITA QUEEN alternated for the lead outside SNACKSTER in the three-path for a half, stayed on through midstretch, got out late under
left-hand pressure bumping EVERTHREE, and saved the place. LADY MECHANIC waited behind the leaders late on the turn, got through in the two-path
between SNACKSTER and YEGUITA QUEEN into the stretch, and needed more. ELLIEREESEASTON fanned five wide coming off the turn, and gained
only mildly on the far outside. EVERTHREE raced four wide on the turn, bid for command through the furlong grounds, then was bumped and bothered by
YEGUITA QUEEN and weakened. AUDREY was fighting with the assistant starter as the gates opened and came out several lengths slow, and was outrun
inside. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, YEGUITA QUEEN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR IMPEDING
EVERTHREE IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN secured inside position around the first turn and settled nicely while rated off the early pace, edged closer late on the backstretch, tipped
three wide mid-way through the far turn, powered past inside duo with a furlong left to run, quickly widened to a clear advantage under a drive then finished
in hand. NO DOWN DAYS moved up to apply pressure to the leader out of the first turn, edged back briefly then moved back up to duel outside VICTORY
CRUSADE mid-way through the final turn, fought back to the furlong grounds then got overtaken by the winner and held on for place. PERFECT KIMBERLY
S hit the rail and steadied sharply entering the first turn, continued settled three wide in the back, launched a rail bid into the upper stretch, tipped two wide a
furlong out and just missed place. DANZATALE tracked the top two leaders up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the stretch run and lacked
the needed response for late impact. KEITANY rated three wide off the early pace, hustled up four wide into the lane and failed to kick on. VICTORY
CRUSADE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled inside NO DOWN DAYS through the far turn, fought back to the furlong grounds then came up
empty. SPRITE'S LADY tracked the top trio up the backstretch and retreated around the final turn.

Footnotes
BIG INVASION stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and drew off while ridden out. CAPTURE THE TIME set the pace along the rail,
was collared in upper, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be a clear second. SOSUA SUMMER chased the pace three and four wide, lacked the
needed rally but churned on to hold the show. MAYA PRINCE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. AIRSPEED VELOCITY failed to
menace while racing four wide. NARA was getting out down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and never threatened. FUERTEVENTURA was
shut off midway down the backstretch, raced well back two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and made little impact. COUSIN ITT played no factor
while racing three wide. WIN NO JOKE was bumped at the start, steadied near the half-mile pole, raced four wide around the turn and was never in
contention. MR. EXTENSION bumped with WIN NO JOKE at the start, had some speed inside and retreated. KING SILVIO was outrun while racing two
wide. URMIZZENTHEPOINT had early speed, bore out around the turn, was eased and walked off. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CUY was never far back, bid between horses three then four wide leaving the turn, outdueled SENOR JOBIM into the final furlong and edged clear. SENOR
JOBIM pressed CITY DRIFTER from outside early, poked a head in front after three-eighths of a mile, battled shoulder to shoulder inside CUY through the
lane and came up second best. INDY LYON broke a length slow, saved ground trailing but within range on the turn, shot through between horses in the
two-path to loom a threat at the top of the stretch, but could not sustain the rally and weakened on the rail. KATIE'S COWBOY fanned five wide coming off
the turn, and lacked the needed closing response. CITY DRIFTER set a pressured early pace inside, got hooked after three furlongs, and faded through the
drive.

Footnotes
PACO'S PICO was prompted out of the gate and held a slim lead over CELESTIAL GLAZE, repelled bid midway through the turn, came two to three wide
into the upper stretch, drew off under a drive and maintained a safe advantage while ridden out in final stages. BATTER UP BUD steadied along the rail and
lost all momentum mid-way through the backstretch, angled out entering the turn, swung wide into the upper stretch, finished with response and cleared
second best. REDDINGTON bumped between foes at the start and just after, chased in close contention around the turn, sustained an inside bid through
the lane and held show. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE was off slow at the start and raced in the last flight, was ridden along three wide into the lane, gained
closer contention and narrowly missed show. ISTHMIAN raced five wide in the back, came three wide into the lane, finished with interest and improved
position. SMOKIN BOW shifted out mid-way through the backstretch, gained three to four wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane. MITICO raced
five wide off the early pace, chased four wide around the turn then ran on evenly through the lane. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD showed response in the
opening quarter then steadily weakened. CELESTIAL GLAZE broke in and bumped at the start, vied outside of the winner through early stages, could not
move on with rival mid-way through the turn and faded in the lane. LORD JAXSTON angled inside just after the start, was ridden along the rail entering the
lane and offered no late bid. AWKWARD PAUSE chased up close through early stages, flattened out around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

HIT THE WOAH was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, surged and was up on the wire.
TRACY ANN'S LEGACY set a pressured pace along the rail, dug in gamely inside through the lane and was nailed on the wire. TREVESS pressed the pace
two wide, battled on to the wire but was narrowly outfinished between the top two. MISSING LINK was up close inside while a bit keen, angled three wide in
upper stretch to have dead aim but flattened out in the final furlong. THAT'S MY BABY broke inwardly and bumped HIT THE WOAH into MISSING LINK,
chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. ZIA'S SONG chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. PATTI D trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER tracked outside the leaders up the backstretch, closed in four wide after six furlongs, reached the front through midstretch and
drove clear. DR. SHANE let UHTRED go on the first turn and moved out to stalk him from outside, challenged between horses in the three-path
approaching the stretch, got outdueled through the furlong grounds by the winner and was able to salvage the place. BUFFALO MAX saved ground
unhurried to the far turn, switched out four wide at the top of the lane, and rallied outside to just miss the runner-up spot. POCO CHARLIE raced three wide
through the turns in midpack, and finished evenly. DEVOTED KITTEN saved ground trailing early, swung five wide leaving the far turn and went by tired
horses. FARLEY had an inside trip until moving to the two-path nearing the stretch, and lacked a rally. LUCAS N' LORI broke awkwardly at the back, moved
out three then four wide on the far turn, and failed to make his presence felt. UHTRED set the pace removed from the rail for six furlongs, and gave way.
JEHA was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD was ridden along out of the gate and raced three wide off the top trio, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch, responded under
left-handed pressure, shifted out wider, steadily edged up closer, reached the outside of DRAIN THE CLOCK in the final sixteenth, stayed on gamely and
edged past in final strides. DRAIN THE CLOCK was away in good order and raced just off the embattled pair, moved up to engage rivals three wide
mid-way through the turn then shook free turning for home, felt the oncoming threat from DRAIN THE CLOCK, came under a left-handed drive, shifted out
wider, fought on gamely and got denied in final strides. DIAMOND OOPS raced in the back three to four wide, swung five wide under a drive into the upper
stretch, showed response and finished well clear over the rest. FRANCATELLI vied outside of GATBSY in opening stages, took on the added challenge
from the winner midway through the turn, could not match strides turning for home and gave way in the lane. GATSBY vied inside of FRANCATELLI in
opening stages, continued to duel inside duo around the turn then gave way in the lane.
