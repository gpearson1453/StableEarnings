Footnotes
POWERFUL MOON broke in front, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear and lasted under right handed urging. TRAMORE BAY never far back,
rallied late in the middle of the racetrack and got up for second. UNCLE KEVIN never far back, advanced widest through the turn, drifted past mid track
giving up ground and was coming on again late. AWESOME STEEL unhurried early, closed a gap late in the four path. DEEP MIND pressured the winner
from the inside into the turn then weakened. CAPTURED BY FATE was through after a half. ASTROMAN trailed.
