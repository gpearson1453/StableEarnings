Footnotes
KEEN KINGDOM stalked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. ZAMBAK raced two
wide in midpack early, went four wide between foes around the far turn, rallied between foes and was getting to the winner late. UNCAPTURED GRACE
settled off the pace outside, steadied off heels early on the first turn, raced three wide around that bend, advanced five wide around the far turn, stayed on
widest in the lane but was outkicked late. MANDORLA raced off the pace three wide, improved position in the lane and was vanned off after the finish.
MOON PARTY tracked the pace inside, went two wide between foes around the far turn, remained in range to midstretch and lacked the needed rally.
BARBARA set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. HOLIDAY PRINCESS lagged well back inside, went five wide around the far turn and never
threatened. TEMPERMENTAL pressed the pace two wide while fighting rating, took a narrow lead between foes midway around the far turn then wilted
through the lane. VICTOREM was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PROUD CONTENDER tracked the leader through early stages, launched a two wide bid for rival entering the turn, dueled outside of READYGOSEEK into
the stretch, dug in gamely under firm handing and shook clear near the sixteenth pole. READYSEEKGO sped to the lead soon after the start and angled
inside, maintained a slim lead into the turn, took on the challenge from PROUD CONTENDER near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of rival into the
lane, fought back gamely into the final furlong then failed to be a match in deep stretch. GHOST FIGHTER lagged a bit in initial stages then moved up closer
along the rail, tipped out and moved up three wide to engage the second flight going by the half mile marker, came under a ride entering the turn, ran on
four wide into the lane and finished well clear over the rest. MACEDONIAN tracked between rivals in early stages, was ridden along two wide though the
turn, shifted out wider for the drive and had no late response. EXTRACTION WILL steadied along the rail in early stages, continued in contention, was
ridden along the rail around the turn then retreated in the lane. COMPASS CAY was off very slow at the start, raced in the back three wide, came out wide
for the drive and never threatened.

Footnotes
COOP TRIES HARDER steadied slightly along the inside midway on the turn, moved to the two-path for clearance approaching the stretch, found a large
opening inside the leaders and rallied through once straightened away, and edged clear under a drive. SPEARGUN was unhurried early, fanned widest for
the drive and finished with good energy. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS raced three to four wide in range to the stretch, and finished one-paced. AMOR LEJANO
(ARG) prompted the pace two to three wide, and weakened in the stretch. WEIGHT OF GLORY set the pace toward the inside to the stretch, and gave way
into the final furlong. OVER THE HILLS broke slowly and was outrun two to three wide. AWESOME FAMILY was finished after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
PRESSLY'S HOPE set the pace along the rail, repulsed a bid from the runner-up nearing the lane, continued on the left lead in the stretch and drew off
under a drive. COUNTLESS DREAMS prompted the winner two wide, bid near the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on to hold
second. MISS YOUNIVERSE saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. ANGELIC STORM broke out and bumped SHE IS ROYALTY at the
start, chased the pace two wide between foes, was bumped near the five-eighths pole, continued two wide between around the turn and lacked the needed
stretch rally. ARTIFICIAL INTELL had speed outside, came in and bumped MAGNOLIA ROAD into ANGELIC STORM near the five-eighths pole, then
steadily faded three wide. MAGNOLIA ROAD was bumped between rivals near the five-eighths marker, chased the pace two wide and retreated. SHE IS
ROYALTY was squeezed back at the start and trailed in the two path. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE
FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CUPID'S DUDE secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch, given cue cue two wide leaving the far turn,
roused to the lead in the upper stretch and widened advantage under steady urging. DAKOTA BOY settled three wide just off the early pace, launched a
four wide bid leaving the far turn, stayed on with response and gained second best. POETIC CODE was well placed stalking the embattled duo up the
backstretch, moved up three wide to race in striking distance with a quarter mile remaining, sustained a steady bid into the stretch and captured show.
MEKANO held a slim lead and angled inside soon after the start, dueled inside of GOGEES up the backstretch and battled on through the far turn, got
collared by the winner in the upper stretch and gave way late. GOGEES dueled outside of MEKANO up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then
failed to keep pace turning for home. ASSET TALENT raced two wide between foes mid-way up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide through the far
turn and failed to kick on. CASSIDYS GOLD got bumped and steadied going by the wire for the first time, raced off the early pace, came three wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. ONE MORE DAY settled and saved ground up the backstretch and had no response when called upon. PLAYING
GOLD showed response in early stages then retreated. JAGGER was off slow at the start, raced in the back, eased to the wire and got vanned off after the
race.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' T broke to the lead, rated along setting an even pace inside, shook off BE LIKE CLINT turning for home and widened under pressure. ROCKET
ONE lacked room after the break, trailed in the two-path for six furlongs, swung widest for the drive and closed with good energy to go clear of the rest. BE
LIKE CLINT broke a step slow, prompted SMOKIN' T from outside for six furlongs, got shaken off into the lane and weakened. MANNIX (IRE) was boxed in
along the rail late on the far turn, moved out three wide for clear sailing into the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. ALWAYS GAMBLING saved ground to no
avail. LAMENT steadied behind BE LIKE CLINT midway on the first turn, and tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
MALRAUX set the pace in the three path, shook clear nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the stretch and widened under moderate urging.
BACKWOODS BOOGIE raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole and rallied for the place. JETTIN OUT chased the pace in
the two path, bid inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole then flattened out in the final furlong. SUNSHINE CHARLIE went evenly while racing four wide.
TENACITY ZIP prompted the pace in the five path and weakened in the lane. DANI'S VICTORY failed to menace while racing two wide. MIDNIGHT PUNK
pressed the pace between foes in the four path and faltered nearing the quarter pole. MUSTANG CAT was outrun inside. MR. EDGAR trailed outside, was
pulled up in the stretch and vanned off. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FAWNING was forwardly placed out of the gate and tracked just off the leader, was prompted to advance moving through the turn, roused forward to put a
head in front of FULTON MARKET with a furlong left to run then kicked clear under steady urging. FULTON MARKET broke readily, went to the front and
showed the way around the turn, stayed on with response but could not hold off the challenge from the winner near the furlong grounds and settled for
second best. NEVER (IRE) was ridden along three wide through the turn, sustained a solid three to four wide bid in the lane, drifted out wider under
left-handed pressure in deep stretch and cleared the rest. VIALETTO was ridden along the rail through the turn, saved ground into the lane, came out a path
wider under a drive and failed to impose on the top trio. MARGEAUX ROMANCE raced off the second flight into the turn, was ridden along three wide into
the lane and lacked a needed rally. STARSHIP BOEING angled inside leaving the backstretch, was ridden along the rail into the lane and lacked the
needed response for impact. WHY LEA raced in the back three wide, stayed in the same path into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
LUCAGO was outsprinted early, began to get in gear around the turn four then five wide, rallied on the far outside to reach the front entering the final
furlong, and bested UNIFIED CONQUEST to the finish. UNIFIED CONQUEST trailed in the two-path to the stretch, settled suddenly while shifting to the rail
leaving the furlong grounds and closed strongly to just miss. NEVER SATISFIED saved ground outrun early, advanced in the two-path turning for home, and
outfinished EL PROFE for the show spot. EL PROFE vied outside CAJUN LOVER for three furlongs, got the best of that dispute into the stretch, but
weakened through the late stages. ON JET HEIR edged closer to the leaders in the four-path approaching the stretch, then flattened out after straightening
away for the drive. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. WOW RUN stalked outside the battling
leaders for three furlongs, and came up empty. CAJUN LOVER dueled inside EL PROFE for three-eighths of a mile, and gave way.

Footnotes
HOT PEPPERS set a pressured pace along the rail, dug in gamely inside of MOUFFY throughout the stretch and held firm. MOUFFY pressed the winner
two wide, dueled outside of that foe through the lane, was inching closer in deep stretch but could not quite get past. JUMEIRAH tracked the pace inside,
could not gain on the top two in the lane but stayed on to best the rest. PEACHY WEACHY raced off the pace four wide and improved position in the lane.
MAJESTIC D'ORO stalked the top two finishers three wide and tired in the lane. RAIN CHECK broke awkwardly, saved ground and failed to menace. FAST
AND FLIRTY played no factor while racing three wide. STRATEGY QUEEN had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
HARD TO IGNORE was taken in hand and settled off the pace near the inside, angled out and given cue five wide heading into the upper stretch,
responded gamely, surged forward to match strides for the lead with CHARMED WAY, dug in along the outside and got a head up in final stride. CHARMED
WAY raced two wide around the first turn then rated near midpack up the backstretch, picked up the pace mid-way through the final turn, coaxed three wide
into the stretch run, roused forward racing in tandem with the winner, fought back gamely from the inside and got denied in final stride. SOUPER DUPER
READY was forwardly placed up the backstretch, moved up three wide and took over the lead mid-way through the far turn, continued clear a furlong out
then failed to be a match when the outside pair surged past. READY CANDY raced three wide off the early pace, was put to a drive four wide entering the
lane, gained closer position but lacked the needed response for serious impact. IMOTO took a solid bump at the start and continued unhurried through early
stages, was ridden along four wide through the final turn, improved position then ran on evenly in the final furlong. MONTANA JOYCE was reserved racing
four wide in the last flight, came under a ride at the head of the lane and had a mild improve. JUANITA R tugged while being rated in early stages, settled
and raced in contention with a half mile remaining, came under a ride two wide around the far turn then gave way. ARETE'S CHALICE prompted the pace
up the backstretch, began to edge up to the lead but got collared by SUPER DOUPER READY mid-way through the turn and steadily weakened. LINN
PIER raced in range while saving ground through early going, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn then faded in the lane. VALIANT MISS
set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared mid-way through the final turn and steadily retreated along the inside.
