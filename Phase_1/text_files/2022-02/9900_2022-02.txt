Footnotes
WHOLELOTTAMO unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane with MISS JANA and prevailed for the
win. MISS JANA challenged for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, was collared down the final stretch, dueled to the wire, was outfinished for
the win, but proved best of others. TAYLORS BABE lacked early speed, had a wide trip, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third.
ROLL BABY vied on the front end, saved ground and weakened. SHARED FUTURE raced in the middle of the field, made a mild rail bid, but was no factor.
SASSY EMMA pressed the early pace and faded. BRINEE raced in the middle of the pack, finished wide and lacked a rally. MAJESTIC WAYS raced within
striking distance, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. VIV VIV VIV raced near the front at the break, dropped back and was no threat
late. TAPSION always raced in the back and showed little.
