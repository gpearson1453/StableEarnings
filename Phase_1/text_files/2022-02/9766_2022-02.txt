Footnotes
EGOMANIA settled just off of the pace while outside of rivals, mounted a four wide bid into the lane, confronted L L L COOL inside of the furlong marker,
battled with that foe to the wire and dug in in the final strides to prevail. L L L COOL tracked the pace from a three wide path, vied for the lead nearing the
furlong marker, was engaged by EGOMANIA inside of the final furlong, battled with that rival to the wire and was nipped on the line for the win. STAY LIT
saved ground while stalking the pace, mounted an inside bid through the stretch, vied for the lead inside of the furlong grounds but was outfinished in the
late stages while a clear third. WOLF MOON WILSON saved ground while settling near the rear through the early going, was in tight quarters along the rail
on the second turn, angled out for the drive and offered a mild late rally but could not reel in the top three. WHOLETTHECATOUT was away alertly and set
contested fractions to the second turn, came under pressure leaving the bend and tired in the final stages. LOYAL PATRIOT was allowed to settle while
maintaining a ground saving trip to the quarter-marker and was not a factor. THECHIEFHASTRICKS lunged at the start and recovered nicely to dispute the
pace to the second turn, gave ground into the stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
FULL OF LIFE was away quickly and sped to an early clear lead along the turn, extended the margin into the drive, had the lead cut into in the end but was
clear at the wire. THE CALABRESE KID chased the pace outside of foes on the turn, rallied into the stretch, closed the margin on the winner in the final
sixteenth and was up just in time for second. SPLIT ACES was forwardly placed through the turn while two wide, was outkicked in the stretch run and was
just edged out for the place in the final strides. UNCLE DANNY bobbled a bit at the start and was hustled to track the pace to the turn, stuck to the inside
along the bend and finished evenly in the stretch run. FANTASTIC DREAM was away slowly, chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn and showed
late interest in the stretch, though unable to impact the top three. TRIBUTE TO ART hopped at the start, was away slowly and spotted the field several
lengths, saved ground through the turn and offered a mild late rally. DANNY MICHAEL saved ground while chasing the pace from the second flight and did
not mount a late rally.

BACK RING LUCK was away alertly and was hustled to set contested fractions, shook free of a pressing rival into the lane but came under pressure in the
final sixteenth and gamely held on for the win. LOAFERS BOY settled off of the pace to the second turn, was steered to the three path nearing the
quarter-marker, swung widest into the stretch, mounted a good late rally to pressure the winner in the final strides but just missed for the win while holding
for the place. FUENTE (GB) saved ground through the first turn, pulled on the rider along the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn and closed
well in tight quarters along the rail in the stretch to claim third. SACRED RIDER was hustled after the break to contest the pace, lost ground into the stretch
run and was outfinished in the final stages. MANILA MISCHIEF was allowed to settle through the first half mile, made a steady inside bid through the
second turn and into the stretch but was outkicked in the drive. OF GOOD REPORT was forwardly placed to the second turn while three wide and
weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
BONITA LEONA contested the early pace, took command into the turn while saving ground, extended the lead through the lane and pulled away in the end.
TAM TRICKY tracked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and was outkicked in the drive by the winner but kept on to win the nod for second.
JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET was a bit reluctant to load, saved ground while tracking the pace through the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, just
missing the head nod for second. LA POPIS contested the early pace then took back to stalk the pace between rivals on the turn and gave way in the drive.
COCORITA was off slowly and spotted the field several lengths at the break, was two wide along the turn, was green through the stretch and passed tiring
foes in the late going. AUNTIE BEV saved ground while chasing the pace and weakened in the stretch run. LONELY ON TOP tracked the pace from the
midflight while outside of foes and tired in the late going. STORMY SIERRA lacked early speed to the turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
BRAZENLY was away in good order, set the pace while rated nicely through the second turn, turned away the challenge from BLACK CASPIAN inside of
the furlong grounds and held over the oncoming runner-up to prevail. ROCKS AND SALT was away a step slowly, steadied off of heels into the first turn,
settled through the run to the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide rally into the stretch, closed well in the late going and could not reel in the winner but
was up in time to secure second. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) pressed the pace from a two wide path, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the final stages, just missing for second. TABLE FOR TEN was four wide along the first turn, sat off of the pace to the second turn, was five
wide into the drive, was bumped nearing the sixteenth-marker and lacked a late rally. GALLANT WARREN was allowed to settle to the half-mile marker,
saved ground along the second turn, improved position into the stretch run, drifted out in mid-stretch and mounted a mild late rally. HEAT N REHEAT was in
tight quarters along the first turn, stalked the pace from the midflight to the second turn, was losing ground when pinched back inside of the final sixteenth
and lacked a late response. GOVENOR'S PARTY was forwardly placed through the early stages, was still within aim while four wide on the second turn and
gave way in the drive.

TAMARA MINE disputed the early pace then took a narrow lead into the turn while being pressured, shook free of the pressing rival into the stretch run and
kicked clear in the end. HAPPY IS bobbled at the start and recovered to stalk the pace from the inside on the turn, was a bit green and hard to place nearing
the quarter-marker and closed well in the late stages to secure second. ICONIC SKY chased the pace from a two wide path while near the rear on the turn,
swung widest into the drive and made a good late rally to claim third. VIVA LA FIESTA was forwardly placed while three wide through the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch run. JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT disputed the early pace then took back to stalk the pace from a three wide path through the turn and
finished evenly in the late stages. FIRE ME UP pressed the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the late
going. GYPSY STREET chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn and weakened in the drive. GETAWAY CHARM tracked the quick pace from a
two wide path and was empty in the stretch run. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN saved ground while chasing from the rear and did not mount a late rally. BELLEO'S
FOREST was a bit slow in the early going, chased the pace to the turn, bolted along the turn, recovered into the stretch and was not a threat. MIX AND
MATCH chased the early quick pace while outside of rivals and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE was content to settle through the early stages while near the rear, was two wide along the far turn, was roused in upper stretch and
made a strong late run along the rail to pass TESORO in the final stages and prevail. TESORO stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground,
angled out to the five path for the stretch run, closed well to overtake DESCARTES inside of the sixteenth-marker but could not hold off the oncoming
winner in the final stages. DESCARTES took command of the early fractions into the first turn, saved ground to the second turn while on the lead, shook
clear of READY SAY GO into the lane and was caught nearing the sixteenth-marker, while well clear of the rest for third. DULAS (IRE) was shuffled at the
start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground to the second turn and did not offer a final late bid in the stretch. READY SAY
GO attended to the pace to the second turn, gave a bit of ground leaving the bend and weakened in the stretch drive. CHARLITO stalked the pace from a
three wide path to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late going. WINE AND WHISKY settled just off of the pace while
outside of rivals, was three wide along the second turn, swung widest into the drive and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
BLACKADDER settled off of the early pace while not far off of the rail, improved position while two wide along the second turn, was roused in upper stretch,
found a seam nearing the furlong grounds, confronted MACKINNON inside of the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that foe and dug in in the final strides to
prevail. MACKINNON was pinballed at the start and was away slowly, was hustled to stalk the pace from a ground saving position to the second turn, was
blocked approaching the top of the stretch, angled out for the drive, quickly overtook the tiring pacesetter inside of the furlong grounds, was headed by
BLACKADDER in the final sixteenth, dueled with that foe and was gamely bested in the end, while clear of the rest. DEL MO was four wide on the first turn,
settled just off of the pace to the half-mile marker, mounted a five wide bid to come within aim approaching the quarter-marker and was outkicked by the top
pair in the late stages. IL BELLATOR stalked the pace to the second turn from a three wide path, lost ground into the stretch run and weakened in the drive.
C'MON MAN settled off of the pace through the early going, gained ground leaving the second turn but did not have a final kick in the stretch run. BOISE
steadied off heels in tight quarters in the run into the first turn, settled off of the pace through the second turn, swung widest into the stretch and did not
mount a late rally. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was away in good order and was sent to set the fractions, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker, kept
on to the furlong grounds and gave way in the late going. UNRAPTURED was forwardly placed through the early stages, gained ground while two wide in
tight quarters nearing the quarter-marker, was shuffled back leaving the bend and tired in the drive. STORMY SAMURAI stalked the pace while saving
ground, mounted a two wide bid to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground into the stretch run and faded in the late stages.
MEETMEATTHECLUB exchanged bumps with DR PESCADO at the start, was allowed to settle off of the pace while saving ground and was not a threat.
DR PESCADO traded bumps with MEETMEATTHECLUB leaving the break, settled toward the rear while saving ground and did not factor.

Footnotes
TRASH TALKIN CAT was hustled leaving the break and set the fractions while in a good rhythm to the half-mile marker, steadily increased the lead along
the second turn, felt pressure in the final sixteenth from the oncoming runner-up but held safely in the end. VANTAGE POINT tracked the pace from a three
wide path, closed well off of the second turn and could not reel in the winner in the end but bested the rest. HARBOR SKY saved ground throughout while
stalking the pace and was outkicked in the drive, but held on for third over an oncoming rival. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) settled off of the pace while two wide
through the half-mile marker, was in tight along the second turn and boxed in in upper stretch, swung out in the final furlong and was gaining in the end, just
missing for third. MOUNT PELLIAR was unhurried in the early stages while outside of rivals, was steered three wide along the second turn and offered a
mild late rally in the drive. SUGAR BEETS settled off of the pace while saving ground and did not have a final kick in the stretch. REFI NOW attended to the
pace from a two wide position through the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was allowed to settle in the opening
stages, made a steady gain through the backstretch run and onto the far turn while four wide but flattened in the late stages. AWESOME DUDE saved
ground while stalking the pace to the second turn and weakened in the late going.
