Footnotes
MOON BIZ broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace slightly off the rail and was under urging in the drive. TIPSY TOURIST bore out leaving the
starting gate, raced in the two path around the turn and willingly chased the winner. PEARLYVILLE , a forward factor in the three path around the turn,
lacked the needed rally. UNION BETTY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path for the drive and
passed tired foes. BAD TEMPER hugged the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. HURRICANE DIRECTOR , four deep around the turn, retreated
through the lane. TUA , no factor, dropped back.

Footnotes
HUMMIN' THE FUNK rated three deep while stalking the pace past the five eighths, responded when given her cue and moved up to take aim past the five
sixteenths, moved to command entering the lane, dueled outside DAUNTLESS GAL to mid stretch, shook clear, drifted out under left handed asking in deep
stretch then held sway. HOT CHOICE , close up between rivals nearing the half mile pole, advanced to the inside of a tiring rival leaving the five sixteenths,
shifted out for the drive, ranged up outside HUMMIN' THE FUNK near the sixteenth marker, switched over to left lead when bothered by that rival then
flattened out. LOVE MY CAT lagged off the pace, was ridden along leaving the far turn, raced two wide into the lane, eased out some in the drive and
offered a mild rally. BLESS AND HONOR settled off the pace and off the inside, edged up four wide nearing the far turn, circled four to five wide into the
lane, advanced past mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. DAUNTLESS GAL took over early and dropped in to set the pace, handled outside pressure,
held a clear lead leaving the three eighths, dug in when collared approaching the stretch, sparred to mid stretch then faded. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was
steadied along while saving ground off the leader early on, tracked to the far turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths and faded. SECRET PRIZE
prompted the pace outside DAUNTLESS GAL, was under pressure trying to keep pace past the three eighths, began a retreat leaving the five sixteenths,
was pulled up when sustaining an injury to her left front in deep stretch then was euthanized on the track. Following an objection by the rider of HOT
CHOICE, HUMMIN' THE FUNK was disqualified from first and placed second.

Footnotes
LORD MIO had speed then rated back off the leader, tracked inside, had room along the rail and bid to take command leaving the five sixteenths, opened
up a clear lead under a drive near the three sixteenths, kept on under pressure through the final sixteenth and held sway. RELATIVLEA stalked the pace
between foes mid turn, came three wide for the drive and closed steadily. AUCTION KINGDOM settled well back while saving ground, got through inside
while gathering steam mid turn, remained towards the inside and closed willingly. SCHOOLYARD BULLY stalked outside rivals, ranged up to briefly
threaten approaching the stretch, gave futile chase in mid stretch then faded. DANGNABBIT rushed to a clear lead, set the pace two wide, was engaged
from both sides nearing the stretch and tired. DR. GRANT , in the clear leaving the half mile pole, failed to kick on under asking, faltered and was eased
late.

Footnotes
GOLDENIZE sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn and was kept to his business in the drive. MONEY ROOM lacked speed,
raced inside horses around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. VIOLENT ROCK worked between horses on the turn
and in the stretch and weakened in the drive. CLASS WIZARD , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced very wide in the stretch and passed
tired rivals. HAMPDEN LANE , inside horses on the turn and in the stretch, weakened. QUITE READY , well positioned three deep on the turn, gave way
approaching the eighth pole. CAPTAIN QUINT , a forward factor along the inner rail, weakened the final furlong. ESPRESSO LUNGO raced along the inner
rail on the turn and was not a factor. COASTAL CHAOS was outrun. MY HANDSOME MAN , three wide on the turn, gave way in upper stretch. WIRED IN
faltered in upper stretch.

SHAKE EM LOOSE , rated well wide and outside rivals past the five eighths, quickly gained five wide leaving the half mile marker, sustained under asking
and moved to command entering the lane, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, widened to mid stretch then held firm while kept to task.
LOOSE ENDS , bumped at the break, regrouped and edged up outside a rival, made progress under a light hold three to four wide mid turn, was forced out
seven wide entering the lane losing momentum, regrouped and straightened then made a solid run through the final furlong to gain the place. HEARTNESS
tracked inside rivals, shifted out four wide into the lane, moved up and gave hard chase past mid stretch and continued on with effort. MICRO STAR stalked
the pace between rivals, was the closest pursuer of the leader leaving the far turn, bid between foes to threaten into the lane, failed to match strides with the
winner past the three sixteenths but kept on trying to the wire. MAXIMUM IMPACT , bumped at the break, settled off the pace, raced three wide into the
lane, altered in past mid stretch ands churned on. UNCLE IRISH rated in range while off the inside, waited behind foes near the three eighths, angled five
wide bothering rivals approaching the stretch, straightened away but lacked the needed finish. NATAGAR came in at the break and bumped with a foe,
edged up well wide past the five eighths, was ridden along making some headway four wide mid turn, was carried six wide entering the lane, recovered to
pursue to mid stretch then faded. MINECRAFTER saved ground off the pace, eased out in upper stretch but came up empty. FREE SQUARE sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, failed to contain the winner nearing the lane and gave way. MR. MOX , four wide between runners, chased to upper
stretch then surrendered. KNOWHOWIKNOW , hung out four to five wide stalking the pace, began to fade past the three eighths, was taken up sharply
when impeded approaching the stretch then was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN , off last, stalked the pace three to two wide on the turn, closed determinedly, overtook SEVEN ON THE ROCKS inside the sixteenth pole
then held off the late closer. RISING PERRY , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path near the eighth pole and rallied outside the winner. A PENN
LEGACY raced in the two path on the turn and in the stretch and showed a mild rally. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS sprinted to the early lead, set the pace
along the inner rail and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. SAN ANTONE , behind horses near the three eighths pole, swung four deep leaving the turn,
was floated out in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. TYREEK , along the inner rail around the turn, gave way. MONSTER MASON was
not a factor. PER RULING #22-146 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, THE WOLFMAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
GOLD TIME VIXEN , taken to rate early, edged up to the inside of a rival near the far turn, eased out and stalked, ranged up four wide to take aim into the
lane, made a grinding run under left handed asking, drew alongside in deep stretch and got the bob. UNSHAKABLE U cleared early and set a rated pace,
was set down three wide in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive past the furlong grounds, switched over to her left lead with a sixteenth remaining,
wandered outward and just failed. LOVE IS STRONG , well back through five furlongs, saved ground into the lane and closed steadliy.
YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ came out at the break and bumped a rival, raced between runners leaving the far turn and failed to make an impact.
MARKETABILITY stumbled at the break then was soundly bumped, dropped well off the early pace, circled the turn four wide and came up empty. WALK IT
OUT NANNY gave early chase two to three wide and dropped back. CORAL SUMMER , three to four wide pursuing the early pace, faltered.
