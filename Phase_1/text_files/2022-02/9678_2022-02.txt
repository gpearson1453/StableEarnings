Footnotes
STRATUSFACTION drew clear leaving the chute and tapered to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure at the rail into the turn and was steadily
handled in the stretch. NOBLE PRESENT chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch then continued to drift through the stretch
while gaining mildly on the winner. BODIE'S STORM chased, raced near the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BANTAM ROOSTER
was bumped at the break, chased and rounded the turn in the three path, then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MICHEAUX chased, rounded the turn
off the rail then flattened. TAPPING SOUTH broke out to make contact with Bantam Rooster, angled out to give early chase, was never a factor and ran
near the rail on the turn. INDIGO was not a factor. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SCARLET TANAGER contested the pace from the start and took the nod nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the turn, widened into the
stretch and held on under steady handling. EXACT chased and ran in the five path on the turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the
winner. MAE SAI PRINCESS gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and finished evenly. BRING IT ON HOME gave chase, raced two deep on
the turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. DEALER'S GIRL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths
then flattened stride. UNCANNY contested the pace, dropped back two deep midway on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn then weakened. DIMITRI'S
ROMANCE chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn, eased outward leaving the turn but showed little more. GANDHI'S CASTLE was shuffled back early,
chased outside then eased in the lane.

Footnotes
CRUZ IN THE CASTLE took the lead two deep leaving the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. DYLADDIE settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid approaching the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and secured second through the stretch. COMMCAT saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the duel for second. TINA'S SONG rounded the opening turn about the four path, bid into the
backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. WHISKEY TALKING ran in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. KATALIMA settled back off the rail, showed little response through the backstretch
and rounded the far turn about the four path. CHARITABLE MISS was not a factor. DIXIE SUNRISE saved ground.

under pressure at the five sixteenths and was kept alert in the lane. ALPINE MOON rounded the opening turn about the four path, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and dueled to a clear second mid-stretch. JESSICA rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase
into the backstretch and ran at the rail on the far turn, then ceded second mid-stretch. LADY MACHO settled off the pace about the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, remained in the three path on the far turn and showed little further. MORALITY CLAUSE showed little
response leaving the first turn. MARY'S JEWEL raced well back and was not a factor. SHERWOOD LADY set the early pace inside, was caught at the nine
sixteenths pole, dropped back at the seven sixteenths then faded. UNEXPECTEDLY raced well back.

Footnotes
SOMEDAY IS TODAY entered the first turn about the five path and stalked through the turn, moved to the lead four wide at the seven sixteenths pole, drew
clear at the three eighths and was pressured to extend her lead at the rail on the far turn, lost some ground into the stretch and continued to drift through the
stretch, though, held well under steady urging. HOW IS SHE saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn, eased to the four path entering the stretch and dug in to take second later yards. LONG LEGS LOUISE raced well off the early pace in the two and
three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and passed rivals outside. POWER SONDE stalked in the
three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened the final furlong. RIVER REWARDS RVF
bobbled inward and into Love To Zoom leaving the gate and raced with the pace, took a brief lead leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. WALK A FINE LINE was bumped at the break then rated close inside the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LOVE TO ZOOM was bumped inward and into Walk A Fine
Line leaving the gate, though set the early pace inside, was met at the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded leaving the three eighths.

Footnotes
WINDSORS TAIL stalked the early pace off the rail, moved to even terms at the three eighths pole and took the nod approaching the five sixteenths, dueled
clear two deep midway on the far turn, ducked sharply outward across the path of Penguin Parade at the eighth pole then dug in under steady
encouragement to hold on. STORMIN ROCKET saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three and four
paths, drifted widest into the stretch and finished well for second late, while gaining on the winner. PENGUIN PARADE settled off the pace about the three
path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide and was making a move on the leader nearing the head of the lane, was shut off at
the eighth pole, though, came back to finish evenly. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, threatened for the lead mid-stretch but flattened later yards. SEXY CHOCOLATTE settled inside on the opening
turn, chased leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled four wide into the stretch but flattened stride. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE
settled off the pace in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. BLUE N GOLD rounded the first turn in the five path and
was never a factor. MATH MAN MARCO surged clear past the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met at the three eighths
pole, gave up the nod toward the five sixteenths and chased from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and gave way in the lane.
SWISS LEGACY was never a factor. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Noballstwostrikes, lodged by the
rider of Penguin Parade, and disqualified the former to third place for coming across the path of the latter in the vicinity of the eighth pole.

Footnotes
HANDS DOWN took a quick lead and was rated inside, came under mild pressure at the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the turn and was kept alert down the
lane. POSTINO'S STORY rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, closed the gap on the far turn but was turned away in the lane and settled for second best. HEROIC DEED rounded the first turn in the four path then
eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, closed ground in the three path of the far turn though flattened inside the eighth pole.
DON'T THROW STONES ducked out to make contactd with For Arts Sake leaving the gate then raced off the pace about the three path, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. NEW SOUTH came through the first turn in the four path, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. CIOPPINO saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. VITO ANDOLINI saved ground and faded past the three eighths pole. FOR ARTS SAKE was
bumped at the break and raced well back. IF I COULD RUN raced off the pace two deep the first turn then faded past the half mile pole. HURRICANE
AMIGO showed little response past the seven sixteenths pole.
