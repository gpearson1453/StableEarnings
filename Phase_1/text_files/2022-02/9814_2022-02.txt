yielded near the sixteenth pole. CHASING FAME had an inside trip, offered a mild bid only and was outrun. COASTAL JAZZ led early and stopped on the

NOT THAT SERIOUS set the pace, drew off on the turn for a long lead and held off the late charge of THE MET. THE MET pressed the pace, fell back on
the turn, continued willingly to the wire and was gaining fast late. DRINKING AGAIN raced mid pack outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and
got up for show in a steady effort. HEY NOW angled out on the backstretch, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. EXECUTIVE
ACTION was outrun in an even effort. MY NOAH pressed the pace to the turn and gave way.

HARKING rallied outside to challenge for the lead on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew clear in a driving finish. FIVE PICS PLEASE broke
sharply, set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel to the sixteenth pole and yielded. ZAMARA raced inside, angled out on the turn, offered
a mild bid five wide and got up for show. MY CRAFTY GAL was hustled along to press the pace along the rail to the turn, weakened and faded through the
stretch. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER raced in the back and failed to menace in an even effort.

the pace, bid between horses entering the second turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. TWILIGHT
RIDER was crowded and checked at the start, saved ground to the turn, angled out, bid ten wide and got up for show. EMPIRE WICKET raced in the back
in a steady effort and improved position. FISHEL raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. HELLO HANDSOME vied inside to the second turn,
weakened and faded through the stretch. STORMING WARRIOR was through early. JUST LIKE FRED vied between horses to the second turn, weakened
and faded. INCLUDE HOO was not a factor. SMILING MATT broke slowly, was hustled along to vie to the second turn, tired and stopped.
