Footnotes
MONEY SUPPLY, bumped at the start, was settled outside a rival collecting his stride, shifted inwards on the backstretch while being prompted to advance,
tipped out three deep on the turn gaining position between foes, angled inside the leaders entering upper stretch, came through to challenge for command
approaching the sixteenth marker and went clear in time under firm right handed encouragement. VIVE BIEN, urged disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, resisted several challenges, then shifted out racing into upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner while just lasting for second. QUALITY G angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch, continued in close
quarters three deep between foes contesting the issue past the quarter pole, then continued willingly outside the top pair to the end while being just
outkicked for the place honors. BOURBON READY, bumped at the start while forced into the path of the eventual winner, switched out pursuing the leaders
through the backstretch to advance on the first flight four wide on the bend, was fanned six wide into the stretch and continued with interest to gain some
position in that path late. CAMINERO tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, switched out nearing upper stretch to lodge a
brief bid between foes but flattened out leaving midstretch. EXXEL tracked off the second flight four wide through the backstretch, angled to the inside
nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. MAINTAINER, forwardly placed tracking just outside the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced four wide
to lodge a brief bid racing past the quarter pole but emptied out entering upper stretch. BOY I HOPE SO proved no factor. DORSODURO broke outwards
bumping BOURBON READY at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but retreated early.

Footnotes
GATHER AS YOU GO broke readily, sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn, met the challenge of
several rivals to regain a clear advantage in the closing stages and was kept to firm left handed pressure. PEACHTREE ROAD, reserved between foes in
the opening half, rallied three wide through the far turn to upper stretch to gain a position just off the leaders midstretch, then altered inside a stricken rival in
late stages to secure the place honors. APPROACH THE DAWN (IRE), forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half,
was urged to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but proved no match in the drive. NAVAL BATTLE was rated along the inside behind the second flight,
awaited an opening racing through the far turn, came outside foes to race four deep into the stretch, then was steadied avoiding a stricken rival in late
stages. WEEZY DOES IT settled outside foes to the backstretch, angled five wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but lost some
momentum when altering course outside a stricken rival while carrying out BEACH BREEZE nearing the wire. BEACH BREEZE settled along the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, was fanned six wide racing through the stretch, then was steadied while altering course in
the final stages when carried out. SHE'S JUST QUALITY tracked off the second flight outside foes racing three deep to the far turn, shifted inwards entering
the stretch and faded between foes late. SILVER SEA reserved along the inside in the opening half, never gained contention. VENUS OYZO, forwardly
placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, lost ground to the leaders on the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. FANTASTIC RAFAELA,
caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, settled outside foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. STARSHIP BELMONT, pulling between foes while a bit
rank under restraint tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, emptied out abruptly after a half. CIELO D'ORO tracked off the third flight outside
a rival in the opening half, switched outside foes to make a sharp, three wide advance on the leaders racing through the far turn, moved to challenge the
winner midstretch, suffered an apparent catastrophic injury near the sixteenth marker dislodging her rider and was subsequently vanned off the course.

Footnotes
MACALLAN was rated just off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch steadily advancing on the
leaders, took over leaving midstretch, went clear late under left handed pressure and was gathered up approaching the wire . AFJAN, urged between foes
to prompt the pace outside a rival into the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but was best of
the others. GIANT'S FIRE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, continued grudgingly into upper stretch but yielded to the top
pair in late stages. ROYAL COURT, off slowly, settled well off the field to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide through the far turn and
continued with an effort to improve position. ARROW STRIKE was rated off the second flight inside foes and continued evenly into the stretch. AZURE SKY
settled well off the field racing to the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and passed inside some tiring rivals in the closing stages. BALLOT BOX, caught
five wide racing to the first turn while under some prompting, dropped off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. BRUCE
BANNER, forwardly placed three wide between foes tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. MOMENT OF
PEACE was urged to a forward placing four deep racing to the backstretch tracking just outside the first flight but came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE) angled inwards racing through the chute tracking outside a rival behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance three deep nearing upper stretch, exchanged some light contact with EDYE'S CANDY in late stages but edged that foe in time under firm right
handed encouragement. The latter broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, resisted
when challenged racing into upper stretch, shifted out in the closing stages exchanging light contact with the winner and just failed to contain that rival. MISS
SUGAR HILL (GB), held up outside rivals racing through the chute avoiding traffic, was prompted to make steady progress outside foes into the backstretch,
shifted out four wide while advancing on the leaders nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share in the closing stages.
REQUESTFORPROPOSAL was rated just off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling inside foes on
the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and finished evenly between foes late. CURIOUSLY, pulling a bit between foes racing through
the chute, angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then switched out racing in close quarters
through the stretch to gain some position between rivals in late stages. BIG TENTATIONS, pulled between foes while shifting inwards crossing the paths of
several rivals racing through the chute, dropped off the third flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide, then four deep into the lane and continued
evenly late. GOLD WATCH, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing
upper stretch but quickly emptied out. CORNICE TRAVERSE stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the far turn and faded inside foes in the
closing stages. LAZARA, bumped, then cut off by AU CHOCOLAT at the start, never gained contention. AU CHOCOLAT ducked inwards at the start
bumping rivals, raced rank between foes, then shifted to the inside racing to the backstretch and faded early. NOVEL IDEA, caught in tight quarters between
rivals racing through the chute, failed to menace thereafter. RIBALDRY (IRE), bumped, then steadied along the rail twice racing through the chute to the first
turn, proved no threat. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TRUST THE NUMBERS gained a forward placing racing just off the leaders between foes, continued under patient handling into the bend, shifted out three
wide racing into upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter and produced a steady late response to narrowly prevail under brisk handling in a prolonged
drive. NAPA CANDY was urged to the lead inside rivals in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, maintained that
advantage shifting off the inside entering the lane, dueled grudgingly inside the winner to the end but just lost the advantage nearing the wire. BLUSTERY
tracked off the second flight five wide racing through the backstretch, steadily gained striking distance racing four wide through the turn to upper stretch but
lacked the needed final kick. HOP PICKER settled outside foes racing through the backstretch, angled out six wide entering the stretch and made some
belated progress. BROOKWOOD HILLS angled to the inside on the backstretch tracking just off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in the
drive. INDIA CARIBE settled while angling near the inside on the backstretch, switched outside foes entering upper stretch but had no rally. SUMMER OF
MISCHIEF, urged prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. DESERT OF MALIBU tracked just
off the first flight three wide between foes through the backstretch into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. GWENDOLA proved no factor. ANY
PORT broke slowly and proved no threat. LULI'S DANCER retreated early.

DROP A HINT was settled last in the opening stages while switching outside foes, steadily gained momentum racing four wide into the turn, loomed outside
the leaders three deep nearing midstretch and produced a steady late response to just edge MY DESTINY on the wire under firm handling. The latter broke
sharply, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes through the backstretch, shifted to the inside on the turn dueling for command,
turned back a rival's challenge midstretch to regain the advantage late but just failed to contain the winner. FEELING MISCHIEF was rated off the first flight
between foes racing through the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain position to the end. TAP DANCE
FEVER tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening quarter, advanced four deep entering the turn to bid for command, moved to gain the
advantage outside a rival with a quarter mile to go but failed to sustain her momentum past the furlong marker. SPECIAL PRINCESS was under pressure in
early stages while dropping out last and passed only tiring rivals. NIGHT CAP flashed brief pace inside rivals prompting the leader in the opening quarter but
gave way racing into the turn. QUINOA TIFAH angled inwards in the opening stages to prompt the pace three wide on the backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
BANK ON SHEA angled inwards in the opening stages tracking off the first flight flight through the backstretch, advanced along the rail to bid for command
leaving the quarter mile marker, shifted out while being roused to dispute the issue inside BABY YODA racing past midstretch exchanging light contact and
just held that rival to the end under energetic handling. The latter broke a step behind the leaders, came through between foes in the opening furlong to gain
terms with the first flight three deep attending the pace into the turn, lost some ground nearing upper stretch when racing outside a drifting foe, moved to
terms with the eventual winner in the three path in upper stretch, continued in a protracted skirmish while exchanging light contact past midstretch but was
just outkicked. PUDDING tracked off the first flight outside those rivals on the backstretch, advanced four wide into upper stretch and continued with a
steady late effort to prevail for a share. CAJUN CASANOVA was rated off the second flight in the opening quarter, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch
and continued to make mild progress to the end. R MERCEDES BOY, urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shifted
to the inside once losing the lead racing into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. BOCA BOY settled last racing to the turn and failed to
menace. KING GUILLERMO, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, drifted out midway through the bend and abruptly
gave out.

Footnotes
NEST shifted out three wide racing into the first turn to stalk the leaders on her own courage through the backstretch, readily advanced when given her cue
nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage entering the lane, then steadily widened her margin in the last furlong in a ridden out performance.
ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK, prompted to a forward placing along the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside to stalk outside the pacesetter racing
into the backstretch, moved to wrest the advantage from that foe racing through the far turn but proved no match for the winner entering the stretch.
BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch and continued three
deep into the lane while continuing with interest to edge a rival for a share. HA' PENNY settled outside foes racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance
while being fanned four wide into the lane and had no closing bid. PRINCESS ELIN, reserved last off the inside to the backstretch, angled inwards nearing
the far turn, was prompted to advance while switching outside a tiring foe racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. PEACEFUL
SURPRISE, carried out a bit by MINING CHROME at the start, tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch but faded early. MINING
CHROME ducked out at the start, was urged between foes to gain the lead while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace to the
second bend and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GLADYS, pulled her way to the lead from between foes to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, repelled a rival's bid racing into
upper stretch, then shook clear of the field, widening to the end under pressure. GIGGLE FACTORY was rated off the second flight between foes racing to
the backstretch, continued in close quarters into the second bend, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued well enough to edge rivals
for the place honors. JOYOUS TIMES broke through the gate prior to the start, was rated inside foes, then between rivals just off the second flight to the
backstretch, was steadied slightly midway through the backstretch, then continued bottled up between foes into the far turn, shifted off the inside racing
through the lane and split foes three wide while just missing for second. EDITOR AT LARGE (IRE), off slowly, was reserved outside foes to the far turn, split
foes nearing upper stretch and continued to improve position five wide late. HOITY TOITY, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, moved to challenge that foe nearing upper stretch but quickly emptied out. BOCA, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground
gaining position inside foes into the stretch but flattened out late. C'EST MARDI settled outside foes to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing through
the far turn and offered no rally. INDEPENDENCE LAW, pulling a bit while angling to the inside to track just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, faded
between foes in late stages. JEAN V'S LEGACY off slowly, was settled along the inside to the far turn and offered no rally. SPEED SALSA, caught a bit
wide racing to the first turn, was prompted to contend four wide through the backstretch to the far turn and soon emptied out. ADRIATIC ROSE proved no
factor.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, was urged to repel a rival's bid racing into
the far turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage, then went clear under right handed pressure and finished in hand
approaching the wire. SHIPSATIONAL was rated between foes racing behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four
wide between foes into the far turn, continued in that path into upper stretch and finished with interest to prevail for the place honors. VOLCANIC tracked the
leaders three deep behind the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance in that path through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick while prevailing for a share. STRIKE HARD settled outside foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out five wide nearing the
far turn while being prompted to advance, then continued in that path to upper stretch in an effort to gain some position late. GOLDEN GLIDER was rated off
the second flight just off the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out three deep racing through the far turn and continued evenly between foes to late
stages. GOD OF LOVE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung outside rivals racing through the far turn, raced six wide into
the stretch but continued with an effort to improve position. LITTLE VIC, shifted inwards while being urged to terms with the eventual winner prompting the
pace into the first turn, pulled a bit against rating racing into the backstretch, moved to press the issue nearing the far turn but came up empty racing into
upper stretch. KITTEN MISCHIEF, reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. MR RUM RUNNER tracked off the first flight
along the inside in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn to gain some position racing into upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. MAKE
IT BIG tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on those foes in that path into the far turn but flattened
out racing into upper stretch. UNPREDICTABLE BAY settled inside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. TRADEMARK tracked just off the first
flight between foes racing to the far turn and gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch.
