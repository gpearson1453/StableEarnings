Footnotes
HEADS OR TAILS was urged along in third position, chased three wide for most of the turn then moved to four wide, gained to take the lead into upper
stretch then kicked clear, powered away under a brisk hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement in the final seventy
yards while much the best. ON THE HILL broke a step slow, angled in then was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved
out inside the three-sixteenths, advanced into second position while remaining on his inside lead and finished willingly to safely secure the place while no
match for the winner. ACALTEQUE brushed the inside of the gate at the start, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path
on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show. EMPIRE STATION was ridden along while showing no speed on the
outside, angled in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths and was no factor.
BOINTHEBACK was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to
the proper lead inside the furlong marker and had nothing left. MOONS THE LIMIT was sent hard from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a foe,
vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. TRIPLE BROWN was urged along off the pace, dropped
back while inside to the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

NOT YET CHARLIE hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take
command inside the eighth pole, then inched away in the late stages to prevail. GINNSU WARRIOR stumbled at the start getting away last and conceding
four lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced briefly five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking two to three wide, tucked inside
through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on to secure the place honors. ALWAYS CHARMING
bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the leader to take command before spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat and was collared inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. BUSTIN PIETRE
hustled from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, came under threat to the outside and
yielded before taking the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive.

advantage into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop while still on his inside lead outside the furlong marker, swapped to a left-handed crop while
remaining on the inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and held desperately to prevail then was reported to have bled. SUMMER BOURBON contested the pace
while loosely between foes, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend, kept on while chasing that foe in the
stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. WINNING DRIVE settled off the pace, was urged three wide early on the turn
then was carried to the four then five path later on that bend and finished with good energy to garner the show. FLEET WARRIOR was away alertly,
contested the pace on the inside of foes, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. P J
ADVANTAGE hit the outside of the gate at the break, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back near the
five-sixteenths and capitulated. HEALY'S HOPE showed no speed while urged along, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. VICAR'S LEGEND was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in passing the five-eighths pole, saved ground early on the turn, lugged out to three wide around the
three-eighths then four wide later on the bend and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CARLY HUSTLE four then three wide in closest pursuit of the duel up front isolated between that duo and the rest of the field in behind, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the three-sixteenths and edged clear to the finish kept to
task. STORMI CAT LADY chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
GAGLIANO chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide at the top of the stretch and kicked on belatedly to
just miss for the place honors. GRAPE THERAPY dueled from the two path with QUEENTIGUA to her outside bumping that rival twice five furlongs from
home, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in and was
collared inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages. MISSION TRAIL chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. QUEENTIGUA dueled from the three path with GRAPE THERAPY to her inside getting
bumped twice five furlongs from home, briefly tucked to the two path into the turn before floating back three wide under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
four wide into upper stretch and tired. PAZZION chased two to three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, tipped out four to five wide at the head of
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RCAPTIVATING went three wide around the opening bend, settled well off the pace, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path on the
far turn, pursued the leader in a prolonged drive in the stretch, gained fast on that exhausted foe late and got up at the wire. SENSIBLECONCLUSION
showed early speed, was carried five wide around the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear under coaxing inside the three-quarter-pole,
dictated terms in the two path around the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch,
was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop inside that marker, remained clear while shortening stride
significantly into the final sixteenth and was caught at the wire while able to get the place. KONG LOVES A FIGHT was bumped on both sides at the start
and last to commence, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, raced two then three wide under urging on the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch then moved further out, pursued the leader on the outside under a strong drive, gained into the final sixteenth and secured the show.
FRONT PORCH was asked leaving the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn, moved
out in upper stretch, shifted further out around the furlong marker, altered course while gaining fast into the final sixteenth then bumped with a foe and
finished willingly for the final spot in the superfecta. EXCURSIONNISTE rounded the first turn in the two path, moved out with six furlongs to run, settled
outside in third position, chased in the four path around the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. CAVE MAN
went to the front, lugged out four wide through the first turn, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole then
switched out, chased three wide on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, was bumped while weakening inside the sixteenth-pole and
lacked the needed response despite picking ground back up in the end. REGAL EMPIRE bumped with a foe at the start, went four then three wide on the
first turn, settled well back on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
SHASTA STAR coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong getting up in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. QUALITY STONES coaxed from the start, dueled with
GUNS BLAZING to her outside widening away from the rest down the backstretch and through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in shaking off her main pace rival nearing the eighth pole, came under growing threat to the outside and was caught
in the final jumps to the wire. GUNS BLAZING dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her inside shaking well clear of the rest, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while just
preserving the show honors. STARSHIP REINA chased along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, offered
up a mild bid a furlong out, then flattened out late missing for the show honors. MISS MI MI chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no headway.

Footnotes
YO CUZ brushed the outside of the gate while veering out at the start, went to the front, was well rated while showing the way well out in the track,
controlled the action in the three path through the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch,
extended the advantage into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a left-handed crop and proved much the best under
good handling. STONE CREATOR broke in at the start then was hustled, moved up to race just behind the early leader, shifted out inside the three-quarter
pole then tracked on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and proved no match while able to
safely secure the place. CARAGATE settled off the pace, was ridden along before the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide,
moved to four wide later on the bend, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. REIGNING CHICK
angled out at the rear under urging early, raced at the back, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, moved to the rail later on that
bend and was no factor. THINKING IT OVER broke in at the start, settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn and failed to respond.
MOAM stumbled after the start, settled on the outside under some coaxing, moved in late on the backstretch, was ridden along in the two path on the turn
and faltered.

Footnotes
REMEMBERMOM four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong overthrowing the top pair inside the final sixteenth, then edged clear to the
finish to prevail. VINCENT hustled from the gate, vied from the four path outside a pair of rivals early on before being briefly shaken off in tandem with
TOUGH WORKOUT nearing the nine-sixteenths, advanced into the turn tucked to the two path to engage TAMBURRO'S SOX once more, this time dueling
through the bend under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, continued the duel getting brushed by his main rival when
seizing narrow command a furlong out, dug in coming in placing TAMBURRO'S SOX in tight a sixteenth out when overhauled in tandem by the top one, ran
on to secure the place honors. TAMBURRO'S SOX hustled from the gate, vied from the two path inside a pair early on before briefly shaking off those rivals
near the nine-sixteenths, came under pressure once more from VINCENT to the outside and dueled through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out,
took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to command, dug in and brushed with his main danger a furlong out headed for the front, fought on inside
getting put in tight with a sixteenth to go when displaced as a pair from the front by the eventual winner and kept on safe for the show honors.
FORESTWOOD LANE coaxed from the gate, raced five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SLUGO coaxed from the start, raced six paths off the inside
down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked four wide and advanced on the front coming under coaxing midway and gaining to briefly latch on the top pair
through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the stretch. OUT OF THE
BREECH bumped at the start by V PATTERN, who broke inwards, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. UNLIKELY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. V PATTERN broke in at the start bumping OUT OF THE
BREECH, raced nine paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to
five wide for home and made no impact. TOUGH WORKOUT hustled from the gate, showed brief speed from the three path vying loosely between foes
getting briefly shaken off near the nine-sixteenths and then for good from the top pair half a mile from home, got coaxed along just off the inside in pursuit
through the turn, faded and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the drive. IGOTTAHAVEIT stumbled badly at the start, then
stumbled quickly again awkwardly when trying to recover his footing and conceded nine to ten lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
detached at the tail of the field just off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed
throughout. Please note that IGOTTAHAVEIT raced with no shoes.
