Footnotes
BADGERVILLE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead under the crop into upper
stretch, responded well in the final furlong and proved best under vigorous urging. CLASH A. J. chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the
turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, reached even terms for the lead into upper stretch, battled outside of the winner to the wire and was outfinished while
able to get the place. LAZZARITO broke a half-step slow then was sent hard, rushed to take the lead, set the pace under some pressure, vied near the rail
on the turn, lost the lead under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. WILD CARP DIEM
was fractious during the warm-up, chased the pace under strong urging down the backstretch, dropped back some while inside to the two path on the turn,
moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. EDDIE THE GREAT broke a half-step slow, was ridden along towards the rear on the
outside, traveled around the turn in the five path and failed to threaten. RESERVATION broke a step slow, dropped well behind while hard ridden, navigated
the turn in the three path and trailed.

FULL MOON FEVER four to five wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked three wide half a mile from home and assumed command inside that station, went
three wide through the turn and into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held clear to the finish. GOOD CULTURE chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HOLDTHEFLIGHT three paths off
the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along, continued five wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors.
CHARGER showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home under challenge to the outside and yielded the front, came under
coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. PRAYER BOOK chased along the inside down the
backstretch coming under coaxing half a mile from home, tipped out four wide through the turn and went four to five wide at the top of the stretch and tired.

CHOOSE HAPPINESS brushed with a foe while last away, was urged along at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, gained under a
drive into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid inside of the leader coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging to narrowly prevail.
WAILIN JOSIE showed good speed, set the pace towards the inside, moved clear around the nine-sixteenths, was asked while inside on the turn, extended
the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, shortened stride into the final furlong, drifted out again
when switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on when headed inside that pole but just missed while able to get the place. EQUAL
MEASURE was sent hard from the start, moved out while urged along off the pace, tucked into the two path for the early part of the turn then shifted four
wide, gained outside into upper stretch, lugged in while getting closer under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, was taken in hand off heels while
continuing to lug in some around the sixteenth-pole and missed while clear for the show. GREATEST LOVE brushed with a foe at the start, pressed then
chased the pace while well out in the track, pursued the pacesetter in the three path around the turn, raced between horses in upper stretch, moved out in
the final furlong and tired. MAKINGCENTS drifted out some early, settled on the far outside, came up empty while four then five wide on the turn and
faltered. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS OMITTED PENDING REVIEW DUE TO A POSSIBLE TIMING ISSUE.

start, raced briefly in the two path before tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing just
inside the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest for the place honors.
STANHOPE two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to take over narrow and brief command swinging five wide into upper stretch, got
roused at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. CONFORMIST coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure to the outside, got headed for the front and swung three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BREW PUB was last to commence, raced at the rear while ridden along, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied to make
a bid near the furlong marker then took a short lead and drew clear in the final sixteenth under steady urging to prove much the best. REGGAE MUSIC MAN
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed
well to make a bid between horses approaching the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and proved no match for the winner while able to secure
the place. BIG BROWN SHOES settled on the outside under some coaxing, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, gained to
make a bid in upper stretch then took a short lead, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and weakened but held the show. LOOKIN
FOR TROUBLE showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled between foes into the
final furlong and also weakened. DEPUTY FLAG set the pace under pressure to his inside, inched clear in the two to three path on the turn, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired. STORM SHOOTER bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, pressed the pace on the inside of
a rival, dropped back along the rail midway through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
PERUVIAN BOY prompted the pace of FAMISHED from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch, got displaced in tandem with that leader just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive coming again to fight gamely to the inside of
ROYAL NUMBER dueling to the finish and just got the nod in the only stride that counts. ROYAL NUMBER bumped at the start by TALE OF MINESHAFT,
who broke in a step at the start, chased two to three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch rallying to take command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under lone threat to the outside and knocked heads to the finish and was nailed in
the very last step losing the bob on the line. FAMISHED established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from the
presence of a pair to his outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home now tucked to the rail, shook off one pace prompter confronted by the other
and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat yielding just inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages while well clear
of the rest for the show honors. TALE OF MINESHAFT broke in a step at the start bumping ROYAL NUMBER, chased four then five wide under coaxing
from midway on the turn, cornered five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. OPT four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung four to five wide at the top of the stretch and tired. ROMAN EMPIRE coaxed from the start, prompted the leader to the outside three then
two wide between foes, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded with five-sixteenths to run and went three to four wide into upper stretch, then tired
in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF JOY disputed the pace on the inside of foes, moved clear near the half-mile pole, drew off along the rail on the turn, responded well under the
crop in the stretch and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. BOHEMIAN RUBY angled out early then moved in inside the three-quarter pole,
went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to get up for the place late. SIR WILLIAM showed speed then
pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match then lost
the place late but was clear for the show. TUESDAY'S CHILD broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and
re-loaded, showed speed then was eased back off the pace, moved out with six furlongs to run, chased four wide on the turn then came five wide into the
stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. RUSH TO HONOR broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace,
went three then four wide on the turn and failed to rally. CROCK OF GOLD contested the early pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went around
the turn in the two path and came up empty. REUNION TOUR moved out while urged along, went around the turn in the six path, came seven wide into the
stretch and was no factor. BELL BOY drifted in at the start, was urged along at the rear, dropped well behind late on the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn, came three wide into the stretch and was eased but walked off.
