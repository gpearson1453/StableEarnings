Footnotes
REMEMBER SUE tracked the early pace while four wide on the first turn, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn, confronted PRAY TO AN ANGEL
nearing the furlong grounds, was put to left-handed urging in the lane and responded in the end to edge clear. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY steadied a bit in tight
quarters into the first turn, saved ground throughout while stalking the pace, stayed to the inside while gaining ground into the stretch run and was outkicked
by the winner in the end, while well clear of the rest. PRAY TO AN ANGEL was away alertly and set the pace to the second turn, drifted out a path leaving
the second turn, was caught nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the late going. BRITTANY BREEZE was forwardly placed while outside of foes to
the half-mile marker, lost ground while three wide on the second turn and faded in the drive.

MAGIC TIGER settled off of the pace while saving ground to the turn, waited for racing room approaching the quarter-marker, angled out for the drive and
surged in the final sixteenth to just get up in time. BOURBONWITHATWIST attended to the pace along the turn from a three wide path, vied for the lead
inside of the sixteenth-marker, led in the final strides and was just nipped on the wire, while holding for second. LUCAS MCCAIN chased the pace from the
midflight while three wide, rallied off of the turn and was outclosed in the final stages, while holding for third. MINSKY (IRE) was away alertly and showed
good early speed while setting quick fractions, led into the final sixteenth but was caught and outfinished, while just missing for third. LASTBESTHOPE
chased the pace outside of foes, was four wide on the turn, swung widest into the drive and closed willingly in the stretch. WINK AND A DREAM was
shuffled back on the run into the turn, saved ground along the bend and weakened in the late going. TIME IS GONE chased the pace from the rear and did
not offer a late rally. DRUMADOON pressed the early fast fractions, lost ground while two wide on the turn and tired in the late stages. SEVERIN tracked the
pace outside of foes, was four wide on the turn while still within aim and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
EL TENAMPA tracked the pace outside of foes to the turn, improved position while three wide nearing the quarter-marker, confronted ELCONDOR in upper
stretch, battled with that rival through the lane and dug in in the late going to prevail. ELCONDOR was away alertly and was sent to set the fractions from a
two wide path, was confronted by EL TENAMPA leaving the bend, battled with that foe through the stretch and could not hold him off in the final stages but
was a clear runner-up. FAIT ACCOMPLI was bumped by NON ESSENTIAL leaving the start, tracked the pace to the turn from a three wide path, lost
ground nearing the quarter-marker and was outfinished in the late going but was clear for third. NON ESSENTIAL broke out at the start and bumped FAIT
ACCOMPLI leaving the break, chased the pace while saving ground to the turn, was steered to the three path on the turn, swung widest into the drive and
made a mild late gain in the closing stages.

Footnotes
SEN SEN was hustled leaving the break to dispute the pace to the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter-marker to confront EMPIRE PASS, shook
free of that foe inside of the furlong grounds and held to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. ALESHA was allowed to settle through the second turn run,
improved position while outside of foes into the stretch and closed well in the late stages to be a clear runner-up. EMPIRE PASS was away alertly and set
contested fractions to the second turn, could not hold off the bid of SEN SEN leaving the bend, gave way in the drive but kept on to be a clear third. GOLD
RUSH GAL exchanged bumps with LADY'S SERMON leaving the break, sat just off of the pace from the mid-flight through the second turn, lost ground into
the stretch and weakened in the drive. LADY'S SERMON bobbled at the start and traded bumps with GOLD RUSH GAL leaving the break, stalked the pace
from a three wide path through the second turn and tired in the late stages. ALISO BEACH saved ground while stalking the pace from the second flight and
lacked a late rally.

shook free of that foe into the stretch run and drew clear in the end. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was allowed to settled through the early stages, was steered
four wide along the second turn, swung widest into the drive, mounted a good late rally in the stretch and while not able to reel in the winner was best of the
rest. FANTASTIC SECRET settled just off of the early initial pace, improved position along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid entering the far
turn to confront BANDEENA, vied for the lead leaving the bend, gave ground into the final furlong and weakened in the final stages. AMERICAN ROYALTY
stalked the pace from the second flight and gave way in the late going. PULPIT SINGER tracked the fractions from a two wide path to the half-mile marker,

Footnotes
ROYAL 'N RANDO stalked the early pace from a two wide path, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, confronted BROOKYS TAPIT nearing
the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. WILL IS CHILL broke in a tangle and was off slowly, settled at the rear of the field while saving ground,
angled out leaving the second turn, made a good rally in the stretch run and while unable to reel in the winner was best of the rest. UNUSUAL CODE was
allowed to settle through the early stages while saving ground, improved position while three wide on the second turn and continued that run to close in the
stretch to secure third. BROOKYS TAPIT was pinched at the start and was hustled to set all of the pace, led into upper stretch, was caught nearing the
furlong grounds and weakened late. HANS GRUBER was sent to attend the pace to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final
stages. DOUBLE THE GOLD saved ground while stalking the pace to the second turn and gave way in the drive. DIMMI QUANDO stalked the early pace
from a three wide path, maintained position while four wide along the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
PSYCHO DAR sat just behind the early quick pace while keeping a two wide path, tipped out leaving the turn to confront SEATTLE BOLD, overtook that foe
leaving the furlong grounds, was kept to task through the lane and drew clear in the end. OUR BOLD PRINCE chased the fast pace from the midflight while
three wide on the turn, found a seam in upper stretch, was roused nearing the furlong grounds and while no match for the winner in the end kept on to best
the rest. R M C HOOK'EM tracked the early pace, was three wide between foes nearing the quarter-marker while vying for the lead, lost ground into the
stretch run and was outfinished in the late going, while holding for third. CHIEF JACKSON was a bit slow in the early going, chased the pace outside of
rivals to the turn, swung widest into the drive and finished evenly in the final stages, while just missing for third. SEATTLE BOLD was away alertly and set
the quick contested pace from a two wide path, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, ceded the lead into the final eighth and weakened in the
late going. DEFENSE WINS hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, saved ground while off of the pace through the turn and did not mount a late
rally. PAPPY BOYINGTON was reluctant to load and a bit fractious in the gate, was away slowly, lacked early speed, was two wide on the turn while trailing
and did not offer a late bid. EXHORTATION saved ground while chasing the pace from the midflight and tired in the stretch run. A MAN'S MAN lost blinkers
soon after the break, disputed the pace to the quarter-marker, lost ground into the stretch and faded in the final stages. MISTER BOLD tracked the pace
outside of foes, came within aim while four wide as part of a quartet vying for the lead nearing the top of the stretch, lost ground into the drive and gave out
in the late stages.
