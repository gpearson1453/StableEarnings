Footnotes
U S N CADEN pressed the early paced, raced four wide into the turn, took control through the turn and drew off as a easy winner. MINISTERTOMYHEART
was unhurried early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out and finished second best. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING was allowed to settle early, raced
five wide into the turn and was along for third. FANTASY SUITE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail and faded. SHACKEY'S LOVE raced in mid
pack and was no threat. TANDES was void of speed and was no factor. REMEMBER THE BULL was allowed to settle early, was eased and vanned off.
