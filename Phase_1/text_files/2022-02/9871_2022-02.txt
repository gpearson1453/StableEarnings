Footnotes
NERVES OF STEEL tracked the pace outside a rival, went two then three wide on the far turn, drew alongside EXPLOSIVE nearing the eighth pole while
drifting inward, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and drew away under hand urging. EXPLOSIVE sped to the front and moved inside, met a bid from DOC
ADAMS on the far turn, kicked clear from that rival leaving the far turn, was soon challenged by NERVES OF STEEL approaching the eighth pole, lost
command in midstretch and stayed on to secure second. LA LA LAND (IRE) settled on the inside then two wide on the first turn, moved into range up the
backstretch, got box in along the rail in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and kept on for the show. SECRET CLUB raced in the two path off the pace,
angled four wide leaving the second bend and flattened in the late stages. DOC ADAMS stalked in the two path, bid two wide on the far turn, could not keep
pace leaving the turn, got crowded between runners in upper stretch and weakened. WILLY THE COBBLER was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground
trailing the field, steered out in the lane and was always outrun.

Footnotes
VERRAGIO dueled around the first turn then pressed into the backstretch, took over at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared midway around the second bend,
led clear into the final sixteenth and held on by a nose. TODAY MATTERS sat off the pace early on and moved into the two path, crept closer up the
backstretch, came out on the far turn and entered the lane four wide, had the rider lose his whip at the eighth pole, rallied steadily in the final furlong and
missed. WHISKEY VISION stalked inside then pulled leaving the first turn to the nine-sixteenths pole, lacked room and had to pause at the three-eighths
pole, remained inside then tipped two wide into the lane, kept on through the drive and got the show. PRINCE ZIGGY suffered a mild shuffle at the start and
steered to the inside, moved out on the backstretch, went two wide into the far turn, angled four wide around that bend and failed to threaten. CROSS
INDIAN stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the lane and weakened. REAL POUCH dueled three wide around the first turn then took control leaving
the bend, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the far turn and was eased to
the wire and walked off.

QUICK FINISH set the pace under pressure, held a short lead from the rail position around the bend, cleared in upper stretch and drew away under hand
urging. GERLACH'S pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch and held the place. SLY stalked
off the rail, put in a mild bid three deep on the turn and was no match in the drive. REBEL WAR took hold near the inside from the five-eighths to the
nine-sixteenths pole, went two wide around the turn and could not rally. ACTIVE ACCOUNT broke a step slow, taken well off the rail, traveled four wide
around the turn and failed to menace. WESTON showed early speed then chased the top pair along the rail through the turn and faded.

SELF ISOLATION sped to the front in the two path, moved inside on the backstretch, took pressure from KITTEN'S KID at the three-eighths pole, shook
free with a quarter mile remaining, drew off under light right-handed urging and was in hand late. ELA CALIMERA MOU steadied on the first turn, pulled
from the nine-sixteenths pole to the half-mile marker, angled to the rail on the far turn and bested the rest. KITTEN'S KID broke a bit slow then went up to be
forwardly place, closest in pursuit from outside in the middle stages, put in a mild bid at the three-eighths pole, lost contact with the winner outside the
quarter pole and flattened to third. SHEZ OUR ARCH broke a step slow and got shuffled back soon after the start, was unhurried outside a rival at the back,
tipped three wide on the far turn and failed to make an impact. TIZ MY PRINCESS steered to the inside early, saved ground to the stretch and was not a
factor. ROYALLY COMMAND was rank along the inside early, drifted out while hard to ride early on the clubhouse turn, tugged closer up the backstretch,
lost ground around the far turn and weakened.

VAROMA lagged behind early, closed in on the far turn while angled out, closed well through the lane and overhauled the runner-up in the late stages.
JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT stalked the pace outside a rival, bid three deep at the quarter pole, cleared in upper stretch and was run down late.
AGREETODISAGREE was off slow from inside then hustled to the front, set the pace along the rail while under pressure, dueled with SKY ON ICE through
the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and churned on to hold the show. SKY ON ICE pressed the pace on the outside, dueled for command on the far
turn and flattened out in the furlong grounds. CECILE'S CHAPTER hit the rail entering the first turn, settled on the inside, tipped to the two path on the
second bend and lacked further response. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, waited behind the top pair on the far turn, swung out into
the stretch and weakened. BADGER KITTEN broke a step slow, settled outside a rival, trailed two wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear in the two path, inched away in the middle stages, opened up on the far turn, coaxed lightly in upper stretch and coasted in
late to win easy. TOUCHDOWN BROWN was off a bit slow from outside, steadied entering the first turn while three wide then angled into the two path,
came out a bit into the backstretch then moved back to the two path while improving position, was closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, failed to make
any headway towards the winner in the stretch run but was clearly second best. WILDER THAN MOST was forwardly placed early and angled to the inside,
moved off the rail on the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. PEACEFUL TRANSFER went two then
three wide around the first turn, moved out further in the middle stages, navigated the second turn four wide and had little left for the drive. SEATTLE BOLD
tracked from inside off the pace, trailed through the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROCKY GIBRALTAR got bumped in the beginning, chased just out of range early, took the turn two then three wide, moved out and rallied five wide in the
furlong grounds and prevailed over OUBABE in final moments. OUBABE broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled in range and steered down to the
inside, went two wide into the lane, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, angled to a clear path then rallied between rivals and missed. ORTH was off
alertly from outside, rated outside the top pair up the backstretch, vied three deep into and around the turn and into the stretch, took over past the eighth
pole, carried the lead into the final sixteenth but was run down by the top pair. CENTRE CIRCLE got bumped from outside leaving the gate, sat off the pace,
saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and kept on for a minor award. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE was off slow and broke in, went up to
press the pace from outside, vied between through the turn, clung to a short lead with a furlong remaining but weakened in the late stages. HOT LEGS
ROMOLO was off slow and came in at the start, went up to take control from inside, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn, fought to midstretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. KID STOLE A KISS broke out and bumped rival at the start, traveled along the inside at the back into the turn, moved out in
the stretch and failed to menace. BIG WILD WEST broke slow, took an awkward step leaving the dirt crossing, went three wide around the bend and was
not a factor.
