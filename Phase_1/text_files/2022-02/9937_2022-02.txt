Footnotes
FISHING FOR FUN was forwardly placed out of the chute and tracked up close three to four wide in early stages, moved up to engage rivals for the lead
with three furlongs left to run, dueled outside of HARD FROST into the lane, dug in under firm handling and kicked clear near the sixteenth pole. HARD
FROST pressed the pace in the opening quarter then moved up to challenge for the lead near the half mile marker, dueled inside of FISHING FOR FUN
around the turn, fought back from the inside into the final furlong then failed to be a match late. GOGEES tracked in close contention up the backstretch,
launched a bid near the quarter pole, sustained a three wide run through the lane and finished well clear over the rest. DANLEY raced five paths wide off the
pace, made a move between foes at the quarter pole, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten the top trio. LOVE IN
PARADISE settled off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn, tipped a path wider for the drive and lacked the needed response for impact.
PAPA CHARLES raced four paths wide in the back, was ridden along five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ASTRAL WEEKS held a slim lead
out of the chute, dueled past the half mile marker and into the turn then came up empty leaving the three-eighths pole. WILDCAT ECHO raced near
midpack, chased four wide around the turn and faded in the lane. TREPID raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the far turn and failed
to move into contention. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM saved ground to no avail. EXQUISITE DUDE showed speed in the opening quarter then steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SPA settled between horses early, advanced through the middle stages remaining in the two-path, took over outside GEMONTEER turning for
home and drove clear while drifting out. GEMONTEER set the pace inside, was no match for the winner through upper stretch, and ran on second best.
CALORIC raced three to four wide throughout, and lacked the needed closing bid. MIRACLE SILVER pressed GEMONTEER from outside for six furlongs,
and weakened. PARLOR was reserved early, and lacked a response in the two-path when roused. FLOWMOTION faded steadily inside.

Footnotes
WHATS GOIN ON set the pace in the three path under a strong hold while appearing to try to get out around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and
widened under a drive. I SAID HEY pressed the winner in the four path, reached near even terms nearing the quarter pole but was no match for that foe in
the lane and just lasted for the place. LUNAR TUNES bumped with TORA LORA LORA just after the start, raced well back in the two path, tipped out in
upper stretch, rallied and just missed second. ANATOLIAN raced off the pace four wide and improved position in the lane. TORA LORA LORA bumped with
LUNAR TUNES soon after the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. ROUGH ENOUGH chased the pace inside and lacked a
closing bid. STORMY STELLA was in range two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, appeared to try to lug in and was taken in hand.

Footnotes
SENSITIVITY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over challengers around the far turn, roused two wide into
the upper stretch, responded gamely and remained clear. ULTIMA COPA was away in good order and raced two wide around the first turn, tracked the pace
up the backstretch, picked up the pace three wide near the quarter pole then was set down three wide for the drive, sustained a solid bid for SESITIVITY but
had to settle for second best. CUMULONIMBUS stalked the pace up the backstretch then sat on hold along the rail at the quarter pole, launched an inside
bid at the head of the lane, sustained steady response and secured a share. WINTER MUSIC was briefly stubborn to load then settled out of the gate and
angled inside, remained reserved three wide in the back, picked up the pace leaving the far turn, got carried out wide into the upper stretch, ran on with
interest and improved position. THEREARENORULES settled two wide off the early pace, launched a five wide bid entering the lane and had a mild
improve. GINGER SPARKLE leaned inward, hit the gate at the start and came away last, raced off the early pace, circled up a bit closer late on the far turn,
ran on five wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. AMAGE hit the gate at the start then settled nicely two wide near midpack through the early
going, hustled up three wide late on the far turn, gained position the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. PATH TO VICTORY saved ground
around the first turn and remained unhurried off the early pace, shifted out wide at the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. RING RUN saved ground
around the first turn then raced inside near midpack up the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the far turn weakened in the lane. LAUGHING LASS
raced up close just off the early leader, continued in close range two wide through the final turn then tired in the drive. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

ALL AROUND advanced three then four wide to loom a threat late on the turn, wrested command outside ASK FOR BODE just past the eighth-pole and
drove clear. ROYAL SQUEEZE was never far back while alternating between the rail and two-path, angled back to the fence into the final furlong and was
up for second. ASK FOR BODE chased outside UNPUBLISHED early, challenged for command three wide after a half-mile, edged away turning for home,
then could not withstand the winner leaving the furlong grounds and gave up the place late. DIZZY GILLESPIE broke a step slowly, and never factored
toward the inside. UNPUBLISHED set the pace inside for a half, and gave way into the lane. OHIO EAGLE bobbled slightly at the start, and was outrun two
to three wide. UNCAPTURED KING showed little three wide.

Footnotes
LUCKY PERIDOT was firmly rated inside, raced between foes down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside, was up near
the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. MADEIRA WINE set a rated pace inside, led to the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner late.
KITTEN'S ROMANCE stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths poled, vied to midstretch and was outfinished. SHORT CIRCUIT saved
ground well back, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. UNICORN SALLY saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn,
angled widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. DANGER was hard held up close inside and weakened in the drive. SPRITE'S LADY played no
factor while racing two and three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FRECCIA D'ARGENTO was forwardly placed out of the chute and stalked the embattled duo three wide up the backstretch, moved up to engage
SEVIENCE FICTION for the lead mid-way around the turn and got carried out wider turning for home, dueled just past the furlong marker then shook free
and widened to clear command. SCIENCE FRICTION dueled with rivals out of the chute and continued to match strides inside of CAJUN COUSIN up the
backstretch, took on the challenge from FRECCIA D'ARGENTO mid-way around the turn, drifted out wider turning for home then straightened for the drive,
fought for the lead into the final furlong then failed to kick on with the winner. QUEEN CAMILLA was reserved and raced four wide in the back, picked up the
pace three wide into the upper stretch, showed response then angled inside past the furlong marker and finished well clear for show. DATTTSAFANCYFOX
stumbled badly at the start and shifted to the outside, was ridden along late on the backstretch, continued in pursuit along the inside around the turn, tipped
wider for the drive and failed to kick on. CAJUN COUSIN vied outside of SCIENCE FICTION up the backstretch, battled on to the mid-way point around the
turn then steadily weakened. DIGNIFIED retreated after the half and lost contact with the field.

SIX MINUS raced four wide through the early going, advanced shifting further out at the top of the stretch, got floated out by TRUPIA through the furlong
grounds, stayed on task and wore that rival down near the finish. TRUPIA settled in midpack two wide early, moved out with a bid between horses in the
three-path turning for home, drifted out clinging to a slim lead with a furlong remaining, and could not hold off the top one. BYE BYE DAVID bumped with
MRBOBBY BRIGHTSIDE at the start, saved ground near the back for six furlongs, moved to the two-path approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly on his
left lead. KANITHAPPEN prompted the pace outside MRBOBBY BRIGHTSIDE to upper stretch, and weakened. MRBOBBY BRIGHTSIDE bumped with
BYE BYE DAVID at the start, set the pace inside for six furlongs, gave way through the lane and was vanned off after the finish. WICKED MOMENT tired
inside after a half-mile. BUT I DID stayed in range three to four wide for six furlongs, and tired. I GEN was no factor two to three wide.

MID DAY IMAGE set a clear pace inside, widened in upper stretch, drifted out through the final furlong and extended the lead under right-handed urging.
MICROPHONE (IRE) chased the winner in the clear two wide, drifted a bit turning for home, could not gain on the winner but held clear of the rest. AVIANO
broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back inside, waited for room around the far turn, got through between in upper stretch and ran on for the show. IN
EFFECT broke outwardly and bumped CALL CURT at the start, raced well back three and four wide and passed tiring rivals. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE)
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. PERFORMING ARTS saved ground to no avail. SEVEN CHANNELS steadied along the first time through
the stretch, saved ground in midpack and never threatened. ROCKSTAR RO was up close inside while quite rank the opening quarter, continued to chase
inside for six furlongs and retreated. CALL CURT was soundly bumped at the start, gave distant chase three wide and was though after six furlongs.

Footnotes
FIRST CAPTAIN settled nicely out of the gate and continued well rated in the back while never far off the frontend, was ridden along three to four wide
around the turn, sustained a steady three wide bid into the lane, gathered strong momentum under left handed pressure in the final sixteenth, finished
gamely and got up in final strides. DOC AMSTER sped to the lead soon after the start and set the early pace, held clear two wide into the upper stretch,
responded under pressure, continued to show the way in final stages then got denied in final stride. DENNIS' MOMENT tracked the pace three to four wide
in early stages, lodged a three wide bid around the turn, sustained a steady effort through the lane and got up for show in closing strides. TROPHY
CHASER stalked the pace along the inside in early stages, headed in pursuit along the rail near the quarter pole, moved up behind the leader with a furlong
left to run then evened out in late stages and got edged for show. REAL TALK stumbled at the start and recovered quickly, raced in early contention two to
three wide, failed to progress under pressure around the turn, came out wider for the drive and steadily faded. HELLO HOT ROD was forwardly placed in
opening stages, continued to race in striking distance of the leader into the turn then came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
LADY PUCHI bumped with MAC THE PEE H DEE at the start, was unhurried for six furlongs near the back, shifted four wide beginning to get in gear past
the quarter-pole, tipped to the far outside once straightened away for the drive, and closed strongly to be along in time. BEACHFRONT BID settled in
midpack for six furlongs, swung five wide into the lane, unleashed a solid rally just inside the winner but was edged at the wire. LAVISH HABITS prompted
the pace three then two wide, bid through midstretch but was outfinished inside the top two. QUEEN MACHA broke a bit awkwardly and was last away,
moved to contention with a four-wide run on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. PIMENOVA bumped with FRIENDSHIP ROAD at the start, set the
pace inside, was clear past the eighth-pole, then was overrun through the last 70 yards. EMPRESS ELLIE saved ground through the turns, and shifted two
wide finishing up one-paced. MAC THE PEE H DEE bumped with LADY PUCHI at the start, stayed close two wide early, and lacked the needed closing
response. INFLUENCING lodged a brief bid three wide between horses a quarter-mile out, but tired in the stretch. FRIENDSHIP ROAD bumped with
PIMENOVA at the break, then bumped with AGRAFFE a stride after that, and posed no threat toward the inside. AGRAFFE bumped with FRIENDSHIP
ROAD just after the start, and trailed throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
