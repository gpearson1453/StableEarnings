Footnotes
OUR SWEET PEA pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear by the quarter pole, then after a couple right handed pops
with the riding crop drew off to prove much the best. SKY OF DREAMS set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the inside, angled off
the inside leaving the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. LIGHTNING ROUND was carried wide into the first turn, then
settled early, and was two wide on the far turn and was along to best the rest. SAW drifted out into the first turn, chased the early pace three to four wide
and tired.

WINDY GLO SAL set the early pace on the inside, drew off on the turn, came off the inside leaving the turn and widened the margin under mild right handed
encouragement. KATESALUCKYGIRL stalked the early pace in between horses, then came three wide into the drive and proved to be no match for the
winner while holding on to the place award gamely. ROSES FROM HEAVEN tracked the early pace four wide, came four wide into the drive and lacked the
needed winning bid, held show award. HOLLYWOOD GINA chased the pace five wide and had no rally. SISTER SADIE was well placed early on the inside
and weakened.

CALCULATED THINKIN was rated along early on the inside, then was asked leaving the five sixteenths and shifted to the three path, closed well in the
drive to go on even terms for command leaving the sixteenth pole and then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. KITTEN'S MAN pressed the early
pace and made a three wide bid to shake clear by the furlong marker, then was headed leaving the sixteenth pole and was outfinished late. KITTEN'S
SOLUTION was reserved early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and shifted to the outside ion the drive and had a belated rally to gain the show
award. YES IT'S ROO was off a step slow, then made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out late, lost show award late. READY AND
RICH was allowed to settle early, then was four wide on the turn and had no rally. HEY CONGRATS set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.

gamely in the drive and held off KATY THE CAT to prove best in a gutsy effort. KATY THE CAT was well placed early and made a three wide bid nearing
the quarter pole and went on even terms with the winner through the lane but was out gamed late to just miss. KIRBY tracked the early pace and made a
four wide bid leaving the turn, then angled in leaving the furlong marker and finished evenly late. GAVIE chased the early pace, then raced on the inside on
the turn and had no rally. LAVELLO broke in the air at the start, then was three wide on the turn and had no rally.

BETTER YET was rated along early from between horses, made a four wide bid when ready leaving the five sixteenths, loomed boldly around the quarter
pole four wide, then drew clear leaving the turn, was given one pop left handed then another right handed with the riding crop, then was wrapped up late to
prove much the best. INTOXICOLOGIST set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the drive but proved to
be no match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. COLOR FORCE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid to vie for
command between horses by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. INTROSPECTION stalked the pace four wide and weakened. CAPABLE was a
bit hard to handle into the first turn, chased the early pace on the inside and tired. IL MIO AMORE failed to menace.

Footnotes
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT was well rated early, eased out and made a three wide move on the turn, hit the front at the quarter pole and drew off in the
stretch under a drive. NOTORIOUS REY vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid to set the pace and move to the inside on the turn, then was headed
by the quarter pole and proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best. MY MAGICAL MAN was fractious in the gate, then vied for the early lead
on the inside and weakened, bested rest. DON TATTO was allowed to settle early on the inside and had no rally. MISTER ARANGUIZ was allowed to settle
early three wide and lacked a rally.
