Footnotes
JOLLY HERETIC came outward at the break, showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes while well off the rail, vied in the two path on
the turn, spun four wide under heavy pressure into upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed. NECROMANCER pressed the
pace on the outside, took a short lead in the four to five path on the turn, spun six wide into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner to the wire and was
denied while clear for the place. PIPITO was fractious in the gate, broke out then was grabbed with the left-rein by the rider, pressed the pace between foes,
vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths, came four wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and
weakened but was best of the rest. ANY MINUTE broke out at the start, chased the early pace then dropped back while moving out under vigorous urging,
went around the turn in the three path, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CLASSY UNION bumped hard with a rival at the
start then was taken up and off slow, spotted the front several lengths, angled in under urging at the rear, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide
late on that bend and was no factor. C. B LOVES A FIGHT moved out while urged along off the pace, dropped back in to travel around the turn in the two
path, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty while continuing on his inside lead to the wire. R BOY CHEEKUM was carried out some at
the start then hard ridden off the pace, went around the turn in the three to four path and capitulated. DR. LEVY bumped hard with an opponent at the start,
was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CREATIVE MAGIC broke out then was
taken up some while corrected, raced near the back while ridden along, went around the turn in the two to three path and showed little.

Footnotes
LADY OF THOROTON three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied tipping out as SCENIC
VIEW shied out in front and collared that rival a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish kept busy to the end. SCENIC VIEW prompted the
leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, seized command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive shying and drifting out under a left handed crop coming under threat to the outside, got collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the
place honors. ALICIA'S WAY broke out a step then bobbled taking an awkward step and was taken in hand conceding four lengths to the front, chased four
paths off the inside detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled seven
wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to be along clear for the show honors. ARABELLAS GIRL chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. WRITE THE CHECK five to six wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the
turn, cornered six wide at the top of the stretch and weakened. THIN LEGS established the front and showed the way in hand two then three wide under
pressure from SCENIC VIEW to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front swinging two to three wide into upper stretch and
tired. ROSEMARY POTATOES chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EXOTIC WEST bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the turn, gained under a drive to
make a bid while floating six wide into upper stretch, battled inside of TIMED OUT, drifted out under a left-handed whip after that foe did the same around
the furlong marker, continued to come out slightly under a continued left-handed crop, bumped with TIMED OUT into the final sixteenth, continued a spirited
tussle while side by side, bumped again with that foe nearing the wire and gamely prevailed. TIMED OUT stalked the pace on the outside, was given her
cue in the five path on the turn, made a bid while floating seven wide into upper stretch then battled outside of EXOTIC WEST, drifted out some into the final
furlong, continued to duel outside of the aforementioned opponent, bumped with EXOTIC WEST into the final sixteenth, bumped again with that foe late and
just missed in a game effort. HONEY MONEY bumped with a rival at the start, moved out under urging then pressed the pace on the outside, chased four
wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and finished willingly for the show. BABA set the pace under pressure, vied
in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage while three wide into upper stretch and tired. VIENNA CODE broke a bit slow, moved out early then settled on
the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GAME THEORY settled at the rear, was
urged three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF TIMED OUT LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST EXOTIC WEST ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
SWEET SOLARE bumped twice with a foe just after the start, moved up to contest the pace on the inside of a rival while off the rail, vied in the two to three
path while still inside that opponent around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under strong
urging. EVERYONELOVESLINDA bumped with an opponent at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path
on the turn, battled with the winner under a drive to the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. CUPIDS GIRL bumped twice with a foe
just after the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved a touch further out and
lacked the needed response but was best of the rest. JABBERWOCK was urged along on the outside, traveled around the turn in the five path and came up
empty. SOLARIS VENTUM bumped with an opponent at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, raced mostly four wide on the turn, dropped
closer to the three path outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. ADAYDREAMBELIEVER broke out then brushed the gate and was off a step slow, was
urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, swerved six wide near the quarter-pole and was no factor. CHARLOTTESOMETIMES was sent hard
from the gate, chased the pace in the two path, floated five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong,
closed strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth then moved clear under good handling. CAPTIVATING CARA set the pace under pressure, moved to a
solo lead in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held the place.
CINDERELLA'S CAUSE pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, chased in the two path on the turn, came under the crop outside the five-sixteenths,
pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. FANCY FELINE broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow,
settled outside under some urging, came under stronger encouragement in the five path on the turn and failed to rally. BIG AL'S GAL moved up with five
furlongs to run, was asked while saving ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend and came up empty. VIOLENTIAM tracked the pace on
the outside, chased in the four path through the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and tired. BIG TONY'S GIRL settled
towards the back, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for
home and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. PRINTRACK showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under pressure, spun three wide for home, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. SILIPO veered out at
the start and was corrected, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MIRACLE NICKY hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and
tired. DONTBELATE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, went eight wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. FLORIDA GATOR chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting put to coaxing three furlongs

Footnotes
EASY SHOT raced well back in the field, saved ground early on the turn, steadied while in tight off heels outside the three-eighths, moved to the three path
shortly thereafter then the four path late on that bend, rallied seven wide into upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid in the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. CRYPTO CASH moved out near the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, was roused three then two wide on the turn,
rallied three wide under a drive into upper stretch, gained to make a bid just inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was denied while able
to get the place. LOST IN ROME settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, came eight wide into upper stretch and finished with good
energy for the show. BOURBON BAY showed speed on the inside of foes then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, came five wide into
upper stretch, gained into the final furlong, loomed a threat into the final sixteenth but was out-kicked while able to get the last spot in the superfecta.
SUPREME AURA raced at the rear of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, swung nine wide into upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. STRIKING SPEED settled off the pace, angled in near the three-quarter pole, moved up with five furlongs to run, chased inside on the turn,
made a brief bid along the rail in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MEXICAN WONDER BOY broke in at the start, moved up
to set the pace, shook clear with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and
tired. BLEWITT showed speed between horses then dropped back outside the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and
had nothing left. AUBURN HILLS showed speed between horses, chased in the three path through the turn and came up empty. LIAM'S FIRE showed
speed on the outside then dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, went five then six wide on the turn, fell back eight wide into the stretch and faded.
