Footnotes
MY SIS CINDY dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued to duel with rival on the turn, entered stretch with a slim margin, met bid from game rival and
edged away late to win decisively. MISS HELEN BACK away well and dueled for lead on the backstretch, continued to press the pace on the turn and into
the stretch, battled gamely in the stretch and came up short when a clear second best. LUCKY MARY chased dueling rivals three wide on the backstretch,
continued three wide on the turn and advanced when scrubbed upon midway through the turn, entered stretch in range and flattened out inside the final
sixteenth. MY TIGRESS chased dueling rivals in between on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, in range entering the stretch and failed to
have the needed kick when asked in the lane. MY BELLA CHICK bumped by inside rival at the start, settled into a stalking trip in between on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch four wide and made a very mild improvement under urging. PROJECT LOGIC broke out and
bumped rival at the start, chased dueling rivals along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and began to lose ground
throughout the turn, finished up one pace in the stretch when asked. FOR MY BROTHER hopped slightly and came away slow, bumped by inside rival as
well, settled into a stalking inside position on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, eased out into the three path in the lane and lacked
rally. EXCESS COIL stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to produce a rally when prompted in the
stretch.
