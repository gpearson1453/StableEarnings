begin to set all the pace, raced just off the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. THE BONDSMAN was off a step
slow, moved up four wide through the stretch drive and gained ground well late. KIDO'S SLING SHOT threw his head in the early stages, raced along the
inside throughout and had no late response. FLUSHING FLASH dropped back early on, raced two to three wide and had not enough in the drive.
RHETTROACTIVE was hustled early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no response. MAHOMEITE was slow early, saved ground and never
threatened.
