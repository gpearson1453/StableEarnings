DOODLE TIME stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, was carried out into the stretch, assumed command and drew off under mild urging. JU JU GUY was
slow early, raced outside, went eight wide leaving the turn, closed well and finished second best. MR. FIREBALL set the pace, swung out leaving the turn,
fell back, went evenly late and held for show. ROUSING RUBBLE angled out entering the turn, went eight wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed
rally. STEPHEN JAMES stalked the pace, bid inside and came up empty. JUST LIKE FRED was never far back, lacked a stretch response and did not
threaten. ROCKTHEPULPIT raced inside, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

didn't have enough late. SNAZZY DRESSER vied between horses and was unable to sustain his bid. OUTLAW vied inside and faltered. SHARP DRESSED
BEAU vied to turn, drew clear and gave way. UNLEASH THE BEAST got boxed in on the turn and through the stretch and dropped back. ELLIOTT BAY

Footnotes
STREET FLYER dueled to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was kept to task. FOXY CARMELA dueled to the turn, fell back and was no match for the
winner. WINDI'S MOMENT was slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to earn show. MONARCHOS PRAYER was never far
back, lacked a stretch response and was outrun. IZE DISCREET ROSE had brief speed only. SLEIGH RIDE was off slowly, crowded in the upper stretch
and outrun.
