Footnotes
SUPERPOSITION came away last at the start and continued reserved in the back, began to edge up a bit closer late on the far turn, was ridden along three
wide into the upper stretch, responded willingly under right-handed pressure and kicked clear. SIX MINUS prompted the pace up the backstretch, dueled
outside BEAU BROWN around the far turn and battled on two wide into the upper stretch, briefly shook free to a slim lead then got overtaken by the winner.
SHIMMERING LIGHT was a bit tight entering the first turn and tugged while headstrong into the backstretch then settled and rated near midpack,
responded under left handed pressure in the upper stretch, loomed closer and secured show. KANITHAPPEN raced outside off the early pace, moved
inside late on the far turn, tipped wider for the drive and improved position. BUT I DID raced inside near midpack through the early going, was ridden along
four wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME tracked in range up the backstretch, continued in contention three
wide around the far turn then flattened in the lane. BEAU BROWN set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, battled back to
mid-stretch then faded. WICKED MOMENT stalked inside up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn and faded. I GEN rated
three wide off the early pace and failed to respond when called upon. MACEDONIAN was not too far back in early stages then began to fade mid-way
through the final turn.

Footnotes
TONE FEELIN set the pace inside, dug in when challenged by KITTEN STREET into upper stretch, and was going away late. LONG BEACH KID was
outrun early, swung four wide coming off the turn, and was up for second near the finish. KITTEN STREET advanced in the three-path to loom a threat after
a half-mile, bid outside TONE FEELIN past the three-sixteenths, then flattened out and lugged in through the last eighth of a mile. MUSTANG CAT was
forwardly placed to the stretch near the two-path, and weakened. ITALIAN CHARM broke slowly, fanned six wide into the stretch and went by tired horses.
UNCAPTURED KING lunged at the break to get away slowly, and never factored. PLATO tired after a half-mile two to three wide. DIZZY GILLESPIE
pressed the early pace outside TONE FEELIN, and was through before completing a half.

left lead in the lane and flattened out while lugging in. CALL ME PENNY prompted the pace between foes in the four path, bid between near the quarter pole
but weakened in the lane. STUPENDOUS was forced in midway down the backstretch, raced three wide in midpack and never threatened. FERMINA DAZA
chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. MAGNOLIA ROAD was outrun while racing five wide. CENTSATIONAL GRACE was off slow,
raced well back three wide and lacked a rally while lugging in through the stretch. LLUVIA was shut off and forced to check near the half-mile pole, saved
ground and made little impact. GRACIAS was forced in and steadied near the half-mile pole and played no further factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
KANAAN settled in hand two wide around the first turn and rated midpack up the backstretch, picked up the pace mid-way through the far turn, given cue
three to four wide in the upper stretch, dug in under left-handed pressure and edged away. KHAFRE secured inside position around the first turn and
stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, remined in close range along the rail late on the far turn, came out a path top stretch, lacked room, bumped with
DEEP STATE and steadied, shifted to the inside and stayed on with good response. DEEP STATE was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked
the pace up the backstretch, roused forward two wide late on the far turn, bumped with KHAFRE in the upper stretch, came back on three wide and
captured show. NORTH CAROLINA cleared and crossed over soon after the start, set the pace to the far turn, dug in on top maintaining a slim lead with a
furlong left to run then came empty in deep stretch. JERRY'S TURN settled two to three wide off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn and had
no response when called upon. FREE SHIPPING raced in the back, saved ground and never threatened. TOLKIEN was not too back in early stages then
steadily retreated around the final turn. RACED WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
KITODAN settled in the second flight for a half-mile, moved swiftly past rivals four wide around the far turn, took over outside BORN A GAMBLER into the
stretch and drew off under a drive. BORN A GAMBLER was never far back, lodged a bid between horses three wide after six furlongs, proved no match for
the winner coming off the far turn, and ran on clearly second best. SOLAR TAP saved ground on the turns, moved out in the stretch and was along for the
show. PURE SPEIGHT set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way readily to challengers. TANG raced three wide much of the way, and lacked the
needed response. FAST N STEADY was never prominent. VITALE pressed the early pace outside, and had nothing left approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
ARROBATIC broke inwardly and a bit slowly, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch, steadily
gained, seized command near the sixteenth pole and cleared off under left-handed urging. SADIE BEAR sped to the front, set the pace a bit off the rail, led
to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. BELLE OF THE BALL stalked the pace three wide, was no match for the top two in the lane but churned
on to best the rest. TEASING chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. RUM SWIZZLE failed to menace while racing three wide. OXOMOC
broke inwardly and bumped OTUMBA, then forced that foe into PRETTY FLATTERING's path a few strides later, steadied entering the turn, saved ground
and was never in contention. OTUMBA was bumped at the start then steadied when forced in soon after, raced four wide around the turn and never
threatened. PRETTY FLATTERING was shut off and forced to check sharply soon after the start, saved ground and was never involved. OSIRIA slammed
into the starting gate to be off last, made some progress between foes down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and was through after a half.

FAVOR settled nicely and stalked while saving ground through early stages, let out a notch mid-way around the turn, moved up to match MI NEGRITA for
the lead at the quarter pole, took over turning for home, widened to a clear advantage under a a hand ride then finished wrapped up. EASY COME EASY
GO raced in range and tracked the pace three to four wide through early stages, came under a ride leaving the three-eighths pole, was no match for the
clear winner but sustained a steady outside bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. MI NEGRITA held a slim lead out of the chute and set the
pace along the rail up the backstretch, took on the challenge from the winner approaching the quarter pole, could not move on with rival leaving the turn and
weakened to show. CANCEL THIS stumbled at the start and came away last, continued reserved in the last flight, was ridden along two wide into the upper
stretch and never threatened. QUEEN CAMILLA raced two wide off the pace and had no response when called upon. ROSY APPLE prompted the pace up
the backstretch, came up empty around the turn, got pulled up approaching the wire and walked off.

YES I'M A BEAST set a pressured pace slightly off the inside, shook off CAJUN LOVER coming into the stretch, and held firm to remain clear. PRINCE OF
IRON advanced after a half-mile three wide, had a clear shot into the stretch, and could not reach the winner despite finishing with good courage. ONE
MORE SCORE saved ground behind the leaders to the stretch, and finished one-paced on the rail well clear of the rest.. CAJUN LOVER pressed YES I'M A
BEAST from outside, challenged midway on the turn, stayed on his left lead through upper stretch and weakened between rivals. FROLIC MAN broke
slowly and was never close. NEVER SATISFIED was outsprinted to the stretch, and dropped far back. VOLBEAT tired after a half-mile, and drifted five wide
coming off the turn.

Footnotes
SAYYAAF set the pace a bit off the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, held clear to deep stretch and held safe under a drive. BAGBOSS was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace three wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and surged late. MEETMEINKINGSTON tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out in
upper stretch, lacked the needed rally and held third. PARTNER'S HOPE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and improved position in
the lane. LORD OF LEGENDS pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. DISCREET TUNE stalked the pace three wide and faded through
the stretch. WORA was off slow, was outrun inside and steadied to avoid the fallen rider in deep stretch. DR. DUKE was bumped at the start, raced well
back three wide then steadied to avoid the fallen rider in deep stretch. CHINOBE raced well back two wide, bolted near the sixteenth pole, lost the rider and
walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED AND FRACTIONS ADDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MISH vied briefly for the lead then edged back to track the top pair, launched a rebid along the rail late on the turn, slipped through the inside of PICKING
UP PENNIES turning for home, took command and held clear under a driving finish. PICKING UP PENNIES vied for the lead between foes in the opening
quarter then held a slim lead over FEAST leaving the backstretch, was ridden along two wide past the quarter pole, got collared when MISH advanced along
the rail late on the turn but stayed on with response and held place. TWICE TOO MANY raced inside off the early pace, picked up then pace late on the
turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid under right-handed pressure and just missed place. THE ICE BEAST raced off the early
pace, was ridden along three to four wide then angled in two wide leaving the turn and had a mild improve. HANDSOME PRINCE chased along the inside
into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and needed more for late impact. FEAST vied for the lead in opening quarter, remained forwardly placed two to
three wide around the turn then gave way. RAISE THE RENT chased in range through early stages, was ridden along three to four wide through the turn
then retreated in the upper stretch. CASALSA showed interest in the opening quarter then dropped back.

Footnotes
GHOSTINYOU advanced slowly but surely through the middle fractions, joined the leaders from outside in the four-path after six furlongs, took over into the
stretch and drove clear. GREG'S HONOR broke two lengths slow and trailed for a half-mile, shifted out four wide rallying off the far turn, had aim outside
through the lane, and finished well to be clearly second best. STREAMING TAP bumped with SQUEEZE ME MIKE a stride from the gate, saved ground
outrun to the far turn, came three wide for the drive and rallied to go well clear of the rest. T VILLE raced close up two to three wide, and weakened through
the stretch. GLOBES vied inside SQUEEZE ME MIKE for six furlongs, and gave way. TAPIT BRIO was three wide to the first turn, and tired after a half mile.
SQUEEZE ME MIKE bumped with STREAMING TAP at the start, contested the pace outside GLOBES for six furlongs, and faltered. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
