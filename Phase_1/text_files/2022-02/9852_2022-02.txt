Footnotes
BOURBON SKY stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped three wide to split rivals entering the lane, bid at the three sixteenths pole, assumed command
shortly after, then held to the wire while hanging on his left lead. DRAFT CHOICE broke a step slowly at the start, tracked in the four path, shifted inwardly
through upper stretch while sustaining a mild advance, and reached place from an outer rival a sixteenth from home. LS'SHOE'S IMAGE dueled for the lead
two wide, cleared entering the lane, but offered little resistance to BOURBON SKY's bid at the three sixteenths pole, then lost place at the sixteenth marker.
STRUTTIN APRIORITY stalked outside of the leading path while staying a path away from those rivals, which allowed for him to be outkicked by an inner
foe entering the lane, then faded in upper stretch, hung on his left lead, and lugged inwardly from right handed urging in the final furlong. ROCK STAR ALEX
laid far back along the inside, and made little impact. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened entering the lane.
JOSAN broke slowly, trailed early on, bolted to the outer part of the track entering the turn, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE HORIZON came in a bit while grabbing an advantage in the opening sixteenth, established a loose lead around the first turn, met a chasing
rival's mild bid turning or home, but readily drew off when let out passing the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure through midstretch, and was kept
to task late. HAVINFUNYET took up between horses soon after the start, lagged well behind the field, swung five wide in upper stretch, and produced a late
kick to reach place in the closing stages. GLANCE broke a bit inwardly, then steadied early on when outer rivals cut across his path, laid off of the pace two
wide, split foes three wide at the furlong grounds to bid for place, but was outfinished by his outer entry-mate late. GOOD MONGOLIA tracked three wide,
shifted four wide in upper stretch, bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by rivals on either side soon after. RANK AND FILE tracked along
the inside, bid for place inside of rivals at the furlong grounds, but flattened out late. ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked two wide, chased the leader turning for
home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, faded, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
SABER RUN broke a step slowly, trailed the field along the inside, commenced a gain in upper stretch, tipped to the five path to be outside of leading rivals
at the furlong grounds, then sustained a rally to reel in the leader in the final sixteenth and drove clear. TRIPPER JOHN dueled along the inside of a rival
while setting quick fractions and speeding away from the rest of the field, shook clear of his counterpart at the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch,
but tired in the final furlong, and was worn down in the final sixteenth, then lasted for place. STEALING APRIORITY tracked three to two wide into the turn,
tipped to the four path in upper stretch chased the clear leader through midstretch before being outkicked by an outer rallying rival at the sixteenth pole, then
failed to reach place. BERNIE SPECIAL tracked the dueling leaders from many length off while in the two path early on, tucked to the rail into the turn, then
chased along the fence through the lane while vying for show, but was outfinished for that position. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER laid off of the pace inside of a
rival while a path off of the rail, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. GREY SLOAN raced at the rear in the three path
around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SPEEDOFTHESPEED dueled for the lead two wide through a quick pace,
but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
ZOFFA settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked in the two path around the far turn, swung outside of the leading trio while commencing a rally
entering the lane, got floated five wide in upper stretch before bidding at the furlong grounds, and drove clear shortly after. MR. PETERKIN tracked along
the inside, patiently awaited racing room entering the lane, tipped three wide at the three sixteenths pole to split foes at the furlong grounds and bid for the
lead, but was outkicked leaving that station. HOT STOVE LEAGUE stalked two wide, gained three wide at the five sixteenths pole to bid outside of the
leading pair entering the lane, drifted four wide while forging an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by rivals on either side leaving the
furlong grounds. RONITHELIMODRIVER settled off of the pace three wide, got caught five to six wide around the far turn, then stayed on the final furlong
with a late kick, but missed reaching show. ANICLUDE trailed, saved ground off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, and
moved up between horses. FILIPPO set the pace along the inside around the first turn, got headed by an outer rushing rival at the five and a half furlong
pole, stalked that rival into the far turn, re-engaged that foe from the outside around that bend, vied between horses in upper stretch, but gave way to outer
rivals at the furlong grounds, and faltered in the final sixteenth. GROOM LAKE tracked three wide, got floated four wide turning for home, then faded five
wide entering the lane. FULL DINNER JACKET tracked four wide into the first turn, rushed around that bend to bid entering the backstretch, vied before
clearing into the far turn, tucked to the rail soon after, but met a pair of bids entering the lane, and weakened at the three sixteenths pole. MATH MAN laid
off of the pace two wide, but was done turning for home.

Footnotes
GLENN'S JUMPER rushed after hopping slightly at the start, prompted the pace setter from the outside, vied in the four path around the turn before seizing
command at the five sixteenths pole, drew off in upper stretch, then tired in the final furlong, but lasted to the wire. THE GRAY BLUR laid off of the pace in
the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead with a belated kick. PRETTY BOY ELM
stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader from the rail through the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival for place late. WARRIORS GEM tracked
in the two path around the turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly before getting outkicked for show at the sixteenth pole. KID
SLIPPER showed the way inside of a pressing rival while staying well off of the inner railing down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the three furlong
pole, but proved no match for his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths marker, then tired through the lane. MOSTA FLYIN took back early and never got
involved. TAPSTER was outrun.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY set the pace along the inside and inched away through the lane. BIG PAPER pressed the leader two wide, but failed to keep pace
at the quarter pole, and held place. CASH ROCKET trailed in the three path before tucking to the rail down the backstretch, bumped an outer rival in upper
stretch while tipping back to the three path, then altered course four wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on late to reach show. SAILOR'S RETURN
broke a beat slowly, pulled inside of foes into the first turn to achieve a pocket stalking position, encountered mild traffic behind the leader at the quarter pole
before that rival kicked away, then chased along the rail while vying for place through midstretch, but tired late, and lost show approaching the wire. DEFIED
laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted two to four wide turning for home, got floated five wide entering the lane, shifted down while attempting a bid for
place at the furlong grounds, but faltered shortly after. ONE MORE BABY tracked three wide, but was bumped four wide by an inner foe while between
horses in upper stretch, and faded.

FOOLISH DREAMS tracked from the three to four path around the turn, then rallied in the final furlong to reel in the tiring leader at the wire. GOLD PUNCH
sped clear, set a fast pace in the two path with a wide lead turning for home, but tired in the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire. BITSY'S CUSTOM C
tracked along the inside, then chased along the rail through the lane, and held show. CRYPTOZONIC settled very far off of the fast pace around the turn,
picked up stride in midstretch, moved out to the six path at the sixteenths pole, and surged belatedly. GRIEF laid far back in the two path, improved inside of
foes through midstretch, but was outfnished for fourth late. MUCHO MARVIN raced off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch,
and failed to threaten. CRUSADER EXPRESS stalked the clear leader from the three path, but weakened between horses passing the quarter pole.
INTHEALY bumped the gate while last away, took the turn in the five to six path, and tired.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR LOKI pressed two wide, bid turning for home, cleared in upper stretch, and drew off in the final furlong under moderate hand urging. ON
YOUR MARK bumped with an inner foe at the start, achieved an inside stalking position after a furlong, but bore a bit outwardly into the turn requiring the
rider to take hold, bumped an outer foe and caused a chain reaction that hindered other outer foes, tucked back to the rail shortly after, tipped to the three
path in upper stretch, split rival at the three sixteenths pole, claimed place at the furlong grounds, and chased the leader home. BIARRITZ stalked three
wide, claimed place in the four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position approaching the furlong grounds, tired thereafter, but
lasted for show. READY TO ROLL bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced at the rear three wide and between horses, but was bumped and carried
wide among troubled foes into the turn, took the bend in the five path before shifting to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on. COMPLEX SYSTEM
broke a bit outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then steadied hard inside rivals at the nine-sixteenths pole to trail the field, then checked behind
troubled foes into the turn, moved out from the three path to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally between horses. CITIZEN WEST took bumps
from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, but was bumped by his inner counterpart into the turn causing him to steady
and bump an outer rival while shifting ground outwardly, then laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, but
failed to factor. SUN STRIKER bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear four wide and outside of foes early on, but was bumped and carried
wide by an inner troubled foe into the turn, got hung out in the six path around the bend, came into the lane in the eight path, and made little impact. JO
DEE'S ANGEL set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid entering the lane, and weakened.

BASEBALL LOVER took a mild bump to his hind quarters at the start, sped clear soon after, then held from an outer chaser rival hanging on his left lead.
TRADER PRICE broke a bit outwardly, stalked three wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and chased the leader home well through the lane.
HUDSON'S TURN nudged an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, but steadied behind a tiring CHEATIN CHARLIE at the three sixteenths pole,
atlered out at the furlong grounds, and improved. AND FIFTY broke a step slowly while being put to tight quarters between horse at the start, laid off of the
pace in the two path and between horses around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up. CHEATIN CHARLIE stalked the clear
leader from the two path, but tired through the lane on his left lead. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS laid off ofthe pace in the four path, and failed to factor.
RISKTAKER was never involved and eased through the final furlong. IRON FORTUNE took the turn in the five path while far back, was outrun thereafter,
and eased late.
