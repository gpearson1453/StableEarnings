Footnotes
MAYBEE A DIVA pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, got through along the rail, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and
extended the lead under mild urging. PALACE STAR bumped at the start while getting away well, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and was all out for
place. SAYITALL was void of early speed, advanced inside on the turn and closed well. PRINCESS ARANTZA dueled to the turn, weakened and faded
through the stretch. MOUNTAIN PASS was checked at the start, moved up outside, challenged three across on the turn and faltered. WISHFUL WON
bumped at the start, lagged while racing outside, went widest in the drive and failed to threaten. SIZZLING GRACE pressed the pace while racing between
horses and stopped into the turn.

Footnotes
MACCHIATO D'ORO set the pace, drew off in the drive and was ridden out. JU JU GUY raced close to the pace, bid three wide on the turn, lacked the
needed rally and held for place. OCULUS veered in at the start, raced close to the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail on the turn, lacked the needed
late response and settled for show. BACK ALLEY CAT was crowded at the start, was slow early, angled out for the drive and lacked a bid. ALPINE
HYPNOSIS pressed the pace, tired into the turn and gave way. SEEKING REFUGE saved ground and failed to contend. BUGLER was crowded and
steadied at the start, raced in the back, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MULLIGAN was hustled along to set the pace, drew away for a clear lead and held in a driving finish. IT'S ALEXUS pressed the pace to the second turn, fell
back, hung late and held for place. IF YOU WANT IT pressed the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn and lacked the needed late response.
SURE ANGEL was off slowly, advanced outside to get within range and had nothing left for the drive. LUCKY STEPPER was not a factor. RED NOVA
pressed the pace, was through after a half and stopped. The fraction of 2468 was removed.

horses, fell back, angled out, closed steadily and gained late . MINING CRYPTO got away well, led early, fell back, challenged on the turn to vie to late
stretch, yielded and held safely for show. SCARRAZANO broke out and was steadied at the start and improved position in a steady effort.
MACHTENHAIRONFIRE veered out at the start, trailed the field and improved position. GYPSY WOMAN saved ground while racing close to the pace,
leveled off in the drive and faded. BUBBAS STREET GAL broke in and bumped at the start, went six wide entering the stretch and lacked a response.
BACK TO BUSINESS broke out and had brief speed only.

urging. COUNT ALEXEI was never far back, raced outside in a steady effort and got up for place while no threat to the winner. UNDENIABLE PROOF was
hustled along to set the pace and faltered near the sixteenth pole. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE raced in the middle of the pack, angled out in the upper stretch and
found his best stride late. MINEHUNTER trailed the field and improved position in a steady effort. OMACHE KID was not a factor. WASSUP BRO raced

Footnotes
CONCUR saved ground, advanced to turn, assumed command, drew off and extended the lead while kept to task. SPIRIT MISSION dueled inside early, fell
back, had no further response and was no match for the winner. JAKE THE GREAT raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid inside and was along for
show. CALL YOU TOMORROW was never far back, raced outside and had nothing left for the drive. MONTANA JACK was through after a half. WESTERN
SMOKE saved ground, lacked a response and was outrun. MARQUE IT UP went widest in the drive and was not urged in the stretch. MAD LUTHER was
through after a half and not urged through the stretch.
