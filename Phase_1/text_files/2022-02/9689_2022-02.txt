Footnotes
KNOW IT ALL AUDREY was bumped hard at the start and forced into another foe, recovered to establish good position just behind the leading trio, drafted
in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked outside the quarter-pole, chased outside under a right-handed crop while still on her inside lead to
the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point, made a bid on the outside shortly thereafter, fought with the runner-up under a continued
right-handed crop to the wire and narrowly prevailed. TIFFANY TALE settled on the outside, was asked while three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at
the five-sixteenths then took the lead, shook clear in the two path into the stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker, dug in determinedly when
challenged by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out again while fighting with that foe late and just missed while well clear for the place.
TONIGHT WE LOVE broke in and brushed with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and weakened but just held the show. ROYAL CURRENCY brushed with an opponent at the start, pressed the pace between horses, took a short lead
at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CAN'T
FOOL ME was bumped hard at the start and nearly unseated the rider, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three wide on the turn and was no
factor. MY CARA MIA MINE brushed with a foe after the start, dropped well back under urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. MENILY
broke in and bumped hard with a foe but came out in front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was headed at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back
under urging along the rail on the turn, moved to the two path late on the bend, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

the leader from the outside three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along

for the show honors. BUREAUCRAT showed the way in hand just off the inside under the watchful eye of JOHNNY FONTAINE latched on to the outside,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home and yielded the front inside that juncture, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. GREAT

Footnotes
DRAFTED broke a half-step slow, settled comfortably at the rear of the field, moved out leaving the backstretch, rallied quickly while four wide midway
through the turn, closed fast to pounce on the leader inside the three-eighths then took over, moved clear while dropping to the three path inside the
five-sixteenths, responded well under a right-handed crop from upper stretch into the final sixteenth then proved much the best while placed under a
hand-ride to the wire. REPO ROCKS broke a half-step slow then was hustled, moved out while just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn,
was driven four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. HAPPY MEDIUM broke out at the start, contested the early
pace on the outside while in hand, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, was asked when confronted by the winner
inside the three-eighths then lost the advantage, dropped back into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. HOPEFUL TREASURE dropped
just off the pace then tracked on the outside, fell back under urging in the three to four path on the turn and came up empty. WAR TOCSIN contested the
early pace on the inside of an opponent, dropped off the pace at the nine-sixteenths, chased inside on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
RED REVOLUTION broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival taking command at the
three-eighths and came under challenge from the runner up to the outside, got placed to coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. NOVA LOVES A FIGHT four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths issuing a challenge
through the latter portion of the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while isolated between that rival and the rest to be
along second best. ILLUSTRIOUS showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing and yielded the front three furlongs from home, spun
three wide into upper stretch and tired while along clear for the show honors. IRIE SPICE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. EL VEINTICUATRO broke out at the start and was corrected,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and gave way. R BOY
CHEEKUM chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. FAZARO
showed brief speed forwardly placed just off the inside, appeared to lose a shoe with six furlongs to run, continued just off the inside through the turn under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and faltered. QUESTION MY SANITY broke out at the start and was corrected before being hustled and coming under a
right handed crop early on, raced seven paths off the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, went five wide through the turn and then eight wide into
upper stretch, trailed and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
RUNABOUT was hustled from the start then taken in hand early, moved out with six furlongs to run, was well placed while rated just off the pace, went three
wide on the turn, ranged up coming to the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole then shook clear, was set down in the four path into upper
stretch, came under one pop of a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop shortly thereafter and held under strong
urging. TWISTED TOM was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out,
pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and missed but was clear for the place. NOBLE THOUGHT broke a step slow, settled
at the rear of the field, was urged two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and improved to just get the show. POTANTICO broke out
and bumped with a rival, contested the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. NUTZFORBOLTZ
raced well back in the field, went four then five wide while moving closer on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. O SHEA
CAN U SEE dropped well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. PLAYWRIGHT charged the front of the gate
just prior to the start, hit the front of the stall and was off a touch slow while bumping with a foe, was ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. BLOOD MOON settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond. HIGH
COMMAND disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN DISTRICT settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside approaching the quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead
into upper stretch then kicked clear under several shakes of the reins, powered away under a moderate hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was geared
down while much the best. THREE JOKERS hit the inside of the gate then bumped with a rival just after the start, raced well back in the field, went four to
five wide on the turn and got up for the place. CASTLE CHAOS was well placed down the backstretch, went three wide under urging on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. DUST DEVIL settled towards the rear of the field, gained in the two
path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response then missed the show. FITZPATRICK settled just off the pace, brushed with
NO BURN outside the five-eighths pole, bumped with that foe around the half-mile pole, chased four wide on the turn and came up empty. STARTING
OVER settled off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. AMERICAN
GENTLEMAN came away in good order, contested the pace on the outside, vied under urging while three then two wide on the turn and tired. NO BURN
bumped with an opponent just after the start, brushed with FITZPATRICK outside the five-eighths, stalked the pace on the outside of the leading duo,
bumped with that same foe near the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn and capitulated. CHOWDA was hustled from the start, moved up to dispute
the pace on the inside of a rival, came up empty in the two path early on the turn and retreated.

EARLY VOTING coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before tipping three to four wide
down the backstretch, settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits, came under light coaxing and shook away from the field from the
three-eighths through the latter portion of the far turn before spinning three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, drew off under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under a left handed crop and drifted out slightly while holding clear to the finish. UN OJO traded a bump at the start with
NONEEDTOWORRY, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field early on, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped out four wide into upper
stretch and closed well to secure the place honors in the final jumps while never threatening the winner. GILDED AGE broke in at the start brushing and
pinching back SMARTEN UP against GRANTHAM, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tipping four to five wide down the backstretch, came
under coaxing five wide three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GRANTHAM bobbled at the break and came
under coaxing to settle just off the inside just off the pace through the first turn, tipped out five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before going
five wide through the far turn, offered up a bid swinging five wide into upper stretch, then kept on one paced through to the finish. NONEEDTOWORRY
traded a bump at the start with UN OJO, raced three wide through the first turn then chased three to four wide down the backstretch, went four to five wide
through the far turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SMARTEN UP got pinched
between foes at the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
COURVOISIER bobbled at the break recovering inwards, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home,
spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. COOKE CREEK three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. MR JEFFERSON three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. UNBRIDLED BOMBER chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and gave way. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed three then two
wide through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn and five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CODE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the action in the three path around the turn, responded well when asked
inside the five-sixteenths, drew off under steady urging into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. RELATE broke in and bumped
with a foe then bobbled, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and proved
no match for the winner while clear for the place. SALUTE TO AMERICA bobbled after the start, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and
lacked the needed response while best of the rest. CURLIN'S WISDOM broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out before the furlong marker and came up empty. MOPED DENNIS settled off the pace, was
urged four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. RAW COURAGE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, showed speed
then was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn and retreated. SILENT RUNNING settled well off the pace, was urged along while
inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. LABAN M MO bumped with a rival at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.
