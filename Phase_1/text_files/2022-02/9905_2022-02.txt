Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT , urged along three wide chasing the a contested pace, angled wider and advanced to take aim outside rivals into the lane, bid five wide
to challenge with a furlong remaining, gained a slim advantage a sixteenth out, sparred outside NANA'S SHOES and prevailed under right handed asking.
NANA'S SHOES , in range between runners near the half mile marker, dropped in then awaited room past the three eighths, got through along the rail in
upper stretch and engaged the leader, put a head in front past the three sixteenths, dueled inside the winner and kept on gamely. FUDGE CAKE sped clear
early while two wide, was joined from her inside near the five eighths pole, battled with WIN THEN GRIN around the turn and into the lane, kept on between
runners in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. WIN THEN GRIN pulled early and went up to the inside of FUDGE CAKE to threaten, dueled and gained a
short lead around the turn, ceded command entering the lane while in the two path, failed to kick on with the leaders leaving the three sixteenths and
weakened. MISS MORENO saved ground while not far back early on, came under pressure around the turn, shifted out and failed to respond. HETTY G.
drifted out at the break, corrected and stalked the early pace four wide, had no response after a half mile and retreated.

PATIENT GAME stalked the pace two wide around the turn, moved up outside HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE in mid stretch, was lightly brushed by that one near
the sixteenth pole and drove clear while racing on his left lead late. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE rushed to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted
out near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. WHAT DOES IT TAKE lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, drifted out in
the stretch and weakened. OPEN THE BOOKS , along the inner rail around the turn, was outrun. MAILMAN'S A FLYER , three deep on the turn, bolted
when his left rein broke mid way on the bend. MAILMAN'S FLYER was deftly pulled up along the outer rail at the head of the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
PEPE AND HEYWOOD quickly went clear and moved out to a lengthy lead under rating, remained confidently handled two wide around the turn and into
the lane, responded when roused in upper stretch, kept on with good energy and was solidly hand ridden to the finish. AWESUMMER , three wide between
rivals nearing the turn, chased outside DESHACKLED from the five sixteenths, continued gamely and out finished that rival for the place. DESHACKLED ,
bumped and in tight at the break, regrouped and angled in nearing the turn, moved two wide between rivals soon after, pursued towards the inside from the
five sixteenths and kept on with effort. LIFESPAN , brushed at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, angled out and lacked a bid. EL
EQUALIZER was hustled up to the inside early on, chased inside rivals, dropped back mid turn and came up empty. THE METHOD , bumped at the break,
lagged back off the pace, raced six wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. TRIGZ TOO , leaned in at the break and bumped a rival, lost ground four
wide pursuing outside rivals into the turn, faltered before going a half mile and was eased late.

HASHTAG LUCKY sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and was under urging in the drive.
AWFULLY FOXY , patiently handled down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, moved over to the two path at the head of the stretch and rallied near
the inner rail. TILSA bobbled slightly at the break, chased the pace in the two path around the turn, floated to the four path turning for home and failed to
rally. SONG OF HONOR , along the inner rail most of the trip, faded in the drive. MI CLEOPATRA AND I , four deep turning for home, lacked a rally.
ELUSIVE AMELIA , never a factor, raced along the inner rail turning for home.

asking in mid stretch and continued to widen while kept alert. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , taken to rate off the rail while stalking the early pace, saw the winner
get away leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide under pressure into the stretch, kept on with some effort and was well clear for the place.
FASHIONISTA , three wide stalking the pace, gave way through the final furlong. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE , off the pace while saving ground, failed to
generate a rally. DAILY PLANET , off the pace and outside a rival early on, circled into the lane but lacked a bid. POP THE CLUTCH saved ground chasing

ACADIAN GIRL , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch, advanced outside MIT MAZEL to secure command approaching the stretch then
eagerly pulled away while ridden out. GOOD MEASURE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and passed tired
foes. MIT MAZEL set the pace along the rail, lost the lead leaving the far turn and weakened through the stretch. LADY FOX , along the inner rail around the
far turn, was outrun. JOANIE'S SUNSET , keen to run leaving the first turn, was three wide entering the backstretch, chased the pace to the far turn then
faltered.

Footnotes
HELIACAL RISING , taken to rate early, angled in advancing near the half mile marker, awaited room while stalking mid turn, found ample room along the
rail soon into the lane, bid soon after then kicked clear, eagerly widen and won under a steady hand ride. MO FIRE grabbed command from between rivals
then edged clear, set the pace two wide, was joined from her inside in upper stretch, failed to repel but kept on willingly to the line to be well clear of the rest.
KOBE'S GIRL , four wide stalking the pace past the five sixteenths, faded. BELLIFY vied inside early on, rated back off the leader then angled out, chased
between foes leaving the three eighths then weakened in the drive. WESTERN LADY settled off the pace, steadied off the winner when that one angled in
nearing the turn, shifted wide and came up empty. SISTER JUNE , six wide nearing the half mile marker, dropped in some to pursue around the turn then
faltered past the five sixteenths.
