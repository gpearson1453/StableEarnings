Footnotes
WITCH MOON settled in the three path on the first turn, closed in on the far turn while easing out to the four path, tipped out in the lane, closed widest of all
and got up in the final moments. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) stalked outside a rival early then off the rail, tipped three wide on the second bend, bid three
deep at the top of the stretch, took over nearing the eighth pole and was caught by the winner late. ACOUSTIC SHADOW prompted the pace from outside,
headed the leader midway around the far turn, dueled into the stretch, vied between in the lane but got outkicked by the top pair. TWIRLING GRACE broke
alertly to take command early, set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled around the far turn, lost command approaching the eighth pole, stayed on
from inside and got edged for the show. SWEET WORKOUT settled in the two path, lacked room to go between rivals near the nine-sixteenths pole, went
around rival and moved inside, closed in leaving the backstretch and far turn, came two wide into the lane, moved further off the rail and needed to find
more late. WIKI WAHINE broke slow, raced greenly along rail early on, dropped back in the middle stages, trailed off the rail into the lane, eased across the
wire and walked off.

Footnotes
LITTLE RACHEL was off slow and broke inward, chased from off the pace, saved ground through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied to the
front at the sixteenth pole and won going away. WITH THIS VOW dueled outside RED PANTY NIGHT for the lead, shook free at the five-sixteenths pole,
led clear into the final furlong, relinquished the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and held the place. FOUNDER'S DAY was fractious in the gate, tracked
three then four wide on the turn, bid three deep in the lane but lacked then needed late punch. BACK ON THE STREET was off a bit slow to begin, lugged
out early on the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, lugged out again at the eight pole and made no impact. RED
PANTY NIGHT dueled for command from inside, lost contact with the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, moved out and chased three wide into the lane and
weakened.

BIG FLAME was off slow to begin, trailed early on, was along the rail into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, steered out widest in the
lane, rallied and got up in time. INCH tracked in range up the backstretch, took the turn two then three wide, reached the front in upper stretch and cleared
at the furlong marker but got nailed by the winner in the final strides. QUANTUM QUEST jumped the dirt crossing early, dueled outside CROSSWORD into
and around the turn, led into the stretch, was overtaken by INCH outside the eighth pole and flattened to third. CROSSWORD bobbled at the start, went up
to duel from inside into and around the turn and weakened in the lane. IM STILL THIRSTY showed early speed three deep, chased the top pair three then
four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LOMA VISTA broke a step slow, got bumped repeatedly while between rivals on the clubhouse turn, angled outside rivals on the backstretch, spun three
wide into the lane, closed fast in deep stretch and inhaled the runner-up. SO SOFTLY sped to the front in the two path, opened up on the backstretch, held
a comfortable lead under coaxing into the stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth but was run down by the winner. HARDDIANE stalked along the
inside, was hard ridden through the far turn and exited that bend two wide, could not threaten the top pair in deep stretch but held the show. WARREN'S
SHOW BIZZ drifted out and bumped LOMA VISTA repeatedly early on the first turn, chased inside off the pace to the stretch and could not rally. ARDIS
raced three wide then got pushed out to the four path on the first turn, rated while wide up the backstretch, continued four wide around the far turn and
weakened. SILENT BEAUTY bobbled a bit at the start, got brushed early on the first turn while three deep, went three wide into the far turn, drifted five wide
at the five-sixteenths pole, steered back to the three path around that bend and was not a factor. LADY SASSAFRAS stumbled leaving the gate, went up
between rivals and pulled a bit on the first turn, ridden along at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked
off.

Footnotes
ZAHRA tucked inside on the first turn, steadied a bit entering the far turn, tipped out to the three path, drew alongside the top pair with a furlong remaining
and drew away. STARSHIP DEFIANT was reluctant to load behind the gate, went up to duel from outside, battled down the stretch but was bested by the
winner. CIRCULODEGANADORAS away quickly from inside, dueled for command with STARSHIP DEFIANT, battled through the second bend and into the
stretch, yielded in the final sixteenth and got put in tight quarters late. DISCERNMENT was prominent between rivals into the first turn then got shuffled back
a bit around the bend, chased in the two path then got floated four wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but could not get up for the show.
HOT ON THE TRAIL stumbled at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, went four deep into the second bend, angled down to the two path and
weakened. MISS TOKYO stumbled leaving the gate, got caught four wide into the first turn, moved down to the three path, raced in range up the
backstretch, got floated five wide into the stretch and weakened. JAMMINJL was a bit fractious in the gate, tossed head shortly after the start, lagged behind
to the stretch and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MARIE cleared early and crossed over to the two path, drew away past the quarter pole and widened under mild encouragement. TRACY DI VICENZO was
off a bit slow from outside, chased widest early on, went five then four wide around the bend and finished willingly to best the rest. DORITA'S HAPPY
dropped back early, traveled along the inside into the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, moved out further in the lane and gained the show. CAYTON
KID was closest in pursuit three wide through the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. LA CHIQUIS tracked from the rail to the turn, angled three wide
leaving the turn and failed to threaten. SAI PHAR was forwardly placed early while drifting out up the backstretch, chased two wide then along the rail into
the lane, drifted out in the lane and weakened. CAT LADY BLUES stalked well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, steered down to the two path and
weakened. MAGICAL WAND broke slow and lost path at the start, trailed four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
DARK VADER was off a bit slow to begin, stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, traveled three wide around the bend, gave chase into the final sixteenth,
then dug in late and outnodded FORE LEFT at the wire. FORE LEFT set the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, led clear into deep stretch,
challenged by DARK VADER late and lost the bob at the wire. TRIPLE TAP stalked off the rail up the backstretch, moved into the two path for the turn,
ridden along past the three-eighths pole, hemmed in by DARK VADER in upper stretch, steered out in midstretch, finished willingly outside the top pair but
had to settle for third. GOING WITH STYLE turned his head and dwelt at the start, trailed along the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF GOING WITH STYLE AND AFTER A REVIEW THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SECRET CLUB unhurried in the beginning and trailed the field, traveled along the inside then moved out on the backstretch, went three wide around the far
turn, rallied outside the top pair and outclosed IF ID TOLD YOU for the victory. IF ID TOLD YOU off slow to begin, raced in mid-pack off the rail, got crowded
a bit past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled four wide leaving the far turn, rallied outside the winner but was too late. DISCRETIONARY DAY tracked in two
wide on the first turn, moved out further on the backstretch, got pinballed between rivals past the seven-sixteenths pole, bid outside on the far turn, dueled
into the stretch, led into the final furlong and yielded late. STONE'S RIVER cleared early and angled to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch,
dueled with rival with a quarter mile left to run, fought back to the furlong grounds and faltered in deep stretch. HAPI HAPI was off slow to begin, advanced
outside rivals up the backstretch, shifted in and bumped past the seven-sixteenths pole, driven four wide into the stretch and weakened. HOOP DREAM
settled inside, tipped three wide leaving the second bend, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally. VERY IRISH reserved in the beginning and moved
to the inside, swung out leaving the far turn and failed to menace. DIVINE RASCAL rated three then two wide outside a rival, got bumped twice near the
seven-sixteenths pole, steadied slightly off heels early on the second bend, raced two wide into the lane and faded. BETITO broke well then ceded control,
rated along the inside, coaxed at the three-eighths pole and tired.
