Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST broke alertly, showed improved speed to quickly sprint clear, set the pace off the rail and lasted. JOYFUL NOISE lacked speed, hugged
the inner rail approaching the stretch, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. PARCHED GHOST , in the two path on the turn, had a mild rally inside
foes. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. LADY MAGICA showed brief speed along the inner rail.
ELOQUENT LADY , outside the winner chasing that one around the turn, drifted very wide entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GREYLOVER dueled two wide outside POWER G through the opening half mile, shook clear under asking into the far turn, braced for a challenge from
BISCOTTO D'ORO past the five sixteenths, ceded command while three wide into the lane, battled back under strong left handed asking inside the furlong
grounds, regained the lead with about seventy yards to go then held firm. BISCOTTO D'ORO broke a step slow, angled out entering the first turn, moved up
four wide outside rivals nearing the half mile marker and took aim on the winner, went on the attack past the five sixteenths, poked a head in front while
dueling into the lane, maintained the advantage to about the sixteenth pole but was out finished. BUSHWICK BRUISER broke inward, was taken to rate off
the contested pace, made a quick bid between runners heading to the half mile marker, chased the leaders three wide into the stretch, shifted in and kept on
with interest. MONOGRAM , well placed off the embattled leaders, moved up between foes leaving the five eighths, was under pressure trying to keep pace
leaving the far turn, stayed on to about the five sixteenths then weakened. POWER G dueled to the inside of the winner for a half mile, was under pressure
into the far turn, failed to kick on and faltered. MY SON CHRIS veered out badly at the break, raced four wide around the first turn, faltered and was eased
through the final quarter mile.

SAMMIE SUNSHINE came out at the break, gained the lead in the two path mid way on the backstretch, opened up on the far turn and prevailed under
intermittent urging. MAVILUS hugged the inner rail and dug in late to hold the place. BREVIARY bore in leaving the starting gate, was four deep on the far
turn and failed to rally. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , bumped then pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path on the far turn and was not a
factor. CAIRO QUEEN , outside horses stalking the pace down the backstretch, faltered in mid stretch and was eased late.

NO MONEY DOWN dropped off the early pace while saving some ground, came under pressure leaving the far turn, moved through a seam along the rail
approaching the stretch, edged up to have aim past the three sixteenths, angled out and responded to some right handed asking, blew past the leader with
a sixteenth to go and eagerly widened while under steady hand encouragement. BOWIE TWO STEP , broke outward and bumped with a rival at the break,
corrected and was hard used between runners to take command and then go clear, opened up a big lead while towards the rail mid turn, kept on past mid
stretch, faded after being headed but remained well clear of the rest. AMICALOLA FALLS was steadied back from between runners into the opening
sixteenth, dropped back into the turn, swung five wide with some momentum into the stretch, straightened and continued on with some interest to gain the
show. I'M NOT SLOW , off the pace, saved ground around the turn and into the lane but lacked a serious finish. MADE TO BE LUCKY , urged along
chasing between runners, came four wide for the drive and faded. KAZU drifted out at the break, raced well back while four wide into the turn, shifted in and
failed to menace. AWESOME STEPHEN , bumped at the break, raced three deep chasing the leader and gave way in upper stretch. GRASPIN' AT
STRAWS , two wide and to the inside of a pair of runners, pursued to upper stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
TOP BOSS disputed the pace racing in the two path between horses, drifted out in mid stretch and dug in tenaciously to prevail. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
stalked the duel, was four deep leaving the turn, loomed in mid stretch and hung. KEEPING THE PEACE lacked speed, raced well off the rail in upper
stretch, was taken up lacking room near the eighth pole, angled in near the sixteenth pole and closed gamely. BEVERLY PARK , three deep around the turn
disputing the pace, was battling in mid stretch then gave way late. PET'S NIGHT was outrun. GRAN CITY was not a factor. PICTOR hugged the inner rail,
disputed the pace to the stretch and faltered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
HUMMIN' THE FUNK settled off the pace and off the inside, moved up between runners leaving the far turn, advanced three to four wide approaching the
stretch, dropped in a bit soon into the lane, made a grinding run under left handed encouragement and split rivals leaving the eighth pole, dueled on a slim
lead through the final seventy yards and held firm. BELLSWILLBERINGING , brushed at the break, prompted the pace three wide, moved up four wide into
the lane, bid outside foes to draw on near even terms past the furlong grounds, battled gamely outside the winner but wasn't quite good enough.
PEARLYVILLE accelerated inside foes leaving the chute and took command, shook clear after a quarter mile, moved away past the three eighths, was
joined by the top pair leaving the eighth pole, gave a bit of resistance then faded. GOT A GOOD REASON rated off the pace, saved ground into the lane,
shifted out in the final furlong and had a mild kick. BAD TEMPER dropped back early, raced three wide into the lane, angled in and failed to menace.
TIKTOKNAWAY drifted out a the break and brushed a foe, forced the early pace between rivals, chased to the inside of BELLSWILLBERINGING around
the turn and weakened. EL MILAGRA forced the early pace four wide outside rivals, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and retreated. BROADWAY
MELODY , between runners early, pursued off the rail past the three eighths and faltered. TIPSY TOURIST , taken to rate early on, saved ground while
within range past the three quarter pole, had no response into the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
IMAGINE THE MOJO vied inside, eased back off the leader down the backstretch, eased out and came back with a two wide bid near the three eighths,
wrested command leaving the five sixteenths, moved clear into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then held sway late. PARTY MONSTER ,
five wide into the first turn, angled in leaving the seven eighths and settled, advanced towards the inside leaving the three eighths, angled out approaching
the lane, closed steadily and narrowly bested KEEN MACHINE for the place. KEEN MACHINE dropped far back early on while saving ground, remained
well back into the far turn, picked up momentum past the three eighths, eased out near the quarter pole, dropped back in for the drive and rallied. SHE'S A
TRIPP hopped slightly at the break, pursued into the first turn, saved ground under pressure leaving the far turn but failed to respond. CIVIL UNREST vied
outside the winner before going clear, opened up a bit after a half mile, was re engaged three furlongs out, fought on to about the quarter pole then gave
way. ICY REPLY , three wide pursuing the pace, failed to kick on past the three furlong pole, faltered and was eased late.
