LAUNCH PAD was unhurried early, rallied outside around the far turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to
be clear late. MIKE OPERATOR set a pressured pace to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. CANDY WOMPUS saved ground, got through
inside on the turn to vie for the lead, didn't have enough late and held for show. HOUSE LIMIT was never far off the pace, bid between horses entering the
turn to get within range and lacked the needed rally. GAGE HAS A GRAY pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back along the backstretch
and lacked the needed late rally. ITSTHATTIME pressed the pace three wide, moved up to contend and gave way on the turn. OCULUS was not a factor.

WHERE'S FRANKIE stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best. TUTTA TERLINGUA vied two across,
inched clear on the turn, responded to duel through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. MISS IMPORTANT lagged early while racing outside,
went six wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and gainied late. BOLD REY raced in the middle of the pack, lacked a late response and failed to
menace. FICTIONAL was void of early speed and improved position in an even effort. FORTUNE'S FREUDE raced close to the pace, bid inside, came up
empty and stopped. MONGOLIAN EMPIRE failed to contend and was not urged stretch. GALILETA broke out, vied to the turn and stopped.

CONQUEST COBRA stalked the pace while racing three across, rallied on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and extended the lead under mild
urging. MAD AT MONEY raced in the back, advanced inside on the turn and closed well to get up for place. START A RUNNIN was sent to the front to set
the pace to the turn, fell back, weakened in the drive and held safely for show. BLANK IT raced in the second flight, bid between horses on the turn, had
nothing left and gave way. PALMY SUNDAE was through after a half, stopped and distanced the field.

of the stretch, closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. GENERAL THAYER was in tight at the start, bid between horses on the
turn, had the rider lose his whip near the three sixteenths pole, yielded in late stretch and was caught for second. AG MINISTER led early, went three wide
between horses on the turn, fell back in the upper stretch and finished evenly. LUVTHEONEURWITH raced in the middle of the pack, lacked the needed

pace to the turn, had nothing left for the drive and faded. DON DANIEL raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. JOKER MATT got away well
and was not factor. HASTA LA VISTA was outrun. AWEZEE was in tight at the start and had brief speed only. PRAYFORTATERS broke awkwardly and

BIBLEMAN vied two across to the turn, drew off for a clear and held safely under mild urging. THIRSTY JUNIOR settled off the pace, angled out on the turn,
closed well and was all out for place. CALL YOU TOMORROW was never far back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and couldn't gain
ground. SQUARED STRAIGHT bumped at the start, went six wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. SIX NINETY ONE improved position in an even effort.
ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE broke slowly, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. MAJOR MUNNINGS lagged early, raced inside and lacked a bid. SAVED BY
ZERO bumped at the start and was outrun. UNDENIABLE PROOF vied inside to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
BURNZ DA BOSS bumped at the start, stalked the pace, challenged four across on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, closed willingly, dueled and
bumped late and proved best. HOLY CROSS awaited room on the turn, bid inside, inched clear, dueled and bumped late and was outfinished in a good
effort. JUROR was unhurried early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed and got up for show. CLASSIC LUCK pressed the pace while racing
inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and finished evenly. GREENBRIER pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, fell back and
went evenly late. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was not a factor. FAST GALLITO went six wide on the first turn, was never far off the pace, angled in for the drive
and lacked a stretch response. ATLATL bumped at the start and was outrun. BUHM'S CANDY BOY set a pressured pace to the second turn, had the rider
check and stopped.
