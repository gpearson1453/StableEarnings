Footnotes
CUSTOMER DRIVEN broke sharply to gain the advantage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace in hand racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, turned
back foes leaving the far turn to edge clear through the stretch and held sway to the end under firm encoutragement. FIVE PRIZES was prompted to a
forward placing racing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, moved to close the gap on that foe after a half, pressed the issue
midway through the far turn into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner late. CULDEE broke inwards brushing LIKING IT TWISTED at the start, was
rated off the second flight while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced four wide racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid three
deep nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. WONDERSTRUCK was prompted through close quarters racing into the first turn to track just
off the pacesetter between rivals, continued in that position to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. LIKING IT TWISTED, brushed at the start, shifted to
the inside while being prompted to a position just off the pacesetter, pulled a bit against light restraint inside foes on the backstretch, continued inside foes
into the far turn and faded into upper stretch. TAHAWEEL dropped out early.

Footnotes
WILD WINTER was settled last along the inside in the opening stages, saved ground through the bend, came through inside foes when presented an
opening to advance racing through the stretch, wrested the advantage in late stages and edged clear. FIREHORN dropped off the second flight in early
stages, switched out nearing the turn, advanced five wide approaching upper stretch, was fanned six wide through the lane but continued with interest to
prevail for the place honors. BLAME BISHOP angled inwards while being urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, was carried
out in upper stretch and weakened late. HIGHLAND PARK HERO, off a bit slowly, was prompted to a position tracking outside foes off the first flight, angled
five wide racing into the lane but had no final bid. STRIKING HEIR, in touch three wide attending the pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue while
being carried out into upper stretch to strike the front but gave out late. OPTIMAL COURAGE angled inwards to track just off the first flight racing into the
turn,

Footnotes
MUTANNAAHY was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset racing a bit off the rail into the turn, shook clear racing through upper stretch
and was kept to firm left handed encouragement. TETON THAI tracked just off the second flight three deep on the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing
into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to gain second late. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX, caught in close quarters and held up outside foes in the
opening stages, settled into stride, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and produced her best stride late to close the gap. EXAGGERATED MOMENT
ducked out at the start cutting off BETH DUTTON and CATCH A RAINBOW while clipping the latter, was righted, then urged to gain contention inside foes
racing into the turn, continued in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch but weakened late. ADRIANA ES BONITA, forwardly placed four wide, continued in
pursuit of the winner outside a rival to upper stretch and faded late. DARESCA, carried out by CRYSTAL STEPS on the backstretch, raced five wide into the
turn and lacked a rally. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper
stretch. MARYMOTHEROF JESUS, slow to gather stride, failed to menace. HARD CURRENCY broke inwards, was righted to track off the first flight
between foes in the opening stages but faded early. BETH DUTTON, cut off at the start, was steadied avoiding a fallen rival while altering course and never
gained contention. CRYSTAL STEPS, held up while caught in close quarters between foes early, drifted outracing through the backstretch impeding
DARESCA and soon retreated. CATCH THE RAINBOW, cut off at the start, clipped heels when losing her path to EXAGGERATED MOMENT and lost her

Footnotes
KING'S MISCHIEF was prompted to a position just off the leaders while angling to the rail racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position saving ground
to upper stretch, tipped out entering the lane and produced a solid closing bid to wrest command then go clear under firm handling. GATE CREW was rated
just out of striking distance along the inside to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. MR.
KRINGLE settled inside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the far turn, tipped off the inside racing through the stretch to split foes in the closing
stages and narrowly prevailed for a share late. SOFT POWER (FR) tracked off the leaders flight outside foes to the backstretch, shifted inwards to race two
deep nearing the lane, was fanned four wide racing through the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. PICASSO was hustled clear of the field along the
inside to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the far turn, then gave out once headed by the winner late. MARV'S MAGIC settled last early
and never gained contention. SECLUDE settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. PIRATE PARADE broke awkwardly, was urged
pursuing the pacesetter just outside that foe racing to the far turn and gave way entering the lane.

Footnotes
STRONG ENDING tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, advanced along the rail on the turn to challenge for command inside foes
entering the lane, wrested the advantage in a prolonged drive but went clear late under firm handling. RUNNING VIOLENCE vied for command between
foes through the backstretch into the turn, continued outside the winner resisting that foe to late stages but proved only second best. WILSHIRE DIAMOND
settled last on the backstretch, swung out nearing upper stretch to split foes five wide and continued willingly in that path to close the gap. ALL FOOLS DAY
angled in tracking off the first flight just outside the eventual winner, gained position between rivals on the turn, switched outside foes nearing upper stretch
while being fanned six wide into the lane and had no final kick. POSEIDEN was urged pressing the pace five wide between foes in the opening stages,
pressed the leaders four wide into the stretch and faded in late stages. SWINGIN FRIAR settled off the second flight racing to the turn, split foes four wide in
upper stretch, then angled inside rivals in the closing stages while gaining some position. DOS VAQUEROS, in touch with the first flight six wide prompting
the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. DENY proved no factor. SARASOTA BOY was urged three deep between foes
pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way in the drive. YOU'RE IN COREY flashed brief pace four wide between foes but
emptied out early. HIGHLY NOTED urged inside foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage while shifting well off the rail racing to the turn, gave way
abruptly once headed nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BLEECKER STREET was rated along the rail behind the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground under patient handling through the far turn, tipped
off the inside racing through upper stretch, then split foes when presented an opening leaving the furlong marker to surge to a clear advantage in time under
firm handling. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn to take over entering
the stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. STUNNING PRINCESS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn,
shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued to make some mild progress. OYSTER BOX angled inwards while
being rated behind the second flight between foes to the backstretch, switched outside rivals racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch
and finished evenly between foes late. NANTUCKET RED, pulling along the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn, faded into upper
stretch. KATAMA MOONLIGHT sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch to the lane, gave
way once headed in late stages. PYTHONESS hopped at the start, was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. MORNING
MOLLY tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded from contention early.

Footnotes
HIDE THE DEMON joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into the turn, dueled into the stretch, then edged
forward in the closing stages under firm encouragement. MYSTIC LINK was settled between foes in the last flight on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance three deep into the turn, split foes in that path nearing upper stretch, angled inside the leaders racing through the stretch to challenge for command
and continued willingly while failing to gain even terms with the winner. BRING ME A CHECK, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn, dueled past midstretch while shifting off the inside and weakened in late stages. A ROSE FOR RAVEN tracked off the first flight outside a rival, angled
out racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late. LORD BARNA was rated off the second flight on the backstretch, steadied slightly nearing the turn,
then continued evenly along the inside. R MERCEDES BOY, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail to track off the first
flight into the turn and faded in late stages. ALLEN settled inside foes on the backstretch and failed to menace. GRAN RUNNER switched out in early
stages while being prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders three, then four wide into the bend and gave way into the lane. BEAR CREEK dropped out early.

SHIRL'S SPEIGHT was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out to advance three wide between
foes racing through the stretch and produced a stout rally under firm encouragement to wrest a clear advantage in time. GET SMOKIN broke readily, set the
pace along the rail from the chute to the far turn, held sway to midstretch but proved no match for the winner. FLORIFORM was urged to a forward placing
between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of that foe to midstretch but finished evenly in the closing stages
while prevailing for a share. ENGLISH BEE tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes racing to the stretch, saved ground to the lane, shifted out a bit under
pressure and weakened late. CLEAR VISION angled inwards leaving the chute to track just off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, tipped out
nearing the lane while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide midstretch and soon faded. DEVAMANI (FR) settled between foes in early stages,
angled out five wide racing into the stretch and made some belated progress. CELLIST, reserved inside foes to the far turn, shifted out racing into upper
stretch but had no closing bid. EONS, reserved inside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, saved ground throughout and gained some position late while
making no real impression. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) tracked the leaders outside rivals behind the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded
nearing the lane. L'IMPERATOR (FR) broke awkwardly, was settled outside foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. FLY LIKE AN EAGLE ducked out at
the start, was collected while switching outside foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch and proved no factor. EPIC BROMANCE, urged to a forward
placing three wide tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the backstretch, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
BRIGHT AND SHINY, forwardly placed four wide racing just off the leaders in the opening quarter, steadily gained on the pacesetter three wide on the turn,
wrested the advantage midstretch and held GONE DREAMING safe under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the first flight four wide between foes
into the turn, then continued willingly outside foes into the stretch to close the gap on the winner. LYRICAL tracked just off the leaders between foes in the
opening stages, tipped out four wide racing through the stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap. BAHAMA PEARL was urged inside foes
disputing the pace through the backstretch, went clear racing into the turn but gave out once headed by the winner midstretch. EMPEROR'S SONG tracked
just off the leaders three deep between foes in the opening quarter, steadied sharply out of close quarters approaching the turn, shifted inwards on the bend
and continued evenly between foes in the drive. CHARGING RENEE was settled off the second flight in early stages, saved ground to the lane and gained
some position in an even effort. CHILLIN LADY ducked in at the start bumping TRULY AMBITIOUS, was righted, then reserved between foes racing to the
turn, then was fanned four wide in the stretch while lacking a closing bid. R TENDERONI settled last to the turn and passed only tiring rivals. FIRST GOLD,
urged along the rail pursuing the leaders into the turn, emptied out into the lane. TRULY AMBITIOUS, bumped, then shut off at the start, was righted to
make brief progress racing five wide into the turn but gave way into the lane. PROSPETTIVA D'ORO tracked the leaders five wide in the opening stages but
dropped out early. THATS JUST HEARSAY urged between foes pressing the pace in the opening quarter, gave way abruptly racing into the bend.

Footnotes
MORGAN'S Z VA, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced readily into the far turn to wrest the advantage nearing
upper stretch and went well clear under firm encouragement. POSTINO'S IDOL tracked the pacesetter three deep just outside the eventual winner to the far
turn, continued with a steady effort advancing with that foe into upper stretch but proved no match late while holding for second. GO YEOWOMEN, reserved
in the last flight along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued with a solid late bid to prevail for a share.
SENSIBLE MYTH tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch while being prompted to advance
but had no late kick. KITTEN WITH A WHIP, reserved between foes to the backstretch, angled inside racing through the far turn, was prompted to advance
inside foes in the stretch but had no late kick. RAKI tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, tipped out entering the lane and faded
between foes late. FINEST JEWEL tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out three deep nearing the lane but came up
empty in the drive. SHE FLED THE SCENE, reserved avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, settled outside foes on the backstretch, swung out five
wide racing into the far turn but offered no rally. GLOVANNA, reserved along the inside in the opening half, emptied out racing into the far turn. CEFALO
raced four wide off the second flight to the backstretch and never gained contention. LIL HOOH'S HOOH, caught five wide racing to the backstretch, proved
no factor. JOSEFA was urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace to the far turn and gave out racing into upper stretch.
