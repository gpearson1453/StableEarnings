DWELLER stalked the leader outside, took over into the stretch and edged away under moderate pressure. PRINCESS EMMA JO was urged within range
three wide and continued gamely to the finish. TITANIC ROSE dropped back early, advanced wide and finished well to gain show. PRINCESS KAIRA saved
ground off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. ZEALACIOUS hustled to the front inside, was collared into the stretch and weakened. LADY
BERNADETTE raced near the inside and began fading on the turn. REMEMBER THIS GAL trailed outside and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WILL TAKE CONTROL prompted the pace three wide, took over on the final turn then drew away while kept to his task. BET ON GRET dueled along the
inside, could not stay with the winner but was second best. BOOK OF DELANCEY saved ground off the dueling trio and rallied mildly. BEACH BANDIT
dueled between foes, steadied briefly between foes near the five eighths pole and weakened. CALLMETHEBREEZE raced within range three wide and
lacked a rally. PREFONTAINE saved ground off the leaders and was never a factor. MERGING TRAFFIC moved briefly closer inside before half a mile then
faltered. GO SKIPPY GO trailed early and was always outrun. NONA RAC broke in a complete tangle losing any chance. ORACABESSA broke very poorly,
chased wide and gave way. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. Claims of foul by the rider of the fourth finisher against the first two
finishers for interference on the backstretch were dismissed.

coasted the final yards. NURTURING veered in after the break, then sped clear to the early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner
turning for home, was no match and remained clear for the place spot. JADE DELTA raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied
mildly inside for third. I'LL MAKE IT COACH raced two wide off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. ARTIE'S ROSE stalked
two wide, chased on the far turn and tired. SOLEMN OATH bobbled at the break, raced five wide early, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn
and failed to threaten. WENDY'S FINE WINE raced four wide early, three wide off the pace and faded. BELONGS TO BABE raced off the pace inside and
