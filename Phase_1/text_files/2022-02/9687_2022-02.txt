Footnotes
ARIZONA SUN pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn and drew clear in the drive under mild urging. MY FIRST PEARL raced close to the
pace outside in a steady effort and earned place while no match for the winner. WHO B DAT was off a step slowly, lagged early, went widest in the drive
and offered a mild bid to get up for show. J T'S LA NENA led early, responded when challenged to vie, came up empty late, fell back and lost position.
FOGGIA pressed the pace while racing inside, was through early and faded. SHESAHEATWAVE trailed the field.

MYSTIC REALITY set the pace, responded to pressure, drew clear and held in a driving finish. DIA DE PAGO stalked the pace, challenged for the lead, not
enough late and held for place. SWAMP SOUFFLE raced in the back, went seven wide leaving the turn, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and
got up for show. BALTIMORE BEECHO pressed the pace while racing between horses, came up empty late and was caught for third. VICENTE'S
SHADOW was crowded at the start, showed good early speed inside, fell back and went evenly late. REELFOOT was not a factor. MISAWA broke out,
pressed the pace while racing inside and was through early.

Footnotes
CASHLINGS stalked the pace, rallied three across on the turn, drew off and kept to task. BEAR BRIAN lagged early, went eight wide entering the stretch
and closed to get up for place. OXBOW PARK was void of early speed, finished well inside and earned show. PARK LANE LAD dueled inside, fell back and
went evenly late. FIGHT ME was never far back, advanced to the turn, bid and came up empty. NOT NECESSARILY raced mid pack, failed to rally and was
not a threat. RISE UP MOSCOW went nine wide leaving the turn and was not a factor. ONE KEENE KAT was outrun. IZEISMAGA dueled to the turn and
stopped.
