NEVER COMPROMISE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady encouragement to hold on well. AMICUS BRIEF raced with the early pace two deep, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a
close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. MOSS BOSS raced hemmed in two deep and between horses at
the heels of Amicus Brief into the first turn and settled close through the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled close three wide
on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BOCK rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole but was of no consequence.

Footnotes
CHINA CAT settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and progressed steadily about the three
path of the far turn, dueled for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards. LADY KAZA stalked two deep then gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely through the stretch to earn the nod for second. EARNED THE SHOT raced
well back to save early ground, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, left the turn widest, dug in to take third under the
wire and just missed second. DINNER AT FIVE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dug in with the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. DUSTWHIRL WONDER settled off the pace about the four path the
first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn five wide, dug in leaving the turn and finished
well. ZIG settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and appeared a factor leaving the eighth pole, but
flattened inside the sixteenth. COURAGEOUS GRACE saved early ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about
the four path then closed the gap in the lane. HARDSCRATCH raced off the early pace about the three path, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened
near the rail on the far turn.

ROOKIE SALSA rated close to the early pace toward the inside, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod between horses
approaching the quarter, drew clear off the rail midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. FU MAN SUE settled off the pace
toward the inside the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths, dug in from the head of the lane
and was gaining on the winner. BOASTER saved ground on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then eased outward and rounded the far
turn about the five path, then dueled through the stretch for third. ANOTHER VICTORY exchanged contact with Tringale leaving the gate and raced off the
pace in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the five path into the far turn and finished
evenly to pass rivals. MARTINKELLY raced with the pace inside the first turn then dueled from the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the
quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. TRINGALE exchanged contact with Another Victory leaving the gate then rated close in the three path the first
turn, started a four wide bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. COMMAND THE CAT raced with the pace two deep

Footnotes
MINISTRY OF MAGIC saved ground while lacking room through the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just
off the rail, eased three wide into the stretch and dug in to get up the final yards. HOT FUDGE SONDE stalked two deep then challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole, dueled for the nod past the five sixteenths, edged clear of RIVER WARRIOR RVF toward the top of the stretch, was steadily encouraged
leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. The latte took over and angled to the rail to rate the pace, dug in to the challenge of Hot Fudge Sonde
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ceded to that one past the five sixteenths but continued a close factor to the head of the lane before weakening.
MASTER THIS settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the far
turn. WARRIOR'S ESTATE saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
IN THE GOSPEL stalked from the three path the first turn and left the turn outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
LATE BREAKING NEWS angled in to stalk two deep, took the lead into the backstretch and pulled himself clear toward the three eighths pole, came under
pressure leaving the five sixteenths, drifted a bit into the stretch but was kept alert to hold on well through the stretch. WONDER HOW moved to the inside
and rated the early pace, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in through the lane to hold
second. HACKER MAN became a bit edgy in the gate and settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail, took third just inside the eighth pole and was gaining on the runner-up. POPPY'S TWO STEP settled off the pace in the
two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride.
BANKER'S ISLAND saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted toward the top of the lane
then weakened. KICHIRO ran in the three path the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and showed only mild response. IRISHTOWN rounded the
opening turn in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. CARTER'S RUN ran in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside
and was never a factor.
