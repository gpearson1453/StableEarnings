between rivals then outside, led narrowly to midstretch but was outfinished. SCARF chased off the pace, advanced inside and was easily third best.
FIFTYSHADESOFRUN dueled along the inside for half a mile and faltered. RUBY DOOBY DOO dropped far behind then passed fading opponents. DON'T
TELL FRANKIE vied three wide down the backstretch then gave way readily. LA LIMA broke slowly and was always far behind. TIME ALTERING lacked
speed and was never in contention. LOVE TO WORK stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

FLIMFLAM MAN went after the pacesetter on the turn, took over into the stretch and drew away under moderate pressure. BUFFALO SHUFFLE quickly
sprinted clear, was collared into the stretch and lasted for the place. DRONE SWARM slow early, advanced very wide with good late energy. ENRAGED
saved ground within range, was asked for run on the turn then tired late. E T'S CANDY MAN moved closer wide into the far turn then flattened out. HORSE
BE WITH YOU chased off the pace between rivals and faded. GO HUSKIES dropped back inside down the backstretch and was no threat. SCOOP DAWG
angled inside early then lacked a response. JOHNNY OIL pursued the loose pacesetter briefly then stopped abruptly. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY broke poorly,
raced well behind, stopped and lost contact with his field.
