STUNT MAN never far back, advanced steadily four then three wide under brisk handling and was along in time. OHIO STRONG battled for the lead two
wide and was caught in the final stages. QUIMBY trailed early and had a mild late rally in the five path. LINO'S KID contested the lead along the inside until
deep stretch then faded. DEXQUIRE matched strides for the lead three wide into the turn then weakened. YOU'RE OUT well placed, failed to respond.
THANKSDAD had brief speed.

GIZMO JONES unhurried early, closed willingly four wide through the stretch, made the lead late and edged clear under a hand ride. COSMIC TREASURE
made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. NOD TO PERSIA pressed the pace
two wide then entire trip and was outfinished despite a game effort. LONGLIVEJUSTICE trailed for nearly six furlongs, swung wide and closed a gap late.
HIGH ROLLING DUDE stalked the pace and went evenly. MAKE THE RULES failed to menace. LAST DROP OF WINE had speed from the start, moved
closer three wide before a half, had speed through the far turn then came up empty. DOUBLE THE LAUGH was through after a half.

Footnotes
MAVI stalked the pace from the inside into the stretch, shifted out two wide past the furlong marker, dug in determinedly and got up in the final strides.
ILLUSIONS OF LOVE was sent to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and was caught in the final stages. HARD TO ACCESS stalked the pace
three wide and went evenly. NATALIA'S TEMPLE passed tiring rivals. CUPP OF CLASS pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. COOKIN ROSES had speed along the inside into the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
OX TROT away alertly, set all the pace under pressure from the runner up and proved best under brisk handling. SPECTACULAR ROAD pressed the pace
two wide and finished second best. MUSICAL MAN never far back, had a mild late rally four wide. MAC'S REVOLUTION unhurried early, closed a gap late
in the four path. SWEET N SILVER with the second flight, finished with good courage two wide. FLEET RUN with the second flight between horses, failed to
respond. ROSAS FOR JIMMY was no factor. MR. CAT with the second flight three wide was through after a half.
