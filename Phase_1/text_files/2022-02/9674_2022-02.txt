SIR OVERANALYZE unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the second turn, rallied down the stretch and drove clear before the wire.
DALE'S LIL BRO went to the front, took command, drove clear, but was no match late for the winner. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, but proved no match late for the top two. THISGUYCANFLY raced within striking distance, weakened and finished evenly. KASENS
TRAIN lacked early speed and was never a threat. MULETRAIN always raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and showed little.

saved ground around the final turn, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for place. TROPHY DADDY raced within
contention, entered the home stretch four wide and was outfinished for second. MEAN CRUISER vied on the front end, weakened and finished evenly.

Footnotes
FLASHY MEG challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and drove clear before the wire. CHARLIE T dueled on the front end, eased back,
came again and got up for second. FIRST I'VE SEEN unhurried in the beginning, raced outside around the turn, made a wide bid and was outfinished for
second. BASALT STREET vied for the early advantage and lacked a late kick. WON DAY dueled inside for the early advantage and weakened down the
home stretch. VALTESSE lacked early speed, finished wide and was no factor. CUSTOM FOR TINA raced near the back, lacked a bid and was outrun.
MILA'S KAT always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
MARILYN'S MAGIC stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. BABY
LOCKOUT pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MY BABY BELE lacked early speed, saved
ground around the second turn, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. CANDY CALL raced near the back, had an outside trip, finished wide,
showed late interest, but was no factor. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE broke poorly, quickly rushed to the front, drove clear and faded. HOLY PEARLS raced
within contention, came around the second turn wide and retreated. MACKENZIE'S HALO always raced near the back, lost contact with the field and was
distanced.
