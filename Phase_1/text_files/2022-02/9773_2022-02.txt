Footnotes
CHARGES DROPPED stalked in the two path early, got bumped late on the first turn, bid two wide outside the leader on the far turn, kept the pressure on
through the lane, headed rival with a sixteenth remaining and dug in late to get up. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) got brushed from outside at the start, controlled the
pace on the inside, met the challenge from CHARGES DROPPED on the far turn, held a short lead into the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly in the
end. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) stalked along the inside, steadied off heels and bumped rival late on the clubhouse turn, stayed inside to the second bend,
angled out on that turn and spun three wide into the lane but lacked the needed late kick. OCTANE (BRZ) broke in and brushed rival at the start, tracked in
the two path then moved to the inside on the far turn, remained along the rail to the stretch and could not summon a necessary bid. KUORA (PER) went four
then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled two then three wide on the second bend and could not rally. DRAMATIZER saved ground off
the pace and was never a factor. GINJA raced in range off the rail, got floated out at the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane and weakened.
TROUVILLE was hard to ride entering the first turn, trailed up the backstretch, entered the lane two wide, steered out in the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA came away well, jumped a shadow early, pressed then went up to duel CAYTON KID for the lead, shook free at the top of the stretch,
powered away under right-handed urging and strong handling and was in hand nearing the wire. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY stumbled badly in the beginning,
trailed up the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn, closed willingly in the lane and nosed out CAYTON KID for second. CAYTON KID bobbled at
the start, sped to the front then dueled inside STOIC LUNA for command, battled that rival through the turn, lost touch with the winner at the top of the
stretch, weakened in the final furlong and lost the place at the wire. TEAM CONCEPT got bumped leaving the gate, tracked off the rail then between rivals,
found the rail in the stretch and could not rally. GOLDEN JOURNEY stalked outside a rival then three deep into and around the turn, remained three wide
into the stretch and weakened. FIVE CIRCLES broke in and bumped TEAM CONCEPT at the start, got shuffled between runners early, had to take back
then angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
EQUILOVE (IRE) was closest in pursuit from outside in the early stages, traveled in the two path around the bid, drew alongside with a furlong left to run,
took over with a sixteenth to go and inched ahead lead. SUITE MADAM BLUE sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, remained clear into the drive,
received a challenge from outside with a furlong to left to run, relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole but stayed on well to the wire. FREEDOM LASS
stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, finished willingly down the stretch and held the show. TRANSLATE stalked outside a rival early
on, between foes into and around the turn, came three wide into the stretch and finished evenly alongside FREEDOM LASS in the furlong grounds.
BESTRELLA (IRE) got bumped back at the start, traveled two wide around the turn, moved out some in the stretch and failed to threaten. VELLA was off a
bit slow to begin, saved ground along the inside to the lane and failed to make an impact. GALLOVIE (GB) stumbled badly leaving the gate, chased four
deep through the turn and came up empty. MISS TOKYO broke in and bumped rival at the start, tracked three deep into and around the turn, then
weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
STARSHIP CHEWBACCA set the pace between rivals early on, held command inside a pair of rivals while in the two path on the turn, shook free at the top
of the stretch and drew away under urging. JAN'S RESERVE raced off the pace, got bumped and crowded between rivals past the five-eighths pole, angled
down to the two path, steered out on the turn and exited the bend four wide and rallied for the place. FOLLOW THE SIGNS came away well, dropped back
to a stalking position, was a bit rank early on the turn, angled down to the two path, steered out in the lane and was along for the show. AROUND THE DIAL
raced up close four deep, went three deep into the turn, lost touch into the drive and weakened. D K'S CROWN pressed the pace from inside up the
backstretch, lost touch with the top trio nearing the turn, chased along the rail to the stretch and weakened. INVICTATATUS pressed the pace three deep
then between rivals into the turn, could not keep up around the bend and weakened. PELICAN WAY came away slowly, got bumped past the five-eighths
pole, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MISS COSTA RICA got bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace from inside, waited for room from the far turn to the eight pole, found a seam with a
sixteenth remaining and surged between rivals to get up in time. SHE'S DEVOTED stumbled and broke out, went up to duel from outside, pressed up the
backstretch, moved up to duel once again on the far turn, battled down the stretch, led late and got nailed at the wire. ALOHA KITTEN dueled for command
from inside, inched ahead on the backstretch, dueled again on the far turn, battled down to the wire and proved a game third. GLESGA GAL (IRE) stalked
the pace outside a rival, drew alongside the top pair three deep on the far turn, vied through the stretch and got outkicked. FEARLESS GIRL (IRE) got
sandwiched at the start, steered to the inside, traveled two wide into the far turn, tipped out past the quarter pole, angled out further in the lane, rallied five
deep but was not enough. MISS ADDIE PRAY veered in and bumped rival at the start, swung five wide leaving the far turn and needed to find more in the
furlong grounds. POP POP'S DREAM settled off the pace, went four deep on the far turn, got bothered past the quarter pole, became rank in upper stretch
and kept on while never threatening. ULTIMATE HY tracked three wide around the first turn, went four wide into the far turn, got put in tight between rivals
past the quarter pole and flattened in the stretch. DERBY QUEST unhurried in the beginning and traveled outside a rival at the back, swung six wide leaving
the far turn, angled inward in upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
FURY KAP broke in and bumped rival at the start, was forwardly placed early then went up to take control from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared
around the bend, was tested again entering the stretch, drifted inward at the eighth pole and cleared again to prove best. SOMETIMES ALWAYS tossed his
head at the start to come away a bit slow, sped to the front while under pressure, was overtaken into the turn, chased along the inside then re-engaged the
leader entering the stretch, got put in tight briefly at the eighth pole halting his momentum, chased the winner to the wire and had to settle for second best.
ME LIKEY raced up close three deep early, chased outside a rival into the turn, took aim three wide into the drive, faltered in the furlong grounds but saved
the show. MUSICAL GEM got hustled from the gate, showed early speed from inside then chased leaving the backstretch, got blocked behind SOMETIMES
ALWAYS past the seven-sixteenths pole, lost some ground on the turn then steered out to the three path and could not rally. SIR FLATTER got bumped
between rivals at the start, sat off the pace well off the rail, went five wide into the turn, angled inside a rival midway around the bend, came three wide into
the drive and lacked a rally. EL DURANGO tracked off the rail in the early stages, entered the turn three wide, moved out and came five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. CIRCLE BACK got brushed at the start, raced off the pace, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path,
steadied off heels briefly at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
STERLING CREST (IRE) stalked the leader in the two path, bid outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared midstretch and inched away.
CARROLL GIRL broke in and brushed rival, tracked three then two wide on the first turn, was asked three wide around the second bend, failed to find the
needed late kick to threaten the winner but finished willingly to hold the place. ISOLA MIA traveled in mid-pack early on, closed in up the backstretch, saved
ground to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out and went between foes at the sixteenth pole and was outkicked for the place. PHENOM broke in
and bumped rival at the start, sped clear to take control held a short lead through the second bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. SWEET TALKED was off slow to begin, went two wide around the first turn, moved out widest on the backstretch, went three wide around the far
turn and could not rally. HEMMERLE went three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, chased two wide into the lane and could not rally. ROCK THE
BOURBON was off slow to begin, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to threaten. TALENTED LADY broke slow and never got involved.
DISTORTED QUEEN fractious in the gate, got bumped leaving the gate, went two wide into the first turn then moved inside, got blocked behind a rival from
the half-mile pole to the three-eighths, traveled two to three wide into stretch and had little left. HAPPY HAPPY was off slow to begin, traveled in the two
path early on, went three deep into the far turn, exited the far turn two wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COVER ME UP came away well and went up to take the lead, let KEROUC come up inside on the clubhouse turn and dueled for command, inched ahead
at the three-eighths pole but was soon challenged again by KEROUAC with a quarter mile left to run, battled down the lane and drew clear late. KEROUAC
chased along the rail into the first turn then went up to duel for command from inside, lost a bit of ground on the far turn then re-bid inside with a quarter mile
left to run, battled COVER ME UP to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. GOT THUNDER took the first turn two then three wide, moved out four wide on the
backstretch, moved into the three path entering the second bend, chased two wide into the stretch and finished well to whittle the gap in the furlong grounds.
CLASSIC MARK broke slow and outward but was quickly correct, pulled into the first turn and had to steady off heels, chased along the inside through the
second bend and churned on for a minor award. NOBLE UNION was caught four then five wide on the first turn, traveled four deep up the backstretch, went
five wide into the far turn, angled down to the rail around the bend and weakened. SENSE OF DOMINANCE went three then four wide on the first turn,
traveled three deep up the backstretch, took the second turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
OURAIKA (FR) tracked along the inside in the early going, angled out into the lane, steered back inside in upper stretch, battled with URBAN in deep stretch
and was all out to prevail. URBAN raced in range outside rivals, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to the front in
midstretch, fought with OURAIKA (FR) in the final sixteenth and got outkicked. KITTY KITANA (GB) came away a step slow, went four wide into the turn, got
forced wide and bumped a rival entering the stretch, closed willingly in the lane and earned the show honors. ELLAMIRA saved ground from off the pace,
looked to rally inside but lost her path at the eighth pole, tipped out and kept on to earn a minor award. BABY STEPS set the pace with SHE'S SO SHINY
then dueled that rival for command, drifted out and brushed at the three-sixteenths pole, held a short lead into the final furlong, lost command in midstretch
and faltered in the late stages. HALF PAST TWELVE stalked two to three wide, angled inward in upper stretch but was no match in the furlong grounds.
SHE'S SO SHINY pressed the pace from outside then moved up to duel down the hill, got brushed by BABY STEPS at the three-sixteenth. IMPEACHD
ALEXANDER (IRE) was off slow and bobbled leaving the gate, raced well off the rail into the turn, got bumped and forced wide into the stretch and could not
recover. DOLLY MAY (IRE) was off a bit slow to begin, raced outside a rival at the back, angled extremely wide to race widest of all and was not a factor. I
GOT A GAL chased between rivals then checked off heels early, came out into the lane and weakened.
