Footnotes
HASHTAG LUCKY drifted out about four wide mid way on the first turn, tracked the leader while in about the five path mid way through the backstretch run,
angled down a bit and went on the attack near the half mile pole, secured command leaving the far turn then cleared off, opened up a commanding lead
while under a drive in mid stretch and was kept alert to the wire. BETCHA BY GOLLY tracked inside, eased out leaving the far turn and was put to pressure,
gave hard chase into the lane and kept on willingly to be clear of the rest. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was hard sent from the gate and angled in entering the first
turn to advance between rivals, steadied in close quarters approaching the backstretch, regrouped then was put to a strong ride near the three eighths,
edged up to the inside of a tiring rival, angled out for the stretch run then flattened out late. IMAGINE VICTORY , off the pace while saving ground, angled
five wide into the lane but lacked a rally. MARKETABILITY broke a step slow, settled off the rail, edged up between runners near the quarter pole, angled
out but lacked a finish. SALAMINA was floated out to about the five path early on, lost ground four to five wide through the backstretch run, failed to go on
leaving the far turn, faltered and was eased late. UNSHAKABLE U opened up early, dropped in to set the pace towards the inside, was collared nearing the
half mile pole, gave little resistance, faltered past the five sixteenths and was eased in the drive.

PANS into the lane, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch then steadily pulled away. HALITE rated forwardly while off the rail, bid three deep mid turn,

and moved up to a stalking position while off the inside, bid between foes nearing the three eighths, battled outside the winner to the three sixteenths then
gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SILENT MALICE drafted back from between runners early on, angled in and edged up near the five eighths, eased
out approaching the stretch, dropped back in for the final furlong and kept on with some interest. ROUGH SEA pulled early while behind rivals, was under
asking outside a foe mid turn and came up empty. O K GAME ON broke a step slow, recovered and moved up to the inside of rivals in the opening quarter
mile, eased back off foes near the half mile pole, chased inside around the turn and gave way. OTHER THINGS EQUAL , five wide outside rivals early on,
gave hard chase four wide mid turn, was in range to upper stretch, failed to kick on and gave way. SPOTTED BULL , in tight at the break, was outrun.

RESPONSE TIME , snugly in hand along the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, advanced outside MAGICAL LUNA,
secured command inside the eighth pole and drew clear. MAGICAL LUNA sped to the early lead, raced in the two path leaving the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, held a clear lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. MOONSAFE , in the two path between horses chasing the pace around the
turn, weakened through the stretch. MATTITUDE bobbled slightly at the break, chased the pace while three deep around the turn and gave way through the
stretch. MARVELLA NASTY , shuffled back approaching the half mile pole, was not a factor. MIT MAZEL , wide on the turn, drifted to the six path in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
BORRACHO sped clear early and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure from two rivals leaving the far turn, edged clear into the lane,
eagerly widened after being set down past the three sixteenths and proved much the best while hand ridden the final yards. REDEEM EDDIE broke a step
slow, was lightly steadied early, stayed inside for the trip and finished up with good energy to gain the place. ARTHUR'S HOPE edged up four wide after a
bit of a sluggish beginning, bid three deep near the three eighths, forced the pace outside the winner to upper stretch, failed to seriously kick on past the
three sixteenths then faded in the final seventy yards. WHISKEY AND YOU , off the pace and off the inside, shifted five wide into the lane and lacked a bid.
KADRI tracked the winner, bid between foes leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and gave way. BOBBY G , off the pace while
saving ground, remained inside for the drive and had belated action.

MOCEPHUS saved ground around the turn, found ample room along the rail through the stretch, took command approaching the eighth pole and drew out.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN , kept well off the rail on the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and weakened. ESPRESSO LUNGO lacked speed, raced along
the inner rail throughout and passed tired horses. MUST BE LOVE , bumped by WE GOT LUCKY leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while three
wide on the turn and gave way through the stretch. SCINTILLIO , between horses on the turn, was not a factor. WE GOT LUCKY bumped MUST BE LOVE
when drifting in leaving the starting gate then was outrun. FULL OF MISCHIEF , four deep leaving the backstretch, faltered.
