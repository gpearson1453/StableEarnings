Footnotes
VIGO came under pressure in the opening stages to secure the lead while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, dictated terms on a narrow advantage
through the backstretch, repelled several challengers while shifting a bit of the inside racing into the lane and widened his advantage late under brisk
handling. DOHKO settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing through the far turn, swung out to split foes four wide nearing upper
stretch and produced a steady late response to just prevail for the place honors on the wire. SWINGIN FRIAR was rated along the rail tracking just off the
leaders in the opening half, tipped off the inside while being urged to advance between foes bidding just outside the winner nearing upper stretch but
flattened out last and lost second at the wire. MISTA DONZELLA tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
shifting out three deep racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late kick. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO broke sharply, prompted the pace outside the
eventual winner to the backstretch, continued between foes into the second bend and faded leaving the far turn. SUPER EDGAR threw his head at the start
while getting away slowly, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch, but drifted out on the far turn, then emptied
out abruptly nearing upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CYBERVIKING angled inwards prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue through the turn, continued in the three path into upper
stretch, gained the advantage while shifting inwards bumping TRIPULANTE racing past the sixteenth marker and narrowly prevailed under firm handling.
The latter was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, tipped off the inside disputing the issue inside
CYBERVIKING into upper stretch, drifted a bit when taking an awkward step midstretch, was quickly corrected, then was bumped racing past the sixteenth
marker and just failed to match the winner's kick. GOLD SPECIAL hopped slightly at the start while breaking last, angled to the inside racing into the turn
and continued well enough to prevail for a share. SHED A TEAR broke readily, tracked just off the leaders three wide racing into the bend but had no
closing bid. MY WAY OR NO WAY tracked just off the leaders between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. SHINBORO settled
along the inside and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF TRIPULANTE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
CYBERVIKING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING
THE STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CYBERVIKING FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
QUEEN TIGER, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, tipped outside that
foe to press the issue nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady effort to wrest the advantage leaving the midstretch to prevail under firm left
handed encouragement. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ angled inwards while moving quickly clear of the field, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the
bend, dueled grudgingly inside the winner past midstretch but proved only second best. RANSOMS REWARD tracked the leaders three wide between foes
leading the second flight on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, then continued evenly in that path to late stages while gaining a share. BUNNY
PRINCESS broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was settled along the inside on the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch and made an
effort to improve position between foes just off the inside late. THE JOKES ON ME switched out four wide in early stages, was prompted in brief pursuit of
the leaders in that path racing into the turn and flattened out in upper stretch. DIALING VALENTINE, carried out by FABIOLA PRINCESS just after the start,
was collected while shifting inwards racing to the turn to track the leaders between foes, but steadily faded into the lane. FABIOLA PRINCESS shied
outwards at the start momentarily impeding DIALING VALENTINE, was collected while angling to the inside in early stages to track the leaders inside foes
in the second flight and gave way nearing the lane. KITTENS MISS MOJO settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
ASPROPODIA tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, steadily gained terms with the
leaders in that path to bid outside foes racing into upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm handling to prevail. JULIE'S GRACE
tipped outside the pacesetter prompting that rival into the bend, dueled for command between foes past midstretch while moving to strike the front but was
just outkicked. FANCYSOUL, off last, settled between foes, split rivals nearing the lane to bid inside the top pair racing into upper stretch and continued
willingly inside those foes to the end while just failing to gain even terms. DEESSE was settled last along the inside early, swung out five wide nearing upper
stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. OB LA DI tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend but steadily
faded entering the stretch. DE PURA SANGRE switched out three wide in early stages, was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders between foes racing
into the turn but came up empty in the drive. IDEAL BREEZE urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the rail, set the pace through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
LATIN NIKKITA broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace racing to the first turn, continued in that fashion to the second bend, pressed the
issue between foes nearing upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue while being headed between calls in the closing stages but narrowly prevailed
under firm right handed encouragement. MUSIC AMORE, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend,
dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch, was headed leaving the furlong marker but contested the issue grudgingly to the end. I'M BUZZY,
caught three deep between foes racing just off the first flight to the first turn, shifted inwards racing through that bend to track just off the leaders a bit off the
inside racing to the far turn, continued under patient handling into the lane, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap
on the top pair. MISS Z tracked just off the leaders while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, steadied sharply avoiding tight quarters approaching the
backstretch, switched outside foes entering the far turn, then advanced to term with the leaders with a sharp, four wide advance nearing upper stretch, bid
three deep for command in the lane while striking the front between calls but flattened out late. STYLE, caught four wide approaching the first turn while
being prompted to contend, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, tipped out three deep
nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. NOVELERA was
settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out gaining momentum racing through the far turn, was fanned six wide racing through the stretch
and continued with an even effort in late stages. SHE NASTY switched off the inside in early stages tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch
and came up empty racing into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MISS Z LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF I'M
BUZZY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

OIL MONEY broke readily, was urged to the lead setting the pace on a clear margin a bit off the rail racing into the turn, shifted out entering the stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement while drawing away late. HE'S SMOKIN NOW was settled last outside foes racing in the four path into the turn, angled
inwards a bit nearing upper stretch, then split rivals three deep in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place honors in time. ARCADIA CALLS
angled inwards soon after the start to track the pacesetter in the three path, was urged pursuing that rival through the turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. EXPENSIVE STYLE tracked the leaders three deep, then in the four path racing into the turn and lacked the late response while being
outfinished for a share. IMPERIAL KING, carried out slightly in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, then faded
along the inside in late stages. SAMAY ducked out slightly at the start, was righted quickly, then urged inside foes in pursuit of the leaders to the bend but
dropped out early.

Footnotes
KATIES A LADY switched out in the opening stages stalking the pacesetter outside a rival under light rating to the backstretch, readily advanced outside
that foe to gain a clear advantage entering the second bend, opened a commanding margin racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm
left handed pressure. SUSANS NOVELA tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out nearing the second bend, was shuffled
a bit avoiding close quarters on the far turn, continued between foes through that bend, then angled three wide entering the stretch while finishing with
interest to prove best of the others. SCOOP THERE IT IS tracked off the second flight outside a rival from just out of striking distance in the opening half,
switched outside a tiring foe while being prompted in pursuit of the winner into the far turn, angled to the inside nearing the lane and continued evenly in late
stages while prevailing for a share. SUMMER HELPER, reserved between foes, then along the inside racing into the backstretch, was taken in hand, then
altered course to race four wide avoiding traffic entering the far turn, then continued in that path to the closing stages while making an effort to improve
position. PERGOLA angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, then steadily faded along the rail nearing the lane. ROYAL
ROCKER was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued three wide between foes racing through the far turn but offered no rally. MURUMBI
settled last along the inside racing to the far turn and proved no threat. STERLINA sprinted to the lead shifting a bit off the rail racing into the first turn, set
the pace through the backstretch and gave out abruptly nearing the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
SCALDING pulled his way to a forward placing three deep racing to the first turn, moved to challenge for command in that path when given his cue racing
into the far turn, took over midway through that bend, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and steadily drew clear while being kept to some right
handed pressure. TAPSASIONAL sped to the lead a bit off the rail in the opening furlong, conceded the lead to attended a rival's pace through the
backstretch, pressed the issue in tandem with the eventual winner between rivals racing into the far turn, couldn't match the winner racing into upper stretch
but proved best of the others. VICARAGE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the second bend while being
prompted to advance, made steady progress four wide to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. IRISH VALOR was rated off the second flight in the
opening stages, angled to the rail midway through the backstretch, was prompted to advance while saving ground through the far turn but lacked the
needed late bid. ISLAND BOY, caught four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, shifted inwards to track three deep in second flight
through the backstretch, continued in that path between foes into the far turn but steadily faded into upper stretch. CARMICHAEL, urged through along the
rail racing to the first turn to gain the advantage in the second furlong, pressed the issue into the backstretch to dictate terms on a narrow advantage to the
second bend but gave way once headed midway through the far turn. BOLD PAYNTER was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch,
continued between foes into the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. FIRSTCADETE switched outside rivals in the opening stages and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
MERCI came through close quarters just after the start, was rated off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling
to the second bend, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, wrested the advantage midstretch and kicked away under
firm encouragement. JIMMY THE BOOT, pulling a bit in the opening stages, was guided to the inside nearing the first turn to stalk just off the leaders to the
backstretch, tipped a bit off the inside on the far turn briefly awaiting an opening, shifted back to the rail in upper stretch when presented an opening to bid
for command inside foes but proved only second best. MOST WANTED MAN, caught in tight quarters just after the start, was reserved outside a rival off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch while angling out five wide and continued well enough to edge a
rival for a share. CALL ME CASSIUS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, switched out
racing through the stretch and continued to improve position three deep between foes to the end. BAILEYS RUN, reluctant to load prior to the start, broke
readily, prompted the pace inside foes to the backstretch, pressed the issue while shifting off the inside racing into upper stretch and faded late. BET, in
touch with the leaders three wide racing to the first turn, was eased back from that position to track off the first flight to the second bend, was urged to lodge
a brief bid three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. DELTA RIDGE, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out entering
the second bend while being prompted to advance between foes but had no rally. ONE COOL DUDE shifted inwards while being urged to prompt a rival's
pace racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes through the far turn and gave way entering upper stretch. REMEMBER THE TUNE was
never a factor. NAVY KING was shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start and soon dropped out.
