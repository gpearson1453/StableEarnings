Footnotes
GREAT STORY broke alertly and was hustled to set the fast pace from an inside path, opened a clear lead into the stretch run and held under urging over
the oncoming runner-up. WALKING BOSS lacked early speed to the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, closed in the late stages and was
unable to reel in the winner in the end but was up in time for the place. UNION WAVE was a bit fractious in the post parade, stalked the fast pace from a two
wide path on the turn, chased GREAT STORY into the stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and was edged out in the final strides for second. GALAN
GRAY saved ground while chasing the pace through the turn and did not offer a final bid in the stretch drive. FAIT ACCOMPLI chased the fast pace outside
of rivals and was done after a half-mile.

Footnotes
LA REINE'S LEGACY was away alertly and took command of the early pace into the first turn, rated nicely through the far turn, extended the lead into the
stretch run and kicked clear in the end. LIAM'S SECRET prompted the pace through the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in
the end by the winner but kept on in the late stages to earn the nod for second. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) stalked the pace from the midflight, gained
ground along the second turn while three wide, was outfinished in the stretch run and was edged out in the final strides for second. ABSOLUTE SCENES
(IRE) hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle through the early going, was steered four wide on the far turn and did not mount a
late rally. BLUE BREEZE saved ground while settling just off of the pace, gained ground on the second turn while along the inside and weakened in the final
stages.

PHILIPIE FAST saved ground while tracking the pace through the turn, shifted out leaving the bend, made a steady advance thorugh the stretch run, reeled
in ON ICE in the final sixteenth and was up in time to prevail. ON ICE was away in good order and was sent to contest the early pace, dueled on the front
end with MORE GUMPTION through the turn, shook clear of that foe leaving the furlong grounds, inched to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth marker but
was reeled in by the winner in the final stages while well clear of the rest. UNION BLISS chased the pace through the turn and was outkicked in the stretch,
while holding for show. ALARMING MOMENT chased the pace from the second flight through the turn and did not mount a final bid in the drive. BUBBLES
IS ON FIRE tracked the early pace to the turn, took up in tight quarters leaving the three furlong marker and finished evenly in the late going. MORE
GUMPTION stumbled at the start, was hustled to dispute the pace through the turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the late stages. SMILING
PATRICK stalked the pace outside of rivals on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LITTLE CASINO stalked the pace from a two wide path through the turn, was roused in upper stretch to confront YOU KIDDING ME, overtook that foe
leaving the furlong marker, edged to a clear lead in the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the fast closing runner-up but held to prevail. CHIEF WILD
EAGLE exchanged bumps with GOOD FOCUS at the start, chased the early pace to the turn, saved ground along the bend, was shifted out in upper
stretch, closed fast in the late stages and pressured the winner in the end but could not reel him in while getting up in time for second. YOU KIDDING ME
was off alertly and was sent to set the pace to the turn, came under pressure from the winner nearing the furlong marker but kept on in the late going to be
an easy third. GOOD FOCUS traded bumps with CHIEF WILD EAGLE at the break, was a bit green and erratic while chasing from the rear into the turn,
was steered four wide along the bend and finished evenly in the late stages. FRISCO KID showed brief speed into the turn and was done approaching the
quarter-marker. B DAWK broke in at the start, recovered and was hustled to stalk the pace to the turn, lost ground into the stretch run and weakened in the
final stages.

Footnotes
FLOYD KNOWLES was off alertly and took command of the pace into the turn, extended the lead into the stretch run, was kept to task through the lane and
drew off in the end as much the best. LOVE THAT KID pressed the early pace to the turn, lost ground on the turn while along the rail inside of two foes, was
no match in the stretch run for the winner but was best of the rest. MAJESTIC LUCK stalked the pace from a two wide path between rivals on the turn and
gave way in the late stages. WIND IN HIS SAIL broke in at the start and was shuffled back soon after the break, was hustled to chase the pace to the turn,
gained ground from a four wide path on the bend and weakened in the stretch. ROISTER saved ground while chasing the pace and tired in the late going.
DANNY'S IRISH BOY stalked the early pace, chased the pacesetter on the turn while three wide and was empty for the stretch run. WELL CRAFTED was
away slowly at the break, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEASIDE DANCER broke sharply and took command of the early pace while in hand through the turn, steadily opened the lead nearing the furlong
grounds, came under late pressure from JAN JAN CAN, was firmly urged in the end and held on to prevail. JAN JAN CAN stalked the pace from a ground
saving position, tipped out leaving the turn, closed in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner in the end but was well clear of the rest for second.
RAMONCITA LIGHT pressed the fractions from a two wide path on the turn, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the drive but held for third.
CLOCHARD STREET chased the pace to the turn between rivals, lost ground while three wide on the turn and tired in the late stages. SOMARA chased the
pace outside of rivals to the turn, lost ground while four wide on the bend and did not have a late response. MISS SKI chased the early pace between rivals
in tight quarters, took back entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch run and weakened in the late going. GEE STREET was shuffled at the start and
away slowly, lacked speed to the turn, was steered three wide along the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HARBOR ABBEY stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, was steered three wide along the second turn, came within aim nearing the
quarter-marker, overtook FRONT OF LINE into the stretch run, felt late pressure from BIG BRAND but held safely in the end. BIG BRAND was allowed to
settle in the early stages while saving ground, took up approaching the far turn to avoid a tiring rival, improved position nearing the quarter-marker while four
wide, continued that rally into the final furlong and could not reel in the winner in the end but was well clear of the rest for second. FRONT OF LINE (GB)
was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace to the far turn, mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter-marker, vied for the lead into the stretch run but
was caught by the winner in upper stretch and flattened out in the late going but kept on to be an easy third. SHE'S EXPENSIVE took back on the first turn
to sit just off of the pace, steadied off of heels into the backstretch run, lost ground while four wide on the far turn and did not rally in the final stages.
ALLISON'S SURPRISE was off a step slowly and was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground while two wide along the second turn and was not
a factor. RUNNING LUCK was hustled leaving the break and contested the pace with NIGHTBIRD, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker,
conceded the lead into the stretch run and faded in the late stages. NORTH DAWN stalked the early pace while three wide on the first turn, was forwardly
placed through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn while two wide, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.
NIGHTBIRD contested the pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back quickly along the second turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off
under her own power.
