Footnotes
INTENSE brushed at the start, vied with rival for the lead two wide, continued two wide on the turn, began to pull away in upper stretch, clear reaching the
sixteenth pole and held safe under steady urging. W. WHITEHOUSE pinballed at the start, settled well off the pace, and advanced two wide through the turn
under a drive, entered stretch three wide, continued to gain one leader in a good effort. SOUL PRODIGY brushed with outside rival at the start, vied for lead
along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and proved no match for the winner and kept on to save show. DAPPER broke
out and bumped rival at the start, stayed along the inside on the backstretch, angled to the three path on the turn and continued three wide into the stretch,
lacked needed response to threaten for a podium position, but did manage to improve a position by catching a tiring rival at the wire. ABOVE THE LAW
bumped both sides at the start, chased duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and weakened in upper stretch.
MARKSMAN ON TARGET broke in and bumped rival at the start, dropped back and saved ground on the turn, continued along the inside into the stretch
and lacked needed bid in the two path.
