edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best in a game score. THUNDER GRUNDER was rated along early, made a four wide move nearing the quarter
pole and gained a short advantage leaving the turn but was outkicked in the furlong grounds, held place award. FLEET IRISH was reserved early, advanced
five wide by the quarter pole and closed well on the outside. AMERICAN FLEET set the early pace while clear and dawdling along, was headed at the
quarter pole and faded in the drive. SOLAR WARMING was off a step slow, stalked the pace two wide and tired.

the wire. WISH FOR PEACE was rated early while four wide, made a three wide move on the turn, and was gaining on the winner late, second best. UNCLE

and had some late gain. BUMBLE MONSTER was bumped by the five eighths marker, then shifted to the outside on the turn and advanced four wide but
had no late rally. DONTSHAKETHEROCKET lacked a rally. FED CHAIR dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered on the turn.

CRAFTY JACK set the early pace while two wide, then was headed by the furlong marker, then was resurgent latye to prevail under a drive. JOCULARITY
tracked the early pace from between horses, then made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then went on even terms for the lead by the furlong
marker, gained a shirt advantage nearing the sixteenth pole but was outfinished late to just miss. MIDDLE EARTH steadied nearing the half mile marker,
then was on the inside and advanced on the turn, shifted out to the two path b y the quarter pole, then dropped back down to the inside leaving the turn,
while making a bid, then angled off the rail leaving the furlong marker and was gaining late. AMERICAN FORCES was bumped at the start, settled early and
was four to five wide on the turn and then had no kick in the drive. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was settled early while moving to the outside, then was four wide
by the quarter pole and shifted out six wide in the stretch to have a belated rally on the outside. MIDTOWN tracked the early pace four wide and weakened.
