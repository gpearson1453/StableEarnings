Footnotes
WHATCHASAID , snugly rated well off the inner rail down the backstretch, angled out on the turn, was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, closed
outside horses, challenged for the lead near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. PEDERSON'S COURAGE stalked the pace outside horses down the
backstretch, was fanned to the six path by UNCLE ROAMIE turning for home, held the lead in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and his rider finished the
final strides with a loose left rein. TRIPLE TITOS saved ground around the turn, raced near the inner rail through the stretch, and flattened out. UNCLE
ROAMIE set the pace off the inner rail, drifted to the five path turning for home and tired the final furlong. POWER BACK , wide leaving the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
PROPER ATTIRE quickly went clear and set a rated pace, was put to asking soon into the lane, opened up under a solid drive past mid stretch and was
kept alert to very late. GIFTED HEART , fidgety in the gate, leaned outward and hit the gate and spotted the field multiple lengths, regrouped and pulled her
way forward from between rivals past the five eighths, tracked in hand outside the winner, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, pursued four wide
in upper stretch and kept on well to the wire. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , in range while saving some ground early on, swung five wide for the drive, moved
up a bit past mid stretch but failed to seriously follow through. UNREQUITED LOVE stalked outside a rival early, was under asking mid turn and faded.

Footnotes
MUTAKAAMIL lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and
drove clear. TOP BOSS disputed the pace outside IT'S SIZZLING TIME, gained a clear lead approaching the eighth pole and held gamely. HAIR OF THE
DOG hugged the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and offered a slight rally. CHARM CITY BAND raced in the two path
on the turn, angled out for the drive and failed to rally. IT'S SIZZLING TIME disputed the pace slightly off the rail and weakened. STAY IN , wide on the turn,
drifted to the seven path turning for home, eased when faltering, pulled up about a furlong after the finish and walked off. DEGAS , three wide on the turn,
faltered in upper stretch.
