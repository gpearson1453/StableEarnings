BEYOND A MILLION controlled the pace inside, repelled a strong challenge at the quarter pole and edged clear through the final eighth. LAUGH IT OFF
settled far behind, split foes rallying, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. IRISH JUMPER saved ground off the pace and continued well while no
threat. BRODY SLAM dropped back in the two path, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out. OUI MADAME chased wide throughout and proved
empty in the stretch. YOURINDENIAL prompted the winner to the stretch then stopped abruptly. PRETTY SPECTACULAR was urged close up inside to the
final turn and faded. MONSTER RISING raced within range for half a mile and stopped.

GIA'S FUEGO moved clear inside to the stretch then extended margin while kept to her task. FROSTED ANGEL chased wide throughout and finished
gamely while no match for the winner. CHELSEA WALL squeezed back early, moved very wide in the stretch rallying too late. CLOUT CHASER came out
at the start then was taken up sharply between rivals soon after and rallied mildly. SO GRACIOUS lagged far behind then passed fading rivals late.
LULINDA'S HEART saved ground close up then gave way through the stretch. TALIA LADYBUG was bumped about soon after the start, pressed the
winner and faded after the quarter pole.

stretch, angled out and finished willingly. KIRTAN dropped back early, moved inside then angled out in the stretch rallying. SHESASUPERFREAK raced
within range between rivals and faded in the stretch. SYSTEMIC RISK set a clear pace along inside, was collared on the turn and gave way. CAUSE I SAID
chased four wide down the backstretch and faltered on the turn. AKNA raced wide off the leaders and stopped after half a mile.
