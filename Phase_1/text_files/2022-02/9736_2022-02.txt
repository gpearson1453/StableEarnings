Footnotes
BABA came away well then was sent hard, set the pace under heavy pressure to the outside while off the rail, vied in the two path under urging while still
inside an opponent around the turn,, shook clear in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a left-handed crop until near the sixteenth-pole then was
placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. HYDRA brushed the inside of the gate at the start and was off a step slow, was urged along at the
rear, went two to three wide under strong encouragement on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and got up for the place while no match for the
winner. VIOLENT POINT pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, swapped back to
her inside lead inside the furlong marker and weakened then lost the place but was clear for third. STARSHIP REINA was well placed just off the pace,
dropped back at the nine-sixteenths, saved ground under urging on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
VIRADIA stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, took over passing the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path while moving
clear at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under the crop into the final furlong, drifted out late and held under strong urging. BARISTA VIXEN settled
just off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to her
inside lead at that juncture, went back to the proper lead while gaining at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly but missed while well clear for second. MY
GIRL LEXI set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch
and tired while just able to get the show. SHADOLAMO dropped back early and showed no speed, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and was no factor. AMOS pressed the pace loosely between foes, vied between horses in the two path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend
and capitulated. WHISPERING ROSE broke a bit slow then was taken up early, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and
trailed.

WAHEEL hustled from the gate, dueled from the four path down the backstretch before briefly tucking three wide and then two wide into the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held sway to prevail.
LORD BROWNIE coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn getting placed to
coaxing three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. HOW YOU FEELING hustled from the start, chased
along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path briefly near the half mile pole, went three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE hustled from the gate, dueled from
the three path with WAHEEL to his outside, tucked inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, began to get shaken off spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. JOE GONZALEZ coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SOMETHING MAJESTIC chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths and made no impact. ALMOND CIDER vied briefly from the two path before giving chase, tucked inside through the turn and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. PURSUIT OF JUSTICE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, got placed to a protective hold and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) was hustled from the start, established a good position just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused
inside the three-eighths, came out into upper stretch, rallied to the lead just inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging to prove much the
best. GRAN CASIQUE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner then was vanned off following the race. LOHENGRIN TWO set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was
headed by the winner and weakened but was clear for the show. TALE OF MIST settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, drifted inward in
upper stretch and came up empty. DREAM BIGGER was hustled from the start, settled just off the pace, chased in the three path through the turn and tired.
SUMMER BOURBON settled off the pace, was asked while two to three wide on the turn, ducked in sharply in upper stretch then was taken up against the
rail and had nothing left. COOL QUARTET climbed while dropping back between horses early, fell well behind the rest of the field, went two to three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
RUBY BLEU three then two wide through the first turn, knocked heads in hand with CHRIS AND DAVE along his inside, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths and shook off his main pace rival confronted outside by AIR ATTACK, had that rival get on near even terms when spinning three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive rebuffing that challenge now engaged by PRETTY GOOD YEAR through the final furlong head to head and stubbornly
repelled that rival to the finish unwilling to be denied. PRETTY GOOD YEAR broke a beat slow and brushed the near side stall at the start getting away last
and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced just off the inside at the tail of the field before tipping to the four path down the
backstretch, tucked briefly to the two path at the nine-sixteenths before going three to four wide through the far turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to close in outside and was on near even terms for the front from just inside the eighth pole to
just inside the sixteenth marker, but was ultimately repelled to the finish. AIR ATTACK saved ground through the first turn before chasing three wide down
the backstretch and into the far turn, commenced a three wide bid three furlongs from home advancing outside the top pair to be heads apart for command
when swinging four wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive and was shaken off inside the final furlong weakening in the late stages while clear
for the show honors. BATTALION chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. CHRIS AND DAVE hustled from the gate, led early on before dueling in hand with RUBY BLEU to his outside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths headed for the front, faded nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. TWO THIRTY FIVE
fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
WATER'S EDGE was taken in hand early then moved outside the early pacesetter, rounded the opening bend in the three path, moved to the lead inside
the three-quarter pole, shook clear outside the half-mile pole, was asked in the two path while challenged on the far turn, lost the lead briefly to the
runner-up in upper stretch, fought back gamely on the inside to regain the advantage before the eighth-pole, dueled in the final furlong and proved best
under strong urging. NO SALT broke in a bit at the start, traveled around the first turn in the three path, dropped back under urging with five furlongs to run,
went three then four wide on the final turn, gained coming to the five-sixteenths, rallied to take a short lead in upper stretch then lost the advantage back to
the winner, dueled with that foe in the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. HUSH OF A STORM saved ground on the first turn,
moved out entering the backstretch, was well placed down the backstretch, passed the half-mile pole under urging, chased in the two then three path on the
far turn, gained to make a bid approaching the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but was far clear for the show. ANYTHING
PAZIBLE was taken back along the rail early, saved ground on the first turn, moved off the rail while at the rear on the backstretch, passed the five-eighths
under urging, went two then three wide under strong urging on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. THERISASTORMBREWIN
was coaxed to the front leaving the gate, moved in nearing the first turn, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead outside the five-eighths, dropped back with
a half-mile to run and stopped.

Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE bumped at the start by COPA, who broke inwards, came under coaxing and chased four then three wide in closest aim of the spurting
away leader, came under urging at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside and was up in the late
stages to prevail. NEXT FLIGHT coaxed from the gate, crossed to show the way just off the inside, spurted away in command tucking inside and widening
his margin through the latter portion of the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
clear to the eighth pole but under growing threat to the outside and was caught in the late going while safe for the place honors. SPEEDING KID three paths
off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped out to the five path near the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WINNING DRIVE coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. COPA broke in at the start bumping BELLE TAPISSERIE, chased five then four wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four then three wide into upper stretch and weakened. HEALY'S HOPE chased just off the inside under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. VICAR'S LEGEND chased five to six wide throughout coming under
coaxing from the three-eighths and made no impact. CAUSE OF ACTION chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and tired.
