Footnotes
AIDANIKE closest to the leader, challenged between foes turning for home, gained the advantage, drifted out, held the runner up safe late while fully
extended. MY CORALENA lacked early foot, advanced late in the turn, split foes entering the stretch, lodged a mild bid inside the winner with a sixteenth
remaining, outkicked by that rival to the wire, clearly second best. RATTRAPANTE forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, three wide exiting when in
good position, lacked a winning response to finish up best of the rest. BRIAR THICKET off a step slow, raced back for a half, steered out to be three wide
into the lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest. MILANA broke alertly, sprinted clear early, continued to show the way through the turn while closest to
the inside of the first flight, weakened when headed by the winner entering the stretch. GOLDEN HAMMER briefly raced forwardly while three wide up the
backstretch, faded while angling toward the inside through the bend. WANDAS CAFE broke back, was never involved while saving ground.

Footnotes
MAJOR KONG last to leave, raced back for five furlongs, circled five wide into contention out of the final turn, challenged the leader past the furlong marker,
kicked clear of that one in the late going. JUSTIN'S QUEST tracked the leaders in the two path through the first turn, lost some position toward the inside
late in the final turn and into the stretch, moved out for the drive and managed a late push outside to be up for the place. CHARLIECANDO four wide
through the first turn when carried out a bit into that bend, continued well off the inside, advanced three wide second turn,bid, briefly led a furlong out,
proved no match for the winner late, caught final strides for the place. FOXY ACE settled off the pace and the inside, two to three wide second turn,
improved a bit into the lane then failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. SPORTS FAN lacked speed while racing off the inside, improved position
while not posing a serious threat. RIVER FINN five wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, moved closer onto the backstretch while angling in to be
three wide, took over in the two path far turn, faltered when confronted into the stretch. REVENIO void of speed while four wide most of the way, lacked a
serious rally. KAT'S HITMAN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside for just under a half and began to weaken, continued to fade. JAMES'S
MOONSHINE pressed the issue early while between foes, began a steady retreat before a half. SUPER WISE in traffic into the first turn, three wide trip,
faded. OPUS EQUUS broke back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EURO ME broke a step slow, moved up steadily along the inside, steered out into the two path to engage the leader entering the stretch, took over, clear,
kept to task. SPURWINK LANE sprinted clear soon after an alert break, extended that advantage into the turn, offered little resistance to the winner when
headed upper stretch, remained clear for the place. TIGER BAIT within striking distance while three wide early, remained in striking position through the turn
and into the lane, lacked a late punch to finish up best of the rest. PRINCESS LILLI BUG closest to the leader up the backstretch, second flight turn,
weakened. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE back off the pace while toward the inside, lacked a closing response. DUTCH TREAT off slowly, remained always back
while racing in the two path. PROUD VICTORIA broke back, raced outside, four wide through the turn, gave way drive.

NAME REJECTED broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, shook clear when
straightened for home, drew out. BREAKING NEWS moved outside, crept closer while three wide through the turn, proved no match for winner in the run
through the stretch, remained clear for the second spot. OUTASITE chased the winner to that one's outside for a half, also was no match in the drive,
narrowly saved the show. WINDCRACKER void of speed off the inside, three down to two wide through the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, gaining for
the show late. BIG NICK forwardly placed while inside, moved closer then lacked room into the turn to see that advance stall, saved ground into the lane,
altered course to the outside past the furlong marker, finished up evenly. BELFAST BOY off a step slow, trailed throughout in lacked a closing kick.

Footnotes
KERSHAW settled off the pace toward the inside, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker then kicked clear
late. ROAMING UNION chased the leader off the inside for six furlongs, moved to challenged into the stretch, dueled inside the winner past the furlong
marker then could not keep up, clearly second best. LEADING WEST bothered then was put in tight into the first turn bumping with PINSON, raced back,
advanced inside second turn, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. THE QUEENS JULES away in good order, showed the way
through the first turn, continued to set the pace the middle half along the rail, faltered when headed by the runner up turning for home. HYPERFOCUS void
of speed off the inside, began a mild, steady rally in the two path midway on the final turn to improve position, not a serious threat. BEAR OAK in the second
flight while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. COAL TRUTH came out into the first turn to bother a couple of outer rivals, raced four wide onto
and up the backstretch, remained four wide through the second turn and tired. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP off a step slow, raced back and made little impact.
PINSON forced out and was bumped into the first turn, remained well wide, five wide again in the second turn, failed to muster a rally. DAVID'S GEM in
some traffic into the first turn when forwardly placed, 2nd flight for a half, gave way. TASHKENT settled in mid pack for six furlongs, had nothing for the
drive. GAGOOTS fractious in the gate, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
BLUE NORTHER forwardly placed through the first turn inside and under stout restraint, continued in hand the middle half, steered out and advanced three
wide to challenge entering the stretch, took over and drew clear under his own courage to win ridden out. BATTLE CALL prompted the pace three wide
much of the way, challenged on the outside second turn, proved no match for the winner inside that one through the stretch, far clear of the others.
CHEROKEE LEGACY pressed the leader from off the inside, challenged between horses and briefly led midway on the final turn, could not match strides
with the top two through the lane, narrowly saved the show. ICE BLAST void of early speed inside, steered out to be four wide when mounting a mild
advance exiting the final turn, continued with moderate interest to improve position. GROUP EIGHTEEN settled off the early pace, saved ground while going
one paced through the second bend, went evenly through the lane to miss the show while between horses at the wire. PINCH HITTER four wide into the
first turn, continued off the inside, lacked a closing kick as well. JIM AND JIM in mid pack along the inside, remained toward the rail second turn, not a threat
in the drive. AMITY ROAD off a step slow, remained always back. ALOGON showed the way along the inside for five furlongs, stopped when headed far
turn. COLE SPUR off slow, trailed throughout.

prove best in a determined effort. MACRON broke back, lacked speed off the inside, angled out to be five wide when advancing out of the turn, challenged
outside the winner late, denied. ABSOLUTE CHAOS away in good order, narrowly set the pace off the inside up the backstretch, continued to hold a narrow
advantage through the turn, could not match the top two in the drive, narrowly saved the show. SUPREMACY off a step slow, trailed early, continued to lag
turn, came four wide out of the turn and staged a mild rally outside to be gaining for the show. UPSTRIKER pressed the pace for a half along the inside and
weakened. SILVER MOON ROAD raced in mid pack outside, five wide down to four path turn, lacked a closing kick. EDGE TO EDGE within striking
distance while in the second flight, weakened. NUCLEAR OPTION remained back while racing back toward the inside. ONE FAST CAT in the second flight
while racing three wide, weakened. JOE FRAZIER tired after a half. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY remained always back.

HOLLIS broke alertly, pressed the early leader from the outside, advanced and dueled through the turn, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch
and kicked well clear. NO SHIRT NO SHOES within striking distance inside up the backstretch, moved out a bit to be in the two path through the turn, no
match for the winner through the stretch, clear for the place. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK raced off the pace while outside, four wide through most of the turn,
did not have enough for the runner up late. COUNTY FINAL away in good order, set the early pace inside, dueled through the turn inside the winner, lost
contact with the winner in upper stretch and weakened to lose a couple of positions the final furlong. BACKGROUND off the pace and the inside, three wide
through the turn, lacked a closing response. BOLDOR lacked speed, dropped inside late in the turn, also failed to produce a rally. MOJO MAN off a step
slow, trailed throughout.

into the lane then gave ground grudgingly to that rival and the runner up the final furlong. MOHAYLADY void of speed, angled out four wide turning for
home, improved position with some mild interest, no threat to the top three. LEGENDARY GIFT went one paced with a mostly three wide trip. HASHTAG
WINNER slight bobble start, trailed for six furlongs, four wide into the lane, improved position by mostly tiring rivals. RIGHT TRAPPE settled off the early
pace, two path into the lane, lacked a closing response. IPSUM GRATUS mid pack, fell back after a half, failed to menace. I'M THE BOSS OF ME hesitated
at the break, moved outside, advanced with a four wide middle move into the far turn then gave way in the drive. PIPESTONE forwardly placed for a half,
faded.
