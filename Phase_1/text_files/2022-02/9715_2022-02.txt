Footnotes
BELLE GOSSE angled to the rail racing to the first turn tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance under light rating to the backstretch, steadily
advanced to contention inside foes nearing the far turn, tipped out entering upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, took over leaving the
furlong marker and went clear under a few right handed taps. BRASS BAND broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the
backstretch, held sway through the far turn to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. BELLAVALENCIA settled outside foes
racing to the first turn, steadily advanced four wide racing into the far turn, moved to briefly close the gap on the leader in that path approaching upper
stretch but flattened out in the drive. RACHEL DREAM settled well off the field racing to the far turn, then passed inside some tiring rivals racing through the
stretch while never proving a factor. JEWEL OF WINTER, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way racing intot he far
turn. DURA THE EXPLORER was urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
UNIQUE PATH raced four deep leaving the chute tracking the first flight from out of striking distance, shifted inwards a bit nearing the bend while coming
under pressure to advance between foes, angled to the inside approaching upper stretch to bid for command inside the pacesetter nearing the furlong
marker and came through in the final stages to narrowly prevail in a prolonged drive under right handed encouragement. EL GUAPO showed quickly in
front, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing in the three path on the backstretch, edged away to a clear advantage while shifting inwards a bit
nearing upper stretch, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best. GRUNDER tracked off the first flight between foes on
the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. TWO STEP DANCE ducked out at the start,
was quickly righted, then urged three wide to prompt the pacesetter into the turn, couldn't match terms with that foe racing through the bend and gave way
nearing upper stretch. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA settled last while being switched outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position
between foes into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. JOHNNIE GOT JETS, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter on the backstretch, gave
way racing into the turn. MARCH MAGIC was settled into stride while angling to the rail in early stages and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BE BOP A LOLA took up a position tracking just off the leaders between foes racing through the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm right handed pressure. CATIRUSIA tracked just off the first flight three deep racing
through the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter three deep racing through the turn, was floated out by that foe racing into upper stretch
contesting the issue, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but came up second best. ROYAL ATHENA was urged to force the pace outside a rival through
the backstretch, edged forward entering the turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch while being roused to resist a rival's challenge but yielded to the top
pair in late stages. HENNI PENNY, carried out at the start, settled into stride dropping off the second flight, tipped out racing into upper stretch and improved
position between foes to the end. BEAUTIFUL TIZ settled last racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then altered course avoiding a tiring foe
nearing the furlong marker but proved no real factor. BAD PAY, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE ducked out at the start impeding HENNI PENNY, was righted, then urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the
bend, was shuffled a bit while eased back nearing the bend and quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
HARROW angled inwards to prompt a rival's pace racing to the first turn, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, then
forged clear through the lane while being kept to firm encouragement. SWIFT KID, off last, settled along the inside to the backstretch, came through inside
foes gathering momentum racing into the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place
honors late. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE tracked just off the first flight inside rivals to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. FLORIDA PHARAOH was urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for
command into the far turn, couldn't fend off the winner's bid and gave way into the stretch. PHAROAH CAT tracked the leaders three wide in second flight,
continued outside a rival into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but came up empty midstretch.
MAGIC BOMB settled near the inside dropping well off the second flight in the opening half and offered no rally. READTHETRANSCRIPT tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch but dropped out early.

ESTILO ELEGANTE tracked just off the pacesetter three wide in second flight in the opening half, steadily advanced on that rival in tandem with
GINGERONYMYMIND nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards entering the lane, then continued with a grudging effort outside the pacesetter in a protracted
skirmish to the wire and just prevailed in time under brisk handling. CRYSTAL ORB broke readily, went clear racing into the first turn to dictate the pace a bit
off the rail, held sway in that path to the far turn, was roused racing into upper stretch to resist her challengers while shifting into the path of
GINGERONMYMIND racing past the three sixteenths marker, was quickly righted, then continued to resist the winner's bid to late stages but lost the
advantage in the final strides. BRYCENS GOLD, caught four wide racing through the first turn while being prompted to a contending position, tracked off the
second flight through the backstretch, was prompted to advance angling out four wide in the lane and found her best stride late to edge a rival for a share.
GINGERONMYMIND tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight in the opening half, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner nearing upper
stretch to bid between foes, was shut off while being bumped by CRYSTAL ORB, then losing her path to the eventual winner entering the lane, altered
course three deep in the closing stages and continued with a solid second effort while just outkicked. LA BRODY, reserved between foes in the last flight
racing to the first turn, gained some position between rivals after a half but came up empty racing into the far turn. MELANCHOLY BLUES tracked just off
the pacesetter inside foes in second flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn. TIZ LOTTIE tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GINGERONMYMIND LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE RUN
INTO THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM OF FOUL BUT DISQUALIFIED CRYSTAL ORB FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING
HER FOURTH.

Footnotes
SHALDAG broke sharply, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage racing off the rail to the backstretch, held sway under pressure through the far turn,
shifted well off the rail while failing to switch leads racing into the stretch but steadily drew clear in the closing stages while being kept to firm
encouragement. DECEIVER, caught four wide while being prompted to contention racing into the first turn, continued three deep in second flight through the
backstretch, couldn't close the gap on the winner racing into upper stretch but kept on well enough outside a rival to prevail for the place honors in the
closing stages. BODIE CODY was prompted to a position tracking the pacesetter in the three path leading the second flight to the backstretch, continued
between foes through the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the lane and steadily faded in the drive. ROSE FOR A SAINT, unhurried between foes racing
just behind the second flight to the first turn, shifted to the inside entering the backstretch while being prompted to terms with the second flight inside foes
after a half but gave way racing into the far turn. FEISTY KITTEN dropped out early.

LOUD N PROUD, forwardly placed three deep tracking just outside the pacesetter, continued with a steady bid outside the leader to challenge for command
racing into upper stretch and edged forward to a clear advantage late under firm encouragement. MOON LAUNCH was rated dropping off the second flight
racing four wide through the backstretch, continued in that path to the lane and found his best stride in the closing to stages to prevail for the place honors in
time. BERHANU broke sharply, angled inwards racing through the chute to dictate the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail to the turn, resisted the
winner's bid racing into upper stretch but yielded late. ROLL ON DUDE tracked the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn, angled inwards
racing into upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to close the gap in late stages. PROFESSIONAL tracked off the second flight between
foes in the opening stages, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and quickly flattened out. BLACK V. K. settled
last in early stages and lacked a closing bid. PREPARE FOR GLORY tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn and emptied out nearing the
lane. ARRIVEDERLA made brief pursuit of the leader inside the eventual winner in the opening quarter, was pulled up racing past the half mile marker and
was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
FLY THE W took up a position three deep tracking just off the leaders under light rating to the backstretch, responded when given his cue to challenge for
command in that path racing into the far turn, dispatched his rivals racing into upper stretch and drew well clear late under hand urging. CALL BROS was
settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in the four path through the far turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. TAKE
TO THE SKIES, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to bid for command inside the eventual winner racing into
the far turn and faded in the drive. BRIDGEKEEPER was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, came under prompting to advance off
the inside on the far turn, angled inside rivals entering the stretch and had no late bid. VIOLENT FIGHT, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail to the
backstretch, set the pace for a half and gave way racing into the far turn. BATTLE CREEK tracked just off the pacesetter near the inside racing to the
backstretch, tipped out nearing the second bend, then dropped back avoiding close quarters entering the second bend and had no further response.
OVERPRAISE angled to the rail while dropping off the field racing to the first turn, was prompted to make some brief progress inside foes after a half but
emptied out approaching the second bend.
