Footnotes
WIN WITH PRIDE in tight at the break to be last away, moved closer along the inside early, continued to save ground turn, rallied up the rail to be in time.
TOWN CHAMP broke sharp, sprinted clear early, showed the way into the turn by daylight, shrugged off a rival in upper stretch, could not contain the winner
while allowing that one the inside late. STORM ADVISORY broke out to brush with the winner, raced off the pace and the inside shifted out a bit for the
drive, finished best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. GITA'S LAD back off the pace while racing outside, three wide through most of the turn,
lacked a winning response in the drive to finish up evenly. CABOT broke with the leaders, moved out and chased the runner up into the turn, three wide into
the lane, weakened in the final furlong. FUTILE void of speed off rail, came three wide into the stretch, picked off some faltering rivals while failing to
menace. FIRERY TALE brushed at the break, lacked speed inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. RAMPAGE raced three wide for a
half then tired. HOOKED A GOODWIN in mid pack early out in the strip, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
BEEASY cleared to the inside after breaking in good order, breather through the turn, edged further away through the lane, kept to task late. UNCAPTURED
DREAM back off the pace, four wide through the turn then moving closer, could do little with the winner late, clearly second best. POPSTER forwardly
placed while racing three wide, lacked a response in the drive to prove no match for the top two, all out to save the show. TIGER MOON off a step slow,
raced well back off the early pace off the inside, three wide out of the turn, improved position and was gaining for the show late. WILD APPEAL chased the
winner early toward the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, weakened in the drive. PIKACHU void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals, never a
threat. SKYLINE in mid pack and three wide, had nothing for the drive. CLASSIC SHINE broke through the gate prior to the start, broke with the field fell
back and was not involved. JOHNNY ROD in mid pack for a half, veered out sharply when straightened for home, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RUBIGINOUS moved up to duel outside the leader into the turn, vied into lane, brushed with entrymate inside that one past the furlong marker, shook clear
of that one a sixteenth out, enough left late to withstand the runner up. RIFT VALLEY lacked early foot inside, steered out to be three wide late in the turn,
rallied widest through the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the winner, clear of the rest. FUNANDFUNNY in the second flight off the rail, three wide
turning for home, chased the leaders past the furlong marker, had little for the winner late or contain the runner up, narrowly lasted for the show. VIOLENT
PASS broke back, moved up steadily to be forwardly placed into the turn, three wide bid late in the turn, dueled with the winner and entrymate nearing the
furlong marker, brushed, faltered late. HARD TO PARK void of speed raced in the two path through the turn, improved position through the stretch with
some mild, belated interest. SHANGHAI SILVER one paced off the rail, went evenly through the lane inside of traffic in lacking a closing response. MY
DOMINATOR one paced along the inside, lacked a closing response. TRAIL DRIVER broke sharp, set the early pace, dueled inside the winner into the turn,
began to weaken soon. WHATA SHOW OFF fell back to trail, was never a threat in picking off a couple of tiring rivals late. PAPA STAR was finished early.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY forwardly placed early, four wide through the turn when beginning to fade, continued to retreat to the finish.

Footnotes
UNCLE MO'S CAT away in good order, settled off the pace, continued to save ground into the far turn, patiently handled when covered up through that
bend, steered out to hit a seam just outside the leader turning into the lane, took over, well clear. MY FAVORITE UNCLE settled in mid pack, raced in the
two path through the second turn, rallied and was up for the place, not a threat to the winner. JEDREK void of speed, remained well back while saving
ground into the far turn, steered out for the drive, rallied for the show, not enough late for the place. CHISHOLM TRAIL broke back, lacked speed, saved
ground through the second turn, improved position while not a serious threat. MINICONJOU moved up to narrowly set the pace inside, garnered a larger
lead midway on the second turn, weakened in the drive. TWICE THE PRICE broke alertly, settled off the pace and inside, lacked a response in the drive.
MO HEAT off a step slow, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BLAME GEORGE chased for six furlongs off the inside, gave way. PRINCE
OF EARL remained always back. PREGAME forwardly placed while racing outside early, faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT KARMA off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, in some traffic turn, steered out a bit when advancing turning for home, bid soon after,
kicked clear. HONEY PARADE forwardly placed early outside, three wide into the turn, pressed, dueled then took over upper stretch, proved no match for
the winner late, held sway for the second spot. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY chased the leader early inside, continued to save ground while covered up
through the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR off a step slow, trailed early, saved ground into the stretch, improved
position with some mild, belated interest. MARY ALICE lacked early foot toward the inside, raced in the two path through the turn, went evenly through the
lane in lacking closing kick. ARROWSPHERE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, dueled into the lane, gave way in the drive. LADY MAGNA void of
speed in the three path, failed to menace through the stretch. ISABELLE'S JOY in the second flight off the rail, three wide and between foes turning for
home, nothing left. DIVA DE KELA tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
HARTLEY moved up inside, got clear into the turn, drew off steadily through the lane while kept to pressure. DISTORTED SECRETS broke well, pressed
the winner from the outside into the turn, continued to pursue that one through the turn, proved no match through the turn, held sway for the second spot.
ARGUMENTAL in the main body while racing outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, slowly getting to the runner up late while remaining well out
in the strip. CAMARADERIE well behind the early leaders, steered out a bit to split rivals three wide turning for home, went evenly to the wire in lacking a
closing kick. ROYAL BONUS off a step slow, trailed well back early inside, continued to save ground through much of the turn, moved out for the drive,
improved position down the stretch. FIGHTINGTEMPTATION broke in, raced within striking distance toward the inside, had little in the way of a response in
the drive. TEXAS LEXUS bothered to be off slow, raced back and inside, improved a bit while not a serious threat. ZMUDA lacked speed, five wide into the
lane, made little impact to the wire. MISS YUM YUM remained always back three wide. TIZMISSBETTY flashed brief speed and faded. SURE WASN'T ME
in mid pack up the backstretch outside, four wide through the turn, backed up in the drive. HOT TUB HOTTIE within striking distance early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
SAFFA'S DAY with the pace after breaking alertly, vied into the lane between foes, drifted out slightly under a left handed stick inside the furlong marker,
held sway in the late going. A C EXPRESSWAY lacked speed in trailing early, three wide into the lane, shifted out for the run to the wire, finished up willingly
to earn part of the place. MESA MOON in the second flight outside, four wide into the lane, three wide exiting when moving a bit closer, lacked a late punch
for the winner, lasted for the dead heat for the place. WAYAKIN lacked speed, four wide turning for home when making a mild advance, flattened out the
final furlong to finish up evenly. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS prompted the early pace while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch run. MAJESTIC WEST
away in good order, raced with the pace closest to the inside for a half and weakened. INCORRUPTIBLE in mid pack while racing inside, traffic late on the
backstretch, continued to save ground turn, backed up through the stretch. LOCK UP stumbled at the break, recovered and raced extremely rank for four
furlongs, remained always back. DEFLATER within striking distance while three wide and between horses, gave way n the drive, far back.

Footnotes
VENTURE FORTH unhurried in the early going while three wide through the first turn, four wide through the second, rallied, bid, took over, determined late.
V. I. P. WHO back off the pace and the inside, three wide second turn, dropped inside for the stretch run, finished challenged past the furlong marker,
outkicked in the late going, edging clear for the place. DERBY CODE void of early foot while saving ground through the first turn, two path through the
second bend, shifted out a bit for the drive when beginning to advance, blocked a furlong out, steered in a bit, up for the show. HEIRLOOM KITTEN one
paced along the inside through both turns, lacked a closing punch. HARDLY A SECRET raced back early just off the inside through the first turn, four wide
late in the final turn, lacked a closing response. BRICE within striking distance early, early bid, took over in the second turn, faltered in the drive. GO FOR
SHERRIE prompted the pace for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. CALIFORNIA SWING off a step slow, remained always back. CARL G also off a bit
slow, moved up to race in mid pack for six furlongs, tired in the drive. CAPTURE THE GLORY broke on top, set the pace just off the inside, gave way when
headed.
