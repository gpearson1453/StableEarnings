Footnotes
PANOTTI tracked the pace three wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. DIVINE
EXCHANGE prompted the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the quarter pole, vied outside of MAP UP EM UP past the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth
marker but could not resist the winner late. FRANKIE'S GIRL was in range while racing two wide, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, angled out in
midstretch, steadied off heels near the sixteenth pole, shifted further out and was up for the show in the final strides. MAP EM UP pressed the pace two
wide, took a narrow lead around the far turn, vied inside of DIVINE EXCHANGE to the sixteenth pole and weekend a bit late. KEITANY raced well back two
and three wide and had mild belated rally outside. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY saved ground off the early pace, raced three wide between foes around the far
turn and lacked a rally. STARRY HOPE raced two wide off the early pace, advanced five wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. SPRITE'S LADY
ducked her head and turned it just prior to the start and was thus off several lengths slowly, saved ground and made little impact. MOTHERWELL set the
early pace along the rail and retreated nearing the quarter pole.

HEADLINE HUNTER sped to the lead at the start, held a slim advantage over SILVER CLOUD in early stages then widened advantage entering the turn,
came two wide into the lane and remained clear under right-handed urging. SILVER CLOUD was forwardly placed in opening stages, kept after HEADLIND
HUNTER around the turn, sustained a solid bid through the lane but had to settle for second best. LUCKY LATKES raced in range outside through early
stages, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch and cleared the rest. HIGH FAIR got bumped at the start and raced in the back, was ridden along
three wide into the upper stretch and improved position without threatening. SMOOTH PEBBLE was not far back early on, chased two wide into the turn
then came up empty in the lane. CODE NAME LISE showed early response along the rail, saved ground around the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
OAKHURST was unhurried early, advanced swiftly four then five wide approaching the stretch, caught the leaders from outside leaving the furlong grounds
and drew off under a drive. PLATINUM MOON prompted the pace, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, battled through a long drive and stayed on well.
ONLY TIME broke out brushing with SILVERLEAF, raced forwardly three wide to the far turn, shifted out a bit further with a bid at the top of the lane, and
was outfinished. MYRISKYAFFAIR settled in the second flight early near the inside, and improved mildly for the last major share. SILVERLEAF brushed
with ONLY TIME coming out, cleared over from the three-path with the lead around the first turn, set slow fractions inside to the stretch, and gave way
through the last eighth of a mile. ADELIE (IRE) raced forwardly to the stretch, and weakened inside. SIGNORA D'ORO brushed with MANDORLA at the
start, and was never in contention. MANDORLA brushed with SIGNORA D'ORO at the start, and was outrun inside.

TUNE IN set the pace along the rail, drew off nearing the lane and widened under a drive. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY chased the pace three wide, could not
keep pace with the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best. NIXON JOY (ARG) lagged well back inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
came four wide into the lane and was along for the show. I'M A G SIX was off a bit slow, angled out leaving the chute, advanced outside down the
backstretch, prompted the winner two wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. LUDINGTON was in range while racing two wide and had no
response. ALMASHRIQ pressed the winner two wide and was through after a half.

GIRLY THE BUTCHER rated inside up the backstretch, raced two wide in the upper stretch, shifted out five wide mid-way through the lane and had a mild
improve. LUNA ANTONIA tracked in contention through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the far turn then gave way a furlong out.

Footnotes
BACKATYA vied inside WHISKEYONHISLIPS for three furlongs, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a steady drive. WHISKEYONHISLIPS
was difficult to load but came away in good order, alternated for the lead outside BACKATYA until the end of the turn, could not match strides from there but
stayed on clear of the rest. ORIENTAL PARK was taken widest early, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly to best the remainder. GILLIGAN was
hustled along early inside, could not keep pace with the leaders entering the turn, and ran on evenly. ACT OF VALOR raced three to four wide on the turn,
and tired in the stretch. RAYO COLORADO became edgy in the gate prior to the start, broke without incident, and faded after three furlongs in the
three-path.

Footnotes
REBELDE raced off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, took the near the quarter pole, angled into the two path turning for home,
continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging in deep stretch and held off challengers on both sides. EMBRACE MY UNCLE
prompted the pace two wide between foes, led near the five-sixteenths pole, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, fought on inside and just
missed in a game try. UNO TIGER advanced in the two path around the turn, tipped three wide turning for home and rallied outside. TIZ RYE TIME chased
the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. MAN ON THE MOON stalked the pace three wide and faded through the lane. MENELIK hopped at the
start and was outrun while racing three and four wide. GUMP set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the quarter pole. AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF EMBRACE MY UNCLE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BUENISIMO was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up to challenge WICKED FINN for the lead late on
the far turn, dueled outside of rival in the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling, edged ahead to a slim lead in deep stretch and held on under a driving
finish. SEIZE THE HAY steadied shortly after the start and tugged while a bit headstrong heading into the first turn, rated two wide between foes up the
backstretch, tipped out a path wider then headed in pursuit leaving the far turn, steadily moved up closer in the final furlong and was inching up on the
winner in final strides. QIAN B C tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched an outside bid midway late on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and
steadily edged up closer to the wire. WICKED FINN cleared on top and crossed over soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch then took on the
challenge from the winner late on the far turn, fought back from the inside, battled on into deep stretch then yielded. EXPONENTIAL rated in range while
saving ground through early stages, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, came off the inside in the upper stretch and gave way. STANFORD (IRE)
rated three to four wide up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn then faded in the lane.
