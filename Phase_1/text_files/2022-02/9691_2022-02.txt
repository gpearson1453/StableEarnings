CILLA stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, pulled away and won handily. ICY CHARLIE vied for the early lead,
proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. DIXIE LADY dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn, weakened and proved no
match for the top two. MISS PAT'S GIRL lacked early speed, came around the turn wide and was never a factor. CONDESA'S HANDMAID evenly near the
back and was never a threat. SARAH'S PASSION was unruly in the gates, raced near the back and was outrun.

ALTERANA stalked the leader in the early going, made a bid down the home stretch, took command and was going away at the end. DOUBLE BARREL
MAN raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for
second. FAREWELL TIME sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was caught late for second. TONI'S STAR raced near the middle of the field,
saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and faded. BORN AGAIN GEORGE raced within contention and made a steady retreat. MR. CURLIN void of
early speed and was never close.

BERTIE'S GALAXY shot to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. WILD BERT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
followed the winner to the wire. BLACK SWORD raced within contention, was close throughout, finished wide and proved no match for the top two. GALAXY
BUILDER brushed at the start, raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kicki. HAIL STATE broke out, brushed, raced in
the back and was never a factor. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG brushed at the start, raced near the back and showed little. LITTLE PUCK broke in, brushed,
pressed the pace and dropped back.

FORT POLK raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside, made a wide bid and was outfinished for the win. SNOWBALL
raced near the rear in the early part, moved up, wide around the second turn, took the lead, but was outfinished by the top two at the wire. WINNING
ROMANCE dueled on the front end, saved ground and lacked a late kick. JET SWEEP void of early speed, had an outside trip and was never a factor.
SAINTS N MUSKETS pressed the early pace, raced wide around the final turn and faded. EILEEN ALEXANDRA challenged for the early advantage and

LANGS DAY for the win. JIMI'S A STAR lacked early speed, racing in the rear, made a late gain and finished willingly. VENN raced within striking distance,
came around the final turn on the outside, made a bid and hung. BEAUREGARD broke in, bumped, dueled for the early lead and weakened. LUCK OF THE
DRAW raced within contention, faded and finished evenly. MAGA MAN lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. JAX
MAN bumped start, pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn, dropped back and was no threat late. IZZY'S BABY BOY raced near the
middle of the pack in the beginning and faded. MAGAWILDTIME flashed early speed, saved ground around the final turn and retreated.
