TAPIT FOR SURE was quick to begin to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK was forwardly
placed to lay up close early on, raced two to three wide in the stretch run but was no match for the winner. DEVINE CANDY stalked the top pair, raced three
wide around the far turn and had not enough for the the top two. FLAT OUT HOT was off a step slow, moved up four wide near the eighth pole and had no
late gain. SUPREME DREAM dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CRIMSON T. saved ground and never
threatened. DELUSIONAL DREAM was slow early, raced three wide and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THORNISH stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up four to five wide through the stretch run and finished well to be clear late under steady
handling. MY TRUE REWARD showed good early speed from the inside, dug in near the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner to finished second best.
NEXTPORTOFCALL was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced two wide while racing between rivals and kept on to the wire. PREFERRED
PROSPECT stalked the early pace, raced five deep near the nine sixteenths pole, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out.
SIGNSOFAWARRIOR was unhurried early on, raced along the inside and had not enough in the drive. SHATTERED DREAMS settled off the early going,
raced five wide near the eighth pole and had no late response. BREWSTER was unhurried early, raced three wide around the far turn and never was a
factor. LIL SILVER FOX showed good early speed and gave way. DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR trailed throughout.

early on, angled four wide through the stretch run and made a good late rally. GONE PREACHIN was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide through
the far turn into the lane and had no final winning bid. WINGS UP was unhurried early on, moved up three to four wide and showed good late interest.
GASPERGOU showed good early speed and gave way. JAZZY JUSTIN pressed the pace while racing between rivals and tired. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER
dropped back early and failed to respond. WEST COAST BROKER failed to sustain a bid.

EUROBOND showed good early speed from the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. PREACHER stalked the early pace, moved up
three to two wide and finished willingly to the wire. SACRED KIKI BIRD stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide and kept on to the wire. TEXAS
LONG BOW was slow early, angled four wide through the lane and made a good late gain. COLLEGE PARTY was hustled along from the inside, raced in
tight quarters early, saved ground throughout and had no final winning bid. DEJA CREW failed to respond. GOLD LABEL was hustled throughout, raced
three wide and tired. OPTIMAL stumbled at the break, raced six wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor.
