sixteenths, ran at the rail on the turn then taken in hand later yards. FULL MOON LOVER chased and raced close off the rail on the turn, couldn't improve

rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed little in the lane. KOM HERE GIRL gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little
more. BEE JEALOUS had a brief early lead then gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, was taken up sore past the quarter pole and was vanned off

Footnotes
PROTA rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. MOTI settled just off the pace saving ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep
rounding the far turn, dug in gamely through the stretch and was gaining steadily late. TIVANO broke out to make contact with EXCALIBUR and was
shuffled back early, settled off the pace about the three path, raced outside into the backstretch then bid toward the five sixteenths pole, had range on the
leaders in the three path of the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. The latter was bumped at the break and saved early ground off the pace, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. CANTAKEITANYMORE saved ground racing
well back, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and could only improve position. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM rounded the opening
turn about the five path and settled off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the six path of the far turn. JAMMIN STILL
stalked in the three path, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
DISTANT THUNDER angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. CHARLIE POTATOES settled off the rail the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded
the far turn about the three path, dueled for second in the upper stretch and was gaining late. JOSEF IS REAL stalked off the rail, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, ceded second in the upper stretch and flattened. SUSPIROS rounded the first turn in the
four path and rated off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn and came evenly through the
lane. TRUTH SERUM broke awkwardly and was steadied soon after the start, saved ground well off the pace, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. DYNAMIC DAY settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. BUZZHOUND saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. GALILEAN MOON
was not a factor. GOOFY BOY saved ground. SWING YOUR SWORD was pulled up lame into the first turn and vanned off post race.

Footnotes
ELEVATED FOREVER took a quick lead to rate the pace inside, was met by Widget Factory and dueled that one from the three eighths pole, cleared at the
rail midway on the far turn and dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod over MEGA MILLIONS, who stalked two deep, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely from the head of the lane but was a nod short at the wire. WIDGET FACTORY stalked three
wide through the front stretch then moved to even terms two deep leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dueled the winner from the three eighths but dropped
back off the rail midway on the far turn and flattened past the eighth pole. BLAME IT ON HONEY stalked four wide then gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, appeared a close factor three wide on the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. CASTLE BOUND raced well off the pace in the three
path the first turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and passed some rivals. GAMING JACK saved early ground,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the three path the far turn, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane but showed little more. SING
A VERSE raced well off the pace inside, bid only mildly from the three eighths pole then flattened into the lane. BLUE SKY PAINTER was not a factor.
CRISTIANO saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC SEAS tapered in to set a pressured pace, was met at the five sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage from that point, recovered
the edge midway on the turn, drew clear into the stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. CHASING ANNA pressured the pace inside and
dueled to a slim lead past the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway through the turn, relented the final sixteenth and just lasted in second. EL
ZOPILOTE chased, rounded the turn about the three path, finished well and just missed second. BANNER MAN gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the six and seven paths of the turn and passed rivals outside. TRUFFLES AND GOLD gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the
four path then flattened in the lane. MISCHIEVOUS JESSE raced in tight quarters at the rail leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the lane.
BELMULLET gave chase then weakened into the turn. TANELEER gave chase then faded in the three path of the turn. ISLAND CADGER gave chase from
tight quarters early, steadied approaching the quarter pole and weakened. This race was hand timed.

through the stretch for third. EVA'S GIRL GRACE gave chase, improved off the rail on the turn, left the turn in the three path then outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH pressured the early pace but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted
into the stretch and flattened stride. ODEMGOLDENSLIPPERS broke out to make contact with Superstasia, gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn then
flattened. PLAY CHARADES could only improve her position. RED LIL SHIPMENT gave chase inside then faded at the rail on the turn. BADS LIL LADY
