returned bleeding from the nostrils and subsequently vanned off. AVENIDA MANANA inside speed while hounded to the half, stayed on for place in a game
effort. SUN DRESS just off leaders throughout, stayed evenly with no late kick. BALLYBRACK LASS raced evenly with nothing left in the final furlong.
HAMPTON SPRING chased outside to no avail and faded far back. SILVERA chased pace to the half, gave way readily thereafter. LIVE IT UP stumbled
and unseated rider at the start.

Footnotes
COPPER KING unhurried early, made a nice outside run to far turn, drifted in late, dueled and stayed clear to the wire. SNAKE BITE chased from inside
throughout, stayed on game in stretch run. ICECAP terrible start, trailed to the half, raced on for show in a good effort. BLESSED WITH LUCK tracked from
two path to the half, evenly from that point. RHETT THOMAS raced between horses to the half, stayed on evenly in stretch. EL CHEAPO inside run to far
turn, weakened in the stretch run. NIAGARA GOLD never factored. DRAMATIC KITTEN inside speed to quarter pole, gave way readily. CAPE MARCO
DRIVE raced off rail throughout.

the stretch with a good finish for place spot. MYEERAH chased pace to far turn, short lead in the stretch but outkicked late. POCA MUCHA crossed over
quickly to front, pressured to stretch and gave way grudgingly. BEAM OF LIGHT raced evenly with no response in the stretch. GUITTY (FR) raced between
horses while back throughout with nothing left. LA TOURISTA tracked three wide to far turn but gave way and faded back while bothered by the fallen
horse. PEACEBETHEJOURNEY fell late stretch in distress and was vanned off. EDGEE ANGEL never close while colliding with stricken foe unseating the
rider in stretch run but walked off. THE FINAL TIME WAS PROVIDED FOLLOWING REVIEW DUE TO THE FINISH BEAM BEING TRIGGERED EARLY.

RUTABAGA never far back inside to turn, angled out for the drive and went clear handily to the wire. MY TOMMY LEE unhurried early, made a quick wide
advance to turn but proved no match for the winner. WAR ENSIGN raced evenly with little response in the stretch while best of rest. I'M STYLIN lunged at
the start losing best chance but recovered to improve position only in the stretch run. WAVES tracked three wide to turn but flattened out in the stretch run.
WICKED KITTY speed duel inside to stretch but used up and gave way in the late stages. LALUCHADORA never close while far back in the stretch run.
CORONADO JUSTICE dueled from two path early, gave and stopped badly in the stretch run.

Footnotes
STRAITOUTTAPOPCORN tracked from three path to far turn, rallied gamely in the stretch run, dug in tenaciously to hold on at the wire. BUMBLE OF LOVE
steadied along first turn, unhurried between horses rallied while exchanging bumps in upper stretch, ran on and just missed in a good effort. TAP DANCING
LADY steadied along into first turn, rallied between horses in the stretch and finished well too late. DISCREET KITTY sat the perfect spot to far turn with a
menacing three wide run past the quarter pole but lacked a late response in the stretch. TELLER TO SING rushed outside to first turn, tried to keep up while
going evenly late. KYNANCE (IRE) never menaced. CHAMPAGNE TOAST inside duel for three quarters but stopped readily in the stretch. SOUTHERN
SKY raced a wide while never close. CLEARLY SMASHING dueled from two path, stayed to quarter pole but dropped back readily.
