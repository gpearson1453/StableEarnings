Footnotes
WORLD OF FOOLS stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path turning for home, secured command in upper stretch and drove
clear. NO MONEY DOWN lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, was taken to the inner rail near the eighth pole and
rallied. YO NESSROUNDONKERN , in the three path in upper stretch, flattened out and drifted in late. RED MESA disputed the pace two wide around the
turn, raced between horses in the drive, weakened and was steadied in close quarters inside the sixteenth pole. DONTFORGETTOBLINK , sent to the early
lead, hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened approaching the eighth pole. CAIRO BOOGIE , outrun, was eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
MARY JANE CHROME tracked the dueling leaders three to four wide, bid between foes to take a short lead after a half mile, spurted clear approaching the
stretch, widened under steady left handed encouragement in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. LUCKY LORRAINE drafted back off the pace and
angled to the rail to settle, eased out around a rival mid turn, moved up between foes in mid stretch, shifted back in and kept on with good energy to gain the
place. BELLSWILLBERINGING rated in about the two path and off of the contested pace, eased out and advanced between runners nearing the lane,
shifted four wide soon after, gave hard chase past mid stretch and churned on. COLOROFACLOUD , five wide most of the way, ranged up to loom after a
half mile, gave hard pursuit outside runners into the stretch but hung late. DIXIELAND DANCER stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled well off the
rail and off the pace, moved up five to six wide nearing the quarter pole but failed to sustain through the drive. MEXICALI ROSE dueled two wide outside
SOME IS NINE, held a short lead into the far turn, ceded command with three furlongs to go, stayed on willingly with pursuit to upper stretch then faded in
the final furlong. SOME IS NINE disputed the pace along the rail to the three eighths then gave way. SHE'S A BIRDIE was outrun. TASFEEQ gave early
chase outside a rival and tired.

Footnotes
LITTLE BOLD BANDIT sped to the early leaw d, opened a clear advantage entering the turn, set the pace in the two path, drifted out late and dug in
tenaciously to prevail with a fortuitous bob of the nose. THE CAIRO KID showed speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the
turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, closed outside the winner and just missed. BARDOLINO bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the
winner three deep around the turn and gained late. LITTLE BAY lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn, angled out near the sixteenth pole
and failed to menace. CAMP PENDLETON , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn and was fanned six deep in upper
stretch. SUSPIROS , three wide on the turn, gave way. DEGAS hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , keen outside DAT DARES GOLD while contesting the pace, moved clear mid turn, wandered to about the four path entering the
lane, corrected in upper stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept alert. COUGAR VISION , three deep past the five eighths, moved up
outside a rival past mid stretch and kept on with good energy to be second best. MY WAY OR ELSE , between foes near the five eighths, dropped in and
was put to heavy pressure mid turn, swung five wide into the stretch, straightened and had a mild rally. DAT DARES GOLD advanced inside rivals leaving
the chute and gained a short lead, sparred to the inside of the winner to the three furlong marker, gave willing chase from the five sixteenths to mid stretch
then weakened. ARBUTUS , off the rail, never posed a threat. REIGNING FIRE dropped back early towards the inside and failed to generate a run.

Footnotes
NEIGH DUDE bore out leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the lead entering the turn, set the pace well off the rail and was kept under pressure in the
drive. PLAYBOY ROY stalked the pace off the rail, eased out to the four path entering the stretch and rallied outside foes. GARITOFF , four deep entering
the turn, remained well off the rail, chased the winner and faded. VINNY showed speed, raced along the inner rail and steadily weakened through the
stretch. HE ROLLS lacked speed, circled the turn three wide and was not a factor. LIGHTNING LAD raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.
ROLL ME OVER , along the inner rail on the turn, gave way. TUCKER ROAD , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun while three wide on the
turn.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS MAHOMES broke sluggishly, rushed up in the four path leaving the backstretch, bid for the lead between horses at the head of the stretch, was
bumped by VANHOOFER approaching the eighth pole, bumped that one inside the eighth pole, bumped with that one late and determinedly prevailed.
VANHOOFER showed speed along the inner rail, exchanged bumps with the winner in the stretch and finished gamely. FLAT CAT , five deep leaving the
backstretch, advanced three wide leaving the turn to gain a short lead and hung late. MR. MOSLEY stalked the pace, loomed four deep leaving the turn and
rallied mildly. SECOND TERM saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. CALLYOURIGHTBACK was outrun.
BOURBONONTHEROCKS weakened. END RUN trailed. An objection by the rider of VANHOOFER against GLORIOUS MAHOMES for alleged
interference inside the eighth pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
GAMESTONKS settled off the contested pace while six wide early on, dropped in to about the three path around the turn, gathered momentum leaving the
three eighths, angled five wide for the drive, rolled up under pressure to engage the dueling leaders a furlong out, switched over to her left lead when taking
over near the sixteenth pole then drew clear. CLICK TO CONFIRM tracked a duel while three wide under rating, bid to engage leaving the far turn, battled
outside foes around the turn, dropped in holding the advantage in upper stretch, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, clung to the lead past
mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. JACKIE THE JOKER , unhurried early while five wide, ranged up four wide around the turn, bid to threaten into the
lane, attempted to get in some while dueling past mid stretch then faded. MISTY MAUVE , caught between rivals a long way while stalking, shifted out some
in the drive and kept on with effort. JACRODRA'S DEVIL got engaged in a duel with REDWHITEANDTACOS leaving the chute, carried that scrum into and
around the turn, stayed on to upper stretch and faded. CAMELIA ROD saved ground while within range leaving the far turn, swung out six to seven wide
past the three sixteenths but failed to drum up the needed kick. REDWHITEANDTACOS was sent up early and contested the pace outside JACRODA'S
DEVIL, dueled on a slim advantage leaving the half mile marker, was under asking to hold position to the head of the lane then gave way.
