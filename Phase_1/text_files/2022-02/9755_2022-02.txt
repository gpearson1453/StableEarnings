DILLY DILLY PHILLY was well placed early on the inside, then was boxed on the inside by the quarter pole, then shifted out four wide leaving the turn for
racing room, closed well to hit the front at the sixteenth pole and then was going away late, driving. FIRST FOREVER was well rated early while four wide,
made a three wide move on the turn, dueled for command by the furlong marker, then could not go with the winner late while getting the nod for the place
award. LITTLEBITALILY set the early pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the turn and dueled for the command, dug in gamely in the stretch but
faded late, lost place award. PROMISE OF JOY was settled early, came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST stalked
the early pace three wide and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole and faltered in the drive.

SARATOGA WILDCAT tracked the early pace two to three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then dueled for command and gained a
short advantage leaving the furlong marker, then prevailed late to prove best under a drive. SCOTTSDALE was sent to the lead after not breaking sharp, set
the pace while clear entering the turn, then was challenged leaving the quarter pole and dueled for command by the furlong marker, then battled gamely to
the wire to just miss. SIR ROCKPORT was allowed to settle early and made a inside bid leaving the turn to loom boldly but flattened out. TORAZO was
reserved early, came three wide into the drive, shifted out in the drive and had a belated rally. A MAIZE ZING RIP chased the pace three to four wide, came
five wide into the drive but had no kick. YOU GO BOY was away alertly and raced three wide and was through early.

OSCAR WINNER was well rated early, made a three wide move leaving the five sixteenths, hit the front leaving the turn, then prevailed late after a long
drive. VISHNU tracked the early pace on the inside, made a bid between horses leaving the five sixteenths to vie for command, then angled out leaving the
three sixteenths, then was slowly gaining to just miss late. ILOVECHARLYBROWN was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the far turn, came
five wide into the lane, rallied mildly but needed more while being up for the show award. YES FOR LESS swet the early pace while clear, then was headed
around the five sixteenths pole, then gave way grudgingly. ASK NEAL was allowed to settle early, then was four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the
drive but had no kick. AFLEET TRAXX was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the stretch but lacked the needed rally. BIFF was reserved early and
raced four to five wide on the turn and came seven wide into the drive and was no threat. TEMPTING THE TIGER failed to menace. EYES OF ZEUS was
not a factor.

Footnotes
CANTSTOPRUNNING vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then drew off in the drive to prove best under a drive.
CHAMPERS vied for the lead on the inside and proved to be no match for the winner, clearly second best. POCOPSON STATION was allowed to settle
three wide, made a mild advanced four wide by the quarter pole and had no late rally, bested rest. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was taken back early, then
advanced four wide by the quarter pole, angled in by the furlong marker and had a belated rally. TOP HAT TREASON lacked a rally. JOZANI R V F failed to
menace. HIT THE TICKET chased the early pace three to four wide and tired. LOVEDISC stopped.
