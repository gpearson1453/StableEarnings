FALSE RULING tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, then had a long drive with the pace setter, slowly edged clear late then
held off the late challenge from SMART TART to prove best under a drive. SMART TART was settled early from between rivals and three wide, then
advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive, closed the gap fast late. REGAL JORDAN set the early pace while clear, then was headed
leaving the furlong marker, then dug in gamely to the wire but faded late. NIKKIS KITTEN was settled early, then advanced three wide on the turn, then had
a mild late rally for the minor rewards. AS YOU WERE was settled early, then advanced on the inside on the turn and had no late kick. MEEMOO chased
the early pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and had no kick. WINNIPEG WONDER chased the early pace five wide and weakened.
KASTANYAS was void of early speed and was no factor on the inside. BIG EYE JOY chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.
