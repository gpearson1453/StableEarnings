LUDICROUS MODE settled well back and slightly off the inside, gathered momentum leaving the three eighths, swung six wide approaching the stretch,
closed under pressure and took over in mid stretch, kicked clear while on his left lead and held sway. BELLARMINE HALL chased to the inside of a rival,
was under a hustling ride leaving the far turn, shifted out and moved up five wide to the inside of the winner entering the lane, failed to match strides with
that one but kept on willingly to be clearly second best. SOLOMONIC settled in the clear while four wide, picked up the pace and took closer order nearing
the five sixteenths, edged up near the furlong grounds then flattened out. EVEN THUNDER , three wide early with pursuit, dropped in towards the rail past
the three eighths and faded. CONTRAFLOW opened up early on and set the pace off the inside, was under pressure as rivals closed in near the three
sixteenths, drifted out several paths soon after and faltered.

Footnotes
ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) vied outside SHERIFF CHIP through the first three furlongs then edged clear heading to the turn, set a rated pace around the
turn, responded when roused three wide in upper stretch, wandered outward from mid stretch to the sixteenth marker, was corrected with right handed
encouragement and held firm. SHERIFF CHIP sped to the early lead towards the rail then was joined by ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ), rated back off that one
nearing the turn and stalked, eased out holding a forward position around the turn, shifted to about the four path and bumped with ARTISTIC REASON near
the three sixteenths, closed in under a drive, briefly steadied then altered inward as the winner drifted near the sixteenth pole, straightened and continued on
willingly to bridge the gap. INK , off the pace and outside a rival, raced about four wide in upper stretch, gathered some steam past mid stretch, angled in
and churned on. ARTISTIC REASON stalked the pace outside four wide outside a rival, angled out bit wider giving chase into the lane, exchanged a bump
past the quarter pole then came up empty. RAPID RESPONSE , between rivals early while stalking the pace, dropped back mid turn and failed to generate
a solid comeback. ONE NATION , off slowly after hopping at the break, was used early to get within range towards the inside, failed to kick on leaving the
far turn and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of SHERIFF CHIP, ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) was disqualified from first and
placed second.

WIN THEN GRIN , in hand hugging the inner rail on the turn, was asked for run turning for home, swept to command inside ELLIE BE DANCING in upper
stretch, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and eagerly drew away. DIAL EMMA REILLY lacked speed, trailed to upper stretch, was taken to the five path
in mid stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, tired the final furlong.
ELLIE BE DANCING sped to the early lead, was kept well off the rail around the turn and in the stretch and weakened. LA DAME , in the three path chasing
the pace around the turn, gave way in upper stretch. CORAL SUMMER , an early factor down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, gave way
in upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
PASCAL CHANT was nudged up inside rivals to contest the pace, dueled under rating into and around the turn, was guided three wide then roused clear in
upper stretch, drifted out under left handed asking through the final sixteenth and held firm. MY SACRED PLACE , under a light hold while saving ground
and off the duel, came under a ride mid turn, had a clear run towards the rail entering lane, eased out a bit and finished gamely to the inside of the winner.
CHRISATUDE lacked speed and saved ground leaving the far turn, eased out and picked up some momentum mid turn, shifted out past the three
sixteenths, ranged up leaving mid stretch then flattened out. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN , away alertly, disputed the pace outside the winner, came four wide for
the drive , stayed on to mid stretch and weakened. MYSTIC TIMES flashed speed, stalked the pace three wide, was under asking mid turn and faded.
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY chased the pace off the rail, came five wide for the drive and faded. CONFUSION BABY BOY dropped back around the turn,
raced wide into the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DEVILISH AFFAIR saved ground around the turn, found ample room along the rail to take command in upper stretch then drew out under encouragement.
R AVERIE LYNN showed speed inside SHACKABOOM while kept off the inner rail, drifted out at the head of the stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and
faded. GRACE ISABELLA , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the five path entering the stretch then faded. JOYFUL NOISE circled the
turn three deep, was fanned to the six path turning for home and failed to be a factor. RAVENEL raced in the two path between horses on the turn, was not
a threat and bumped SHACKABOOM when drifting out approaching the eighth pole. GLOWING STAR , never a factor, raced near the inner rail through the
stretch. SHACKABOOM prompted the pace outside R AVERIE LYNN, weakened and was bumped near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
GALLINELLA settled off the pace while saving ground, remained inside advancing in upper stretch, moved through to take over near the sixteenth marker
and kicked clear under a drive. JEANIE'S ANGEL pulled her way clear early on then set a rated pace, widened mid turn, raced off the rail while under
pressure past the three sixteenths, drifted out in mid stretch, failed to contain the winner but continued with effort to be second best. DANNY DEEP CUTS
prompted the early pace outside the leader, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, moved up four wide in upper stretch but failed to seriously sustain
in the final furlong. MY WAY OR ELSE , away alertly, rated off the leaders, circled five to six wide advancing under pressure into the lane, chased to mid
stretch then flattened out. PETION LASS settled off the pace, raced three wide leaving the far turn, stumbled when sustaining an injury soon past the
sixteenth pole and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run. No action was deemed necessary.
