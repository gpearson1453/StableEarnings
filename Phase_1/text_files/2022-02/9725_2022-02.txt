BALI BRAVA got away well, set the pace with a clear lead and held safely while ridden out. DR GS SWEETIE chased the pace, lacked the needed rally and
was no match for the winner. LA CAPRICHOSA saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid five wide and was along for show. BONITA DIXIE broke out,
raced outside and lacked a bid. SPINNING PLATES showed brief speed, fell back and went evenly thereafter.

LE TUB set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and drew clear under urging. MISS GLORIOUS stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the
turn to duel, was no match late and finished second best. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was never far back, put in an even effort and was along for show. JAZZY
EINSTEIN broke slowly, was unhurried early, lacked a response and did not threaten. WINTER STAR raced in the back and was not a factor in an outside
trip. PRINCESS ARANTZA stumbled at the start and was outrun. LOVE ON THE FLY showed little.

GUARDING ELK CAMP dueled to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. LOVELY LINDA pressed the pace while racing three
wide, fell back, lacked the needed late response and held for place. C C THE BARTENDER raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, bid and
didn't have enough late. THUNDER WOMAN was off a step slowly, moved up to stalk inside, bid and came up empty. MY EXPRESSION was outrun in an
even effort. TRANS MISSISSIPPI passed tiring rivals. TICO TIME was not a factor. TWIRLY GIRL broke out, dueled inside to the turn and stopped.

CHEWY CHEWY GOOD pressed the pace while racing inside, assumed command after a half, drew off on the turn and extended the lead while kept to
task. TIZ WONDERFULLY broke in the air, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. SURE
ANGEL was unhurried early, put in a steady effort and was along for show. BIG NEWS COMING was crowded after the start and not a factor. FIERY LADY
pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. GRAN MANNA was outrun. AMERICAN BOURBON bled and was vanned off.

Footnotes
HUNTINGTONS RITHM moved up inside to contend, inched clear at the top of the stretch, was under pressure late and held on gamely. HERMANO
challenged three across on the turn dueled through the stretch, came in late and was outnodded. BLOW MY MIND stalked the pace while racing outside,
closed steadily, was gaining late and got up for show. CONCUR challenged between horses, dueled through the stretch, was squeezed and checked late
and fell back. WHIDBEY PRINCE failed to threaten in an even effort. OMACHE KID was outrun. AL RHYTHM led briefly and dropped back steadily.
Following a stewards' inquiry, HERMANO was disqualified and placed fourth for causing interference in late stretch.
