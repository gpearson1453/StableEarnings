Footnotes
VIBE SETTER dueled from the three path with BOINTHEBACK to his outside down the backstretch, got joined by LUCKY MUCHO MAN into the turn and
vied among a trio clinging to the front and coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under challenge from
flanking rivals, got headed briefly for command just inside the sixteenth marker and surged gamely late to prevail on the wire. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE
brushed the near side stall at the start and came under hustling, chased three then two wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in to knock heads with the aforementioned foe a furlong out taking brief command just inside the sixteenth marker but was ultimately
denied at the end. WICKOSITY coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. BOINTHEBACK dueled from the five path down the backstretch and then vied four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MY INSPIRATION chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. LUCKY MUCHO MAN coaxed from the start, raced four wide just off the duel down the
backstretch before advancing to engage those rivals three wide between foes through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the drive. SELL SOMETHING stumbled at the start pecking the ground and conceding three lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing with
seven-sixteenths to go, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. WALK THE BANK veered in at the start and was corrected,
chased along the inside throughout under coaxing from three furlongs out and tired.

Footnotes
GIRL OF TOSCONOVA was bumped at the start, angled out early then settled on the outside, ranged up five wide on the turn, was asked while taking the
lead at the quarter-pole, shook clear when set down outside the furlong marker and drew away under a mild hand ride to win ridden out. KERIK settled at
the rear on the outside, tipped from the three to four path early on the turn, shifted five then six wide while moving closer later on that bend, spun seven wide
into the stretch under a left-handed crop and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH was hustled from the start,
showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, moved up under urging to make a bid at the nine-sixteenths, took the lead between foes with a
half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage three wide into the stretch and weakened but was far clear for the show. MATOULA was
taken in hand early then settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, split fading foes at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. BETTY'S
SMILE broke in and bumped with an opponent, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased in the four path around the turn,
dropped back fast late on that bend and faltered. TAPPANZEE was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, moved up under urging to dispute the
pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and stopped. THE GLENMORE was hustled from the gate,
contested the pace on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the turn and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
FREDDYMO FACTOR chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. SCOTT ALAIA coaxed from the gate, ranged
up after the start to take command six and a half furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside, briefly tipped to the two path before
tucking back inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat to
the outside, got collared inside the sixteenth pole and ran on safe for the place honors. RAFFINITY led early on before being displaced from the front by the
aforementioned foe, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors.
LINNY KATE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home and weakened in the stretch.
SEAHORSE D'ORO four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn and took the
inside route into upper stretch, made no impact. GAME THEORY chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide at the head of the stretch and proved no menace.

Footnotes
BIG TONY'S GIRL moved out while settling off the pace, was well placed behind the leading trio, ranged up four wide on the turn, rallied to the lead into
upper stretch then kicked clear inside the three-sixteenths, was given one light pop of a right-handed crop into the final furlong and drew away under a brisk
hand ride to prove much the best. CARLY HUSTLE broke a step slow then checked, spotted the front several lengths, went around the turn in the three
path, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy to garner the place. APPRECIATE settled on the far outside,
moved in late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response then lost the
place but was well clear for the show. QUEENTIGUA contested the pace between horses, vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. PAZZION broke in and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISSION TRAIL was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside of two opponents,
vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. GRAPE THERAPY was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the
inside of two foes, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path and faded.

BEST IDEA hustled from the gate, vied four then three wide between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
drew clear under a drive to prevail. BUILT TO LAST broke in at the start bumping and sandwiching PEPPER KING in tandem with CENTRAL PRIDE, vied
five then four wide outside a pair coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on
clear of the rest for the place honors. CENTRAL PRIDE broke out a step at the start bumping PEPPER KING in concert with BUILT TO LAST, traded
jostling bumps with PEPPER KING for a seam shortly after the start before settling four wide in pursuit, went three to four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced to the finish safe for the show honors. MODERN MIDAS got
bumped askew at the start and was forced to steady when losing his lane getting away near the rear of the field due to pressure from RIA'S ANGEL, chased
three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the rail into the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. RIA'S
ANGEL broke in at the start bumping A LISTER into the rear of MODERN MIDAS before closing off those rivals forcing one to alter in and one to steady,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, swung three to four wide for home and weakened.
LIMIT UP hustled from the start, vied inside a pair of rivals from the two path coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside
into upper stretch in retreat and folded in the drive. PEPPER KING got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, traded bumps with
CENTRAL PRIDE jostling for a lane in behind BUILT TO LAST briefly after the start before tipping out six to seven paths off the rail, tucked four wide
through the turn and got placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. A LISTER got bumped solidly at the start by
RIA'S ANGEL, who broke inwards and in turn bumped MODERN MIDAS before altering inwards in a shying move to the rail, got coaxed along in pursuit
from just off the inside at the tail of the field, tipped three wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SUGAR showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside a foe late on the backstretch, tucked into the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into
the stretch under the crop, gained to make an outside bid approaching the furlong marker, took the lead while still on her inside lead just inside that marker
and drove clear while continuing on her inside lead to the wire to prove much the best. MY DELICIOUS moved out inside the three-quarter pole, tracked the
pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, leaned inward on a
rival in upper stretch then was kept off that foe by the rider, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and proved no match while clear
for the place. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead
under urging approaching the quarter-pole and weakened but held the show. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON was well placed down the backstretch, passed
the half-mile pole under urging, dropped back while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn and came up empty. SARATOGA KAREN veered in at
the start and was off slow, angled out at the rear, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. LONDON GOLD broke in at the start, settled towards
the rear, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide and showed little. MY LITTLE LULU was restless in the gate, set the pace under pressure to
her outside, lost the lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and faded. PRALINE
PECAN moved out then settled towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BARESE was last to commence, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while four to five wide on the turn, lost touch with the runner-up while chasing
that foe late on the bend, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong, began to gain nearing the sixteenth-pole and got up
four strides before the wire to prevail. BOLD JOURNEY broke in and bumped with a rival, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on
the turn, shook clear late on that bend, extended the advantage into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop inside
the furlong marker, remained clear while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while clear for the place. GENO was bumped at the
start, established a good position just off the pace, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened while well clear
for the show. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY settled well off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CUT THE CORD broke a bit awkwardly, settled off the early pace then came under urging, dropped back leaving
the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES broke in then was hustled, raced at the rear while
ridden along, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. G MUNNING broke in at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of the
runner-up, dropped back in the two path under urging on the turn and retreated.
