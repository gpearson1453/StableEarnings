began to lose ground four wide on the turn, failed to rally. FARMER FRED R F eased back and angled in heading up the backstretch, moved out on the turn
fanning five wide into upper stretch. ALEXANDER WHO was brushed lightly after the start, chased inside, failed to rally. POSTMANFOURTYEIGHT chased
the leaders three to four wide, tired.

Footnotes
MORO APPEAL broke in just a bit but recovered to quickly speed clear opening up nearly five lengths within the opening furlong, continued with a
measured pace in the two path, widened on the turn and in upper stretch, kept to the task in a snappy effort. SAMURAI JACK went three wide on the turn,
kept on to secure the place. LEATHERNECK tucked in heading up the backstretch, went two wide on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch and ran on.
SHANGHAI MIKE stumbled at the start, raced outside four wide on the turn, needed more. BAYERN TO BE WILD was forced in just a hair at the break,
tracked from inside, came out at the top of the stretch, faded. PHOENIX FIRE moved out from three to five wide on the turn, was never a threat.
