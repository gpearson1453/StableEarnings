Footnotes
CHEESE LOUISE exchanged contact with Needacarcalllouie leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the three
eighths pole, dueled for the lead past the quarter, ran clear approaching the top of the stretch and was steadily handled through the lane. DAMISELA
stalked two deep then challenged while between horses nearing the three eighths pole, took a slim brief lead toward the quarter pole, was caught past the
pole, dropped back into the lane, though, finished evenly. SPUNKY ALI CAT rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter then flattened leaving the far turn. CITY PRINCESS settled inside on the opening turn, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, eased outward toward the top of the lane and showed little further. ELLIE BEAR saved
ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little
more. NEEDACARCALLLOUIE exchanged contact with Cheese Louise leaving the gate and was jostled a stride later, rounded the opening turn in the six
path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. WINDRUSH KARMA came out to make contact with
Needacarcalllouie at the break, entered the first turn in the four path, but was pulled up with a fatal injury and had to be euthanized on the track.

leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dueled clear at the three eighths but gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong.
LOOKIN BACK ducked outward to make contact with Sarah Bellum leaving the gate then settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. COLETTE'S SPIRIT saved ground, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, was eased to the five path on the far turn and showed little more. QUINCYS WAY rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid
only mildly on the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. SARAH BELLUM was bumped off stride leaving the gate, ran in the
three path on the first turn and showed little response down the backstretch. BETTER BOAT stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms at the
nine sixteenths pole but dropped back at the three eighths and gave way from there. This race was hand timed.

FRATHOUSE MUSIC tapered in to stalk off the rail, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep at the quarter pole and was steadily
encouraged to hold on well. LOOKIN' SMART settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran three wide on the
far turn, was bumped lightly by HIGH PRINT entering the stretch then dueled that one for second. The latter saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the
quarter pole and came between horses midway on the far turn, drifted a path leaving the turn and made contact with Lookin' Smart then relented in the
stretch duel for second. HARD BEING ME raced off the pace inside and could only improve his position. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL rated the pace inside,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and gave way.
KNOKKE BY THE SEA saved ground.

QUICK ENTRY rated off the pace inside, bid toward the five sixteenths pole and steadily closed to challenge leaving the far turn, took over approaching
mid-stretch, dueled clear toward the sixteenth pole and was steadily handled to the finish. WALL saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths
pole then dueled for second mid-stretch. HOLIDAY BONUS settled back in the three path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and was along for third the final strides. POSITIVE PHIL took the lead at the three quarter pole and
angled in to rate the pace, drew off to a longer lead from the half mile pole, came under pressure and held on to a rapidly decreasing lead at the rail on the
far turn, but was caught toward the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. HE'S NOT CURLY settled back two deep the first turn, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride. SUNMAN showed little response. CATCH MY CABOOSE settled in the three path
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. INSIDE RISK was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S DANCING rounded the first turn three wide, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and took aim in the three path of the far turn, dueled for
the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. BOUNDTOBEBAD stalked the early pace two deep, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came
under pressure toward the five sixteenths, contested the rail on the far turn, was met into the stretch and relented the final sixteenth. FUDGE CAKE moved
to the inside and rated a short lead, was caught toward the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but flattened at the rail on the far turn.
JAMESTOWN ROAD settled off the pace in the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn then flattened.
UNCAPTURED RUBY saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths and showed
little more. DEVILISH BEAUTY saved early ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little further.
NURSE TOMPKINS settled back off the rail then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about
the five path.

Footnotes
JEFFERSON NATIVE contested the early pace between horses then set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, was headed nearing
the eighth pole, recovered the advantage past the pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on driving. MAN OF THE CLOTH gave chase through the
backstretch, ran in the six path of the turn and dug in from the top of the stretch to take second under the wire. REMYS GUNSMOKE chased outside,
rounded the turn about the five path, dug in to take third late yards but was outfinished for second. MANHATTAN WEAVE chased through the backstretch,
dueled to a slim brief lead three wide approaching the head of the lane but flattned stride nearing mid-stretch. MY PHOENIX ducked sharply outward leaving
the gate then chased outside, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and ran evenly in the lane. NICE BUT NAUGHTY gave chase, ran at the rail on the
turn then flattened. WATCHING SNOW FLY saved ground turn. CATS DIAMOND BOY pressured the pace inside and raced at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail on the turn then weakened leaving the eighth pole. ROCKET J. and FEARNOUGHT were not factors.
