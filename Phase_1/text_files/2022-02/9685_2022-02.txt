VALENTINE DIVINE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. SIDNEY'S HOPE tracked the
early pace, went six wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. SMART SPREE was reserved early, raced seven wide into the turn and
was empty late. COWBOY TOBY was taken back early from between rivals and offered no late rally. YES ITSA STAR was allowed to settle early, went four
wide into the turn and never fired. HOOK EM pressed the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn and faded. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM raced in mid
pack and retreated. COLORFUL COLORADO was void of speed and was no threat. MINISTERSDON'TLIE was outrun early and was no factor.
