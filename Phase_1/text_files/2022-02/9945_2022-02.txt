Footnotes
MUSADA set a clear pace, widened her margin down the backstretch, and lasted from an outer foe late. GRAND PRIORITY bumped with an inner rival
before being taken in hand while in tight quarters among foes early on, rated far back along the inside around the first turn, tipped two wide entering the
backstretch, commenced a rally approaching the final furlong, slipped inside of rivals turning for home to claim place entering the lane with many lengths to
find on the clear leader, the shifted outside of that rival, sustained his long rally to produce a late bid, but ran out of ground. WE NEED A FIVE tracked three
wide, attempted a bid for place turning for home, but was outmoved for place by an inner rival entering the lane, and kept on. MISTA VALENTINE rated far
back two wide, improved with a half mile to go, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on while hanging on her left lead. SHACKLE THE GOLD
stalked along the inside, then chased two wide and between horses around the far turn before tiring through the lane. I DON'T FLY COACH laid off of the
pace in the two path, lost position down the backstretch, and failed to factor. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT never got involved. STARVICTORY tracked in midpack in
the two path, but faded along the inside into the far turn. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY was caught in the five path while off of the pace around the first turn, and
made little impact. BROOK IS GOLDEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the four path around the first turn, but was done early,
and eased late.

FAME FEATHER stalked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, drove clear in the four path in upper stretch, and held sway from an inner bidding
SNOWBALL through the final sixteenth. SNOWBALL laid off of the pace in the two path, rallied between horses in midstretch, attempted a bid inside of the
leader approaching the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. CONDESA'S HANDMAID set a clear pace into and around the turn while a path off of the rail,
but was headed by an outer rival in upper stretch, yielded thereafter, but saved show late. STRONG BEAUTY stalked along the inside, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, but was outkicked for minor placings by an inner rival while changing leads at the furlong grounds, and
lacked a kick thereafter. GALAXY THIRTYSIX tracked in midpack in the four path around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally
and tired. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR was outrun throughout. THE QUARTER MILE AND HALF MILE FRACTIONS WERE TRIGGERED BY HAND

Footnotes
FLYING CURLIN was smoothly taken in hand to avoid trouble from outer rivals early on, steadily gained into the turn to tracked the leaders from the inside,
ranged up while tipping outside of the top pair entering the lane, produced a bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. PLEMMONSTON trailed in the two
path around the turn, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, rallied horses in midstretch, and sustained his charge to reach place from an outer foe in the
final sixteenth. PERFECT PERIGEE shifted in early on causing an inner MORO WARRIOR to do the same and impact inner rivals, pressed the pace two
wide from the three path, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, but offered little resistance to FLYING CURLIN's bid at the furlong grounds, yielded,
and lost place late. OXBOW WIND broke a bit outwardly, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted out to the six path approaching the
final furlong, then passed tired rivals while hanging on his left lead. OUR SEXY A. P. saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MORO WARRIOR was
forced inwardly by an outer rival soon after the start, but continued to shift in after his outer counterpart straightened, impacted inner foes in the process,
chased the top pair from the outside and in the four path around the turn, drifted to the six path entering the lane, but lugged inwardly from right handed
urging in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, and weakened. PURE VALOR was forced a bit inwardly by an outer rival in the early stages, but
rushed between horses soon after, set the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path while getting headed at the quarter pole, and weakened.
CHAIRMAN MOO was shut off early while MORO WARRIOR came across his path, checked due to the incident and lost multiple lengths worth of
positioning, then was outrun. THE RIDER OF MORO WARRIOR CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PERFECT PERIGEE FOR INTERFERENCE
IN THE EARLY STAGES, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FORDLAND inherited an advantage from outer rivals around the first turn, set the pace along the inside, shook clear at the five sixteenths pole as his outer
counterpart faltered, drew off in upper stretch from a chasing rival, and lasted to the wire. CLASSY MISS settled off of the pace in the two path, slipped
inside of rivals while gaining around the far turn, altered course three wide in upper stretch, floated to the seven path to stay outside of a drifting foe
approaching midstretch, then surged late in hopes of reeling in the clear leader, but ran out of ground. ALLOCATE stalked along the inside, chased the
leader from the two path around the far turn, pursued that foe through upper stretch, but drifted outwardly approaching the furlong grounds causing him to
fail to keep pace, kept on thereafter, but failed to bid and was outkicked for place late. SPOOKY ROAD stalked two wide and between horses, but was
shuffled back behind a stopping AMERICAN HUNTER at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on for a minor share through the lane. FRENCH CURLINE
lagged behind the field into the far turn, swung seven wide and to the center of the track entering the lane, and moved up outside of tiring foes. BEE RIGHT
prompted outside of AMERICAN HUNTER early on, but was carried out many paths by that bolting foe entering the first turn, tracked four wide, then tired in
upper stretch. MOST EMPRESSIVE tracked three wide, took back from between horses into the far turn, shifted four to six wide entering the lane, but
lacked a rally. AMERICAN HUNTER showed the way into the first turn while well off of the rail, but bore outwardly many paths entering that bend,
regathered approaching the backstretch to prompt the leader from the outside, but caved between horses turning for home. THE THREE QUARTER

CREOLE CHARLIE set a clear pace, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway safely to the wire. SCHNELL stalked two wide, but only managed to chase the
leader through upper stretch, and proved second best. RELEASE THE BEAST tracked two wide, tipped three wide entering the lane while leaning on an
outer rival, and kept on to secure show. ZION tracked along the inside, but lacked a rally through the lane. SECRET VISTA laid off of the pace three wide,
floated four wide entering the lane while inching closer, but failed to sustain a rally to produce a bid. HOORAY AUSTIN failed to factor. OUR FREDDIE MAC
was outrun.

Footnotes
STITCHED set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of outer rivals approaching the lane, but fought back to reclaim an advantage leaving the
quarter pole, dug in gamely while resisting PRACTICE SQUAD's challenge through midstretch, and inched away from that foe late. PRACTICE SQUAD
stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, ranged up entering the lane to produce a bid, but was re-headed by an
inner STITCHED passing the quarter pole, shifted inwardly in upper stretch to engage that rival, but was repelled, and held place. STOCKPILER broke a
step slowly, saved ground off of the pace, improved to midpack into the far turn, chased the top pair through upper stretch while claiming show, shifted
outside of those rivals at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, quickened after changing to his right lead in the late stages, but failed to reach
place. CAUSE TO CRUISE was moving about when the gates opened and was unprepared for the start causing him to come out multiple lengths slowly,
trailed in the two path early on, improved inside of foes into the far turn, split rivals three wide at the furlong grounds while greenly flopping leads back and
fourth through midstretch, and stayed on. FIRST GLIMPSE stalked two wide, then four wide around the far turn, then tired five wide passing the quarter
pole. MONARCH MAN pressed two wide, led between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole, but yielded to those rivals at the quarter pole, and weakened.
JESUIT tracked from midpack in the two path, checked slightly while taken in hand behind rivals entering the backstretch, came into the far turn between
horses, shifted four wide passing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick between horses. MARQUEE RIDE broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace in the four
path around both turns, swung six wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. BUDDY REAUX race off of the pace in the three to two path around the first
turn, and never got involved. THE THREE QUARTER FRACTION WAS TRIGGERED BY HAND

Footnotes
KOUFAX set the pace along the inside while a path off of the rail, showed the way inside of a bidding HIGHLAND CREEK around the far turn, repelled that
foe before shaking clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway safely to the wire. CRUMP trailed around the first turn, rated at the rear two wide around the
far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, floated to the seven path approaching midstretch, and steadily grinded away outside of foes to reach place in the
final sixteenth. KOOLHAUS lugged a bit outwardly into the first turn requiring strong rider correction, responded willingly and stalked inside of a rival from
the three path, chased the top pair from the two path around the far turn, but drifted outwardly while under strong right handed urging approaching
midstretch, then bid for place between horses in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished for that position. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE stumbled at the start,
saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in midstretch, and chased between horses through the final furlong. HIGHLAND CREEK pressed two
wide from the three path around the first turn, bid at the three furlong pole, vied around the far turn, but was turned away approaching midstretch, and
weakened through the final furlong. HOMBRAZO tracked two wide while in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leading pair from the three path
around the far turn, but faltered between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FREELANCER tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail, came into the lane two wide, rallied to bid inside of the leader in the final furlong, gained
an advantage a sixteenth from home, and edged away. ROMAN POET set a clear pace a bit off of the rail around the turn, shifted to the four path passing
the quarter pole, but was headed by an inner bidding rival at the sixteenth pole, and proved second best. PURE PANIC stalked two wide and between
horses, tipped to the five path in upper stretch to remain outside of the leader, but got outkicked by an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, and kept on to
secure show. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE stalked along the inside, then chased along the rail through the lane without producing a bid. CREME DE BALI saved
ground at the rear around the turn, and moved up inside of rivals through the lane. XAVEY DAVE laid at the rear three wide while in the four path around the
turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, shifted back inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to menace between horses thereafter.
PRAYFORPEACE reared in the gate before the start, then broke inwardly and required rider correction, chased three wide, shifted to the six path in upper
stretch, but drifted outwardly at the three sixteenths pole while weakening. HOLIDAY HOUSE laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven path
in upper stretch, and failed to factor. ALEBRIJE raced at the rear two wide, and never got involved. THE QUARTER AND HALF MILE FRACTIONS WERE

CHAPEL BARN set a clear pace in the two path around the turn, inched away at the quarter pole, and held sway to the wire. DEANO tracked along the
inside, then chased along the rail to claim place entering the final sixteenth. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) pressed two wide, pursued the leader from the three
path around the turn, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, and lost place to an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. BIG FALCON ROCKET chased in the
four path around the turn, but lacked a kick to produce a bid. LEMON AND DIEM trailed, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up without
threatening. FROLIC MORE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. MURDO broke outwardly, got
caught in the five path while off of the pace around the turn, and made little impact.
