Footnotes
NINEJUANJUAN CALL set the pace outside of a pressing rival early on, cleared into the turn, held a clear margin through midstretch, but lugged out in the
final sixteenth, and just lasted late. PERMANENTDETENTION tracked along the inside, produced a grinding rail rally through the lane, but just missed
reeling in the drifting leading on the wire. FORTY THREE laid off of the pace three wide, gained two wide and between horses in upper stretch, altered out
in midstretch, rallied and was gaining outside of the leader to attempt a late bid, but severely shied and lost momentum when the leader lugged out across
his path in the final sixteenth. CHARLIE'S TOWN rushed inside of the leader to press after a quarter mile, but failed to keep pace into the turn, chased
around the bend while outside of the clear leader, then sustained place through upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. ADIEU LE CHAT raced far
back in the two path around the turn, then moved up between horses late. CATCHIN DRAMA tracked four wide, but faded through the final furlong. FLIT N
FLOT TIME was outrun. SCAT TIME prompted the pace three wide early on, but only managed to chase the clear leader around the turn before weakening
in upper stretch.

Footnotes
A. K. SAFARI set a clear pace, widened his advantage around the far turn, and drew further clear in the final furlong under very light hand urging. HELLUVA
LIFE stalked the clear leader from the three path, then managed place through the lane. PLEMMONSTON laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
outside of BOLD MINISTER in midstretch, then stayed on mildly, and caught that foe on the wire for show. BOLD MINISTER tracked along the inside, but
failed to gain on the leader through the lane, then was nailed on the wire show. NO KA OI stumbled at the start, trailed around the first turn, and never got
involved. FIFTYFIVE STRONG laid off of the pace two wide, but was through after a half mile.

leading into midstretch, but rallied leaving the furlong grounds to bid entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear late. CYCLONE saved ground off of the

vying rival around the turn, shook clear passing the quarter pole, held sway into the final furlong, but was bested by an outer rallying rival in the final
sixteenth, then got nailed on the wire for place. UNDER DISCUSSION took a bump from an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace two
wide, vied around the turn, but failed to keep with his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, chased thereaffer, but yielded at the furlong grounds.
COURTHOUSE COVE tracked two wide from the three path, inched closer to striking range approaching the five sixteenths pole, but hung on his left lead
and tired in upper stretch. FASTNFURIOUS tracked from the two path, but lost position between horses turning for home, then moved up through
midstretch. DOT'S DOLLAR broke a step slowly at the start and trailed the field early on, gained five wide and outside of foes around the turn, but flattened
out in upper stretch. TEE BURNS broke a bit inwardly, chased from midpack in the four path around the turn, but lacked a further bid between horses in
upper stretch, and tired. FEROCITY never got involved.

Footnotes
ARLYNE'S CROWN set the pace in the two path, inched away in upper stretch, then tired late, but lasted to the wire. VERY WEALTHY stalked inside of
rivals while a path off of the inner railing around the turn, chased the clear leader from the three path through upper stretch without progressing, but began
to narrow the gap as the leader tired in the final furlong, produced a late bid, but ran out of ground to wear that foe down. WILLAMINA got keen while pulling
in the bit behind foes into the turn, settled and saved ground around that bend, then gained show from outer rivals passing the quarter pole, and chased the
top pair home. NIBBLES laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but lacked a raly. SUPER FIRE trailed around the turn, then passed a tiring foe
in the final furlong without factoring. FIRED UP TIGER tracked from the three path around between horses around the turn, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
CHATON ROUGE bumped an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing SPARKLING WATER, got briefly headed by that foe with five furlongs
remaining, but drew clear of that rival into the far turn, then held sway safely from an inner chaser through the lane. SURREY tracked along the inside,
chased the clear leader around the far turn, then sustained stride through the lane to prove second best. TWIN CAUSE bumped an inner foe at the start,
tracked three wide, chased under strong urging around the far turn, then lost place to an inner foe entering the lane, and faded, but safely maintained show.
SPARKLING WATER took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied at the five furlong pole, briefly led passing that
marker, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart into the far turn, and weakened between horses around that bend. SHE'S CUSTOM MADE broke
a step slowly, and showed little.

EXPLOSIVELY HOT saved ground far off of the pace, then rallied along the rail through the lane to best outer leaders in the final sixteenth. MAW MAW'S
SOPHIA stalked three wide, pressed outside of rivals before bidding at the five sixteenths pole, vied in the five path through midstretch, but was outkicked
by a rail rallying rival passing the sixteenth pole, then kept on to gain place. SIENNA BREEZE bumped an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a
pressing pair into the turn, clung to an advantage from those vying rivals after shifting to three three path entering the lane, held through midstretch while
hanging on her left lead, but was bested in the final sixteenth, then lost place approaching the wire. SPEAK TO ME prompted the pace two wide and from
between horses into the turn, vied turning for home before being floated to the four path in upper stretch, but was bested for minor rewards by rivals on
either side in the late stages. SPECIAL CONNECTION trailed, moved up past outer rivals in upper stretch, then chased the leading quartet home. SUZIE'S
DREAM bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, got floated to the seven path at the quarter pole, and faded. NEW YEAR'S PARTY failed to
factor. THE MISSING PIECE stalked along the inside, shifted to the six path at the quarter pole, but lugged inwardly soon after, and weakened. PLATINUM
QUEEN missed the break and spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, raced far back three wide around the turn, and was outrun through the lane.

CHARCO set the pace along the inside, then drew off passing the quarter pole under driving pressure. BRON AND BROW leaned outwardly and bumped a
foe at the start, rushed into the turn to press the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, and safely
maintained place. GUTZY stalked along the inside, then chased through the lane, and was best of the rest. BIG SCULLY reared and lashed out with his
front legs while awaiting the start, then was bumped by an inner foe leaving the gates, raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and
tired. MY HEAVY SON was outrun.

Footnotes
BROKEN RIB brushed an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, bumped with an outer BET HE'S READY passing the quarter pole while
hoping to tip out for clear sailing, but was denied room, then aimed to split foes two wide approaching the three sixteenths pole, bumped an inner LAPIS
LAZULI while forging through tight quarters at that marker, then surged in the final furlong, reeled in the tiring leader in the final sixteenth, and drove clear.
BRION set a clear pace, widened his margin in upper stretch but tired approaching the final sixteenth, and was bested twenty yards from home. MARITAL
BLISS tracked in the four path and outside of foes around the turn, then stayed on to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe
for that position soon after. LAPIS LAZULI tracked along the inside, took a bump from an outer BROKEN RIB at the three sixteenths pole before leaning
back on that rival during the incident, then kept on to secure a minor share. MIZZEN MAN raced at the rear two wide, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, then to the six path to be outside of leading foes at the three sixteenths pole, and moved up late. BET HE'S READY took a mild nudge from an inner
foe at the start, stalked in the three path, then from between horses turning for home, bumped with an inner BROKEN RIB passing the quarter pole while
keeping that foe hemmed in behind rivals, then faded approaching midstretch. SERGEANT RECKLESS was outrun. TREASURE HUNTING stalked the
clear leader from the two path while inside of rivals, then weakened three wide at the three sixteenths pole. THE TRAINER OF LAPIS LAZULI CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BROKEN RIB FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

SUGGESTED pressed the leader from the outside and in the three path around the turn, failed to keep pace with that rival passing the quarter pole, but kept
on in the final furlong, re-bid in the final sixteenth, and got up late. CHARGE THE LINE set the pace in the two path, drew off while well in hand passing the
quarter pole, remained under confident handling well into the final furlong, but was roused entering the final sixteenth as outer rivals closed in, got bested
soon after, then just saved place. BIG UNION tracked two wide, tipped three wide entering the lane, then four wide at the furlong grounds, and rallied late to
miss reaching place. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY laid off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, tucked back in entering the lane to split foes two
wide at the three sixteenths pole, rallied with aim to split the leaders in the final sixteenth, but was put to tight quarters between them while doing so, and got
outfinished for show. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE broke a beat slowly, raced off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, then moved up late. SIR
GIANNIS tracked in the four path around the turn, but faded through the lane. SOUL STREIT broke slowly, rushed to an inside stalking position, but
weakened in upper stretch. MONEY MIKE was outrun.
