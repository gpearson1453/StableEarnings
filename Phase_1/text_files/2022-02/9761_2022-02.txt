Footnotes
NOBLE JON horrific trip from start, shuffled back, came again to prevail under stout handling. QUICK MASTER off rail to far turn, led into stretch but
outkicked late going. FIREMAN DAN unhurried to far turn, raced along for show spot late. CAUSE A STIR raced evenly while lacking a late response.
POUR ME A DOUBLE troubled first turn, bid into far turn, flattened out in stretch. MADELYNS HEAT no speed to far turn, improved position in the stretch
run. RARE N READY never in contention. SERPENTINE broke slow, between horses at half, inside quarter pole, no rally. C F V BULLET hopped at the
start while never close. ORDER OF THE DAY never far back to far turn, gave way readily in the stretch. ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED never menaced. NO
BETTER STORY speed to duel for a half, gave way badly while distanced.

swung wide with winner turning for home but outfinished late gamely. LEGENDARY LORE never far back throughout, rail run through the final furlong but
outfinished. DROPPIN G'S never far back in good position to stretch and stayed gamely to the wire. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE inside speed to far turn, gave

and gave way in the stretch run. RED LABEL three wide to the lead at the half but emptied out from quarter pole. SMOKEY LEE flashed speed early, gave

JOEZINE pressed pace from two path and leveled off from the turn. CAIRO DRIVER unhurried early, raced evenly from the half with no late gain. U SO
MONEY BABY never a real menace. EMOTIONAL INTEL failed to threaten and veered out into the stretch bothering rival in the process with no late gain..
TOTO'SRUBYSLIPPERS raced wide throughout while bothered slightly entering the stretch with no gain thereafter. MY ZIP ZIP failed to contend.
PARADIGM SHIFT pressed pace inside but gave way readily. SUPER GEUSE pressed pace three wide to far turn gave way readily.
