Footnotes
CANADA'S CUSTOMS laid close up along the inside, comfortably stalked along the rail around the turn, easily slipped inside of the leading pair in upper
stretch, and drew off handily in midstretch. CANDY'S PRIDE set the pace inside of a vying PINEAPPLE ALLEY around the turn while staying a path off of
the inner rail, which allowed for CANADA'S CUSTOMS to produce a rail bid at the three sixteenths pole, quickly proved no match for that rival passing that
marker, and proved second best. PINEAPPLE ALLEY prompted the pace setter from the outside early on, vied two wide from the three path around the
turn, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch causing him to fail to keep pace with that rival and a rail bidder in upper stretch, then safely managed show.
HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT leaned outwardly at the start, tracked the leading trio from just off while in the three path, came under urging at the five
sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick to produce a bid in the lane, and kept on for a minor share. ISN'T IT TIME saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
DREWSILLA hopped slightly at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch
without bidding. MYLIES STAR chased early on, but failed to keep pace into the turn to be off of the pace two wide, sustained that positoin around the turn
before swinging to the five path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CAJUN TWO STEP never got involved. EASY ACES hopped at the start while
breaking multiple lengths behind the field, and was outrun. MY ROYAL PRINCESS showed little.

Footnotes
TALEOFREADYCHIANTI was reluctant to load, then broke a step slowly, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, tipped to the six path while
picking up stride approaching midstretch, then rallied through the final furlong to wear down the bidding leader in the late stages. GEORGETOWN ROAD
tracked from midpack in the two path, gained on the leading group in the three path turning for home before tipping four wide entering the lane, then
sustained his rally to bid entering the final sixteenth, forged an advantage with seventy yards to go, as an outer TALEOFREADYCHIANTI menaced, but got
outfinished. LADY ARSINOE laid off of the pace in the two path, but drifted out to the seven path passing the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked by an
inner rallying foe leaving the furlong grounds, but kept on to surpass inner tiring foes to reach show late. INDIGO MISS sat close up along the inside just
behind the pace setter, bid inside of that foe in upper stretch, led passing the three sixteenths pole shook clear in midstretch, but tired in the final furlong,
was bested with seventy yards to go, and yielded. IMOGENE MALVINA broke slowly, rated at the rear in the five path around the turn, tipped to the seven
path entering the lane, then passed tired foes in the final furlong. I AM UP required a shoe repair in the paddock, then bobbled and bumped an outer rival at
the start, saved ground at the rear of the field, then passed tired rivals after slipping through tight quarters at the furlong grounds. ROYAL FLOWER took a
bump to her hind quarters from an inner foe at the start, recovered well soon after, set a quick pace in the two path around the turn, but was headed by an
inner rival passing the three sixteenths pole, chased through midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead and lugged in entering the final sixteenth, and
weakened. CARNELIAN prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, but faded turning for home, and weakened through the lane. RATHER BE
LUCKY stalked three wide, pressed the fast pace around the turn, but yielded entering the lane, and caved thereafter.

Footnotes
FREEDOM'S WAY bobbled slightly and inconsequently at the start, stalked comfortably along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leading pair
entering the lane, rallied in upper stretch with a clear MORE THAN WORK to catch, ranged up to that foe at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage
entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear. MORE THAN WORK prompted the pace two wide, led passing the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper
stretch as an outer FREEDOM'S WAY pursued, resisted that foe's bid at the furlong pole, but was headed a sixteenth out, and was second best. CATNIP
splayed both of her front feet outwardly when the gates opened, then took a solid bump from an outer foe before being able to regain her balance, brushed
an inner rival in the aftermath, saved ground off of the pace around both turns, rallied inside of foes through upper stretch, tipped two wide in midstretch to
surpass the tiring early pace-setter, then sustained her charge to reel in an outer rival for show in the late stages. ALMANZO stalked three wide and outside
of the leading pair, but allowed an inner foe to tip out approaching the lane, got outkicked by that rival soon after, failed to keep pace with the leaders in
upper stretch, then maintained show into the final sixteenth, but lost that position to an inner rival late. MASK PATROL tracked along the inside while a path
off of the rail, shifted a bit further out in upper stretch, but lacked a kick strong enough to produce a bid, and failed to threatent. MINNESOTA READY rated
off of the pace two wide, tipped to the three path around the far turn, then to the six path approaching midstretch, and moved up mildly while hanging on his
left lead. MAZUMA bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack three wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid before
tiring. SEEKING SPLENDOR stalked two wide and between horses, but faded around the far turn. HESTON broke inwardly, trailed three wide, then in the
four path turning for home, and made little impact. BARONNE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed by
that foe leaving the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

MOMENTOUS prompted the pace outside of MARSALIS early on, vied with that foe around the turn, dueled shoulder to shoulder through the lane while
hanging on his left lead, forged a very narrow lead at the furlong grounds, then held gamely and prevailed in the long battle before bumping with his
counterpart at and past the wire. MARSALIS set the pace inside of a vying MOMENTOUS around the turn, dueled with that foe through the lane, sustained
the fight after being just headed at the furlong grounds, but failed to regain even terms before bumping with his fellow sparring mate at the wire and just past
it. MAJOR CONTENDER broke outwardly, bumped a rival and caused trouble for other outer foes in the process, laid close up to the sparring pair into the
turn, stalked them from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, then saved show. CAN'T HUSH THIS broke slowly, chased
under urging while in midpack in the two path around the turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, but failed to reel in MAJOR CONTENDER late for
show. PORT ROYAL was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, raced far back in the two path, then moved up between horses late. EYE
DEE KAY broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. TEPEU raced far back in the
four to six path and made little impact. ART HEIST broke a step slow before being sandwiched by rivals on either side at the start, took the turn in the four
path while at the rear, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and lacked a rally. VINTAGE VINYL broke inwardly and bumped a rival into other foes,
then tracked from midpack along the inside before tiring. BLUE BONZAI was solidly bumped by an outer foe into an inner rival at the start, then was outrun
along the inside.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL COINS tracked from midpack along the inside, came under urging to commence a rally into the far turn, swung to the four path entering the
lane, sustained an advance while hanging on his left lead to gain place at the furlong grounds with a few lengths to find on the clear leader, then reeled that
foe in inside the final sixteenth, and drove clear. SHIPPINGPORT managed a loose lead in the two path, held sway well into the final furlong, but was worn
down in the final sixteenth. NEW YEAR SURPRISE rated far back two wide, tipped three wide turning for home, then stayed on between horses to claim in
the final sixteenth, and held it from an outer rival. BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide, then in the four path around the far turn, tipped
to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. PRAIRIE stalked in the three path, chased the loose leader while loosing ground around the far
turn, kept on in upper stretch to hold place, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong grounds, then faltered late. REIGNING SPIRIT broke a step
slowly before being knocked off balance by an outer foe at the start, trailed thef ield around both turns, then swung to the six path entering the lane, and
moved up. COURAGEOUSLY was fractious in the gate, then broke in and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside, but faded in midstretch. EL
SOCIO hopped slightly at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path early on, and failed to factor. WING COMMANDER saved ground off of the pace, but
to no avail. CARILLO hesitated at the start, raced at the rear in the two to four paths, and never got involved. REGULAR GUY tracked in the four path
around the first turn, but faded into the far turn. MORE THAN BLESSED laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, then got caught in
the five path around the far turn, and tired.

STRONG QUALITY moved up around the first turn to press the pace setter from the three path, vied with that foe into and around the far turn, dueled
through upper and midstretch, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. SCOTLAND YARD set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the inner
railing, vied with that foe around the far turn, sustained gamely a duel through midstretch, but gave way in the final sixteenth, then just save place. BON
BUENO tracked along the inside, failed to slip inside of a foe through very narrow quarters into and around the far turn, altered course outwardly in upper
stretch, the rallied four wide at the furlong grounds with a grinding kick, but missed reaching place on the wire. KING OTTOMAN pressed three wide while in
the four path around the first turn, rated back to stalk down the backstretch, chased the top pair through upper stretch, then from between horses at the
furlong grounds, but lacked the needed punch. MAASAI WARRIOR tracked from midpack in the two path into the first turn, but tugged while in the bit
entering the backstretch to achieve a stalking position just behind the leaders, but only managed to chase those foes through upper stretch before yielding
late. BOSS' DIALIN IN laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide into the far turn, got floated five wide in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly.
BEYBLADER bumped the gate while breaking slowly, trailed three wide early on and improved late. BIG BLUE LINE laid off of the pace three wide, then in
the five path around the far turn, and tired through the lane. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR settled two wide, took the far turn in the four path, swung to the
seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. VINCO raced forwardly in the three path and between horses around the far turn, but dropped back to
midpack entering the backstretch, then faded between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
PYRON was allowed to settle at the back early on, trailed around the turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, grinded away outside of foes while hanging
on his left lead through midstretch, then changed leads passing the sixteenths pole, surged with a stout turn of foot late, and got up approaching the wire.
JUST MIGHT set the pace in the two path, inched clear in upper stretch, but tired approaching the final sixteenth, was surpassed only a few strides from the
wire, and saved place. GRAY ATTEMPT tracked from off of the pace in the three path, swung outside of foes approaching the lane, shifted six wide in upper
stretch, grinded away, but was outkicked in the final sixteenth while flopping back to his left lead, and missed reaching place. SEVEN SCENTS pressed two
wide early on, backed off to stalk along the inside into the turn, then shifted outside of the leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase before being
outkicked for minor placings. STRIKE ME DOWN stalked four to three wide into the turn before taking the bend in the four path, tipped to the five path in
upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch between horses in the final furlong. COWAN laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted a bit outwardly in upper
stretch while searching for racing room, but lacked a rally to split foes. TORO STRIKE stalked in the three path while the leader's closest pursuer around the
turn, but faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CYBERKNIFE stalked in the three path, ranged up into the far turn to bid two wide at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command while well in hand at the
three sixteenths maker, shied inwardly from a right handed shoulder tap at the furlong grounds, but straightened when the rider changed to left handed
urging soon after, and inched further away. KUPUNA stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but failed to keep pace
with the eventual winner in upper stretch, then chased that foe home to secure place. STRAVA broke through the gate soon after loading, tracked from
midpack in the three path, chased under urging around the far turn before being floated four wide entering the lane, then hung on his left lead, and failed to
match strides with an inner foe for place at the furlong grounds, and held show. GUNFIGHTER popped the gate open when an outer rival broke through it,
then came out a beat slowly at the start, raced at the rear three wide, improved into the far turn, then stayed on well through the lane, but ran out of ground
to catch an outer rival for show late. YONO raced far back along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, and moved up without menacing.
PEACEFUL WATERS got a bit antsy when other rivals broke through the gate, set the pace in the three path around the first turn before tucking to the rail
down the backstretch, met CYBERKNIFE's bid turning for home, but weakened on his left lead at the three sixteenths pole. SHINNECOCK HILLS acted up
in the gate when his entry-mate broke through it, then broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the two path early on, and made little impact. STOWAWAY
tracked along the inside, then faded around the far turn. SHAMAYIM raced at the rear two wide and between horses around the first turn, and was outrun.
GUNTOWN laid off of the pace in the four path, but was done into the far turn and eased through the lane

Footnotes
SHE CAN'T SING settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked two wide and among foes around the far turn, split foes passing the quarter pole, bumped
ADELAIDE MISS in the process, then charged along the rail to bid for the lead inside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, led a sixteenth out, and held to
the wire. PASS THE PLATE brushed the inside part of the gate at the start, trailed the field, circled rivals with a seven wide blitz around the far turn, bid in
upper stretch, led while lugging inwardly approaching the furlong grounds, then got headed at the sixteenth pole, and drifted a bit outwardly late while being
bested. ABSCOND rated off of the pace along the inside, then three wide into the far turn, gained in the six path and between horses turning for home to vie
for the lead in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival in the final furlong, and chased while not having enough to gain place. I HEAR YOU hopped
at the start while breaking slowly, rated far back in the two path, trailed in the three path around the far turn after outer foes made moves, then shifted to the
six path in upper stretch, and chased the leaders home while hanging on her left lead. AMICHE was forced outwardly at the start, tracked in the four path,
stalked into the far turn, inched closer among foes turning for home, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch, and tired in the final furlong.
DRAPES tracked in midpack in the four to three path, but was outmoved by rivals on either side while in the six path around the far turn, trailed entering the
lane, then stayed on in the final furlong. DAWN'S DANCER broke outwardly, stalked in the two path, prompted the leader from the outside while in the three
path into the far turn, bid turning for home, lead very briefly entering the lane, then faltered between horses in upper stretch. OUT OF SORTS tracked from
the three to two path around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, but chased around the far turn before fading. ADELAIDE MISS set a clear
pace with shifting to the three path into the first turn, showed the way in the two path into the far turn, but was bumped by the bidding eventual winner
passing the quarter pole, and caved soon after.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD prompted the pace setter from the outside, bid for the lead entering the lane, exchanged brushes with his inner counterpart in upper stretch
before forging an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear through the late stages. SILVER PROSPECTOR set the pace along the inside, showed
the way from a vying OLYMPIAD around the far turn, dug in while shifting to the two path entering the lane, brushed with that foe while resisting his bid in
upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, gave way soon after, but safely held place. MILES D stalked three wide, came under a drive between
horses at the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the five path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the top two in upper stretch, sustained his chase
while clinging on to show from an inner bidding rival in midstretch, and gamely held that position. O BESOS took a staggered step at the start, laid off of the
pace in the four path around both turns, split rivals approaching midstretch to bid for show inside of MILES D, but was denied that position through the late
stages. HAPPY AMERICAN trailed, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and moved up. UNTREATED tracked from midpack four wide and outside of
foes, but weakened on his left lead in upper stretch. SPRAWL stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase along the rail in upper stretch before
fading at the furlong grounds. MIDCOURT was moving about as the gates opened and broke slowly, tracked in the three path, but faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
CAVALRY CHARGE set the pace inside of a pressing rival, drew clear at the quarter pole, maintained a wide margin into the final furlong, but tired entering
the final sixteenth, and just lasted to the wire. ADHAMO (IRE) was void of early speed and settled at the rear two wide, tipped to the four path around the far
turn before swinging seven wide in upper stretch, rallied through midstretch, surged late in hopes of nailing the tiring leader on the wire, but just missed.
HALO AGAIN tracked along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, dashed four wide in upper stretch, rallied to take aim on the clear leader
entering the final furlong, ranged up to that foe to produce a bid in the late stages as outer rivals closed in, but missed and got outfinished for place. SANTIN
tracked from midpack two wide, tipped to the four path around the far turn, then to the six path in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead passing the three
sixteenths pole, quickened between horses after changing over approaching the final furlong, but missed reaching show while getting outkicked.
CAPTIVATING MOON saved ground off of the pace, shfited four wide in upper stretch, and moved up between. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) settled at the rear
two wide, gained in the five path around the far turn, then stayed on mildly in the seven path. LARGENT stalked two to three wide, but was outkicked in
midstretch, and tired. POINT ME BY laid off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. FORTY UNDER stalked along the inside, then faded at the furlong
grounds. TWO EMMYS vied two wide, stalked into the far turn, but faded entering the lane. MAJOR FED was outrun.

Footnotes
TURNERLOOSE stalked along the inside into the backstretch, tracked into the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied to take aim on GODDESS
OF FIRE in the final furlong, bid with a determined charge at the sixteenth pole, and drove past approaching the wire. GODDESS OF FIRE tracked from
midpack two wide, gained three wide into the far turn, bid entering the lane, led at the furlong grounds, but was caught in the closing stages. AWAKE AT
MIDNYTE tracked two wide, moved to stalk the leader at the five furlong pole, but was outmoved by an outer rival at the three furlong, then got outkicked for
show in upper stretch, chased through the final furlong, and nailed a rival on the wire to regain show. HIDDEN CONNECTION prompted four wide into the
first turn, then two wide entering the backstretch, but was taken wide at the five furlong pole by an inner injured rival before assuming command, led around
the far turn, but gave way at the furlong grounds, and lost show on the wire. MISS MATTIE B broke slowly, saved ground far off fo the pace, improved inside
of wide rivals entering the lane, and chased the main group home. DREAM LITH laid off of the pace two wide, then four to five wide while attempting a rally
turning for home, but failed to menace. NORTH COUNTY laid off of the pace along the inside, then two to three wide aorund the far turn, and failed to factor.
CANDY RAID never got involved. DIVINE HUNTRESS laid off of the apce three wide, but was bothered and taken wide at the nine sixteenths pole by an
inner injured rival, inched closer four wide around the far turn, but was floated wider entering the lane before tiring. CALIFORNIA ANGEL broke slowly, was
slightly hampered by an injured rival at the nine sixteenths pole, and was outrun. LA CRETE set the pace along the inside, but sustained an injury at the five
furlong pole, was pulled up, and vanned off.

Footnotes
EPICENTER bumped with an outer rival at the start, but quickly recovered to set the pace along the inside, felt light to mild pressure from an outer foe down
the backstretch, glided away from that rival passing the quarter pole, drew off under mild hand urging through midstretch, then was geared down through the
final sixteenth with much more to give. SMILE HAPPY rated off of the pace two wide, tracked in the three path between horses while searching for racing
room turning for home, rallied to split rivals at the three sixteenths pole, forged place from outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and was gaining on the
wrapped up leader late. ZANDON broke in the air, raced a bit keen at the back early on before settling at the rear two wide into the first trn, gained five wide
turning for home, but leveled off in upper stretch, got outkicked by an inner foe for place at the furlong grounds, then kept on to reach show on the wire.
PIONEER OF MEDINA bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted that rival from the outside around the first turn, backed off to stalk down the
backstretch, then chased the clearing leader around the far turn, dug in for place between horses approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an
inner foe at that junction, then got nailed on the wire for show. TAWNY PORT broke a beat slowly, saved ground off of the pace, but was shuffled back
behind a tiring RUSSIAN TANK turning for home to trail the field entering the lane, swung to the six path at the quarter pole, then stayed on to surpass tiring
foes. SLOW DOWN ANDY tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer outside of rivals around the far turn before floating four wide entering the lane,
but came up empty thereafter. TRAFALGAR broke a step slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and made
little impact. PAPPACAP stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch. BODOCK tracked two wide, came under a drive between horses into the far
turn, and tired. RUSSIAN TANK laid in midpack along the inside while a path off of the inner railing, but weakened turning for home.
