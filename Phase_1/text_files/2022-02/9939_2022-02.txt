INNATE away ok, took advantage of rival leading rail open and went up to the lead along the inside under own power, inched away from rival throughout the
turn and into the stretch, put to a drive and responded to prove best. MONGOLIAN DREAM stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three
wide on the turn and into the stretch, kept gaining on leader under a drive and finished up a solid second best. HUMBOLDT stalked leaders in between
rivals on the backstretch, rider kept scrubbing on him entering the turn and into the stretch, asked him throughout the stretch and improved to get up for
third. WILLIS away best and cleared early, left rail open and INNATE took advantage by getting the lead approaching the first call, pressed leader two wide
entering the turn and in range entering the stretch, kept on in upper stretch and angled in a path when leader drifted out, finally shorten stride in the late
stages to be passed late. ALEMOON stalked leader along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to threaten when asked in the lane.
