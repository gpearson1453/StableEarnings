Footnotes
INOUAINTALKINTOME came away alertly, prompted the pace on the outside while in hand, turned up the pressure while shaken up in the three path on the
turn, gained the advantage into upper stretch, kicked clear inside the furlong marker, widened under strong urging to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up
while much the best. LIVE IN FIVE set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked for more
outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while clear for
the place. EMERALD BANKER angled to the outside early, dropped back under coaxing then came under stronger encouragement before the five-eighths,
went around the turn in the four path and came up empty. ELEGANT LAOBAN was urged along at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and
showed little.

at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, closed well to take over command just inside the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail.

home, dug in under threat and was overhauled just inside the sixteenth pole, ran on to safely secure the place honors. INVESTMENT GRADE broke in at
the start brushing MIA BEA STAR, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the

Footnotes
INVEST broke out then bumped lightly with a foe, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came out some into
upper stretch then was put to a right-handed crop, dueled inside of the runner-up under a strong hand-ride from the eighth-pole into the final sixteenth, was
given one pop of the right-handed crop on the shoulder about forty yards from the wire and gamely prevailed under strong handling. MAGNETRON tracked
the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the four path on the turn, gained to take the lead in the five path into upper stretch, dueled outside of the
winner to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. POTANTICO settled comfortably in the second flight, saved ground on the turn, was roused
nearing the quarter-pole then put to a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick but was well clear for the show. FLOWERS FOR LISA contested
the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop and weakened. BLOOD MOON bumped with a rival
at the start, settled early then was urged along prior to the three-quarter pole, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to respond.
THREETHEHARDWAY bumped with foes at the start, settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TRAPPEZE ARTIST
was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, angled to the rail leaving the chute, moved out leaving the backstretch, shifted
from three to five wide while roused on the turn and was no factor. PLAYWRIGHT settled early then was urged along, dropped well behind leaving the
backstretch, navigated the turn in the four path and faltered.

Footnotes
JUGGLER got off to an awkward start when the rider lost their balance to the right side, came under hustling and chased inside briefly before tipping out
four to five wide down the backstretch advancing on the front to take command half a mile from home after a brief tussle with THRILL OF IT, shook away
safely on the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and gamely rebuffed the
challenge drifting out late to the wire. THRILL OF IT showed the way early on vying for command from the two path, had the aforementioned foe advance
and yielded the front half a mile from home after a brief fracas to chase in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, rallied to get on near even terms inside the eighth pole, but was ultimately repelled to the finish and shaken off in the final strides.
COLLOQUY broke in at the start bumping ROYAL TIME into CRAWFORD COUNTY, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. CLASH
A. J. chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. RELATE coaxed from the gate,
chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. CRAWFORD COUNTY got bumped at the
start by ROYAL TIME due to pressure from COLLOQUY breaking inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. ROYAL TIME got bumped at the start by COLLOQUY and in turn bumped CRAWFORD COUNTY, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. JOSHUA forwardly placed three wide in aim of the front
vying for command early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
SOUTH STREET was a bit rank under restraint in the three path early on the first turn then dropped closer to the rail, raced at the back of the field while
unhurried, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then quickly shifted five wide, rallied outside under the
crop and closed strongly to get up late. AWESOME AARON saved ground around the opening bend, moved out behind the leading duo while well placed
outside the five-eighths, ranged up to issue an outside challenge in the three path on the final turn, was asked while in front coming to the quarter-pole,
kicked clear into upper stretch, drifted in under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth but was caught while well clear
for the place. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE went four then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked between foes in the two
path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. WRITEITONTHEICE was last to commence,
went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the far turn and came up empty. RED LINE OVERDRIVE moved in while
hustled to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set the pace with company to his outside, was given his cue along the rail on the
far turn, lost the advantage late on that bend and gave way. STJAMES settled off the pace while inside to the two path, was roused on the far turn and failed
to respond. BEYOND BEST went three then four wide on the first turn, settled under some urging, was hard ridden in the four path on the final turn and
faltered.

DR ARDITO just off pace four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path and advanced on the leader under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. FORTY TWO
ACE showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, forcing KODIAK BROWN to
steady along the rail inside that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared
a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors safely on the wire. SON OF AN EX chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled out seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors well clear and along best of the rest. BREADMAN five to six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, continued three wide for home and tired. RUN FOR
BOSTON chased along the inside detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing nearing the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. KODIAK BROWN chased three then two wide making his way to the rail when forced to steady in behind FORTY TWO ACE just
inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

HEY MAMALUKE moved up to take the lead then went clear, drew off to a sizable advantage, went around the turn in the two path, spun four wide into

DEHERE broke out and brushed with a rival, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished
willingly for the place. PIECE OF MY HEART settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, moved off the rail late on that bend and
lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. AUNT KAT was away in good order, followed the leader down the backstretch, was urged three wide for
most of the turn then moved to four wide, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. EASY TO BLESS was unsettled in the gate,
brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to rally.
SWEET WILLEMINA was ridden along towards the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LADY MILAGRO broke out at the start bumping SWEET SURPRISE in tandem with FROSTED WILD RIDE who broke inwards, established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside, began to widen away through the latter portion of the turn and was set down spinning just off the inside for home,
drew off under a drive to prevail. LANFRANKOPHILE hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. SWEET SURPRISE bumped
between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROOSKI five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. KINGDOM QUEEN three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. BEVERLY'S CHARGE broke out at the start bumping with
OFALLTHEGINJOINTS then traded leans with that rival, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. FROSTED WILD RIDE broke in at the start bumping SWEET SURPRISE in concert with LADY MILAGRO, who broke
outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide for home and tired. OFALLTHEGINJOINTS broke in at the start
bumping with BEVERLY'S CHARGE and trading leans with that foe, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. BISTRITA coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and tired.
