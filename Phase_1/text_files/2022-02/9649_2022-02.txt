Footnotes
LUCK IN MY EYES settled off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, angled out seven deep turning for home, drove past. GUY IN THE SKY
dueled inside a rival just off the rail, moved nearer the rail late on the turn, drifted out in late stretch and was no match but held the place. GOLDEN
CARACAL shifted to the rail entering the turn, tracked inside edging closer to the leaders later on that bend, steadied when in tight quarters nearing the
quarter pole, was guided out a bit in upper stretch but again placed in tight quarters late. MARQUIS LIGHTS stalked from outside, went four wide on the
turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch but could not sustain the effort. I AM A SOUL MAN raced toward the rear two wide into the turn, angled five wide past
the three-sixteenths and ran on wild mild late interest. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE dueled outside a rival, went three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.
ALVIS failed to threaten racing inside and well back.

Footnotes
MAX A MILLION RSS was just a bit fractious in the gate, hopped slightly and was bumped at the start then moved out and urged forward, bid outside four
wide leaving the turn, was in charge at the top of the stretch and kicked clear. FEISTY HALO tracked inside, began to shift out past the five-sixteenths, was
five wide at the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner but secured the place. DIXIE JEN settled outside well back, went four to five wide on the
turn, fanned nine deep turning for home and improved position outside. ROYAL QUEEN was within range stalking five wide on the turn, came into upper
stretch seven deep and had no extra late. APPEARTOTRUST settled inside a foe but off the rail toward the rear, went three to four deep on the turn and
was not a real threat. THE PACESETTER broke in just a bit, contested the pace outside three wide, weakened. JASMINE BABY was just a bit fractious in
the gate, hopped and bumped a rival at the start, vied inside but one path off the fence, faded.
