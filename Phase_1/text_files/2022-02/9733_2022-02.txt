Footnotes
SMOOTH AS GLASS broke readily, raced in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace, pressed the issue on the turn to edge forward nearing
upper stretch, was headed midstretch but resisted grudgingly under firm left handed pressure to regain the advantage nearing the wire. SING ALONG SUZY
tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing through the backstretch, steadily gained contention three wide between foes nearing upper stretch, drew on
terms with the eventual winner to strike the front midstretch but couldn't match her rival's kick. LEA ME ALONE, off slowly, shifted to the inside while steadily
gaining position inside foes nearing the turn, lost some momentum when being shuffled back behind tiring foes entering the bend, angled out five wide
racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to regain position. LUNA QUEEN, in touch with the leaders four deep nearing the chute, was eased off
the first flight to track those rivals to the turn, advanced four wide through the bend in tandem with a rival nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive.
TALE OF V K was urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way after a half. U KNOW I B LION, urged inside
foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CREEKMORE broke readily, was urged clear inside foes in the opening stages, shifted off the rail nearing upper stretch dictating the pace on a comfortable
advantage and held sway to the end under right handed encouragement. NATIVE HAWK broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter three wide between
foes in second flight racing into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but prevailed for the place honors between foes nearing the wire. CODETOWIN
tracked off the second flight five wide in the opening stages, steadily gained position four wide through the turn but was outkicked for second. ROARING
RIVER angled to the inside early racing just off the second flight, saved ground to the lane while continuing in pursuit of the winner to midstretch but
flattened out late. TONY SMALL tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted to the inside on the turn but had no rally. SMART N
INTUITIVE, taken up after the start when caught in close quarters early, never gained striking distance. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY flashed brief pace
between foes racing to the turn and faded after a half.

Footnotes
BALI BEACH tracked just off the the leaders inside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance
and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage and go clear in late stages under firm encouragement. HEAVY WEIGHT, urged inside rivals
disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, shook clear on the far turn, held sway past midstretch but proved no match when confronted
by the winner late. CEDAR BEACH, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders outside a rival in the opening half, continued evenly between foes into the
stretch while failing to match the top pair. TAPINTOYOURBEER, carried out by QUICK HIT entering the first turn, then again midway through the first turn,
angled inwards after a half to gain position between foes, then shifted inside foes entering the stretch while continuing evenly. JUPITER RAIN tracked off
the second flight inside rivals in the opening half, tipped out racing through the far turn but had no closing bid. BENCH WALK, off slowly, was forced wide
avoiding TAPINTOYOURBEER racing through the first turn and never gained contention. GOLDEN WONDER, in touch prompting the pacesetter to the
backstretch, gave way after a half. QUICK HIT, urged between foes pursuing the leaders soon after the break, drifted out racing into the first turn, then again
midway through that bend bothering TAPINTOYOURBEER and BENCH WALK, dropped out last on the backstretch, was soon outdistanced but walked off
the course under his own power.

Footnotes
MY BLONDE MARY, in touch with the first flight three deep in early stages, prompted the pacesetter through the turn, lost some ground to that foe shifting
out to the four path in upper stretch but responded to firm encouragement to wrest a clear advantage in time. KENAI COOL, urged between foes dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, edged away to a clear advantage in upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's final bid. CLEM GEM
tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share
late while no threat to the top pair. MAMBO DANCER tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards continuing between foes
through the turn but lacked the needed final kick. SUNDRENCHED, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pacesetter into the turn, gave way nearing
upper stretch while drifting wide into the lane. HOLY DIVER tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages and steadily faded racing into the turn.
LAPULGA dwelt at the start to leave the gate well behind the field and failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START, BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TOWERING GAZE tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced on that foe racing into the far turn,
bid for command in tandem with FORBIDDEN DREAM nearing upper stretch, then edged clear in the closing stages under firm encouragement.
FORBIDDEN DREAM was rated between foes to the backstretch, steadily gained position after a half, shifted to the inside on the far turn to bid inside the
pacesetter in tandem with the winner racing into upper stretch but was outkicked. ASTERS D'ORO broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin racing
a bit off the rail to the second bend, then gave way between the top pair racing into upper stretch. MAP THE MOMENT broke awkwardly, switched out four
wide entering the backstretch while being prompted to contend but steadily faded into the far turn. ADIOS DEE DEE tracked the pacesetter inside foes to
the backstretch and gave way nearing the far turn.

BLAZE AWAY N HIDE, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the bend, edged forward while shifting off the inside midstretch and went
clear late under firm left handed encouragement. LI'L MISS CAMILLE broke sharply, angled inwards to force the pace outside the eventual winner through
the backstretch into the bend but couldn't match that rival leaving midstretch. LOVERS AT MIDNIGHT ducked out at the start, was righted quickly to track
off the second flight while shifting inwards nearing the bend, angled to the rail on the turn and continued with interest inside foes to late stages to prevail for
a share. DANCE FOR GOLD switched off the inside in early stages tracking just off the leaders racing into the bend but faded in the closing stages.
NATASHA'S BIZNIZ angled inwards tracking off the second flight racing into the turn but proved no threat. BALLYMENA tracked off the first flight racing
three wide to the turn and gave way outside foes racing into upper stretch. DISPERATA was settled into stride while angling to the inside in the opening
stages and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MENELAO was rated off the first flight three deep between foes racing into the first turn, angled to the rail after a half, was prompted to advance inside foes
entering the second bend to challenge for command inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then edged forward in late stages under firm right handed
encouragement. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT broke sharply, dictated the pace off the rail racing to the backstretch, shifted to the three path nearing the second
bend while holding sway on a clear advantage, resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved only second best in the drive. STRATFORD, off
awkwardly while dropping out last, settled into stride well off the field to the backstretch, gathered momentum splitting foes leaving the far turn, angled four
wide entering the lane and continued well enough to prove best of the others while earning a share. THATZA ALPHA angled inwards racing to the first turn
to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the second bend, then faded near the inside in the closing stages. DANCING SOLDAT, forwardly

Footnotes
PHARAOH FANCY PANT tracked off the first flight while under some prompting along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out three deep nearing the
second bend, was roused to advance between foes in that path entering the second bend, gained striking distance between foes, angled inside the
pacesetter racing into upper stretch to wrest command and went clear under pressure. THRU THE VINE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while
being prompted to contend, shifted inwards on the backstretch prompting the leader, took over nearing the far turn to set the pace off the inside through the
far turn but proved no match for the winner in the drive. MR. EINSTEIN settled along the inside in early stages, continued in that fashion to the far turn,
tipped out entering the lane and made an effort to improve position while prevailing for a share. WESTERN ADVANTAGE settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch, advanced entering the far turn to lodge a brief, four wide bid nearing upper stretch but soon flattened out. STAR DEPUTY, urged inside rivals
dictating the pace in the opening half, gave way into the far turn. DOUBLE DAVID tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes to the backstretch and
faded after a half. SIDE TRACKED, forwardly placed between prompting a rival's pace, gave way early.
