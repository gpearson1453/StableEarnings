Footnotes
BREVIARY broke a step slow, advanced three to four wide to contention around the first turn, disputed the pace three wide outside M.J.'S LADY through the
backstretch run, fought on between foes from the far turn to the quarter pole, emerged four wide into the lane while dueling to the inside of CONGRESS
HALL, took a short lead near the sixteenth pole, drifted out and edged clear at the line while under strong handling. CONGRESS HALL tracked the pace
four wide, edged up between runners nearing the far turn and joined the pace fray, gained a slim lead while five wide outside the winner into the lane,
maintained a slim advantage past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly while drifting out. LOVE IS STRONG settled within range while off the rail, edged
under a ride while between rivals into the stretch, had aim on the embattled leaders past mid stretch but failed to seriously follow through. LIFE IN FLASH
saved ground stalking the pace, edged up some around the final turn, chased past mid stretch then faded. LANA , four to five wide, ranged up outside rivals
to force the pace past the half mile marker, failed to kick on with the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths and came up empty. M. J.'S LADY took a short
lead early on while in the two path, handled pressure into the far turn, fought on the inside of rivals leaving the five sixteenths then faded through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
RUBI DE LEON , under urging soon after the break, raced forwardly in the two path on the turn, split foes in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and
was kept under pressure in the drive. KOBE'S GIRL lacked speed, circled rivals four deep on the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and rallied
outside horses. DIAL ME MAYBE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, reached a striking position approaching the eighth pole and flattened out.
HELLO JAMROCK , along the inner rail on the turn, failed to rally. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced inside
horses on the turn and lacked a rally. SHE'S GOT GAME bore out leving the starting gate, raced well off the rail on the turn and was not a factor. SALTY
SAUL sprinted clear while a bit rank down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MINECRAFTER settled back off of a contested pace while saving ground, moved up along the rail passing the three eighths pole, edged up behind the
leading duo past the three sixteenths, eased out then split rivals, took command soon past the furlong grounds and drew clear under a drive.
KNOWHOWIKNOW moved up inside rivals leaving the chute then got engaged in a duel with FREE SQAURE past the five eighths, carried that battle to mid
stretch, kept on well from there and earned the place. FREE SQUARE , away well and took the early lead, had company to his inside and got caught up in a
battle outside KNOWHOWIKNOW leaving the five furlong marker, was under pressure continuing the scrum three wide into the stretch, ceded command
leaving the eighth pole and faded late. HANG TIGHT bobbled at the break, dropped off the early pace while saving some ground, eased out into the lane but
failed to generate a solid run. RELATIVLEA settled in the clear while off the inside, was put to a strong ride three to four wide past the half mile pole, failed
to kick on and retreated. LORD MIO , between rivals with the early pace, rated back off the leaders past the three quarter pole, was under asking chasing
the duel mid turn, had no response and gave way.

Footnotes
HAYNE'S FEVER , under a snug hold two to three wide outside the leader, seized command near the quarter pole, responded when set down in upper
stretch, eagerly widened and won under a steady hand ride. TAPPIN FOR GLORY settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out and picked up
some momentum past the three eighths, angled four wide advancing into the lane, straightened and churned on willingly to nab the place in the final jumps.
ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN cleared early and set a rated pace, was shadowed by the winner through the backstretch run, felt more pressure leaving the far
turn, dueled past the five sixteenths, gave way grudgingly in the final furlong and just failed to hold the place. LINDA'S NEKIA stalked the leaders while two
to three wide, failed to kick on under pressure into the lane and faded. LUCKY RAMSEY was steadied back from between runners heading to the first turn,
dropped in to save ground, made a bit of a run under a strong drive past the five sixteenths but flattened out in the lane. ALWAYS FORGIVEN broke a step
slow, raced three wide into the first turn, steadied off heels leaving the three quarter pole, was taken four wide into the far turn but lacked a rally.
PURIMETER , in the two path, was under asking between foes near the far turn and faded. FIND YOUR BOAZ , three wide early, gave way. PER RULING
22-047 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, LINDA'S NEKIA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

BACI accelerated to a clear, early lead, set the pace along the rail and was under energetic urging in the drive. TEQUILA FOG raced inside horses in the
two path around the turn, remained inside the lane and had a slight rally. WICKED JANE lacked speed, swung to the five path near the eighth pole and
rallied outside horses. AWESOME VIEW , in the three path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. AZZURRA circled the three three
deep, floated to the four path at the head of the stretch and weakened. RAN CHAR stumbled leaving the starting gate, was a forward factor along the rail
down the backstretch and weakened entering the stretch.

Footnotes
EMMA DEVINE prompted the pace two to three wide outside SUPERIORITY, applied more pressure past the three eighths, gained a slim lead entering the
lane, shook clear leaving mid stretch and pulled away under a drive. MO FIRE , between rivals while not far back, shifted out four wide into the lane and
kept on willingly to earn the place. SUPERIORITY was sent clear early, set the pace towards the rail, dueled from the five sixteenths to about mid stretch
then gave way grudgingly. HOLY PINK , away alertly, drafted back off the leaders and saved ground, moved up past the five sixteenths, angled out leaving
the three sixteenths and churned on. CIVIL UNREST , three deep chasing the pace, shifted five wide into the stretch, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and faded. LA REINA SUSAN was steadied early, dropped off the pace and failed to respond. JAMERICAN flashed speed, lost action in behind
nearing the five eighths, was pulled up soon after and vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry into the backstretch run but no action was taken
