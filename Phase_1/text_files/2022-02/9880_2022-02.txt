Footnotes
MORNING COCKTAIL vied outside of BREEHAZEL in the early going, could not match strides with rival mid-way around the turn but remained forwardly
placed, spun out five wide into the upper stretch, moved back up to challenge for the late lead and edged away under steady urging. BREEHAZEL vied for
the early lead racing inside of MORNING COCKTAIL, shook free mid-way through the turn, continued with a narrow on top by a narrow margin in the final
furlong then got edged out when the winner drove by late. LOOKING FOR LOVE bumped with rival at the start then chased in contention along the rail just
off the top pair, hustled along two wide into the lane, moved up into striking distance in the final sixteenth and narrowly missed place. SHAWNEE
PRINCESS chased the top flight from the outside in early stages, was ridden along three wide into the lane, stayed in the mix but lacked the needed
response for serious impact. HOT ANNA raced four wide in the back, came out wider for the drive and had a mild improve. SUNDAY SUZANNE bumped
with rival at the start then got in tight between foes shortly after the start, chased along the rail through the turn, saved ground into the lane and failed to kick
on. EVELYN raced off the second flight heading into the turn, came four wide into the lane and offered no late rally. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

WIN OR CELLAR sprinted to the lead soon after the start, held firm two wide through the turn, roused for more in the upper stretch, responded, widened
advantage and remained clear under steady urging. FEARLESS GIRL raced in the last flight and angled inside leaving the backstretch, tipped out a path
wider and took closer order late on the turn, came out wider for the drive, produced a solid finish but had to settle for second best. BET ON DRAMA chased
two wide between foes around the turn, was no late match for the top pair in the stretch run but stayed on and captured show in final stride. DRILLZILLA
moved up in close contention along the rail nearing the quarter pole, weakened off the top pair in the upper stretch and got nipped for show. LATTE LOVER
was off slow at the start, chased four wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. RAIN OF BLESSING raced three wide in contention around
the turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MYSTERY BANK broke on top and angled in then conceded position to LARGE entering the first turn, stalked rival two wide up the backstretch, given cue
along the rail leaving the final turn, roused forward to the lead at the head of the lane and kept clear. VELOCE secured inside position around the first turn
and tracked the leader along the rail through early stages, tipped out midway around the final turn, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch,
produced a solid finish and cleared second best. EXPONENTIAL settled off the early pace, hustled up three to four wide around the far turn, shifted to the
inside in the upper stretch and captured show. LARGE took over the lead entering the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the
winner at the head of the lane but ran on and got edged late for show. GENERAL settled two wide off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the
upper stretch, angled in under pressure and improved position. NOT SO EASY rated between foes up the backstretch, moved up three wide to race in close
contention late on the far turn, sustained bid into the stretch then gave way in the final sixteenth. RESIDENT LIBERAL raced three wide off the early pace,
hustled up four wide into the upper stretch then angled in and failed to move on. FINDING MISCHIEF was a bit awkward with head at the start, was
reserved in the back, saved ground and never menaced. BEINFUN rated outside in the flight tracking the leader up the backstretch then came up empty late
on the final turn. UNDEFILED tracked the pace up the backstretch then came up empty on the final turn.

Footnotes
CLASSICSTATEOFMIND sped to the lead soon after the start and took the inside position, held a slim lead over LIVING WATER late on the turn, tapped on
the shoulder turning for home, had plenty left in reserve, widened to a clear advantage and remained clear under steady encouragement. JUST SAY WHEN
raced in contention just off the top pair around the turn, given cue three to four wide at the head of the lane and produced a solid finish. LIVING WATER was
forwardly placed and raced just off the leader late on the turn, could not remain in touch with the winner approaching the upper stretch but ran on and held
show. TOPS THE CHART lost iron at the start and raced near the back, regained shortly after and saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the
drive and narrowly missed show. AMERICAN STARLET slightly hopped and broke out at the start then angled inside leaving the backstretch, gained closer
contention along the rail, sustained inside bid into the final furlong then gave way late. CONAGHER brushed with rival at the start, saved ground around the
turn, tipped four wide for the drive and failed to kick on. FAITHFUL RULER raced two to three wide near midpack around the turn then weakened in the
upper stretch. BRIT'S CANDYMAN brushed with rival at the start, raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. RUN UP

PRINCESS CUPID broke on top and dueled outside of YOGA QUEEN around the turn, began to edge away two wide at the head of the lane, came under
left-handed pressure with a furlong left to run, drifted out wider and impeded the progress on oncoming MUGURUZA. ARROW SHAPE chased three to four
wide around the turn, drifted out losing some ground entering the upper stretch, stayed on with response and produced a solid finish. MUGURUZA was
ridden along the inside around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, began to edge up closer to PRINCESS CUPID with a furlong left to run, got shut off
when rival drifted out, checked sharply and lost all momentum. YOGA QUEEN dueled inside of PRINCESS CUPID around the turn, remained forwardly
placed to the final furlong then steadily weakened. WOW TAPIT raced in contention chasing the embattled duo around the turn then failed to keep pace in
the lane. CANDYMEISTER raced in the back, tucked inside around the turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. STEWARDS
POSTED AN INQUIRY, RIDER OF MUGURUZA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST PRINCESS FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW
PRINCESS CUPID WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD

Footnotes
BETH'S DREAM got carried out a few paths at the start, cleared the lead and steadily angled over to the inside, held a slim lead over threatening BATTLE
CRY late on the backstretch, let out a notch and regained a clear advantage, held firm still unleashed around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the
upper stretch, widened to a commanding lead, tapped once right handed past the furlong marker then angled inside and finished ridden out. BATTLE CRY
stalked the pacesetter through the early going then edged up to briefly apply pressure to BETH'S DREAM late on the backstretch, could not remain in touch
with rival but sustained a two wide bid through the turn, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and finished well clear for second best.
RASPBERRY BALLET rated off the early pace, hustled up along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and ran on for a share. TIZ
ENOUGH raced outside in the back, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten. CELESTIAL CHEETAH tracked the pace up
the backstretch, chased the top pair three wide around the turn then faded in the lane. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL rated three wide in early stages, chased two
wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and had no late response. FREAK saved ground up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the
turn and dropped back in the lane. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE

three to four wide a furlong out, dug in under left handed-pressure and edged away. KATIESDREAMGIRL was allowed to settle out of the gate, continued in
the back and saved ground, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, vied for the lead in the final furlong and
got outkicked late. JAZZY T prompted the pace up the backstretch, dueled outside of COOL FRONT around the far turn, battled on into the final furlong then
yielded late. WINTER PRINCESS settled and saved ground through early stages, hustled up two wide around the far turn, came out five wide in the upper
stretch, sustained a steady bid but needed more for late impact. COOL FRONT set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled inside JAZZY T around the
far turn, fought back to the furlong marker then came up tired. PARDON MY HEART raced near midpack up the backstretch, remained in contention three
wide around the far turn then weakened turning for home. SYSTEMATIC rated through early stages, showed interest while ridden four wide around the final
turn then came out wider for the drive and gave way. DOUBLE DOT raced midpack and came up empty after a half. RUN UP AVAILABLE
