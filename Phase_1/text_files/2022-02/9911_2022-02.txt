Footnotes
CUZ tracked just off the first flight a bit off the inside in the opening quarter, came around a tiring foe leaving the midway point of the turn, angled to the rail
to bid for command inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage to prevail under right handed encouragement. TIZ
HANDSOME came around GOLD CZAR at the start, was urged to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage to the turn, dueled inside a rival on
the bend, then outside the eventual winner into upper stretch but couldn't quite match that foe. CAPTAIN tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the
turn, was fanned six wide avoiding some drifting rivals racing through the stretch but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. CPOWER, in touch
with the pacesetter three deep prompting that rival, pressed the issue racing into the bend, gave way racing into upper stretch, then drifted out markedly in
the closing stages. GOLD CZAR ducked out slightly at the start, was settled last to the turn, steadied off AKTHAM, then altered course in upper stretch but
had no closing response. AKTHAM, urged prompting the pace inside rivals on the backstretch, gave way after a half, then drifted out racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
SASSY LIKE JULIA was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch, quickly shook
clear and held sway to the end under right handed pressure. STARSHIP PRECIOUS tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, angled
inwards entering the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. ESTILO DIFERENTE angled inwards to force the pace outside
a rival racing into the turn but couldn't match that rival through the final three sixteenths while losing second late. BLUSHING KEYLEN tracked just off the
first flight three wide in the opening stages, was prompted to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the closing stages. FOLK HERO
settled outside foes just off the second flight, continued three wide into the turn but had no closing response. FALL CAMPAIGN ducked inwards while a bit
slow to gather stride at the start, was prompted to a position tracking just off the leaders along the rail racing to the turn but emptied out early.

WESTWARD LOOK broke in bumping DYNAMORE was urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, disputed the pace on a narrow
advantage through the backstretch to the far turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. MR.
EINSTEIN, caught four wide leaving the chute, tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight to the far turn, tipped three wide racing into the
lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. MORE CHANCES, shut off just after the start, switched outside foes racing through the
chute while being urged to gain terms with the pacesetter racing into the first turn, pressed the issue outside that foe through the backstretch to the far turn
and faded in late stages. WESTERN ADVANTAGE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide entering the
lane and continued evenly late. NIP OF BOURBON, taken up in the opening stages avoiding tight quarters, settled along the inside to the backstretch,
switched out after a half, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch while gaining some position but made no real impact. ROSE FOR A SAINT was rated
off the second flight inside rivals racing to the first turn, was shuffled back behind MURCIELAGO midway through the backstretch and offered no rally.
CLEVER FELLOW, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, switched outside foes racing through the backstretch, raced four wide leaving the far
turn but came up empty in the drive. DYNAMORE, bumped at the start, ducked inwards in the opening stages crossing the paths of MORE CHANCES and
NIP OF BOURBON and dropped out early. MURCIELAGO drifted inwards racing through the chute to gain a position just off the pacesetter racing to the
first turn, was pulled up midway through the backstretch, then walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
CLIFFY, forwardly placed along the rail racing into the first turn, tipped out entering the backstretch while being prompted to close the gap on the pacesetter,
continued with a steady bid racing into the far turn to pressed the issue, then wrested the advantage racing into the lane and edged clear late under firm left
handed encouragement. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
to the far turn but couldn't contain the winner in the drive. THANK YOU settled last racing to the far turn, then came through near the inside to edge a rival
for a share nearing the wire. STRONG ENDING tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch but
had no rally. SHAKEM N BREAKEM tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid racing into the
far turn, lost terms with the leaders while being fanned four wide into the stretch and steadily faded. PAINTER'S PRIDE tracked just off the second flight
racing three wide to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SKYLANDER was rated along the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance for the opening six furlongs, briefly awaited an opening
leaving the far turn while tipping off the inside, split foes to bid for command inside the leader racing through the stretch and wrested a narrow advantage in
time under firm handling. JAMES JONES tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out leaving the far turn to
advance on the leaders four wide, drifted inwards racing through the stretch while being urged to challenge for command but was just outkicked. GRAND
CAY, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, gradually drew into contention saving ground through the far turn to upper stretch, switched out nearing
midstretch, then split rivals four wide in the closing stages while finishing willingly to close the gap and prevailing for a share. DEFENSIBLE tracked off the
second flight outside foes racing to the second bend, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into the stretch and continued in that path to
make a mild bid. ROCK THE STARS tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance outside a rival in the opening half, was urged three deep racing
into the far turn to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into upper stretch, but lacked the needed final response while being carried into the path of THE
THUNDERER by JAMES JONES in the closing stages. AZURE SKY settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide racing into the
stretch and displayed some belated interest to gain some position. THE THUNDERER tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance a bit off the rail
racing to the backstretch, closed the gap on that foe in tandem with ROCK THE STARS to lodge a brief bid between foes entering the far turn, couldn't
sustain that effort leaving midstretch and was carried inwards in late stages while giving way. MOON WARRIOR settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. MAPACHE G hopped at the start and trailed the field to the stretch. WOOTDAREITIS, urged to the lead while
angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn and gave out abruptly into the stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

PREPARE FOR GLORY tracked just off the leaders three wide on the backstretch, steadily advanced outside the pacesetter on the turn to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch, edged away to a clear advantage and held sway to the end under firm handling. HIGH FIVE COTTON tracked the leaders
along the inside in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. SLIPPY, urged along
the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, lost the advantage racing into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with
a second effort while failing to match the top pair. BERHANU angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, angled inside once gaining
the advantage entering the bend, dueled for command inside the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way. BLACK V. K. settled last and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
THRU THE VINE was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, met a rival's
challenge nearing upper stretch and held grudgingly to the end under left handed pressure to prevail. OUR STUIE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace
in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn past midstretch and was just outfinished. REINER tracked off the first flight between foes to the
backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn while being prompted to advance, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and continued with
interest to close the gap on the top pair. UNCLE ARMANDO was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, was urged to advance while
angling out four wide nearing the lane and continued to make mild progress to the end. DECEIVER, reserved inside foes racing to the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn and continued with interest inside foes to improve position. BODIE CODY tracked the leaders three deep in second flight in the
opening half, continued outside a rival into the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. HOLIDAY DANCER switched outside rivals in the last flight
leaving the chute, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and offered no rally. FEISTY KITTEN settled outside foes in early stages and failed to
menace thereafter. SIDE TRACKED tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half.
SUNNY SAINT, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing through the chute, steadied out of tight quarters entering the
first turn and dropped out early. PER RULING #2022-014112 FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, THRU THE VINE WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
TINKER'S PAL broke a bit slowly, was prompted to gain position inside foes on the backstretch, was held up avoiding close quarters along the rail nearing
the turn, saved ground through the turn while being prompted to advance inside foes approaching upper stretch, came through tight quarters to bid inside
the pacesetter racing past the furlong marker and wrested a narrow advantage in time under pressure. FREE SPIRIT, urged to dispute the pace while
angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled inside a rival racing into the bend, dispatched that rival racing into upper stretch while shifting a bit off the
inside, resisted the winner's bid but came up second best, then was vanned off the course following the race when failing to return to be unsaddled.
POSEIDONS MYTH angled inwards leaving the chute to track off the first flight between foes, angled to the inside crossing the path of the eventual winner
racing into the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. WANNA WOW YOU broke readily,
forced the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. GIOVANE'S PROMISE tracked off the second flight in
early stages, switched out after the opening quarter while being prompted to terms with the second flight between foes, was urged to lodge a brief bid three
wide entering the bend but emptied out nearing the lane. PRAKRITI tracked off the second flight four wide in early stages, was fanned five wide racing
through the turn while being urged to advance but had no rally. RAL COPPERHEADROAD switched outside foes to race five deep behind the second flight
on the backstretch, dropped back while angling inwards racing into the turn but lacked a closing response. TWO STEP DANCE broke through the gate
before the start, was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders four wide through the backstretch into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. WHONEW'S
TREASURE broke awkwardly while ducking out sharply in the opening stages and failed to menace thereafter. POWERFUL NATIVE dropped out early.

Footnotes
JACK RABBIT QUICK broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing just off the rail to the backstretch, repelled several challengers nearing
upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. MISTA DONZELLA angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of
striking distance, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out three wide racing through the stretch while continuing with a steady late bid to prevail for the
place honors. BATTLE CREEK settled last while angling to the rail racing through the chute, tipped off the inside on the far turn, swung out five wide racing
through the stretch and found his best stride late to close the gap on the top pair. OVERPRAISE was rated along the inside from well out of striking
distance, saved ground through the far turn, then tipped out three deep racing through the stretch while continuing with interest to gain position between
foes to the end. SEAZAN, reserved outside a rival tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance in early stages, was prompted to advance three
deep on the far turn, was fanned four wide racing through the stretch and continued with an even effort. SPIRITUAL KING tracked the leaders a bit off the
inside racing to the backstretch, advanced three wide into the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. BUC'S INVESTMINT,
reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out nearing the stretch but had no closing bid. BLAKENSTEIN, forwardly placed
stalking the pacesetter, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes racing through the far turn but gave way into the lane. CASTLE KING proved no factor.
LAST INVESTMENT switched outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.
