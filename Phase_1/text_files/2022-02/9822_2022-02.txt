Footnotes
BULL MEECHUM took the lead on the chute and rated the early pace, was hand urged away from the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the turn
then kept alert through the lane. PRINCE JACOB gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn and settled for second best. TICKLING SPRINGS broke inward to
make contact with Vidmer's Courage then gave chase, rounded the turn two deep then dueled clear of ISLAND CADGER the final strides. The latter gave
chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn then yielded in the stretch duel for third. VIDMER'S COURAGE was bumped at the break and gave chase well off the
rail, ran in the four and five paths of the turn and showed little in the lane. MINI BOLT gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and never factored.

yards. IMPETUOUS gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and was along for third later yards. ZAINO BOYZ chased, raced close off the rail on
the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. ONE MORE FACTOR gave chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. TO
THE FRONT gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. FREEDOM IS RINGING hesitated at the break, was slow getting into

CIELO AZUL stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled for the nod toward the three eighths pole, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. SAN ANTONE settled off the pace and off the rail, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second while outfinished for
the win. GIGGING was bumped lightly at the break then saved ground, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, dug
in from the top of the stretch and was closing on the runner-up. MUTAKAAMIL settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn still about the three path and showed little further. PETULANT DELIGHT came away awkwardly and made
light contact with Gigging then rated a slim lead inside, was met and dueled at even terms into the backstretch, gave up the nod toward the three eighths
pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. MARTIN MAN settled back saving ground on the first turn, moved out and gave chase into the backstretch then
