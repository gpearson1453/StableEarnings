Footnotes
LIL LATIGO pressed the pace while racing inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely. READY TO FORGIVE was
checked entering the turn, was blocked and angled in sharply leaving the turn and closed when clear. GATO DE RAYO pressed the pace, bid five wide and
closed well to earn show. PUT YOUR PANTS ON raced close to the pace outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
VIX HERO broke a step slowly, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. SUPER ACCORD dueled to the turn, swung wide and gave way.
FLYCATCHER set a pressured pace, was checked on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS KITTY set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. SWEET LADY LANA stalked the pace, bid willingly,
couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a good effort. SCAT ATTACK raced inside, was steadied on the turn and lacked the needed late rally. KIKI
MY STAR raced close to the pace outside, went widest in the drive and failed to rally. SEENEVA THE CAT was never far back and failed to threaten in an
even effort. ARIZONA BREW saved ground, was steadied on the turn and lacked a bid. BELLA'S GIFT broke slowly and trailed the field.

drew off for a clear lead, faltered and held safely for show. WIN LIKE COACH P trailed the field, finished well and gained late. RANDOM PLEASURE
pressed inside to the second turn and flattened out. GOLDEN GODDESS set the pace, tired into the turn and gave way. FILTHY was through after a half.

CATS TOUCH raced mid pack inside, angled out on the turn, bid eight wide and drew clear late. BLAME IT ON KITTY broke slowly and was squeezed at
the start, raced wide and closed well to get up for place. ANGELO'S PRIDE was never far back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and
gained late. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES veered out at the start, pressed the pace while racing three wide, bid willingly to duel, yielded late and lost position.
SHIFTY DANCER set a pressure pace to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. EMPEROR'S CHOICE broke out and bumped at the start, stalked
the pace while boxed in and had nothing left for the drive. SPIRIT MISSION bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing inside and leveled off in the
drive. CHEF was not a factor. DYF dropped inside to save ground and lacked a bid. GRANDPA A. C. advanced to the turn, tired and stopped. Fractional
split of 13866 was removed.

Footnotes
SMILING SPIRIT advanced to the turn, closed willingly and wore down her rivals to get up late. SMOOTH RITHMS was hustled along to set a pressured
pace to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. MONGOLIAN ROSE was never far back, went eight wide leaving the turn, found her best stride
late and was gaining ground. OUR LITTLE TIGER pressed the pace while racing inside, bid and hung. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ was never far back, lacked a
rally and did not threaten. KARALINKA raced in the back, went eight wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. QUEENS RANSOM showed speed to the turn
and gave way. TIZ TENACIOUS lagged outside and failed to contend. MICKEY DOBBS pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.
