Footnotes
HIP FOUR O FOUR vied for the lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage around the second turn, dueled down the lane with MIDNIGHT
NIGHTMARE and prevailed for the win. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE challenged on the front end, saved ground around the second turn, dueled down the lane,
was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SHAR'S TREASURE raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside,
made a wide bid and proved no match for the top two. FELLER was an early factor, faded and was no threat late. DAPPER DAN MAN lacked early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. FUNNY ACTOR dueled on the front end, faded and finished evenly near the back. HE HAD A SECRET void of early
speed, had an outside trip and showed little. SMILING SONG always raced near the back and was outrun.

start, vied on the front end, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. COROT showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match
for the top two. NATE'S WAY pressed the pace, was close throughout and lacked a late kick. TOP BRASS raced near the back, came around the turn on
the outside, finished wide and was no factor. POLO ART stumbled at the start, raced in the back and was never close. LUNAR LIGHT void of early speed,
saved ground around the turn and showed little. BAPTISM bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and dropped
back.

NONEYA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. JERSEY HOTTIE void of
early speed, moved up entering the second turn, racing outside, made a bid, couldn't catch the winner, but proved an easy second. GOODBYE GREELEY
went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and lacked a finish. OAK HILL SENIORITA lacked early speed, came around the second turn off the rail and
was never a factor. SOUVENIR CHANNEL raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. ROSE OF CIMARRON
was fractious in the gates, raced within contention in the early going, retreated and trailed late.

Footnotes
JUS MY IMAGINATION sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and proved much the best. FIRSTSLATE pressed the pace, raced three wide
around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. UNTETHERED SOUL raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout,
finished wide and was a clear third. ROMANTIC BEAST broke out, raced near the back, saved ground around the turn, showed late interest, but was no
factor. ENVOYS LEGACY void of early speed, moved up, but was no threat. G KATE bumped at the start, raced near the middle of the field and put forth an
even effort. BUILDING HOME pressed the early pace and dropped back. AUTUMN ASPEN raced in the middle of the pack, faded and was no threat late.
WICKED FLASHBACK always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
VODKA GIMLET raced near the middle of the field, moved up around the final turn, waited, blocked, angled out, rallied and proved the best late.
LIGHTNING STRUCK raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead at the head of the stretch and was caught late. TOTALIZER
lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, made a steady gain, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished by the top two. SILENT
POWER void of early speed, made a late wide gain and finished willingly. SIMPLY WICKED raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. FIESTY
FIST went to front, drove clear, dueled with BRIANS'S IRON MIKE and was finished early. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE dueled for the early advantage, was used
up and trailed late.
