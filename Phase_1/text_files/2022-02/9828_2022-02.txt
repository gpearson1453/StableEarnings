Footnotes
MERCY MERCY stalked the pace along the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, drew alongside the leader in the final furlong and drove past in the final
sixteenth. MYLITTLERUNAWAY set the pace in the two path, saved ground around the far turn while traveling clear, challenged from outside in the final
furlong and yielded late. SUGARY unhurried in the early going while outside a rival, came two to three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane, then
rallied rallied but was not enough. A NEW PEACE stalked the pace outside a rival, tipped out at the top of the stretch and lacked a late bid. MISS
FLAWLESS (FR) broke well then settled off the pace, went to wide on the first turn, raced along the rail on the second bend and could not rally. GEA came
away slow, steered to the inside, moved to the two path for the second bend and failed to menace. ZABAVA settled along the inside, saved ground to the
stretch and never got involved. FIRST RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
STIR THE POT was off a bit slow from inside, vied for command inside a pair of rivals, shook free in upper stretch and inched away. DREAM ROBBER
came in and bumped rival early, vied three deep for command into and around the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on for a clear
second. QUANTUM QUEST broke out and bumped rival at the start, vied between rivals for command, was crowded a bit at the three-sixteenths pole and
weakened. ALEXANDER'S DREAM got bumped from outside early, tracked three then four wide around the turn and could not rally. TOO LATE got
bumped from inside leaving the gate, crowded between rivals and shuffled back a bit early, chased two wide through the turn and weakened. THERE WAS
AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER ABOARD ALEXANDER'S DREAM AGAINST DREAM ROBBER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE EARLY IN THE
RACE ALONG WITH A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH DREAM ROBBER CAME IN AND MADE CONTACT WITH ALEXANDER'S DREAM, THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST ALEXANDER'S DREAM
A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
BENDER got bumped on both sides at the start then steadied soon after, trailed early on and moved inside, steered out on the far turn and came four wide
into the lane, closed fast in the final furlong and got up in the closing moments. STREET RUCKUS sped to the front from inside, set all the pace to the
stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth but was caught late. COSMO stalked the pacesetter on the inside, was coaxed around the far turn, tipped out
in upper stretch, lacked the needed late punch but finished willingly behind the top pair. GOLDINI got bumped from inside at the start, tracked in the two
path outside a rival, moved out to the three path on the backstretch, continued three wide into the drive and lacked a late bid. SWISS SWOO (IRE) bumped
twice in the beginning, stalked in the two path, flanked the leader into the far turn, lost ground and positions on the far turn and weakened. EL JOY got
bumped between rivals at the start, settled outside a rival, shifted three wide into the stretch and weakened. ME B BUBBA T broke out and bumped rival,
pulled early first time through the stretch, hugged the rail into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ALEXIS broke alertly and quickly took control, took pressure into the turn, held a short lead through the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and
drew away under right-handed urging and steady handling. SWEET CALIFORNIA stumbled badly at the start, went up to chased the speed between foes,
bid from outside into the turn, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to save the place. GHOSTEM trailed early on, went two wide into
the turn, angled out a bit then came back to the two path leaving the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished well to miss the place. WARREN'S QUEEN
BEE tracked the pace from inside, tipped out and split foes past the quarter pole and needed to find more in the final furlong. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH was
forwardly placed behind the pacesetter, chased on the rail through the turn and flattened out. ROMAN EMPRESS traveled in range four deep into and
around the turn and failed to menace. TIZZY TWISTER was off slow to begin, coaxed early and went up to chase three deep, went three to four wide into
the lane and weakened. EQUIVALENCE chased widest up the backstretch, took the turn five wide, eased in the lane, bled following the race and walked off.

Footnotes
FLORAL ESSENCE set the pace on the inside, held a short lead on the second turn then cleared leaving that bend and held safely in the final sixteenth.
SONG OF FIRE steadied off the heels of the leader into the first turn, stalked from inside up the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and finished well to
gain the place. ST HELENA was rank into the first turn, tracked outside a rival, went two then three wide on the second bend and edged RENEGADE
PRINCESS for the show. RENEGADE PRINCESS threw her head and came away a bit slow at the start, steered down to the two path, came three wide
into the lane, angled out at the top of the stretch and missed the show. PISTACHIO PRINCESS raced up close outside the pacesetter, kept the pressure on
around the turn, lost contact into the stretch and weakened. RESARCIO lost her footing, stumbled and came away slow, went two then three wide around
the first turn, angled out to the four path on the far turn and made no impact.

Footnotes
SOY TAPATIO went three wide into the first turn then moved out to the five path around the bend, continued wide to the far turn, came four wide into the
stretch, closed well through the final furlong and inhaled the runner-up. MONGOLIAN FORD got bumped leaving the gate, took control early and moved
inside, fought with HOLDEN THE LUTE into and around the second bend, cleared in upper stretch but was run down late. DIVINE ARMOR stalked two then
three wide on the first turn, traveled between runners in the middle stages, tipped out at the top of the stretch, drifted inward near the sixteenth pole and was
along for the show. HOLDEN THE LUTE broke in and bumped rival at the start, pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the half-mile pole, kept the
pressure on in the two path on the far turn, and flattened in the lane. MOTOWN MUSIC tracked a bit off the rail on the first turn, saved ground into the lane,
moved out in the stretch, got put in tight at the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. MEMO DADDY (CHI) went three to four wide around the first
turn, was rated outside the top pair up the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ICE COLD GOLD was closest in pursuit in the early stages, closed in on the far turn and range up two wide with a quarter mile left to run, gained command
leaving the turn, kicked clear and lasted in the final strides. UNFAITHFUL WAYS reserved in the early stages in the two path, went three wide into the far
turn, angled outside a rival to the five path around the bend, moved back in a few paths leaving the bend, steered out widest in the stretch, surged late but
ran out of time. BASKET CASE chased along the inside to the stretch, tipped out in upper stretch and got edged for the place. BEACHGRASS broke slow
and bumped with inner rival at the start, raced between foes off the pace, came two wide into the stretch, steered out in upper stretch and finished evenly in
the final sixteenth. BLOSSOMING sat off the pace on the inside, shifted three wide on the far turn, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. PRETTY
RENA showed keen early foot while drifting out a bit on the first turn, traveled clear into the second bend, held a diminishing lead approaching the quarter
pole, relinquished the lead soon after and gave way in the lane. SWEET HEIDELBERG bumped leaving the gate, tracked the pace outside a rival, moved
out wider on the backstretch, dropped between foes on the turn and had little left for the drive.
