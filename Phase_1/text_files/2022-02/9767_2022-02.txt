Footnotes
CLASSIC FILM was allowed to settle early three wide, shifted out a bit further getting in gear after six furlongs, rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from
outside in deep stretch and drew clear. MY MAN VITO established the pace moving in from three-path around the first turn, stayed clear to midstretch, then
could not deny the winner while able to save second between horses. DRINKSONTHEBEACH prompted MY MAN VITO from outside, moved inward for the
drive, and stayed on well. MEKANO raced three wide, loomed outside the leaders approaching the stretch, but weakened through the final stages.
MUROMEC was outrun for six furlongs, switched out coming off the far turn, and improved position without threatening. HEART OF ROMAN stayed in
range early, but could not muster the needed late response two wide. GUS K moved up through the backstretch run, then faded steadily. TAKEMYSHOT
never menaced. SUMMER SHANDEE was four wide into the first turn, and was finished early. TRINNI SURPRISE showed little inside.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL TRUFFLES stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off with authority. FIVEFINGERDISCOUNT chased the
pace two wide between foes, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to gain the place. NOBEL vied two wide down the backstretch, drew
clear midway around the turn, could not resist the winner and held well enough to preserve the show. MINDSHIP Q chased the pace four wide and lacked a
closing bid. LOVE ME ARCHIE steadied soon after the start, dropped well back two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened.
DINNER BELL had brief speed inside. LUCKY LUCAS was fractious in the gate, had early speed inside, stopped around the turn and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
CAFE SOCIETY was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried near the inside through early stages, edged up a bit closer late on the turn,
tipped three wide turning for home, responded willingly under a mild drive and finished going away. MILLEFEUILLE was forwardly placed and stalked the
pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up to engage FLYING ATHLETICA mid-way through the turn, battled for the lead into the final furlong then failed to be
a match when the winner swept by. TONED UP rated outside near midpack in early stages, was ridden along entering the turn, sustained a four wide bid
into the stretch run and got up late to take show. FLYING ALETHA took over the lead shortly after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, took on the
challenge from MILLEFEUILLE mid-way through the turn, fought back and continued to hold a narrow margin a furlong out then weakened and got edged
for show. PENS STREET took a solid bump between rivals at the start, stalked outside up the backstretch, was ridden along entering the turn, drifted out
wider turning for home and gave way. TWILIGHT raced off the pace and steadily retreated. FUNNYBET bumped with rival at the start, dropped to last after
the opening quarter and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VELOCE BELLA sped clear after the start, showed the way in the two-path to the stretch, received some mild hand urging after straightening away, then
cruised to the finish in hand. CUPID AUSTIN was ridden along on the turn three to four wide, never got near the winner but cleared the remainder late.
LETS RUN TWO broke slowly, raced three to four wide on the turn, moved in through the drive and was up for the show on the fence. LEMONADE LADY
chased after VELOCE BELLA to the stretch, and weakened. SPICY HONEY (IRE) shifted out five wide at the top of the stretch, and made no headway.
HAPPY'S NICE CANDY broke a step slow and was outrun early inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and had no rally. SONGTELLER
steadied from between horses early on the turn, and remained outrun. MISS INEZ showed early speed inside, and was through before completing three
furlongs.

Footnotes
YES I AM FREE stalked the pace two wide, seized command turning for home and drew off under a drive. RICHY hit the starting gate, raced off the pace
two wide, swung widest in upper stretch, closed outside and was just up for the place. BELGRANO saved ground off the pace, advanced inside in upper
stretch, tipped out leaving the sixteenth pole and was narrowly outfinished for the place. WARRIOR'S PRIDE set a clear pace along the rail, was collared by
the winner turning for home, resisted to the sixteenth pole and weakened. GEAR JOCKEY chased the pace three and four wide around the turn and lacked
a closing bid. OMAHA CITY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BREAKTHROUGH broke a bit awkwardly,
stalked the pace three wide, angled into the two path nearing the lane and came up empty. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHESS NOT CHECKERS tracked in range through the early going, moved up two wide to challenge ADIOS BABE for the lead late on the turn, vied to the
furlong marker then shook free and held late. SOUTH PACIFIC chased near midpack then hustled up around the turn, came four wide into the upper
stretch, sustained a steady bid for the winner, edged closer in final stages and held place. GRANDMA'S PUDDING raced two to three wide off the early
pace, given cue five wide in the upper stretch, gathered momentum under right-handed pressure and finished strongly. ADIOS BABE was forwardly placed
tracking the pacesetter, took over the lead leaving the three-eighths pole then took on the eventual winner late on the turn, fought back past the furlong
marker then weakened late. I SAID HEY chased the top pair through early stages, remained in contention two to three wide through the turn then flattened
out in the final furlong. MORE GLORY lacked speed and raced in the back, came wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. QUEEN CUPID raced off the
early pace, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. RIDE LITTLE GIRL angled inside soon after the start, was ridden along two wide into the
upper stretch and failed to move into contention. MAKIN IT LOOK EASY hustled up out of the gate and took over the early lead, got collared leaving the
three-eighths pole and quickly retreated.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE settled in midpack early near the inside, shifted three wide for clearance while coming under a ride a quarter-mile out, rallied steadily
outside JOE PHILLIPS and wore that rival down to win going away. JOE PHILLIPS quickly took control up front, rated along in the two-path to the stretch,
remained clear into the final furlong but was no match for the winner late. SPIN RATE tracked JOE PHILLIPS for six furlongs, could not make headway
through the lane and was clearly best of the others. GONNA BE EPIC lagged well back for six furlongs, and improved mildly for the last major share.
SKYWALKING was far back early, swung four wide into the stretch and passed only tired horses. BIG BLUE was never prominent. SMALL REASON was
strung out five wide early, remained well out in the track four wide on the far turn, and tired. WESTERLY WIND stayed in range three wide early, and tired
after six furlongs. BACH was outrun inside. WILLIAM BOY was outrun three to four wide throughout. SWEENEY'S CAT raced forwardly inside for six
furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. NIKEE KAN angled in early,
tracked the pace from the rail around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but finished willingly to hold the place. REINAGOL
was bumped early, saved ground off the pace, rallied along the rail in the lane and just held third. MISS J MCKAY was pinched back and checked sharply
not long after the start, raced well back two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside to just miss third. POSEIDON'S PASSION
lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and had a mild stretch gain. GUARDIAN MOON steadied when forced in early, chased the pace three
wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally. SISTER PEACOCK lost footing at the start, rushed up outside, pressed the winner for three furlongs and
tired in the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHARGE IT cleared on top out of the chute and angled in to race three paths off the inside, set the pace and widened advantage while still unleashed
around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, responded willingly under under some mild urging and finished much the best. ENOUGH ALREADY
raced near midpack then hustled up three wide mid-way around the turn, stayed on with response through the lane and finished second best. TOUCH
CODE was forwardly placed stalking the early leader, launched a bid around the turn, sustained a two wide bid into the lane and secured a share. LOGICO
raced widest off the early pace, hustled along four wide through the turn and improved position without threatening the top trio. HARD PERFORMER angled
inside soon after the start, was not too far back early on then flattened entering the turn, cut the corner into the upper stretch and needed more for late
impact. ALWAYS ABOVE raced off the early pace, came five wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. BENNY THE BOOK tugged along the rail in
early stages, tipped two wide and edged up closer going by the half mile marker then came up empty around the turn. GRANLUSSO stalked the pacesetter,
was ridden along two to three wide through the turn then came up empty turning for home. BERNIE LOMAX was not too far back between foes in early
stages then faded entering the turn. SIMMS raced four to five wide and never menaced.

Footnotes
HIGHEST HONORS advanced to contention after six furlongs, was roused three wide to go after the leaders approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly
and was up outside at the wire. SIGILOSO moved in from the three-path with the lead midway on the first turn, set an even pace near the inside to the
stretch, and dug in gamely to drop a tight decision. HOMBRE prompted SIGILOSO from outside, challenged and reached near-even terms after six furlongs,
battled through a long drive and was outfinished between the top two. BOURBON WAR raced three wide in the second flight to the stretch, and gained
mildly late on the far outside. EN WYE CEE saved ground to no avail. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS contested the pace inside before yielding to SIGILOSO on
the first turn, went along covered up inside through the middle stages, lodged a bid along the rail through upper stretch but did not have enough. CHESS'S
DREAM was reserved early inside, and lacked a response when called on. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TARTUFO settled off the early pace while racing widest, went five wide around the turn, closed determinedly down the center of the track and was up in the
final strides. MEISTER vied between foes through the opening quarter, dueled inside of TRAPPEZOID down much of the backstretch and around the far
turn, shook clear turning for home, held well clear to deep stretch and was nailed. SIR OLLIE had early speed between foes, settled back leaving the chute,
gave chase four wide between foes around the turn and churned on through the lane to gain the show. TRAPPEZOID turned his head just prior to the start
then hit the starting gate, rushed up between foes leaving the chute, dueled outside of MEISTER to upper stretch, could not keep pace from there but hung
in for a piece. AEQUOR stumbled at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. WILL E SUTTON hit the starting gate, recovered to show speed inside,
could not keep pace with duelers after the opening quarter, angled three wide entering the turn, chased in the three path around the bend and faded through
the lane. UNBRIDLED HONOR played no factor while racing two wide. WHO'S THE STAR trailed outside.

Footnotes
PARQUETRY settled two wide into the first turn and rated just off the early pace, edged up closer late on far turn, given cue three wide in the upper stretch,
roused forward in the final furlong, dueled with TRENDING in deep stretch and got up in final strides. TRENDING was forwardly placed two wide around the
first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, was ridden along leaving the three eighths pole, set down two to three wide for the drive, roused forward
