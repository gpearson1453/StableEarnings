Footnotes
SUPERTRIX vied inside of VICIOUS VELMA early on, backed off to shift outside of that foe at the five furlong pole, dueled with that foe around the far turn,
led at the furlong grounds, then wandered about while drawing clear leaving that marker. VICIOUS VELMA set the pace outside of SUPERTRIX, then inside
of that foe around the far turn while in the two path, but gave way at the furlong grounds, then saved place. VEILS AND VOWS laid off of the ace, saved
found around the far turn before shifting out in upper stretch, then bumped an outer TETHERED at the sixteenth pole while securing show. TETHERED
bobbled at the start, stalked outside of the leading pair, then from the four path around the far turn, chased while not progressing in upper stretch, then took
a bump from an inner rival at the sixteenth pole while tiring. HELLO HERO was outrun. HEART OF INDEE tracked along the inside, but was done early.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE QUARTER MILE, HALF MILE, AND THREE-QUARTER MILE FRACTIONS WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DYNAMITE GIFT bobbled a bit at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, cleared his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, and lasted from an outer
rallying rival late. PARKER EVA stalked the leading pair from the three path, chased without progressing in upper stretch, then produced a late kick in the
final furlong in an attempt to wear the clear leader down on the wire, but came up just short. TWIRLING PATTI tracked along the inside, chased in the two
path through the lane, and caught a tiring rival for show at the sixteenth pole. QUICK MUNNY dueled along the inside of the eventual winner, but steadied
while giving way to that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and weakened thereafter. MA CHERIE was outrun.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA prompted the pace two wide, forged a narrow advantage at the three furlong pole, then drew off approaching the final three sixteenths, and was
kept to task to the wire. WOMAN WITH A BOOK tracked along the inside, shifted from the two to three path entering the lane, bid for place outside of the
early pace setter at the furlong grounds, wandered a bit, but edged late position late. JURISDICTION set the pace inside of the prompting eventual winner,
got headed by that foe leaving the three furlong pole, fought on turning for home, but proved no match in upper stretch, resisted WOMAN WITH A BOOK's
place bid through midstretch, but was bested by that rival late. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS laid off of the pace two wide, moved to track between horses down
the backstretch, but lacked a rally through the lane. OFF SIXES stalked outside of the leading pair, chased those rivals while outside of another pair of foes
around the far turn, and tired through the lane. SKYCRAFT was slow into stride, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HAVE NO FEAR stalked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of GET NONE at the furlong pole, dueled with that foe through the closing stages, and
prevailed. GET NONE trailed early on, circled inner foes in the five path around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane before completing a bid
in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong grounds where he met HAVE NO FEAR's rail challenge, dueled with that foe thereafter, but was bested.
BLUEBIRD SING laid off of the pace, trailed around the turn, then chased along the rail through the lane before surpassing outer foes in midstretch to claim
show at the sixteenth pole. A LOT OF SPUNK pressed outside of the leading pair around the turn while intentionally staying a path away from them, shifted
to the five path entering the lane as an outer GET NONE ranged up along side, then got outkicked by that foe and a rail bidding rival in upper stretch, before
keeping on to reach a tiring rival for a minor share. HARRIET'S DREAM set the pace inside of prompting foes around the turn, shifted off of the rail entering
the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, then by an inner foe approaching the furlong grounds, and caved under no urging from the rider
through the final furlong. BLUES MARY tracked two to three wide, but failed to make an impact. DOUBLE DARE YOU prompted the pace two wide and
between horses, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COACH KENNY tracked along the inside, shifted three wide approaching the three furlong pole, took the bend in the four path, then rallied to take aim on
the clear leader in midstretch, bid passing the furlong grounds, led a sixteenth out, and drove clear. WIDDLE ZEE showed the way in the two path, but was
surpassed by an outer rival a sixteenth out, and held place. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU laid off of the pace in the five path around the turn, then stayed on
to claim show in midstretch. CALLINGINTHENIGHT chased two wide and between horses while taking the turn in the three path, but lacked a bid. DUSTY
BOY failed to factor. HIGH RIDGE laid close up along the inside, stalked into the turn, then faded through the final furlong. ADRENALINE broke slowly and
got outrun. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY SHOWN.

Footnotes
COVE BLUE set a clear pace while rating well in hand, inched away at the five sixteenths pole when let out a notch, then widened his advantage through
upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. YOUVESAIDITALL laid off of the pace in the two path, rallied in the five path around the far turn,
gained place in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, met NEW EAGLE's rail challenge for that position passing the furlong grounds, dueled with that
foe thereafter, and prevailed. NEW EAGLE saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail to bid for place inside of YOUVESAIDITALL at the furlong
grounds, dueled with that foe thereafter, but was kept at bay. THE LAST ZIP tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, drifted back to the four
path passing the quarter pole while hanging on his left lead, changed over between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick and tired late.
GRAND ATLANTIC stalked the clear leader from the two path, but failed to keep pace turning for home, chased in the three path and between horses
through upper stretch, but faltered at the furlong grounds. WAR CHEST tracked from midpack in the five to four paths around the turns, but failed to
threaten. JUST GUN IT settled far back in the three to two path around the first turn, and never got involved. HONEY WON'T tracked along the inside, bid
for place inside of rivals while in the two path entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened.
VOLUBILE tracked from midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, but faded through the lane. CANDIZAR was keen and taken
in hand between horses early on, settled at the rear in the three path around the first turn, but was outrun. HAY DAKOTA raced at the rear along the inside,
and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARRIVAL DAY set the pace along the inside, shook clear of a pressing rival approaching the lane, then drew off at the quarter pole, and was kept to task to
the wire. ELI'S GIRL tracked two wide and between horses around the turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes to bid for place at the
sixteenth pole, and forged that position late. HAVE I EVER tracked three wide while in the four path around the turn, gained place passing the quarter pole
after the leader kicked clear, dug in for that position from rivals on either side at the sixteenth pole, but was bested by her outer challenger for late.
JULESFORYOU saved ground off of the pace, picked up stride behind foes turning for home, tipped two wide at the three sixteenths pole to sustain a rally
between horses, bid for place inside of HAVE I EVER entering the final sixteenth, but flattened out late. TRAFALGAR SHORE broke slowly, trailed into the
turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, then passed tired foes while hanging on his left lead. VERDANDI stalked along the inside, but weakened in
midstretch. HIGHER NOTE pressed the leader from the outside while in the three path, chased that foe turning for home, then weakened between horses
passing the quarter pole. ZENCHUA SKY was done early.

Footnotes
BLISSFUL CHANGE broke inwardly at the start, prompted the pace three two wide into the turn, vied turning for home before gaining an advantage at the
three sixteenths pole as an outer SALVAJE pursued, but inched clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway to the wire. SALVAJE leaned outwardly and
bumped the gate while breaking a bit slowly, recovered soon after and rushed to a three wide stalking position, attempted to range up to a leading
BLISSFUL CHANGE at the three sixteenths pole, but was turned away at the furlong grounds, and chased that rival home. ROOKERY took a bump from an
inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace four wide, gained in that path around the turn before tipping to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for
show outside of SIKUM a sixteenth from home, and prevailed in the closing-stages battle for that position. SIKUM tracked along the inside, lost position at
the three furlong pole to lay off of the pace turning for home, but sustained a rail grind in upper stretch, tipped to the three path at the furlong grounds, bid
for show at the sixteenth pole along with an outer ROOKERY, but was outfinished by that rival late. CHIKARA rated far back in the two path around the turn,
improved inside of foes in midstretch, then belatedly moved between rivals in the late stages. MISCHEVIOUS MEL trailed, gained mildly in the five path
around the turn, floated to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up late. SPARKLE OF HOPE laid off of the pace two to three wide, swung six wide
entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. MINER'S QUEEN set the pace inside of the vying eventual winner, but was headed at the three sixteenths
pole, and faltered through the final furlong. ANNA VOLANTE was inconsequentially forced inwardly at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, shifted tot
eh four wide in upper stretch, but tired while hanging on her left lead. COBRA CASABLANCA stalked in two path while under a snug hold just behind the
leaders around the turn, chased in the three path through upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. GIRL'S ON FIRE bumped an
outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace three wide and between horses, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
WAITIN' ON A WOMAN laid close up along the inside early, shifted to the four path after outer foes cleared off into the turn, chased under urging around the
bend, but sustained stride in the final furlong, and reached the driftng leader on the wire. ENCHANTED MOON dueled for the lead between horses early on,
then inside of CAJUN CANNON while a path off of the rail around the turn, shook clear at the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but bore out in the
final sixteenth as an outer foe closed in, and got nailed on the wire. MR. K W rated at the rear along the inside, shifted three wide at the three sixteenths
pole to split foes, rallied through midstretch, and surged belatedly between horses to claim show on the wire. CAJUN CANNON dueled for the lead three to
two wide while in the three path around the turn, yielded to his inner counterpart entering the lane, sustained a chase thereafter, but was nailed on the wire
for show. ALL MIKE NO MAE bumped an outer rival at the start before taking a bump from that foe soon after, stalked along the inside, tipped three wide
entering the lane, chased through midstretch, but flattened late. ARGYBARGY BUCK took a bump from an inner foe before being bumped by an outer rival
between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, but made little impact. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST was
fractious loading then never got involved. HALF CAPPUCCINO failed to factor. FIGHTING SOLDIER hesitated at the start and was outrun. RUN TO BLADE
broke inwardly and bumped a foe soon after the start, tracked two wide, but weakened through the lane.
