ORATORY GLORY was never far off the pace, advanced on the far turn, bid off the rail, closed steadily and drew clear late. LA ROSA DRIVE set the pace,
drew off on the turn for a clear lead and was outclosed to finish second best. SUBTLE RIDE trailed the field, finished well and was along for show. WINDI'S
MOMENT pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out. FILTHY broke in the air, showed speed to the turn, tired, stopped and was vanned off.
GOLDEN GODDESS stalked the pace while racing inside, dropped back into the turn and stopped.

BIG NEWS COMING was unhurried early while racing outside, went nine wide entering the stretch, had the rider lose her whip in the upper stretch, closed
steadily and wore down CHANTAL to get up in the final strides. CHANTAL set the pace, bore out through the stretch and was caught near the wire.
PANCAKES AND BEER lagged early, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and closed to earn show. PARTYATTHECAPITAL stalked the pace, bid off
the rail, didn't have enough late and hung. LADY JADE held a good position while racing inside, leveled off in the drive and fell back. GRAN MANNA
pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. SUGAR ON TOP was through early and dropped back steadily.

Footnotes
PUMPKIN BREAD was never far off the pace, rallied outside on the turn to assume command, drew off for a clear lead, had an uneven course and held
safely while kept to task. OPAL CREEK rallied inside on the turn, altered course in the upper stretch, couldn't gain ground and just held for place. BOOZE
RUNNER advanced to the turn, awaited room, swung wide, angled in near the eighth pole and finished with good energy. MISS RENO pressed the pace to
the turn, fell back, was impeded and checked hard on the turn, dropped back and had no further response. BALI BRAVA sprinted clear, was rated along the
backstretch, was through after a half and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry and a trainer's objection concerning possible interference on the far turn.
No change was made.

SURPRSINGLYPERFECT pressed the pace while racing outside, closed under steady urging, inched clear and held safely. EL CHUMELITO pressed the
pace, bid willingly to contend, led briefly past the eighth pole and was outclosed in a good effort. TIGER BY HIS TAIL bumped at the start, vied to mid
stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT broke out and bumped at the start, raced mid pack, went widest in the drive and lacked the
needed rally. KING PARKER bumped start, set a pressured pace and faltered. GO FOR A RIDE was not a factor. DOODLE TIME raced in close early and
was through after a half. FREEZING JIMMY bumped at the start and was outrun.

Footnotes
COMPLICATE pressed the pace, assumed command entering the turn, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. LAUNCH PAD was
void of early speed, advanced around the turn, dueled between horses and was outfinished in a game effort. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER advanced on the
turn, bid off the rail, dueled late and was outfinished in a game effort. MISAWA raced close to the pace outside, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and
lacked the needed late response. HOLLYWOOD HEAT raced in the back, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and improved position. BURNZ DA BOSS
stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, swung eight wide and leveled off. MARICOPA COUNTY was not a factor. CIBERTRUCK was through
after a half. ADD ON set a pressured pace, tired and stopped.

BELLA'S BACK set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and just lasted at the wire. A DIME FOR ME raced in the back, rallied on the turn,
closed inside and was gaining fast late to just miss. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS rallied on the turn, went seven wide entering the stretch, offered a mild bid only
and settled for show. BONITA RAPIDS broke slowly, was void of early speed and closed inside to improve position. OLD TOY lagged early, went widest in
the drive and lacked a rally. COSMIC TRIPSTER was outrun in an even effort. BEAUTY BLACK pressed the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, weakened
and faded. SUNSHINE EMILY raced inside and had brief speed only.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN MEMORY got away well, led around the first turn, awaited room on the second turn, angled out, bid willingly to duel through the stretch and
prevailed in a long drive. CHROME KING was steadied along the inside entering the backstretch, saved ground, rallied on the turn, got through along the
inside, dueled through the stretch and just missed at the wire. JUAN BRAVO was crowded at the start, advanced on the turn, shifted out for the drive and
was gaining fast late. HOYA PARANOYA broke awkwardly, moved up between horses to set the pace, responded to duel to md stretch and faltered.
CREME DE LA CHROME was steadied entering the second turn, checked entering the stretch and dropped back. NEXT JOURNEY was carried out on the
first turn and failed to menace in a steady effort. BANGO FOR BUCKS was carried out on the first turn, was impeded and checked on the second turn and
dropped back. CREATIVE FEATURE broke awkwardly, bore out on the first turn and had brief speed only. Following two riders' objections, MONGOLIAN
MEMORY was disqualified and placed seventh for causing interference on the second turn. PER RULING 228A-008-DOR FROM THE ARIZONA
DEPARTMENT OF GAMING, THE DISQUALIFICATION OF MONGOLIAN MEMORY WAS REVERSED.
