Footnotes
EUPHORIA STAR was forced six wide entering the first turn, angled into the three path soon after, tracked the pace three wide, moved to even terms in
upper stretch, dueled outside of BOGGIEMIESTER through the lane and prevailed. BOGGIEMIESTER was bumped by STARSHIP WIZARD at the start
then MOON AT MIDNIGHT just after, advanced between foes nearing the first turn, swerved out when STARSHIP WIZARD came out a path entering the
first turn, forcing the winner very wide, became rank and rushed up in the five path, cleared the field and angled into the two path late on the first turn, set
the pace inside from there, dug in inside of the winner in upper stretch and dueled inside to the wire in a game try. STARSHIP WIZARD broke inward and
bumped at the start, had early speed outside of foes, came out a bit entering the first turn, led in the three path, settled back into a stalking position when
BOGGIEMEISTER took over later on the turn, prompted the pace outside of that foe down the backstretch, bid between the top two finishers nearing the
quarter pole, was no match for those two in the lane but stayed on to save the show. HENRYTHETHIRD had early speed between foes, steadied entering
the first turn, chased two and three wide and lacked a rally. SUMMER ASH was off a step slow, lagged inside, went three wide around the far turn and
improved position. FISHING FOR FUN chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. WIZARD SERRAT hopped at the start and made little impact
while racing two and three wide. MOON AT MIDNIGHT was bumped just after the start and was outrun inside. BOUND LUCKY played no factor while racing
two wide.

ASK FOR BODE vied outside OCEAN RIDE through the first half-mile, edged clear briefly through midstretch, then was all out to preserve the decision.
OCEAN RIDE alternated for the lead inside ASK FOR BODE to the stretch, had that one get away from him with a furlong remaining, then came back on
again to narrowly miss. NO COMMISSION eyed the battling leaders in the clear on the turn, was in the five-path at the top of the stretch, and finished
one-paced. NAVAJO CREED was no factor inside. QUICK ENOUGH stumbled at the break, and was always far back.

Footnotes
PLAYA INCLUSION held a slim lead out of the chute and led the way under some pressure from LININHERBESTLIFE, edged away from rival and widened
to a clear advantage around the turn, prompted two to three wide into the upper stretch, held plenty left in reserve, drew off under a mild drive and finished
ridden out in the final sixteenth. RAW HONEY tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid into
the stretch run, came under left-handed pressure at the furlong marker, shifted out wide and secured place. ONLY GIRL steadied not long after the start and
settled through early stages, picked up the pace entering the turn, ran on five wide into the lane, moved out wider in late stages and cleared the rest. THE
CUBAN MISSILE stalked near the inside up the backstretch, hustled up two wide then along the inside around the turn then gave way. MOSA MIA raced off
the early pace, came wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LIVINHERBESTLIFE bumped with rival at the start then raced just off the leader out
of the chute, continued forwardly placed up the backstretch then faded around the turn. NADINE'S GIRL raced in the back throughout.

AMERICAN HEROINE prompted the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch and just lasted. MITIGATION stalked the pace
from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed outside of the winner and just missed. LISA MARIE was off slow, trailed two wide for a half,
advanced four wide around the far turn reached contention in midstretch then evened out late. LADY PUCHI saved ground off the pace, circled five wide
around the far turn, reached contention nearing the eighth pole then flattened out. COLD CALL saved ground and failed to menace. LIMANI chased the
pace three wide and faded in the lane. CRACKIN MISCHIEF set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. PANAMA HATTIE raced three wide, stopped
nearing the lane and was eased.

Footnotes
OUTSHINE prompted J P HELLISH from outside early, took over entering the far turn and edged clear after six furlongs, faced challengers from both flanks
through a long drive and dug in for the decision. POPPY'S BOYS saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide into the lane, bid outside while staying
on his left lead, and was able to get up for the place. MR MATUSCHEK saved ground unhurried early, went around a tiring rival midway on the far turn,
moved back in cutting the corner with a bid on the rail, had the rider drop the crop with a furlong remaining and was outfinished inside the top pair. EMOJI
GUY shifted out five wide approaching the top of the stretch, and could not menace with an even finish. BIRD'S EYE VIEW stayed in range early, raced four
to five wide around the far turn, and lacked the needed response. PARLOR tugged his way along under a firm hold early, went three then four wide on the
far turn, and was empty when asked. COLONIST was never prominent. J P HELLISH set the early pace inside for a half-mile, and retired.

Footnotes
ACADEMIC HONOR was allowed to settle in opening stages and continued nicely rated four wide up the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the turn,
angled to the rail near the quarter pole then cut the corner and advanced to challenge for the lead, dueled inside duo to the furlong marker then shook free
under left-handed pressure and finished clear. LAKOTA SPIRIT stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for MISSY GREER at
the quarter pole then took on the added challenge from the rail running ACADEMIC HONOR at the head of the lane, vied to the furlong marker then failed to
kick on with winner and settled for second best. MISSY GREER sped to the lead soon after the start and continued to set the pace, took on the challenge
from LAKOTA SPIRIT at the quarter pole with the added challenge of ACADEMIC HONOR at the head of the lane, fought back to the furlong marker then
weakened to show and remained well clear over the rest. AWESOME STREET raced off the pace three to four wide, was ridden along two wide into the
upper stretch and had no response. HIGH RESOLUTION was reserved five wide through early stages, came three wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. STORY HOUR raced off the top trio through the early going, flattened out around the turn and continued to tire in the lane. LATE NIGHT LADY
was not too far back along the inside in early stages then steadily retreated.

SO SUAVE (IRE) settled in range while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, responded when roused in upper stretch, moved to the
front near the sixteenth pole, vied outside of STAR SIGN from there and held safe. STAR SIGN prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter
pole, drew clear in upper stretch, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth marker and fought on inside to the wire. THENORTHREMEMBERS hopped
at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. ARCHER ROAD saved ground off the pace, angled
three wide near the quarter pole, made progress in upper stretch and evened out late. POUND GREEN stalked the pace from the rail and came up empty in
the lane. LEASE set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
DEL REY DOLLY tracked outside the early leaders three wide, ranged up to challenge LARA'S LADY from outside through upper stretch, reached the front
a sixteenth out and was going away at the finish. LARA'S LADY set the pace inside, kicked away from STORMIN' COUGAR after a half-mile, settled into the
stretch with a clear lead in the two-path, then could not withstand the winner leaving the furlong grounds. PEARLINTHEROUGH saved ground to the
stretch, moved off the rail and lacked the needed final bid. DOMINANT JOY was no factor two wide. STORMIN' COUGAR pressed LARA'S LADY from
outside for a half, and weakened. DOLCISIMA moved inside approaching the turn, remained on the rail and had no response. STACIAS RUBY was through
early two to three wide.

MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) settled in the back of the back and saved ground, continued patiently handled along the rail into the final turn, edged closer then
tipped out four wide approaching upper stretch, responded willingly under a drive, powered past inside duo and finished going away. MEGAYACHT tracked
the pace and saved ground, continued patiently handled then came under a ride three wide late on the final turn, vied outside of JARREAU in the upper
stretch then failed to be a match when the winner kicked by. JARREAU stalked the pace through middle stages, launched a bid midway through the final
turn, took the lead from A THREAD OF BLUE then quickly came under attack from MEGAYACHT, vied in the upper stretch then got overtaken by the
winner and stayed on to best the rest. SMALL HOPE raced outside off the pace, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and improved position
without threatening. A THREAD OF BLUE set the early pace, got collared by JARREAU late on the final turn and tired in the drive. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB)

Footnotes
SMART SPENDING was unhurried while saving ground, moved up between rivals while still in hand around the far turn, angled four wide to split foes
turning for home, kicked in when roused and swept past near the sixteenth pole. RIVETING SPIRIT raced well back two wide, advanced three wide around
the far turn, angled five wide nearing the lane, was unable to match strides outside of the winner but stayed on willingly to gain the place. ODRAMARK
stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide to bid between foes midway around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on
the left lead in the lane, drew clear in upper stretch but offered little resistance from the sixteenth pole. FLYING BLACK chased the pace three wide, bid four
wide nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. BAYOU BELLE failed to menace while racing four wide. OMNIA prompted the pace two wide, had
a slim lead between foes around much of the far turn and tired in the lane. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane.
ASKEW was outrun inside.

Footnotes
LAY THE GROUNDWORK settled in the second flight early, advanced four wide approaching the stretch, swept past HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES with a
furlong remaining, then kept WALKATHON at a safe distance late. WALKATHON moved in from the four-path on the first turn, stayed in easy striking range
up the backstretch, waited for an opening approaching the stretch, switched out for clearance after straightening away for the drive, finished with good
energy but could not reach the winner. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES led early inside before letting BRISKY FROLIC go on with it, tracked outside that rival
through the middle stages, rebid after six furlongs and reached a short lead turning for home, could not match strides with LAY THE GROUNDWORK past
midstretch and weakened inside. BRISKY FROLIC bumped with BITTY BOSS while keyed up entering the first turn, tugged his way through between
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES and LOVING PROMISE to take over into the backstretch, then yielded to challengers after six furlongs. AMBLE was reluctant to
load, raced in the second flight early, shifted four wide coming off the far turn, and made no impact. LOVING PROMISE was forwardly placed three wide
early, and faded after six furlongs. BITTY BOSS bumped with BRISKY FROLIC and steadied entering the first turn, dropped far back into the stretch and
was eased up late.
