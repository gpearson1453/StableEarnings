Footnotes
BOURN vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, pulled away and was ridden out. VALERIE LOUISE challenged for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. BOSTON BELLE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and
missed second. D'ORO MOON raced within contention, made a mild bid and was outfinished for show. MY LITTLE GUERA lacked early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. SAY WHAT raced within striking distance, came around the turn three wide and faded. I SEE BLING raced evenly near the back,
saved ground around the turn and was never a threat. IMMACULATE GLORY broke out, raced near the back and was never close.

Footnotes
MISS MESS shot to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and just held on for the win. FIRSTSLATE raced within contention, forwardly placed
throughout, made a late bid and needed more ground. FOURSWEETNIECES raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid
and finished willingly. SARAHS HOME raced within contention, raced outside around the turn, made a late try, was outfinished, while putting forth a game
effort. COUNTRY DREAM always raced near the back and was never a threat. AIKEN TO BE lacked early speed, put forth a dull effort and was never
close.

Footnotes
MY FORTUNATE SON lacked early speed, moved up around the turn, made a wide bid and proved the best late. SING LOUD vied for the early advantage,
came around the turn three wide, took the lead down the lane and was caught late. VOYANT dueled on the front end, raced close throughout and lacked a
late kick. MONZZA raced in the middle of the pack, came around the turn five wide, entered the stretch seven wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ON
TILT pressed the pace, came around the turn four wide and faded. LOUISIANA THUNDER challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and
dropped back. TRAELEE void of early speed and showed little. SOUTH AL SPARKY lacked early speed and was outrun.
