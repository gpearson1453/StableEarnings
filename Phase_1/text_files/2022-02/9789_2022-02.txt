HIT THIS TOWN sent clear set the pace widening into the turn being given a breather there responding to an inside challenge in upper stretch by kicking
clear as much the best. SILVER DOLLAR CITY saved ground cutting the corner to bid boldly along the rail in upper stretch being turned back inside the
eighth pole hanging on at the wire to save place. UNCLE KEVIN raced evenly through the turn coming five wide in upper stretch giving a mild rally from mid
track there. TRAMORE BAY a step slow through the turn lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the six path. AWESOME OX chased the pace
through the turn weakening along the inside in upper stretch. SHINING THROUGH was always outrun. COTTON JIM gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC REACH pressed on the inside backing off on the turn angling out to upper stretch bidding four deep drawing clear late. WESTERN HOPE
pressed the pace saving ground to grab the lead along the rail in upper stretch ceding late to outside pressure while saving place. CHISELED JUSTICE
pressed a narrow lead through the turn coming between horses into upper stretch wearing down the final sixteenth. SPLIT MY BRITCHES slow early raced
evenly to upper stretch mustering enough there to best the others. ZIP IT QUICK pressed the pace dueling through the turn tiring in the two path the final
eighth. JOHNNY C tracked evenly through the turn then faded in upper stretch. THE GOSPEL OF MARK was never involved. DANCE MOVES folded up on
the turn. I'MMA NATURAL dwelt at the break having no chance, walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY DETERMINED THAT I'MMA NATURAL WAS
AFFORDED A FAIR START.

set the pace being hooked on the turn dueling from the rail down the lane ceding grudgingly at the end. PASSIONATE HEART stalked the ;pace looming
outside the leaders into upper stretch hanging in the final yards. PASATIME chased on the turn fading at mid track in upper stretch. Z U IN MY DREAMS
faded on the turn. NATIVE VALLEY was always outrun. ZOEYS TOUCH well back to upper stretch was eased to wire.
