Footnotes
ALLURE FORTUNE was well placed early on the inside, then made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over when straightened and drew out to
prove much the best under mild urging. JUSTKISSMYGRITS set the pace on the inside while clear, was headed leaving the turn and proved to be no match
for the winner, clearly second best. PROMISE OF JOY tracked the pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and was up for the show award late.
KIRBY was rated in between horses and made a mild bid four wide by the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. LAVELLO hesitated at the start, then
was on the inside on the turn and had no late rally.

MIAMI MUMBLES was settled three to four wide on the first turn, then chased the pace three wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid onj the turn,
then hit the front nearing the furlong marker and dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to edge clear under a drive. ST. PADDY'S DADDY was allowed to
settle three wide, followed the winner on the turn and tipped outside of that rival nearing the quarter pole to make a four wide bid, loomed boldly but hung in
the deep stretch. LAWLESSNESS was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn, then angled out for racing room nearing the
furlong marker and rallied well. LOXODROME set a fast pace and was well clear on the backstretch, then was headed leaving the turn and faded in the
drive. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn and had a belated rally. VISHNU chased the pace on the inside and tired.
SUPER HOUDINI was not a factor.

Footnotes
KATZ ME AT NOON vied for the early lead four wide, then made a bid and drew clear on the turn while two wide, then drew out in the drive to prove best
under a drive. MY MAGICAL MAN was bumped at the start, vied for the early lead in between horses, then chased the winner three wide on the turn and
stayed on for the place award. NOTORIOUS REY vied for the early lead on the inside and weakened. DOUBLE KATZ was rated along and was two wide on
the turn, swung out four wide for the drive but had no kick. VENCIL was settled back on the inside and was not a threat. MISTER ARANGUIZ was not a
factor while three wide.

Footnotes
GRANDFIRE tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to press the pace, then wore down rival late to prove best under a drive.
COOS BAY set a pressured pace in the two path, then shook clear leaving the turn to be clear by the furlong marker, but it was not enough, caught late,
clearly second best. GATOR FIFTY TWO was well placed early, then was three wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. GOTANDA was allowed to
settle early, then was four wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed rally. MARKET passed the tiring rivals. GEM JUAN failed to menace.
UHAVETOBEKITTENME chased the pace on the inside and weakened. POSSE CAN DISCO pressed the pace on the inside and stopped.
