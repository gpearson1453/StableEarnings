Footnotes
NO PEDIGREE vied for the lead two wide, led entering the lane, inched clear approaching midstretch before shifting to the four path leaving the furlong
grounds, and held from an inner chasing foe to the wire. GRIEF chased outside of the leading pair while under steady urging around the turn, hung on his
left lead while vying for place through upper stretch, then kept on inside of the leader in the final furlong to attempt a late bid, but was kept at bay.
LILRASCALMAN tracked four wide, bid for place at the three sixteenths pole outside of GRIEF, but hung on his left lead, and tired in the final sixteenth.
THUNK laid off of the pace in the three path, altered course to the five path and outside of traffic at the three sixteenths pole, and moved up without
threatening. ADRENALINE vied along the inside, but gave way in upper stretch. MISTER DON stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the
lane, but lacked a bid, and faded. MEAN CANNON trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SOUL COAXING trailed in the three path around the first turn, rallied three wide and outside of foes into the far turn, swept past the leading pair on his own
will at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off under driving pressure through upper stretch before being wrapped up a sixteenth from home. WILLY MC set
the pace two wide into the first turn, cleared around that bend before feeling outside pressure entering the backstretch, showed the way in the far turn, but
offered little resistance to a bidding outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, then held place through the lane. CARTIER CAT tracked along the inside, then
surpassed a tiring for foe show at the furlong grounds, but failed to threaten. ZOFFA laid close up inside of the pace setter into the first turn, switched
outside of that rival around that bend, pressed down the backstretch, but was swiftly outmoved by an outer foe at the five sixteenths pole, and tired through
the lane. FED MONEY tracked the pace two to three wide around the first turn, but weakened at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
CRUSADER EXPRESS set a clear pace in the two path around the turn, came under mild urging in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. CHAIRMAN
MOO stalked the clear leader outside of a rival while in the three path around the turn, then stayed on to narrow that foe's margin through the final furlong.
PLEMMONSTON tracked in the two path around the turn, and passed a tiring foe in the final furlong to claim show. RUNNER trailed along the inside, shifted
to the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on. FAMILIAR WAYS stalked along the inside, but tired through the lane. FLYING BANKROLL took the turn in
the three to four path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. OKUDAH laid off of the pace in the four to five path, and was outrun.

EDDIE'S HUMOR took a mild brush from an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path while outside of a pair of foes into the turn, gained
turning for home to bid outside of DONT CROSS EL HEFE entering the lane, took a small tap from that rival at the quarter pole before returning the favor a
few strides later, then drew off approaching the final furlong. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS leaned outwardly at the start an brushed a rival, laid off of the pace in
the two path around the turn, then shifted to the rail in upper stretch as EDDIE'S HUMOR took charge, and chased that foe home after claiming place
leaving the furlong grounds. DONT CROSS EL HEFE vied for the lead outside of RISKTAKER while in the three path, led turning for home, brushed an
outer bidding EDDIE'S HUMOR at the quarter pole before being bumped and headed by that rival at the three sixteenths pole, and tired thereafter.
RISKTAKER brushed the gate at the start while breaking a step slowly, vied inside of a rival into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BASTI
BLUE chased the leading pair from the three path early on, but weakened between horses into the turn.

Footnotes
CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT hopped slightly at the start, trailed the field into the far turn, gained outside of foes in the five to six path around that bend before
fanning to the eight path in upper stretch, then rallied to drive past the leaders a sixteenth out. DA GOLD ROOM raced off of the pace in the six to five path
around the first turn, tucked to the three path entering the backstretch, tracked while shifting to the four path turning for home, grinded away to bid inside of
the tiring leader approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival at that junction, then kept on to gain place late. WHITE MIST set a clear
pace while multiple paths off of the inner railing, widened his margin into the far turn, but drifted to the five path turning for home, held sway through upper
stretch while tiring, but was surpassed by rivals on either side a sixteenth out. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY stalked in the four to two path around the first turn, then
chased outer foes through upper stretch before fading. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN raced off of the pace in the four to five paths and between horses, and
failed to factor. MY GUITAR brushed the inner part of the gate while breaking a step slowly, then saved ground off of the pace, but faded through the lane.
THUNDER AHEAD stalked in the five to four path around the the first turn, then weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
EKATI'S VERVE settled off of the pace in the four path, gained into and around the far turn to sweep to the front at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the
lane, and held firmly to the wire. FLEETRIDGE prompted the pace two wide, led into the far turn, but was headed by an outer move from EKATI'S VERVE at
the five sixteenths pole, fought on through the lane, but was bested, then held place. LAKE NAKURU rated at the rear along the inside, steadily gained in
the two path into and around the far turn, tracked entering the lane, shifted to the three path to engage an outer ONE TIME GEM for show at the three
sixteenths pole, claimed that position in midstretch, and chased the top pair home. ONE TIME GEM tracked from midpack two wide, gained on the leading
group inside of EKATI'S VERVE around the far turn, but was outmoved by that foe at the five sixteenths pole while claiming show, then battled outside of an
inner bidding LAKE NAKURU for that position through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. EMPTY HOLSTER raced at the rear two wide around the
first turn, gained to be off of the pace in the four path around the far turn, but failed to threaten thereafter. COLOR FAST laid unhurried along the inside,
chased in the five path around the far turn, and failed to factor. IMMORTAL stalked three wide around the first turn, but steadily faded thereafter.
BORGOBYTHESEA set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened. STAR APPEARANCE tracked along the inside,
but was done early. MR. QUALITY stayed very wide while far off of the pace, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BALTIC FLEET prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, vied while a path away from his inner rival around the turn, showed the way via a
very slight margin turning for home, but failed to kick on entering the lane, got re-headed by his inner counterpart in upper stretch, briefly failed to keep pace
in midstretch, but fought on to regain an advantage in the final sixteenth as his inner rival tired. SIMPLY VALID set the pace inside of a vying pair of foes into
the turn, got headed turning for home, regained an advantage passing the quarter pole, inched clear approaching midstretch, but tired in the final furlong,
was caught again a sixteenth from home, yielded, but just saved place. SPEEDY G stalked the leading trio from the two path and just off, tipped to the five
path and outside of them in upper stretch, but only managed to chase, and reached show on the wire via a dead heat. MUCHO VELOCE bumped with an
inner foe at the start, prompted the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn, vied turning for home, but hung and failed to keep pace with his
inner counterparts approaching midstretch while remaining on his left lead, and yielded through the final furlong before being nailed on the wire to dead heat
for show. DR. BENNY raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and narrowed the gap on the leading group
mildly. GRAN MUCHACO leaned outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, then failed to factor. TRUMP FLAG broke a step slowly at the start, and never
got involved.

Footnotes
WIN YA WIN tracked from the four path and outside of the leaders, came into the lane in the five path, rallied determinedly in pursuit through midstretch,
caught the tiring leader and bid at the sixteenth pole along with an inner YANKEE SEVEN, and edged ahead late. YANKEE SEVEN stalked along the
inside, tipped two wide at the three sixteenths pole while inside of X CLOWN, grinded away to bid for the lead between horses at the sixteenth pole, but was
outfinished by an outer rival. GRAVY HOUND set the pace inside of a prompting X CLOWN, shook clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, held sway
from chasing foes into the final furlong, but tired a sixteenth out, and faltered late. X CLOWN prompted the pace two wide, vied turning for home, but failed
to keep pace with his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, chased from between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by those foes
a sixteenth from home. SIR WELLINGTON stalked from the three path and between horses around the turn, then chased evenly through the lane. MAY
HOUR tracked along the inside, but took back passing the half mile pole and lost multiple lengths of position into the turn after YANKEE SEVEN tucked to
the rail despite that rival being clear, then failed to make an impact thereafter. CHIMNEY ROCK broke a step slow before being pinched back between
horses at the start, took the turn in the five path while at the rear of the fleld, and failed to factor. RELENTLESS DANCER never got involved.

lead a sixteenth out, and edged an advantage late. PALACE MAGIC stalked two wide, bid outside of the leader while in the four path around the turn, led at
the three sixteenths pole, dug in to resist DREAM TOWN's bid at the sixteenth pole, but was bested late. VEILS AND VOWS was allowed to settle off of the
