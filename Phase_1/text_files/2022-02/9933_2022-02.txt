Footnotes
WICKED HAPPY pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, took the lead along the rail early on the turn, moved clear when MADAME ROSE began to
weaken at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, shortened stride into the
final sixteenth but maintained a safe advantage under steady urging to prevail. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT was hard ridden behind the leading duo in third
position, went three then two wide on the turn, pursued the winner under vigorous urging in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. MADAME ROSE
set the pace under pressure to her inside, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back under pressure at the five-sixteenths then moved to the three
path and tired but was best of the rest. DON'T BE CHEEKY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the outside, went three
then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. ANCHOR LADY dropped back under urging, went four wide on the turn and had nothing left.
THATSJUSTLOVELY tossed her head while taken up at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground through the turn and
faltered then was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
MR. BUCKLEY coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued three wide
into upper stretch seizing the front straightened away, dug in under lone threat through the final furlong holding sway to the finish. GOT THE GOLD five then
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside to latch on
the aforementioned foe near the finish and was repelled to the wire. B C GLORY DAYS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. SIR WILLIAM chased four
then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no rally. STREET CULTURE coaxed from the
start, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge for the initial
time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then tired through to the finish. OUT THE WOODS broke in at the
start and was corrected, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ARISTOCRATIC displayed good on the outside of a foe then moved clear when that foe was taken back nearing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground while
coaxed along around the turn, responded well under hand urging in upper stretch , came under a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker,
remained clear into the final sixteenth and was fully extended to gamely prevail. MR PHIL was urged along in third position, chased in the four path around
the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. HAPPY FARM was
hustled from the gate, showed good speed on the inside of the winner, was taken back off the pace nearing the nine-sixteenths then switched out, chased in
the two to three path through the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and
finished willingly to get the show. FREE ENTERPRISE broke out and bumped lightly with a foe then was corrected by the rider, jostled with a foe around the
five-eighths, went five wide early on the turn, dropped to four then three wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into upper stretch, drifted out into the
final furlong and lacked the needed kick while gaining some ground. BELLE TAPISSERIE bumped lightly with a foe at the start, jostled with that same rival
around the five-eighths, was urged six then five wide on the turn, dropped back six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. SOMEBODY was urged along
at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
EDDIE THE GREAT veered in at the start commencing a chain of light bumps and leans against WICKOSITY down through to REGAL EMPIRE, pinching
back WICKOSITY in the process before being corrected, raced forwardly placed and began to pull growing a bit rank under restraint with six furlongs to go
while four to five paths off the inside latched on his barn mate INFEASIBLE to the outside, settled attending that rival through sensible splits and tucked to
the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear
under a drive to prevail. WICKOSITY got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe and in turn bumped EL VEINTICUATRO before being pinched
lightly back, raced six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild bid. INFEASIBLE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide through sensible splits facing pressure only through the
presence of his barn mate to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front taking the inside
route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. EL VEINTICUATRO bumped at the start by WICKOSITY due
to pressure from EDDIE THE GREAT, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
SILVERMILL five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
to five wide for home and tired. REGAL EMPIRE got brushed at the start by EL VEINTICUATRO due to pressure initiated by EDDIE THE GREAT, raced
four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking two to three wide through the turn, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and
made no impact.

Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear when set down into
upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved much
the best under steady urging. SARATOGA BEAUTY settled on the outside, was asked while tracking four wide on the turn, chased the winner into upper
stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. MISS PEPPINA settled at the rear, was urged three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SPUN D'ETAT was sent hard from the gate, chased the pace on the
outside, raced three wide while between foes on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. BABY BOSS contested the pace on the outside then in
the two path while between foes on the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and capitulated. VIOLENT POINT was hustled from the start,
chased the early pace then was taken under light restraint while behind horses, saved ground on the turn, moved out a touch into upper stretch, dropped in
inside the three-sixteenths then hit the rail and came up empty.

Footnotes
MIDASWELLRUN coaxed from the gate, raced four to five paths off the inside in aim of the leader before advancing on that rival to take over the front half a
mile from home, tucked to the two path through the turn, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail.
LUCKY BRODY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one while running on well clear for the place honors. RAISING SAND stumbled at the start, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLYING WITH ANGELS chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position. MY BOY COLTON coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside, got displaced from the front half a mile from home and chased along the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and faltered. BECKENBAUER chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the
right side at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. BATTLE MAP showed speed five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway and faded, went four wide into upper stretch, then folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON was carried in while hustled from the start then bumped with a foe, raced on the outside while ridden along, went four to five wide on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a strong drive, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. PRINCE JAMES bumped with a rival
early, moved in while urged along off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, gained to make a bid between horses coming to the five-sixteenths,
fought loosely between foes under a drive into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. FAST GETAWAY was
hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, led under a drive into the final furlong then lost the
advantage, fought on well into the final sixteenth and weakened while clear for the show. SECRET RULES was sent from the start, chased the pace on the
outside then four wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, battled outside of two foes under a drive into the final furlong and tired. SIBELIUS was
hustled from the start, pressed the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out into upper stretch and also tired then drifted
in late. PERUVIAN BOY broke a bit slow then dropped back quickly while climbing badly, fell well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and
was no factor.

Footnotes
SHADOLAMO went to the front, moved clear inside the three-quarter pole, extended the advantage with five furlongs to run, controlled the action while
inside around the turn, responded well under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker and held
sway under steady urging. BEE BIT settled well off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly to just
get the place. BARISTA VIXEN settled towards the rear, was urged four wide on the turn and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to
get the show. CHARGE ACCOUNT bumped with an opponent at the start, showed speed then dropped off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn,
drifted out in pursuit of the leader in upper stretch, chased to the wire and lacked the needed kick. SWEET MIA bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the
pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. ANNIKA GOLD was
urged along on the outside, dropped from the three to two wide early on the turn, moved to the rail before the five-sixteenths and also lacked the needed
response. SUBIACO was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MY GIRL LEXI lost her
footing at the start and was last to commence, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.
