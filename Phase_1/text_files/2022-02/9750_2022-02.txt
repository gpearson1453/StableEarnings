wide into the upper stretch, stayed sharp under a mild drive and remained well clear. GREEN DOT BRAH lacked speed and raced in the back, shifted out
wide in the upper stretch, rallied along the outside and finished well clear for second best. SLOE GIN BIZ raced up close in pursuit of the early leader, ran
on four wide into the upper stretch and dug in to capture show. INNER WAVE raced two wide between foes off the second flight entering the turn, stayed on
two wide into the stretch run and got nipped for show. U U STAR raced in contention along the outside, ran on three to four wide through the turn, came out
wider for the drive and flattened out. DANLEY was ridden along the rail around the turn, saved ground into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. INDEED
INDEED chased between foes entering the turn, was ridden five wide in the upper stretch then shifted in and gave way. LICHTMAN showed response in

Footnotes
ONE IDENTITY was well placed tracking inside off the top trio, tipped out late on the turn, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch, took over the
lead with a furlong left to run and held firm under steady encouragement. FIRENSPICE rated near midpack in early stages, launched a five wide bid
entering the stretch run, angled in a couple paths under pressure and finished willingly for second best. POIEMA raced up close just off the early duel,
moved up to engage rivals for the lead mid-way through the turn, vied into the upper stretch then got overtaken by the top two finishers and stayed on to
best the rest. RUNAWAY BREEZE was not too far back saving ground, angled out under a left-handed drive in the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.
DONYA KNOW IT raced in the back, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. GOLDEN ISLE dueled two wide for the early lead, battled on
through the turn then tired in the drive. SHOOTLIKEAGIRL angled to the rail shortly after the start, dueled inside of GOLDEN AISLE through the turn then
had nothing left in the lane.

MAGICAL MARRIAGE sped to the lead and angled inside soon after the start, was well rated on top under a snug hold, continued with a slim lead leaving
the far turn, given cue two wide entering the lane, dug in under steady pressure and held firm. BUNKER HILL was allowed to settle out of the gate and
raced two wide into the backstretch, tracked the pace into the far turn, launched a bid near the quarter pole, dug in four deep a furlong out and got up for
place. BIG ART settled and saved ground through early stages, tipped out three wide late on the far turn, launched a bid racing a bit tight between foes near
the furlong marker, gained closer contention then evened out nearing the wire. RIGHTEOUS ROY got brushed between foes at the start, stalked and saved
ground up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside into stretch, sustained bid into the final furlong then flattened out. STARLITE WALKER was forwardly
placed up the backstretch, moved up close at the quarter pole, sustained bid into the final furlong then gave way. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
QUEEN CALYPSO tracked the pace along the inside through opening stages, tipped three wide late on the turn, responded willingly under a drive and
finished going away. RED WIND raced three wide off the second flight entering the turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch, finished well and cleared
second best. AMERICAN TAP chased between rivals in early stages, was ridden along the inside late on the turn, cut the corner, moved up into striking
distance then got outkicked by the top two finishers. PRETZEL raced off the early pace, saved ground into the lane and improved position without
threatening. DADDY'S JOY chased inside near midpack, tipped out wider for the drive and needed more for late impact. MY MASTERPIECE got brushed
between foes at the start, raced off the early pace, was ridden along six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. FAST VENEZUELA sped to
the lead and angled inside soon after the start, held firm around the turn, got collared in the upper stretch and gave way. MOONROCK raced up close three
wide around the turn then faded past upper stretch.

Footnotes
KLUGMAN sped to the lead and angled in soon after the start, widened advantage still unleashed around the turn, came under mild hand urging two wide in
the upper stretch, responded willingly, drew off and finished in hand. AGARRAMESIPUEDES raced three wide between foes entering the turn, sustained a
three wide bid into the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but dug in gamely and edged foe for place. KING D chased in contention along the rail,
was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response and got edged out late for place. THE MAR was away in good order and chased
in contention, was a bit awkward in stride and weakened near the seven-sixteenth pole, made a rebid along the rail leaving the turn and lacked a needed
rally. CANTANKEROUS CAT hustled along two wide in pursuit of the early leader, sustained bid mid-way through the turn then retreated. CRY MACHO
reared in the air at the start and spotted the field several lengths, hustled up five wide while not far back into the turn, came up empty nearing the quarter
pole and continued to tire in the lane.

Footnotes
TREVESS was forwardly placed from the outset, moved up to challenge the leader with a quarter-mile remaining, took command turning for home,
remained clear a furlong out then held late under a driving finish. DESIGNED BY KITTEN bumped with rival at the start then raced four wide in the second
flight entering the turn, sustained a three wide bid for TREVESS through the lane, stayed on with good response and edged closer in final strides. SHALL
RETURN raced two wide in early stages then launched an outside bid late on the turn, ran on four wide into the stretch and secured a share. LAWN DART
chased between foes in opening stages then waited for a clear path around the turn, tipped two wide and given cue in the upper stretch but failed to kick on.
SAMMY'S TOWN got bumped between and shuffled back at the start, raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. MIDSHIP
LADY took a solid bump at the start, was not too back entering the turn then had no response when called upon. TUNSTALL sped to the lead and angled
inside, got collared by the winner leaving the turn and tired in the drive. WEDONTBELIEVEHER showed brief response in early stages then faded.

SONIC SPEED got bumped at the start then settled three wide into the first turn, remained unhurried up the backstretch, shifted out and picked up the pace
leaving the far turn, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch, responded gamely under right-handed pressure and surged clear. EAGLE CHIEF settled
near midpack, launched a four wide bid near the quarter pole, dug in four deep with a furlong left to run, edged ahead to briefly take the lead then got
outkicked by the winner. EL PECADO showed the way into the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, fought back still
holding the advantage with a furlong left to run then yielded late and finished on equal terms for show. SIR TERRE raced off the pace and saved ground,
was ridden along two wide through the far turn, raced in traffic in the upper stretch, shifted out wide for a clear path, finished willingly and got up late to
share show. RAVE ON stalked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the upper stretch then ran
on evenly in the final furlong. AMERICAN GREAT was forwardly placed behind the pacesetter, launched a two wide bid around the final turn, stayed on with
response into the final furlong then had nothing left ion late reserve. TRUPIA tracked the pace saving ground, remained in contention along the rail around
the final turn then tired in the drive. ROGER THAT B raced four to five wide into the first turn and remained reserved in the back, saved ground around the
far turn then shifted out and never threatened. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
