MCENTIRE rallied around the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly and drew off under urging. TOP OF THE GAME raced in the back, advanced on the
turn, closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. CLAVICHORD challenged four wide entering the turn, dueled to mid stretch and
faltered. THE BEAT was crowded at the start, raced in the back, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. STACKIN SILVER moved up along the
backstretch to contend, took over into the turn and flattened out. TIZHOTNDUSTY challenged three wide between horses into the turn, had little left and
gave way. CZECHMIGHT was hustled along inside, set the pace, tired into the turn and stopped.

XYLOPHONE stalked the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn and inched clear mid stretch under left handed urging. SEVEN
POINTS was squeezed at the start, unhurried early, advanced on the turn, bid five wide and got up for place. BONES AND ROSES moved up to challenge
three wide on the backstretch, weakened in the drive and hung late. LEMON DROP LADY led around the first turn, contended to mid stretch and gave way.
LIFE IN PARADISE saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid and came up empty. EASY DOES IT raced off the rail in an even effort and failed to threaten.
TEXAS WENDY broke out, challenged between horses along the backstretch and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
FREIBURG stalked the pace, bid three wide on the turn, closed willingly and drew off while kept to task. KING LEBRON dueled two wide to the turn, drew
clear, was outclosed and no match for the winner. MR VIEW was never far back, bid inside and was along for show. REIGN ON (GB) was slow early, swung
wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. BULLET TIMES improved position in an even effort. INQUISITEUR was not a factor. PURELY GIVEN showed
speed to the turn and gave way. AWESOME IMAGE dueled to the turn, dropped back and gave way. COUNTRY ROAD was off slowly and checked at the
start and failed to contend. FRANKLYENERGIZED had brief speed only.
