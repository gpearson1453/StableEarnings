Footnotes
SERAPE set the pace along the inside, met DREAMING OF NEANY's bid turning for home, swiftly repelled that rival entering the lane, and drew off under
mild urging. DREAMING OF NEANY broke inwardly at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader around the far turn to bid for the lead
two wide turning for home, but proved no match for the leader entering the lane, and was second best. A G'S CHARLOTTE rated off of the pace in the two
path around the first turn, then saved ground while tracking around the far turn, and gained place from outer rivals approaching the final furlong.
MISHPACHAH stalked three wide, attempted to range up along with DREAMING OF NEANY around the far turn, but failed to match bidding strides with a
quarter mile to go, and tired through the lane. LOVELY LADY MAY prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn. ANITA'S
VISION showed a visible layer of sweat on her neck pre-race, and never got involved. AVERI EVER AFTER brushed an outer rival before nudging an inner
foe at the start, then got outrun.

Footnotes
COBRA CASABLANCA sped clear early on, maintained a wide margin around the turn and through upper stretch, drifted outwardly a bit after flopping back
to her left lead with seventy yards to go, but held sway safely from an outer rallying rival late. HAVE NO FEAR stalked the clear leader from multiple lengths
off around the turn, turned away place-bidding rivals on either side in upper stretch, closed in outside of the leader in the late stages, but was kept at bay. A
LOT OF SPUNK tracked along the inside, shifted outwardly to engage DOUBLE DARE YOU in upper stretch while vying for show, and edged away from
that rival for that position passing the furlong grounds. DOUBLE DARE YOU tracked three wide, vied for show outside of A LOT OF SPUNK through upper
stretch, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole. LOVE AND LEMONS never got involved. NORTHERN ALLIANCE got outrun.

ISOLATE set the pace inside of a prompting LONG WEEKEND turning for home, shook clear of that foe entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and
was driven into the final sixteenth. LONG WEEKEND pressed the leader from the outside while under steady urging, but failed to keep pace with that rival at
the quarter pole, and held place from an inside chasing rival. SOUNION broke slowly after splaying his front right when the gates opened, saved ground off
of the pace, improved to gain show in upper stretch, and chased along the rail through the final furlong, but failed to reach an outer rival for place.
EMERALD FOREST chased three wide around the turn, but tired through the lane. EBBEN was put to tight quarters between horses at the start, raced at
the rear two wide, and failed to make an impact.

GALILEAS PROMISE set the pace, drew off passing the quarter pole, and was put to hand late. VICIOUS VELMA pressed the pace two wide, but failed to
keep pace with the leader entering the dueled, dueled outside of EARLEY ROSE for place thereafter, and prevailed. EARLEY ROSE stalked along the
inside, bid for place inside of VICIOUS VELMA entering the lane, dueled for that position through the lane, but was bested. GOLDEN TWIST stalked three
wide, but weakened at the half mile pole. TETHERED tracked in the four path around the first turn, then raced far off of the pace along the inside around the
far turn, and failed to factor. MARK WITH AN E broke a bit outwardly at the start, and was outrun. HERO'S DAUGHTER showed little.

Footnotes
MARQUEE RIDE pressed the pace three wide, vied outside of EXIT around the far turn, assumed command entering the lane, drifted outwardly a bit in
upper stretch, but widened through the final furlong once straightened. CRYPTIC CODE was briefly restless awaiting the start, then hesitated while
launching off his hind quarters when the gates opened, raced far off of the pace around both turns, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of
foes through the final furlong to reach place in the late stages. CURLIN EDGES tracked two wide, backed off between horses at the five furlong pole, raced
off of the pace three wide into the far turn, then stayed on through the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe a sixteenth out before reaching show late.
STAVANGER broke outwardly, raced off of the pace three wide, chased the leading pair around the far turn, shifted inwardly in upper stretch after
MARQUEE RIDE assumed command, and flattened out along the rail in the final sixteenth. TRICOLOUR lunged inwardly at the start and took a few strides
to regain balance, laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked down the backstretch, but was shuffled back behind a tiring T G'S NELSON at the three
furlong pole, and lacked a re-rally. T G'S NELSON acted up briefly in the starting gate, then prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, but
weakened at the half mile pole. EXIT set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals early on, vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, but
proved no match for that rival approaching the lane, and stopped thereafter. HERO DRAGON showed little.

TELLMEONASUNDAY broke a bit outwardly while being last away, tracked in the five path into the first turn, tucked to the rail at the seven furlong pole,
stalked before bidding for the lead at the three furlong pole, assumed command at the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure through midstretch, and
was geared down in the late stages. JUST PASSING THRU trailed in the two path, split foes two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole while chasing
the top pair turning for home, drifted to the five path entering the lane, then stayed on to claim place leaving the furlong grounds. WORLD OF WONDER set
the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the inner railing, met TELLMEONSUNDAY's rail bid into the far turn, proved no match for that foe
entering the lane, and tired. MARAMA saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MAIRSILS FIRST prompted the pace two wide while in the three path,
but weakened at the three furlong pole. SIKUM stalked three wide while in the four path around the first turn, but weakened at the five furlong pole, and was
done early.

Footnotes
THE GREY BEAUTY prompted the pace outside of the leader from the three path, drifted to the six path entering the lane as an outer ISN'T IT TIME ranged
up, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, but fought back and regained an advantage entering the final sixteenth. ISN'T IT TIME stalked behind the
leading pair, shifted outside of them approaching the five sixteenths pole to range up turning for home, got floated to the seven path entering the lane by the
leader while bidding, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but failed to kick on in the final furlong, and was bested by her inner counterpart in the final
sixteenth. ASK DALE broke a bit outwardly and was taken in hand by the rider at the start, saved ground far off of the pace before coming in to the lane in
the three path, dove back to the rail for clear sailing at the furlong grounds, then rallied inside of rivals to claim show late. MRS. NECAISE chased the
leading trio from the three path around the turn while under steady urging, sustained stride in upper stretch, to reach show at the furlong grounds, but was
bested by an inner rival for that position late. MISS BARETA failed to factor. RYDENSEEK never got involved. STARSHIP NOLA broke a step slowly,
lagged behind the field around the turn, and showed mild late interest to pass a tiring foe. ZUMRA BAYOU bobbled inconsequently at the start, set the pace
along the inside, but gave way inside of a pair of rivals at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
TREASURY set a clear and uncontested pace, and held firmly from an outer chasing foe through the lane. CRUMP tracked two to three wide, ranged up
entering the lane in pursuit of a clear TREASURY, but was only second best. GULFSTREAM WAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked then clear
leader from the two path, chased around the far turn before getting outkicked for place by an outer rival entering the lane, and was best of the rest.
GIGGING trailed, took the far turn in the four path while far back, and moved up through the lane. CABERTOSS tracked along the inside, chased the
leaders around the far turn, and faded through the final furlong. CARILLO laid off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. EDITOR IN CHIEF bumped
with an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but tired.
