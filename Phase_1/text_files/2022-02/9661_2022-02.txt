Footnotes
EAGLE IN LOVE broke in and bumped with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, gained the lead under a drive in
upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up inside the furlong marker and drove clear under strong handling. LONG TERM was sent hard from the start, moved
in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail under urging while still inside those foes on the turn, passed the
quarter-pole in the two path under pressure, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final furlong and proved no
match while well clear for the place. CHEEKY TICO bobbled at the start, settled under some urging, chased inside under strong urging on the turn, moved
off the rail outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. IMPROPER bumped with a rival at the start,
pressed the pace loosely between foes, vied in the two path while between horses on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired.
PATHOLOGICAL was bumped soundly at the start and forced into another rival then taken up sharply, moved out under tight restraint early, shifted further
out while momentarily taken under an even tighter hold inside the three-quarter pole, came under urging with seven-sixteenths to run, chased three then
four wide on the turn, was carried six wide into the stretch, moved in around the furlong marker and capitulated. REGAL EMPIRE broke out and bumped
with an opponent, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no
factor. UNION LIGHTS was bumped soundly at the start then taken up, moved out early, angled in outside the five-eighths, was urged along in the two path
on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CONVERTIBLE FREEZE five then six wide just off a pace dispute, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take narrow command a furlong from home, then edged away to the finish kept to task. DONTBELATE dueled inside of LANFRANKOPHILE down the
backstretch, then vied inside a pair two to three wide through the turn under light coaxing, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in and was collared near
the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. HOT STEPPER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch making headway, offered up a bid to the furlong grounds, then flattened out in the late stages while preserving the
show honors. R DOC four wide in aim of the duel early on, advanced on those rivals and vied for command floating five wide through the turn under coaxing
from three furlongs out, spun six wide into upper stretch heads apart for command, then weakened in the late stages. GINNSU WARRIOR stumbled
awkwardly at the start recovering inwards and getting away last, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home and made no impact. LANFRANKOPHILE dueled from the two path with DONTBELATE to his inside, then vied three to four wide loosely between
foes through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, faded and went five wide into upper stretch before tiring in the drive.

Footnotes
DEFAULT PROTECTION broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, took the lead under a drive
at the quarter-pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. COURAGEOUS GIRL disputed
the pace on the outside, moved clear outside the five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path, was asked under threat outside the quarter-pole, lost the
lead into the stretch, moved out after losing touch with the winner into the final furlong and safely secured the place. HONEY MONEY was coaxed from the
gate, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, started the turn in the two path, was roused for more while
shifting four wide in the vicinity of the three-eighths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. VIENNA CODE bumped lightly with a foe at the
start then paused while in tight briefly, angled out early then settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
BLUSHABLE broke in at the start, settled off the pace, moved up inside a foe with a half-mile to run, was asked while inside to the two path on the turn and
came up empty. BRAVO REGINA bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, settled towards the rear, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
EUCHARIST settled comfortably on the far outside, was roused in the five path on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, closed strongly to engulf the
exhausted pacesetter inside the three-sixteenths, drew away under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one light reminder with the crop
outside the sixteenth-pole then eased up late while much the best. DEE BO was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, angled
out nearing the furlong marker and just got up for the place. MACHO BOY was urged along in third position, went around the turn in the four path, chased
the leader while still on his inside lead in the stretch and weakened then just lost the place but was clear for the show. A COLT NAMED SUSIE was urged
along towards the back, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. OUR AMERICAN STAR broke a bit slow, raced at the rear of the field, went four
to five wide on the turn and was no factor. STANHOPE was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, moved clear leaving the
backstretch, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, dropped closer to the rail while shortening stride approaching the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage while remaining on his inside lead inside the three-sixteenths and capitulated. EXXTOP hit the inside of the gate at the start then bobbled slightly,
settled near the back, went around the turn in the two path and showed little. BROCKMONINOFF was hustled from the start while loosing his footing
slightly, contested the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and retreated.

OCEAN DEEP broke out at the start under coaxing filling the space vacated by ROMANTIC MAN who broke outwards, chased just off the inside from near
the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch before tipping out an additional path or two, rallied to
steadily gain outside and was up in the final jumps to the finish. TOTAL EFFORT broke in bumping NAPOLEON COMPLEX, then got bumped by WE
READY who also broke inwards, raced four then three wide in aim of the front coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, took over narrow command three-sixteenths from home, dug in under a drive inching away briefly before being caught in the late stages and forced
to settle for the place honors. ALITE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a bid taking the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to secure the show honors. WE READY broke in at the start bumping TOTAL EFFORT into NAPOLEON
COMPLEX applying half the pressure in concert with ROMANTIC MAN to squeeze back NAPOLEON COMPLEX, chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths and advanced through the latter portion of the turn to take brief and narrow command swinging five wide into upper stretch,
yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages. ROMANTIC MAN broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back NAPOLEON
COMPLEX against pressure outside from WE READY, chased five wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, offered
up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. NAPOLEON COMPLEX got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was steadied
when squeezed back at the start conceding six lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through
the turn, went three wide for home and offered no rally. PRINCE OF JOY dueled from the two path with MY BOY COLTON to his outside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed for the front at the quarter pole and spun three wide for home, then weakened to the wire. MY BOY COLTON
dueled three wide down the backstretch with PRINCE OF JOY to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded tucking to the two path, took
the inside route into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
TALE OF MINESHAFT settled under some urging, went four to five wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed fast to make an outside bid at
the three-sixteenths, was bumped by the runner-up inside the furlong marker, dueled with that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
VICTORY BUILT pressed the pace on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a bid near the
three-sixteenths, drifted out and bumped the winner inside the furlong marker, dueled inside that foe to the wire and just missed while well clear for the
place. MATTY'S MARAUDER was ridden along in the back half of the field, went three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while along for the
show. MALIBU STAR was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and failed to rally. GHOSTMON dropped well behind
while void of speed, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the final furlong and failed to threaten. MISTER
WINSTON was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn and tired. FORGOTTEN MISSION set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, lost the advantage while drifting inward in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths and tired. LITTERBOX was well placed just off the pace, chased in mostly the two path on the turn and came up empty.
SCORPION DYNASTY was fractious in the gate, settled towards the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. FAR AWAY LOOK bobbled after the start, settled on the outside, was urged five to six wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
Through thick fog, CHESTERTOWN race five wide in aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin three wide into upper
stretch seizing command straightened away, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. BUY LAND AND SEE chased four to five wide from the tail of the
compact field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on to just get up for the place honors in the last jump
to the wire. LITTLE MENACE showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home
under threat and relented straightened away, dug in and was nailed for the place honors on the line. FAMISHED forwardly placed four wide between foes,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, swung four wide for home and tired in the stretch. TIMES WERE PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.
