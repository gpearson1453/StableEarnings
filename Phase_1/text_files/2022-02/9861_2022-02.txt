Footnotes
END ALL GET ALL angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, was roused midway through the backstretch to maintain
striking distance, responded entering the far turn to advance inside rivals nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage, then went clear under firm
encouragement. CANDY CRUSHEM, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to press that rival in that path racing into the far
turn, struck the front racing past the quarter mile marker but proved no match for the winner. INDIAN BUZZ was urged inside foes to gain the advantage
racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival entering the far turn but couldn't match
terms with the top pair racing into the stretch but continued with interest to prevail for a share. SOBERANO (FR) was settled last racing to the backstretch,
gained position between foes racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late response. GHOST STALKER, caught four wide tracking off the first flight to
the backstretch, continued in that path through the far turn and steadily faded. INTERNET OF THINGS, in touch with the first flight between foes attending
the pace, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
RULING FRONT broke readily to dispute the pace inside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and widened the
advantage late under firm right handed encouragement. THAT'S MY BOI TOY prompted the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn,
proved no match racing into upper stretch, drifted inwards in late stages but continued well enough to save the place honors. PELLEGRINI ducked out at
the start, was righted to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn and continued evenly while missing for second. HE'S PURRFECT shied
outwards from PELLEGRINI at the start, was settled off the second flight, then continued three wide between foes into the turn but offered no rally. JUPITER
RAIN tracked off the first flight inside a rival on the backstretch but faded early. BUSTER BURNS ran loose in the chute prior to the start, shied outwards
avoiding HE'S PURRFECT at the break, was righted to race four wide through the backstretch into the turn and steadily retreated. CLASSIC ESCAPE,
required an equipment adjustment in the gate prior to the start, was off last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JIM'S BRONZE STAR broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue three deep on the turn to strike the front
nearing upper stretch and edged clear of PONY GIRL in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. EXPECT TO BE READY tracked just off
the first flight four wide between foes in the opening stages, continued in that path into the turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place
honors nearing the wire. PONY GIRL angled to the rail in early stages racing just off the first flight, was urged to press the issue inside foes racing into the
turn, dueled with the eventual winner past midstretch, but proved no match in late stages, then lost second approaching the wire. UCAPTURED AERO,
urged disputing the pace just inside the eventual winner in the opening stages while shifting off the rail, pressed the issue between foes into the turn and
gave way leaving midstretch. DREAM TRACER settled along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but made no real
impression. MILENITA, caught five wide in the opening stages tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, dropped back nearing the lane. OSTARA
raced between foes in the last flight on the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA broke readily, attended a rival's pace under light rating in the opening half, was prompted to take over racing into the far turn, went clear
nearing upper stretch while shifting to the inside, then drifted out in the last furlong and just maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling. MET
IN MIAMI tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep after a half, was fanned four wide on the
far turn but continued willingly into the lane to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. AZURA, urged inside the eventual winner into the first turn
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, pressed the issue into the second bend, couldn't match the winner and faded into upper stretch while prevailing
for a share. JUST STAY HOME tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, angled inside foes entering the far turn, tipped out
nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance between foes but had no closing response. MIZZEN AIR, firmly rated inside foes tracking just off the
leaders to the backstretch, tipped out three deep nearing the second turn while being urged to advance on the leaders but gave way nearing upper stretch.
D FLAT WHITE settled last in early stages and failed to menace. FUN PADDY proved no factor.

Footnotes
COMMENCE broke inwards bumping EIGHT WEEKS LONG, was collected, then angled to the inside racing through the chute to track off the second flight
to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes racing into the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through upper stretch and produced a steady late
response to just collar HARROW on the wire, just getting the nod in time under left handed encouragement. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter inside
rivals racing into the first turn, tipped outside the leader entering the backstretch while moving to prompt that foe, pressed the issue racing into the far turn to
gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, went clear between calls late and continued grudgingly to the end to just lose the nod on the wire. STAR
CHAMBER, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn tracking off the second flight, angled to the inside midway through the backstretch, saved ground
gaining position into upper stretch, came around a tiring foe in the lane and continued willingly inside the top pair to close the gap while prevailing for a
share. BARAHIN, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted off the inside racing through the stretch and
continued with interest four wide nearing the wire while just missing for a share. BIG POLO sped to the lead along the inside leaving the chute, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged nearing upper stretch but gave way in late stages. KING RAMOS was rated
between foes while dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn and came up empty nearing the
lane. EMPHASIZE was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. EIGHT WEEKS LONG, bumped start, was settled last
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. IN HONOR OF ARTIE, caught three deep leaving the chute tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight, continued outside a rival to the second bend and steadily faded between foes on the far turn.

IMPERIAL BREW, raced six wide to the chute while racing just off the leaders, shifted inwards while being rated outside foes through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance three deep racing into the bend bidding for command nearing the three furlong marker, moved away to a clear advantage racing into
upper stretch, widened the margin under left handed pressure and was taken in hand in late stages while continuing to draw away. LAUDERDALE raced
five wide between foes in the opening stages, was rated off the second flight while angling inwards on the backstretch, shifted outside foes while being
prompted to advance leaving the turn, was fanned four wide in the closing stages but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY tracked off the first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out three wide nearing
upper stretch, then continued to gain position in that path while being outkicked for second. MR. WHO joined the pace four wide in early stages, pressed the
issue outside a rival racing into the turn but gave way once headed by the winner. STRIKING HEIR angled to the inside racing through the chute to dispute
the pace inside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong
marker. GO TIME switched off the inside while coming under pressure early but never gained contention. OHIO MUNNY angled to the inside in the opening
stages, tracked off the first flight through the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the turn. RESIDENT dropped out early.

Footnotes
BARBERINI, bumped by PANADERO at the start, was rated outside foes just off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide approaching the
far turn commencing a steady advance, continued in that path through the second bend to upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the
advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. PANADERO broke out hitting the gate, then bumping the eventual winner, was collected, then angled
to the inside racing through the chute, steadily gained position inside foes on the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid inside the leaders when presented
an opening racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just failing to match the winner's kick. SKIPPERINI raced three deep through
the chute tracking just off the pacesetter, continued outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to challenge the pacesetter between foes
leaving the midway point of the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, dueled between foes past midstretch but yielded to the top pair
late. FAST N STEADY was rated between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out three wide racing into the far turn while
being prompted to advance, bid between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. FIERCE WARRIOR, reserved off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, switched off the inside after a half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch carrying out KISS PRINCIPAL but had
no closing response. SHIMMERING LEROID tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half but steadily faded racing
into the far turn. ONWARD AUSTIN sped to the lead through the chute, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, was headed nearing upper
stretch and gave way between foes into the lane. KISS PRINCIPAL settled between foes, then switched outside rivals entering the backstretch, raced four
wide into the far turn, was carried out to the six path nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
LET'S BE HONEST ducked out at the start, then drifted out while being taken in hand racing through the chute carrying out BE BOP A LOLA, tracked the
leaders off the inside through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the bend, was held up momentarily when lacking a path nearing upper stretch,
switched out three wide racing into the lane and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under some right handed pressure while being taken in
hand in the final strides. SHE DAZZLE tracked outside the pacesetter from just out of striking distance in the three path on the backstretch, shifted inwards
nearing the turn while moving steadily to close the gap on that foe, took over leaving the quarter mile marker, held sway on a clear margin past midstretch
but couldn't fend off the winner. PLUIE D'AVRIL, reserved between foes racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the
inside racing into upper stretch to bid inside the top pair but lacked the needed final kick. BE BOP A LOLA, bumped by WICKED MIAH at the start, then
carried out by the eventual winner racing to the chute, steadied out of tight quarters entering the backstretch, raced outside foes on the backstretch,
continued in brief pursuit of the leaders three, then four wide into the turn and steadily faded in the drive. WICKED MIAH shied outwards avoiding the
eventual winner at the start bumping BE BOP A LOLA, was collected to track the leaders along the inside racing through the backstretch but steadily faded
racing into the bend. NOTHINS FREE sprinted clear of the field while angling over racing into the backstretch, maintained a clear margin into the turn, but
gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BE BOP A LOLA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER RACING THROUGH THE CHUTE BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. MARICOPA WAS SCRATCHED IN THE
PADDOCK PRIOR TO THE RACE.

Footnotes
KITTEN WITH A WHIP was guided to the inside racing through the chute tracking just off the pacesetter under light rating to the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and responded to firm right handed pressure to wrest a clear advantage in time. GO
YEOWOMEN broke readily, was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside rival leaving the
far turn into the stretch, couldn't contain the winner's late bid but held grudgingly for the place honors. SIP'N DIP, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace
under light rating to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE tracked off
the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out while being urged to advance between foes racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide
nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final response. STRONG GEM, reserved in early stages while angling to the inside, saved ground throughout
gaining some position but had no closing bid. MORGAN'S Z VA switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught five
wide after a half, continued in that path through the far turn to the lane and finished evenly late. SENSIBLE MYTH, bumped at the start, momentarily
dislodging her rider from his irons, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. HELLO ROSIE SAY, urged to a
forward placing four wide racing through the chute, was carried out by GLOVANNA racing into the first turn and soon emptied out. GLOVANNA, urged to
contend three wide between foes leaving the chute, drifted out racing into the first turn impeding HELLO ROSIE SAY and soon dropped out. HOLY DIVER
retreated early.
