Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB sprinted clear at once while confidently well handled and cruised to the wire a handy winner. ARBA ranged up to chase winner throughout
while clearly no match while best of the rest. OLA QUE TAL chased inside to turn, angled out widest in the stretch run for show spot. KITCHEN FIRE
chased pace from inside, could not sustain bid in the stretch and faded. WILD WILLIAM inside run to the stretch while never a real menace. OVERNIGHT
SUCCESS never factored. COMMISSARIO always far back. COWTOWN COWBOY reared, threw rider in the gate, reloaded with nothing left to give.

Footnotes
QUICK MASTER bore in start, chased leaders to far turn, battled hard trough the stretch run to be along in time. CALIFORNIA FLIRT bore out start, never
far back, energetic rousing in the stretch but outgamed to the wire. JR'S GIFT raced between horses to far turn, angled in through the stretch but too late
while staying game. STRIKES BACK threw rider in the gate, broke sharp to lead, stayed game to the stretch and weakened. HORSE DADDY pinched back
at the start, raced evenly with no late response when called upon. SUCCEED tracked to the half, floated widest into the stretch run and faltered in the late
going. MOUNTAIN GHOST never reached a contending position throughout. MAJOR CAM was through early and dropped back with nothing left. RARE N
READY bobbled at the start and lost best chance thereafter.
