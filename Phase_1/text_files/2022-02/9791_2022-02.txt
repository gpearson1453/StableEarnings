Footnotes
AUTISM CAN DO got away well, set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. REDDISH stalked the pace, got through along
the rail on the turn, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. HANDSOME ACCOUNT saved ground, angled out on the drive, bid five wide
and closed steadily. NOT NECESSARILY lagged early, went six wide entering the stretch, finished well and gained late. LT. BULLITT was off a step slowly,
went widest in the drive and found his best stride late. IZEISMAGA stalked the pace, went three wide entering the stretch, was not urged and hung in the
lane. CALIFORNIA TENGA raced inside early, angled out for the drive and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
HIGH FLYIN TIGER was unhurried early, rallied through traffic around the turn, got a head in front near the eighth pole and inched clear. RANCHER
advanced along the rail on the first turn, sprinted clear into the second turn, was headed mid stretch and outfinished to finish second best.
SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER settled off the pace, raced mid pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, bid, hung and settled for show. DEPUTY KNIGHT
stalked the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn and finished evenly. SHARP'S FLASH stalked the pace while racing three across, went
seven wide at the top of the stretch, leveled off and faded. ATLATL broke awkwardly to be off slowly and failed to threaten in an even effort. WHISPERING
FLAME was in tight entering the first turn, raced close to the pace inside and tired into the second turn. CASTLE DONOVAN LAD trailed the field and
showed little. Fraction of 4785 was removed.

leaving the turn and lacked a bid. ROYAL DANIELLE raced inside, lacked a bid and was outrun. MORNING BLURS was hustled along, led early, was used
on on the turn and stopped. REDHAWK raced mid pack, swung wide on the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
RAMBLIN' MAN rallied around the turn, bid eight wide and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. DARNQUICK pressed the pace four wide,
dropped back on the turn, angled in, got through along the rail, assumed command, drew clear and was caught in a game effort. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO
pressed the pace three wide between horses, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and narrowed the gap. STONE CARVER pressed
the pace, bid willingly and hung late in a good effort. THIEF IN THE NIGHT bumped at the start, was hustled along, led to the turn, fell back and faltered
near the eighth pole. RAIL HUGGER broke out and bumped at the start and was outrun in an even effort. LEADING SCORE was jostled at the start and
trailed the field. Hand timed.

THE PUBLIC HALO vied to the mid stretch, drew off for a clear lead and held off the late charge of TOP OF THE GAME. TOP OF THE GAME was crowded
at the start, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and was gaining fast late. ZORICH broke awkwardly, was hustled along inside, vied to the
eighth pole and faltered. SOUTH FRESNO stalked the pace inside, lacked a late response and failed to menace. CONQUEST COBRA raced in the middle
of the pack, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT came in at the start, advanced off the rail to get within range,
had little left and dropped back. SPARKLING LUTE dueled between horses, fell back on the turn and gave way. LINEMANS CHECK trailed the field, went
widest in the drive and was not a factor. WESTERN SMOKE raced close to the pace while racing outside, lacked a stretch response and dropped back. MO

Footnotes
UPPER ROOM rallied around the turn, closed willingly and wore down TRES CHIFLADOS to get up in the final strides. TRES CHIFLADOS set a pressured
pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and was caught near the wire. WICKED FORTITUDE was slow early, went six wide at the top of the stretch and
finished well to get up for sho. BLANK IT stalked the pace, was roused on the turn, bid, hung and lost position. ROYAL SEEKER was outrun in an even
effort. MARDEN was not a factor. BULLET TIMES raced inside and had brief speed only. DEMERARA dueled inside and gave way into the turn.
