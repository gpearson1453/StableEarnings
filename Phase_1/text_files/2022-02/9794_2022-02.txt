urging. JARLIAN raced off the early pace, stalked two wide on the backside, chased on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and rallied outside for
second. ONE TWO KID raced three wide early, then stalked outside, chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter pole and finished evenly in
the lane. SOPHOS raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter pole and rallied mildly on the rail. S MAN was off a bit slow, raced two wide off the
pace, went three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. LONGTAIL cleared going into the first turn, set the pace while rating, showed the way on the far
turn, dueled passing the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.

PENANCE dueled inside for the lead, dueled with ANGINETTI on the turn, battled back gamely inside of that rival past the furlong marker and edged away
for the win. ANGINETTI dueled two wide for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, dug in gamely outside of
PENANCE and came up second best. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR chased outside, moved up four wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside in the stretch run.
WISHES AND DREAMS was bumped at the start, outrun early, saved ground on the turn and closed mildly inside. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE was bumped at
the start, outrun early, came wide into the stretch and did not factor. GRACE'S DRAMA chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and tired. COTTON
CANDY CUTIE chased three wide and faded.

Footnotes
TIZ A SHARPIE raced off the pace, advanced into contention on the far turn, rallied outside rivals turning for home, dueled with SQUAN'S KINGDOM
passing the furlong marker, took charge and pulled away under urging. SQUAN'S KINGDOM raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, rallied
between horses entering the stretch, gained a short lead, dueled with the winner and came up second best. LORDEN'S LOVE showed good early speed to
set the pace, continued with a clear lead, dueled into the stretch, weakened and held well for the show spot. TAYLOR'S BELLE raced three wide early,
settled two wide off the pace and passed tired rivals. ABSOLUTE ANNA hesitated a bit and was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
SUCCESSFUL LEGACY chased the pacesetter racing close up, dropped back on the turn and faded. ABHAILE raced three wide early, stalked the pace
and gave way.

Footnotes
KID D'ORO settled nicely while stalking the early leader, bid two wide entering the far turn, quickly took charge, responded when asked, drew off under
urging and was in hand for the final yards. EL HERMANO trailed the field, saved ground, moved up on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied
outside and finished well for second. COMMISSIONER G raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, rallied
mildly in the lane and got third. GENGHIS set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled briefly with the winner,
weakened, then dug in late and held on for fourth. OPEN LENGTHS was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace and closed belatedly inside. BELLARMINE
HALL raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. NIMBLE BEAST raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn,
came three wide into the lane and tired. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD raced four wide early, continued three or four wide off the pace and gave way on the far
turn. MISSION WRAPITUP stalked the leaders, chased three wide on the far turn and gave way.
