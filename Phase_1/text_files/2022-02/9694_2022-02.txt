Footnotes
EVIL OF COURSE was away in good order and vied outside a duo in opening stages, battled on into the turn, shook free past the quarter pole and kept
clear under steady encouragement. UNCAPTURED FAITH raced just off the embattled trio leaving the backstretch, was ridden along three wide through the
turn, sustained a two wide bid for the winner through the lane and held place. FLOR DE PLATA got bumped soon after the start and lost position, ranged up
closer late on the turn, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. NOBODY'S SECRET raced off the early pace, hustled
along five wide into the lane and finished with response. MUDSHAFT raced off the pace, saved ground through the turn, shifted out wide in the upper
stretch and passed tiring rivals. ANGELIC STORM chased inside off the early speed, tipped three wide for the drive and failed to kick on. TRUE BEAST vied
inside a pair of rivals soon after the start, battled on through the turn then tired in the drive. GOOD TROUBLE raced off the top flight leaving the backstretch,
ran on four wide through the turn then gave way. SHE IS ROYALTY raced near the back, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. BLAME THE
MEDIA vied between rivals soon after the start, battled on to the quarter pole then faded in the lane. PRINCESS PUP raced in the back, wide into the lane
and never menaced.

Footnotes
PANORAMA TRUCK bumped with CASHIER CHECK at the start, let the latter go to the front on the first turn and moved out to track him from close range,
poked a head in front from outside just after six furlongs, dueled the length of the stretch and prevailed in the final strides. CASHIER CHECK bumped with
PANORAMA TRUCK at the start, cleared that one midway on the first turn and moved inside with the lead, got hooked midway on the second turn, fought
back tenaciously on the rail through the lane and just missed. BIRDMAN RICHIE broke a step slow and was three wide early, moved in going to the far turn,
waited behind horses nearing the top of the stretch, moved to the rail rallying mildly once straightened away, and finished up evenly to just get the show.
SIMILAR TASTE saved ground for six furlongs in range, had the two-path through the lane and was outfinished for third. SAVAGE SAILOR lagged toward
the back to the far turn, shifted out four then five wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain. BUBBA DREAMS raced two to three wide while between
horses much of the way, and posed no threat. CRYPTIC CREED moved up outside rivals up the backstretch, then gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
NITROUS CHANNEL pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in midstretch and widened under a drive. STAY RESTLESS
stalked the pace while bottled up inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to be clearly second best. UNIKEE set the pace along
the rail, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, weakened a bit but stayed on to hold the show. DOUBLE PLAY KING was in range three wide and
lacked a closing bid. PALM ISLAND ducked into the gap at the start, angled out soon after, raced three wide and never threatened. SUPERSTITIEUX was
outrun inside. OCOTZINGO played no factor while racing two wide. SLIGHTLY FROSTED broke inwardly, raced four wide around the turn and was through
early.

AL HILAL was allowed to settle in opening stages and secured inside position around the first turn, saved ground and rated off the pace up the backstretch,
was ridden along the rail around the far turn, cut the corner into the upper stretch then tipped three to four wide, dug in gamely under right-handed pressure
and kicked clear. THE GREAT OZ rated three to four wide off the early pace, was ridden along three wide through the far turn, tipped wider for the drive,
dug in along the outside and produced a solid finish. DOUBLE BLESSING was reserved racing in the back, swung wide into the upper stretch, closed with
response and captured show. SOUPER FORTUNE settled and saved ground through early stages, quickly moved up to challenge for the lead late on the
far turn, raced in striking distance in the upper stretch, drifted out wider under right-handed pressure and yielded late. HARDREDCANDY was forwardly
placed around the first turn then moved up to engage THE RED MAN for the early lead, dueled up the backstretch then shook free past the quarter pole,
stayed on with response then got overtaken in the final furlong. MOMZA tracked in contention up the backstretch, continued in contention three wide around
the far turn then flattened out in the lane. THE RED MAN led the way around the first turn then dueled inside with HARDRED CANDY up the backstretch,
could not match strides with rival late on the far turn and faded in the lane. COUCH DREAMS raced off the pace, got carried out wide entering the upper
stretch and never threatened. WINDY CITY RED got bumped inward after the start, was reserved near the back and failed to move into contention.
UNIMPEACHED stalked the embattled duo up the backstretch, went two wide through the far turn then retreated. CARIBBEAN GOLD showed early interest
then came up empty after the half. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
MY PRANKSTER broke a step slow and lagged toward the back early, got ridden along through the turn while gradually shifting out four wide and beginning
to advance, bid for command outside rivals into the stretch, and outdueled DEAN DELIVERS for a hard-fought decision. DEAN DELIVERS received a light
bump from OF A REVOLUTION up the backstretch, advanced with a three-wide bid between horses after a half-mile, battled inside MY PRANKSTER
through a long drive and yielded grudgingly. OF A REVOLUTION moved off the inside bumping DEAN DELIVERS lightly early, then went back to the rail,
cut the corner rallying to loom a threat inside the leading trio turning for home, then flattened out through the final furlong while clearly best of the remainder.
IN DREAMS set a sharp pace for a half, came two wide off the turn feeling the effects of his early efforts, and surrendered to challengers from both flanks.
GRAPHIC DETAIL broke a step slow, and never reached contention. MR. BOUMA chased the pace two to three wide, and stopped after a half-mile.

leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. DREAM OF A DAY broke inwardly and pushed the winner to ANKARA at the start, settled off the
pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch, was unable to match strides with the winner from the
sixteenth pole, came in a bit nearing the wire pushing MY ROMEO LIMA into ALLEGORICAL and GRAND DAVID in the final strides. MY ROMEO LIMA
broke inwardly and bumped STRONG LIGHT at the start then ALLEGORICAL a few strides later, prompted the pace three wide, dueled three deep around
the far turn, battled on between foes through the lane and was bumped between rivals in the final strides. GRAND DAVID engaged in a protracted duel
inside of multiple foes to deep stretch and was bumped late. KHUFU bobbled at the start, tracked the pace from the rail, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth
pole but was outkicked. ALLEGORICAL was bumped soon after the start, dueled two wide between foes to deep stretch then was bumped between foes in
the final strides. REMOTE was in range while racing two wide between foes, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. TAP THE GAVEL
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. ONCE A GIANT chased the pace three wide between foes and faded in the lane. STRONG LIGHT was
bumped and squeezed back at the start, saved ground off the pace, checked off heels early on the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far

Footnotes
GRAND SONATA saved ground around the first turn and settled nicely stalking the pace up the backstretch, was patiently handled around the far turn,
tipped out approaching the upper stretch, lacked racing room, continued boxed in, came under left-handed pressure in the final furlong, shifted out, got
clear, surged to the wire and got up in time. ROYAL SPIRIT was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved
up two wide to engage COINAGE for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled into the lane, dug in gamely under strong handling, shook free, led in final stages
and got caught in final stride. COINAGE took command soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace and saved ground up the
backstretch, took on the challenge from ROYAL SPIRIT late on the far turn, fought back gamely into the final furlong then yielded late. ELDON'S PRINCE
was allowed to settle in the back and save ground through early stages, picked up the pace late on the far turn, was ridden along four to five wide into the
upper stretch, got carried out wider in the final furlong and had a mild improve. RED DANGER raced two to three wide off the early pace, given cue three to
four wide into the upper stretch, edged a bit closer then got carried out wider in the final furlong and finished evenly. SPEAKING SCOUT tracked in good
position up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, moved up into strong contention, sustained bid into the final furlong then
flattened out. FATHER GLADO rated off the early pace while never too far back, was ridden along two wide through the far turn and failed to kick on. RED
KNOBS secured inside position around the first turn and settled off the second flight up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the far
turn and faded in the lane. RUN UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE

GIRL WITH A DREAM broke inward nudging RADIO DAYS over to DISCO EBO, quickly took control and ambled along through a moderate opening
quarter, was roused into the stretch to maintain the advantage, and responded to turn back RADIO DAYS under a drive. RADIO DAYS was nudged toward
DISCO EBO at the break and was slow into stride, began to advance outside after a half-mile while already under strong urging, had aim outside the leader
into the lane but settled for second best. LAST LEAF briefly lost her footing at the break, trailed inside for a half, moved out four wide finding stride
approaching the stretch, rallied into third through the furlong grounds but could do no more. DIAMOND WOW pursued outside GIRL WITH A DREAM for a
half-mile, and weakened. GREATITUDE raced two wide around the turn, and tired through the stretch inside. SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL showed brief speed
inside, was through before reaching the stretch, and was eased up to the finish. DISCO EBO got brushed at the start and was a step slow, moved up a bit
under urging three wide into the turn, had nothing left after a half and jogged in.

lane, kicked clear past the furlong marker and held firm under left-handed pressure. AMBITIEUSE secured inside position around the first turn and settled

MISS YOU ELLA settled and angled inside soon after the start, rated two wide off the early pace, angled out and headed in pursuit late on the far turn, got
carried out wide into the lane, responded under strong handling and finished well to prevail for a share. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER cleared on top and
angled inside soon after the start, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, continued to hold firm around the far turn then got collared by
the winner past the furlong marker and gave way. BATTLE CHARGE tracked the clear top two leaders up the backstretch, was ridden inside late on the far
turn, tipped four wide for the drive and ran on evenly. OCEAN SAFARI was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch,

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO broke alertly and tracked outside GALT early, edged closer to the leader after a half-mile while well clear of the rest of the field, wrested
command just after completing six furlongs, moved inside drawing clear and widened under steady urging. SIMPLIFICATION was tossing his head around
as the gates opened and was last away, advanced gradually through the middle stages three then four wide, rallied into second after straightening away for
the drive, stayed on his left lead and just saved the place. MO DONEGAL broke slowly, saved ground recovering to midpack early, moved out four wide
idling a bit under pressure approaching the stretch, had a mild late surge on the far outside and just missed the runner-up spot. GALT found himself on a
clear early lead after a sharp start, felt increasing pressure from WHITE ABARRIO after a half-mile, could not withstand that rival after six furlongs, and
weakened through the lane. CAJUN'S MAGIC stayed in range near the inside to the far turn, shifted out three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed
closing response. SPIN WHEEL was four wide at the back going to the first turn, moved inside approaching the stretch while still well out of it, and made no
headway. TIZ THE BOMB raced two wide and out of contention early, and had no apparent mishaps. GIANT GAME advanced mildly three wide being
scrubbed along midway on the far turn,, and was empty after six furlongs. ELOQUIST dropped far back inside after six furlongs, and jogged in.
