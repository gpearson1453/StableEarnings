Footnotes
MISS GETTY UP not far back to turn, angled out, went clear while gathered up late in an impressive effort. LUCKY SHORE broke slow, far back to turn,
rallied outside for place no match for the winner. BIA BOLT RUNNER unhurried to the turn, rallied outside, outfinished for place. NINJA KITTEN speed
outside, dueled to turn, weakened in the drive. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE close up inside, blocked into turn, nothing left in the drive. MAOILIN broke sharp
outside, could not keep up, never factored. SWEET SPIN never factored at any pole. LOST WISH speed outside to the turn, gave way into the stretch run.
REMEMBRANCE slow start, troubled quarter pole never a factor. CANDYCREAM through early, dropped back. BETHY sharp speed outside to the half,
gave way readily in the stretch. Internal fraction was unavailable due to timer malfunction. Final time was correct.
