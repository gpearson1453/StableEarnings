Footnotes
PHAROAH CAT was rated between foes in the opening stage, advanced pressing the pace between rivals into the turn gaining a narrow advantage after a
half, went clear in upper stretch and just maintained the advantage under firm handling. AMERICAN DOLLAR was urged rivals disputing the pace a bit off
the rail in early stages, lost some ground to the winner racing into the lane, switched out racing through the stretch while continuing willingly to close the gap
late, then was vanned off the course following the race. M V SPEED, forwardly placed along the inside racing just off the first flight into the turn, shifted to
the four path racing into upper stretch and continued to gain some position. MANUKA BOBBY settled last along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch
and continued with an effort to improve position. GIOVANE'S PROMISE, in touch with the leaders five wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace three
wide into the turn and came up empty in the drive. O DANNY BOY flashed brief pace four wide between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MS. MALEVOLENCE broke outwards making some contact with ME SAY SO, was righted to track just off the pacesetter along the inside racing through the
backstretch, responded when given her cue to advance inside that foe approaching upper stretch, shifted off the inside and quickly took charge racing
through the stretch while being kept to firm right handed pressure. CSILLA broke inwards bumping ME SAY SO soundly at the start, was righted to track just
off the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn, tipped out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors.
ROYAL ATHENA sped clear of the field while angling over in the opening stages, dictated the pace a bit off the rail through the backstretch into the turn,
proved no match when confronted by the winner and faded to lose second late. HENNI PENNY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground
to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. MANGROVE MAMMA was rated outside foes dropping back off the second flight on the
backstretch, was prompted to make brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the turn but had no closing response. ME SAY SO, bumped from both sides,
then squeezed back at the start, settled between foes off the second flight racing to the turn but lacked a rally. SO MOXIE was a brief factor three deep
prompting the pacesetter to the turn but gave way after a half.

ORNERY ANGEL tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, advanced on that rival with
a sharp move to bid for command in the four path nearing upper stretch, took over while shifting inwards entering the land and kicked away from her rivals
late under firm left handed encouragement. BIONIC BOTTLE was hustled to the lead racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, briefly resisted the
winner's challenge racing into upper stretch but proved no match approaching the furlong marker while best of the others. TALE OF V K tracked the leaders
along the inside from behind the second flight in early stages, tipped out racing through the turn to race in the three path entering the lane and continued
with interest to gain some position between foes while earning a share. TAMIAMI settled last while angling out five wide racing through the backstretch,
continued in that path into the stretch and passed only tiring rivals. SALSA RITA was urged pursuing the pacesetter between foes through the backstretch
into the turn and gave way into entering upper stretch. PEACEFUL WAY angled inwards tracking the pacesetter just off the inside racing into the turn,
shifted to the rail nearing upper stretch and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
UPPER SPEED DS tipped off the inside racing to the backstretch tracking well off the first flight, angled outside rivals approaching the far turn while being
prompted to advance, continued four wide into the lane while gradually gaining terms with the pacesetter and edged forward of that rival in the closing
stages under firm right handed encouragement. PURTIZ, restless in the gate prior to the start, broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace
on a narrow advantage, resisted several challenges to maintain the advantage into the stretch but proved only second best in the drive. BUNNY PRINCESS
tracked off the first flight just outside the eventual winner racing in the three path to the backstretch, angled nearer the inside after a half, steadily gained
position inside foes on the far turn, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch, then raced in hand awaiting an opening between foes, altered course to
the five path in the closing stages and continued with interest to close the gap on the top pair. MAY BEAU angled to the inside early dropping off the second
flight, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and finished evenly inside rivals late. ADRIANA ES BONITA, urged between foes prompting the
pace from the outset, was eased off the leaders entering the backstretch to track those foes, shifted out three deep nearing the second bend while moving
to press the issue, continued in that path to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. KATY AND EMMA broke awkwardly, then was steadied
off rivals dropping out last to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half while being prompted to advance three deep on the far turn but had no
closing bid. GEE GEE'S CURLIN, urged three deep prompting the pace into the first turn, continued outside a rival on the backstretch, pressed the issue
between foes into the second bend and gave way nearing the lane. LYING KAREN, off slowly, was settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no
threat.

Footnotes
D'CRAZINESS was rated between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out to the three path on the far turn commencing a
steady advance, rallied to gain the lead in that path nearing midstretch and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. MARV'S MAGIC settled
behind the second flight while angling to the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out three wide racing through the lane to prove best of
the others. FIG JELLY, in touch with a rival along the inside prompting the pace while under light rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the
far turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but gave out once headed by the winner. NINJA DUST was rated inside foes as
part of the second flight in the opening half, shifted out nearing upper stretch to advance four wide, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued to
gain some position with a mild bid. THANK YOU RICKETTS was settled last racing to the far turn, switched out nearing the lane, was fanned six wide in the
closing stages but displayed some belated interest. MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dueled
for command pressing the issue to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. SNAP HOOK tracked the leaders three deep, then four wide as part
of the second flight racing into the backstretch, angled inwards in the closing stages but made no real impression. BALISTICO, pulled a bit in early stages
while being rated well off the first flight tracking those rivals into the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the lane, shifted out four wide
approaching upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. BANGOR RIDGE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
EYE ON THE CANDY broke readily, angled inwards leaving the chute dictating the pace on a narrow advantage just off the inside, met the challenge of EL
FANTASMA racing into the turn, turned back that rival racing past midstretch and edged clear late under energetic handling. STREET LAMP tracked just off
the leaders four wide in the opening stages, conceded some position while angling inwards nearing the turn, then continued willingly three deep between
foes into the stretch to prevail for the place honors late. TEMPESTUOUS switched outside the leaders on the backstretch tracking just off the first flight,
continued in pursuit of those foes three wide, then four wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. EL FANTASMA
angled to the inside prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, dueled for command through the turn into upper stretch but weakened in late stages.
THEJIGISUP tracked the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking distance early, angled to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground to the lane but had
no closing bid. INDIYS TREASURE dropped out early.

Footnotes
GREAT BRITAIN broke readily, was rated tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on that foe
racing through the far turn to wrest the advantage racing through upper stretch, then went well clear late under right handed pressure and firm handling.
PAPI BELLO settled between foes, then along the inside dropping well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside racing through the
far turn, swung five wide entering the stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. ORIGO tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight in the opening half, advanced three deep entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid outside the winner nearing the lane but lacked the needed
late kick. GENERAL COMMAND broke sharply, sprinted well clear along the rail to the backstretch, set the pace into the second bend and gave out once
headed by the winner. SHINBORO settled outside foes dropping off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to make brief progress four wide
nearing the far turn but had no closing bid. WILD IRISHMAN settled last to the backstretch, swung outside foes entering the lane but passed only tiring
rivals. JUST SO YA KNOW hopped a bit at the start, was held up in close quarters along the inside in early stages and never proved a serious threat. GIVE
IT A GO angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. AFIKOMAN tracked the
leaders three deep between foes in second flight to the backstretch, then steadily faded into the far turn. THE DUNGEON settled outside foes racing three,
then four deep to the backstretch and dropped back early.

Footnotes
KIGER was rated in early stages dropping off the second flight, angled inwards nearing the bend while being prompted to advance, split rivals on the turn
racing just off the inside, bid inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage in the closing stages under firm handling to
prevail. CORT'N ASONG tipped out in the opening stages while being prompted to a forward placing between foes bumping HIMELSTEIN, moved to press
the pace between foes racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid racing past midstretch but
proved only second best. TAPSOLUTE tracked the leaders five wide in second flight on the backstretch, shifted inwards approaching the bend exchanging
some contact with NICK THE CARDSHARK, continued in pursuit of the leaders four wide through the turn to upper stretch and finished evenly late while
prevailing for a share. HIMELSTEIN, prompted to a forward placing just outside the pacesetter, was bumped by CORT'N ASONG midway through the
backstretch, was urged to press the issue three wide between foes into the turn, couldn't match the leaders after four and a half furlongs, shifted inwards
racing into upper stretch, then weakened. DOODLE HOPPER settled between foes in the last flight early, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but
offered no rally. NICK THE CARDSHARK tracked just off the leaders four wide between foes on the backstretch, was bumped nearing the turn while quickly
losing ground to the first flight and emptied out early racing five wide to the lane. INDY RIDE, off a bit slowly, tracked the leaders along the inside early, was
prompted to advance racing into the bend but lacked the needed closing response. CHILL HAZE, urged to the lead while angling sharply to the inside in the
opening quarter, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way abruptly after a half. YAK was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JEFF'S ANGEL broke inwards bumping JEWEL OF WINTER while also exchanging some contact with MISSPOKEN, was righted quickly, then angled to
the rail racing through the chute to track just off the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, switched out, then swung four wide
leaving midstretch and produced a solid closing response to just wrest the advantage in time under strong handling. JUDGE JUDITH broke readily, sped to
the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge while shifting out
racing into the stretch to regain a clear advantage nearing the furlong marker but just failed to contain the winner. LIBERTALIA, restless in the gate prior to
the start, was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to press the issue outside that foe racing through the far turn, was carried
out to the three path while failing to match that foe in upper stretch but kept on in that path between rivals to close the gap while prevailing for a share.
MAGIC MIKAELA angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, advanced along the rail racing into upper stretch but was
outkicked by the top trio. MISSPOKEN bobbled, then exchanged bumps with the eventual winner at the start, was righted to track the leaders outside a rival
in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. RACHEL DREAM angled inwards in early stages to track off the second flight between
foes, was bumped midway through the backstretch by MALIBY SKY and offered no rally. A TOUCH OF SPADGET, reserved inside foes racing to the
backstretch, never gained contention. MALIBU SKY, held up between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards after a half making
contact with RACHEL'S DREAM and had no closinge response. JEWEL OF WINTER hopped at the start, then was bumped by the eventual winner losing
position at the start, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.
