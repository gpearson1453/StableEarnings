Footnotes
BAZINGA C set the early pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths pole, then was resurgent in the furlong grounds to edge clear
under a drive. MY DIXIE LASS was well rated early on the inside, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and gained a short advantage by the furlong
marker but hung in the final furlong, second best. DETERMINED TRUTH stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and was
between rivals by the quarter pole but weakened, held show award. ISTHATYOURHARLEY was reserved early, then advanced two wide on the turn and
shifted out four wide in the drive and had no rally while just missing the show award. J M R GEMMA broke outwardly at the start, then was void of any speed
and was not a factor. SHASHKA chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.

COUNTESS SHANAKILL was bumped at the start, then was reserved two wide, advanced on the turn and eased out four wide nearing the quarter pole for
racing room, continued that bid and drew off in the furlong grounds under mild right handed crop urging. DASHI was allowed to settle early and advanced on
the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside in the stretch and was up for the place award. WARRIOR'S BLADE tracked the early pace and tipped out three
wide leaving the turn but lacked the needed winning bid while just missing the place award. ARTEMIS RISING was away alertly and was soon clear and
crossed over to the inside, then was headed leaving the furlong marker and weakened. DOCS WAY was reserved early in between rivals and lacked a rally.
SUNSHINE BAY had no rally. LA DAME tracked the pace three wide and weakened. FAIRFIELD had no response while four wide.

BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn and slowly edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a
drive. NORA RADD set the early pace while clear and off the inside, came three wide into the lane and could not hold off the winner late while lasting for the
place award. QUEEN'S DREAM chased the early pace three wide, then came two wide into the drive and closed well late between horses to just miss the
place award. MELODIOUS SINGER stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out. BALI broke in a tangle and
was very slow into stride, was not a factor. SMOKIN CLASS chased the pace five wide and weakened.

wide bid leaving the turn, vied for command by the furlong marker and led late, but was denied late to just miss. SEEKING THE DREAM pressed the early
pace and made a three wide bid to duel for command by the quarter pole, then vied for the lead by the furlong marker and was outfinished late. MIDTOWN
ROSE set a pressured early pace towards the inside, then kept on to the wire while giving way grudgingly. TANYA'S GEM chased the early pace four wide,
then shifted towards the inside leaving the turn and faded. S W BRIAR ROSE bobbled at the start, then was guided to the outside and had no rally.

VOUCH vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid to draw off on the turn, then remained clear to prove best under left handed urging. THOMAS KNIGHT
was well rated early towards the inside, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, but could not gain on the winner late, clearly seocnd best. THE
BEST CANDY was allowed to settle three wide, advanced three wide on the turn but finished evenly late, bested rest. MAIN COOL CAT was void of early
speed, saved ground on the turn and angled out in the stretch to have a belated rally for the minor rewards. CATTLE DRIVE was settled back early, then
was five wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. SACRED MOUNTAIN was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a late response. SMART TWO A T
was off a step slow, then raced four wide on the backstretch and had no response. DEVINE DENTAL vied for the lead three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
HERE'S WALDO dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, then held on gamely late to prove best under a drive. E
T'S CANDY MAN was allowed to settle early, made a six wide move by the quarter pole, then closed well on the outside to just miss. GALILEE chased the
early pace two wide, made a five wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive, bested rest. ZILLION was bumped at the start, then saved
ground to the quarter pole and swung out six wide leaving the turn but had no kick. SUNSHINE MAX stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the
turn but came up empty in the drive. MO CRAZY BLUES dueled for the early lead three wide and weakened. GET DOWN BROWN pressed the early pace
in between rivals and weakened. DOMINANT FACTOR had a wide trip while being dull.
