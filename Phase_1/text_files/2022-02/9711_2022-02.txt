well and asked for speed, outquickened early and had to settle for a inside stalking position, continued to save ground through the turn and entered the
stretch three wide, stayed on ok and edged out late for third. HUMBOLDT off slow and trailed quickly on the backstretch, continued to trail entering the turn
and entered stretch very wide, showed mild late progress to split the field. INNATE chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued in chase
mode through the turn, in range in upper stretch and when prompted began to weaken in the final sixteenth. WILLIS settled off the pace two wide on the
