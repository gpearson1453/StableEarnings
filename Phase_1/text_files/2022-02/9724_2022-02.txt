Footnotes
COMMISSIONER DAVID got away alertly, attended the pace from outside, moved clear three wide midway on the turn, drew off in the stretch under
moderate hand urging early then in hand late. EL GRAPPLER was outpaced early, moved out from three to five wide on the turn beginning to pick it up,
improved position in the stretch while no match for the winner. FORT STANTON SCOUT exchanged a very light brush at the break then was urged forward
inside, dueled inside the eventual winner, switched out once in upper stretch and had no extra. ROLLIN IN DIAMONDS chased mid-pack three to four wide,
was not a threat. STORM THE FIRE steadied early as a rival moved in while clear and in front, dropped back heading into the turn, went two to three wide
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BONFIRE PARTY broke outwardly, dueled inside a rival but off the fence, went in the two to three path through the turn, faced inside and outside
challengers but dug in to hold sway. ARTILLERY MAN dueled outside the winner going three to four wide, kept on late to re-take the place. GO RED
RASCAL tracked the leading pair, bid inside in upper- to mid-stretch but evened out late. KISS ME D ORO settled off the leaders inside racing on or just off
the rail, came out in the stretch and ran on mildly. HOT CHARLIE chased three to four wide, asked for more early on the turn, moved out six wide turning for
home and ran on evenly. B A CHAMPION broke a bit awkwardly and was in a little tight, trailed about in the three path into the turn, swung eight deep
leaving that bend and was not a threat. MAJORWAYHOME was outside three to four wide, shifted seven deep at the top of the stretch and failed to
menace. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
ICY CAPE pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up and held. LONG RANGER was allowed to settle
early, raced six wide into the turn, was closing late and just missed. PREMEDITATED LILY tracked the early pace, angled in and was along for third. FEEL
THIS MOMENT set a pressured early pace from off the rail and faded. ATTACKING GIRL was void of any early speed from the inside and passed tired
rivals. MARIA'S TOWER was unhurried early, raced seven wide and offered no late rally. HOMEMADE LOVIN was outrun early and was no factor. POW
WOW was reserved early from the inside and tired.
