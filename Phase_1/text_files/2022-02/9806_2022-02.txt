CROOKHAVEN LASS settled off the pace, closed willingly and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. SOUTHERN VENTURE bumped at the
start, led to the turn, dueled through the stretch and was caught near the wire. TOTHEMOONANDBACK came in at the start, challenged for the lead on the
turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. BLUE GESSAMI broke in, bumped and was checked at the start, raced in the back,
went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. AVABELL bumped at the start, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a
bid. The rider of BLUE GESSAMI claimed foul against the rider of TOTHEMOONANDBACK for alleged interference at the start. No change was made.

SILLY NOTION raced close to the pace, moved up between horses to assume command, drew off entering the stretch and extended the lead under mild
urging. SHES GOT THE POWER was never far back, saved ground, bid willingly, hung late and was no match for the winner. DODROPIN raced outside,
challenged for the lead along the backstretch, fell back leaving the turn, leveled off and settled for show. RATIONAL was void of early speed, offered a mild
bid only and improved position. PRINCESS SOIREE stalked the pace, challenged three wide between horses on the backstretch, weakened and dropped
back. IROQUOIS HEART sprinted clear to set the pace, tired into the turn and was not urged late. JAZZY EINSTEIN was pulled up and vanned off.

sixteenth pole. ALBANY FRONT was never far back, bid three wide between horses to challenged, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was no match late.
KODIAK KING bumped and clipped heels at the start, went six wide leaving the turn, closed well and was vanned off. TEN CARAT ROCK went six wide at
the top of the stretch, lacked a bid and was not a threat. SUNLAND STAR showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. ANGELINO passed tiring
rivals. REGAL CANDY raced inside in an even effort and was outrun. FATS DOMINUS ducked in start and bumped at the start. MOONLIGHT BLUE vied
inside to the second turn, tired and stopped. RUN FOREVER bumped at the start and was through after a half.

FIRST PROMISE vied two across, swung out leaving the turn and drew clear near the sixteenth pole. WORKIN NINETOFIVE stalked the pace while racing
inside, shifted out for the drive, went willingly to the wire and gained late. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL rallied on the turn, went five wide and offered a mild bid
to get up for show. SOLA set a pressured pace and faltered near the sixteenth pole. AUTISM PRISM was outrun in an even effort. SECRET HAVEN was
not a factor. LA CAPRICHOSA was off slowly and trailed the field.
