BULLAWAY broke awkwardly, rushed from the inside, challenged around the far turn and prevailed under all out pressure. SHADY'S TURN was quick, to
begin to set the early pace, raced two to three wide in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. LAST BITA GLITTER chased the top pair, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and was no match for the top pair. DOWNTOWN BROWN dropped back early, raced four wide around the far turn and had no
response. ATWATER was hustled early and never threatened. RHETTROACTIVE was slow early, raced along the inside and never was a factor. The three
eighths fractional time was unavailable.

SHE'S SEVENTEEN was away alertly from the outside to set the early pace and held well in the drive under steady handling. HIGH COST OF LIVIN was
hustled along early, raced two to three wide and finished willingly to the wire. PRINCESS SHAKIRA chased the top pair down the backstretch, checked just
past the quarter pole, angled four wide and closed in well late. JUSTATAPIN stalked the pace, raced five wide around the far turn and had not enough.
HERE AND VOW drifted wide around the far turn, angled in through the upper lane and never threatened. SHELLPHONE raced along the inside and had no
response. NEW YEARS LOVE was off a step slow, raced near the inside and never was a factor.

showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. DANZ A REBEL stalked the
pace, raced three deep and kept on to the wire. LIGHT BOUND BID hopped at the break, moved up three to four wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough. JERRYS PRIDENJOY was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced just off the inside and weakened. TACKSON was allowed to settle early,
raced five wide into the upper stretch had no response. HYPER DRIVE dropped back early, saved ground and had no response. GAMERA broke in the air,
raced towards the inside throughout and never threatened.

Footnotes
JOMO chased the early pace, raced near the inside around the turn, raced three wide and prevailed late under strong pressure. FRONT OFFICE was
hustled throughout, made a good rail bid and just missed. CANTWAITTOGRADUATE quick to begin, was getting out through the far turn and kept on to the
wire. COUNTRY BOY CHARM was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and made a late gain. CRIMSON TRACE was shuffled at the break, raced
along the inside and never was a factor. RISK REVERSAL raced six to seven wide and had not enough in the drive. DIRTY DEEDS was hustled along while
racing between, raced in traffic near the quarter pole and weakened. MY BOY GUS was hustled along and weakened. UNCLE TAP trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MR. WHITE was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced near the rail and held well under strong handling. DUN SOBER was hustled from the outside,
raced two wide in the drive and finished second best. DREAM BABY DREAM chased the early pace, moved up three to four wide and made a good late
gain. CORRANA EN LIMEN stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. EDGE OF ACKWORTH was hustled along, raced
three wide and had no final winning bid. ALL FOR TRUTH raced along the inside had no response. MAYHAWK was shuffled at the break, raced five wide in
the lane and never was a factor. DANCE EVEN raced near the inside and never was a factor. MIDNIGHT DESTINY trailed throughout.
