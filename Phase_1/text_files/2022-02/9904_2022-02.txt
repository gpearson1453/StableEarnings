Footnotes
BARNSTORM was sluggish getting into stride but picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the turn about the five path, closed steadily
outside through the stretch and got up the final strides. COMPANY CLOWN chased toward the inside, eased outward on the turn and entered the stretch in
the five path, dug in for a brief lead late stretch but was caught the final yards. THAT'S HISTORY was hustled to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and set a pressured pace, contested the rail on the turn, dueled clear of Upheaval leaving the eighth pole but was caught flattening stride later yards. ONE
MORE FACTOR pressured the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail, steadied from between horses past the eighth pole but came back
through the stretch and finished well. UPHEAVAL pressured the pace and dueled at even terms two deep most of the turn, but dropped back past the eighth
pole and faded. KUKULKAN chased through the backstretch, started to fade toward the top of the lane, was eased in the final sixteenth, pulled up short past
the wire and walked off while appearing sore.

Footnotes
DIVINE PROPORTION rounded the opening turn in the four path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, drifted
a bit into the stretch, dug in for the lead later yards and was determined to keep the edge over NEW SOUTH, who rated the pace inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled from the head of the lane but reluctantly ceded in later yards.
HURRICANE AMIGO stalked in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back at the rail into the far turn then flattened
stride the final furlong. FAIRPIT drifted and was steadied through the first turn and appeared off stride into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. CLASSIC TUXEDO rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole then weakened near the rail on the far turn. MORNING ARTIE rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase into the
backstretch but weakened approaching the far turn. INSURRECTIONIST hesitated at the break, was eased leaving the first turn and walked off post race.

Footnotes
SUPER JORDAN took a quick lead and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in
under steady encouragement to hold on. LOAD TO FIRE chased toward the outside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished strong while gaining on the
winner. ARE YOU HAPPY chased toward the inside through the backstretch, angled to the five path on the turn then dug in from the head of the stretch to
take the nod for third under the wire. DIVINING DANCER chased off the rail, rounded the turn about the three path and missed the nod in the stretch duel
for third. WALK THE BANK gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. A THOUSAND IDOLS gave chase inside, raced
near the rail on the turn then weakened. FOREST FROST gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn and showed little further. STALKING became fractious
in the gate and was never a factor while saving ground. ALREADY THERE hesitated at the break and never factored.

Footnotes
SO RED THE ROSE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, closed to the lead three wide
approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear in the upper stretch then widened through later yards. SHE FIGURES settled off the rail on the first turn then
eased out with a bid into the backstretch, circled rivals in the five path of the far turn and dug in to take second the final strides. MORTAL STORM stalked
the earlier pace two deep then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth.
MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three and
four paths but flattened stride leaving the sixteenth pole. UPSY DAISY DO saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn near the rail then weakened. ZIG took the lead between horses leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace, contested the edge at the rail
most of the far turn but was caught nearing the head of the lane and weakened the final furlong. I AM I WILL mostly saved ground.

QUID PRO QUO stalked in the three path then took the lead at the three eighths pole, dueled clear toward the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far
turn and was steadily handled through the stretch. RED HOT TODDY was bumped then pinched back at the start and rounded the first turn in the four path,
started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and dueled clear in second inside the sixteenth pole. SMALL PAW rounded
the first turn in the five path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and dug in
to take third inside the sixteenth pole. WHAT AN OX rated the early pace inside, was met and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. FELICIAS CASTLE stalked off the rail then took over at the half mile pole, came under pressure nearing
the seven sixteenths, was caught at the three eighths and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened the final
furlong. SECRET SWIRL broke in to make contact with Red Hot Toddy then settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little further. JUBA JUNIOR saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole but faded into the far turn. GOLDEN METTLE was not a factor. ROCKET BALLAD rounded the first turn in the five path and raced well back.

Footnotes
JUNGLE BEAST raced with the pace inside through the front stretch then took the nod and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly for the nod. ROAD PARTY raced with the pace and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, contested
at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES rounded the first turn in the four path and settled
off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, angled outward past the eighth pole then
flattened the final sixteenth. STORMIN ROCKET saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the
three path, but showed little in the lane. BLUE N GOLD raced off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, then flattened in the three path of the far turn. SEXY CHOCOLATTE moved to the inside on the first turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, though, faded past the three eighths. PENGUIN PARADE was not a factor. WINDSORS TAIL entered the first turn in the five path, was taken up with a
fatal injury leaving the turn and had to be euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
WEAVINTHEBLOCKS ran in the four path on the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far
turn, dug in for the lead toward mid-stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. PONTICELLO rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, continued in the three path most of the far turn but angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and dug in to
take second late yards. WEAVE IT QUIXOTE took over at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the
five sixteenths, held the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in to steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught toward the sixteenth pole,
flattened stride and just lasted in third. MINDYOURPSANDQS settled inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, ran at the
rail on the far turn, eased out past the eighth pole and was gaining on third. ROCK FILE rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced well back
leaving the turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, had range on the leaders in the four path of the far turn, was carried to the six path toward
the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. BLUE COLLAR BOY saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. MIKI dwelt at the break and mostly saved ground. NORMANDY'S
EMPIRE was through early.
