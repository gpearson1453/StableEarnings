MAJESTIC SKY controlled the pace, remained clear and widened through the stretch when being geared down late. CALLMETHEBREEZE went after the
winner before half a mile, proved no match but was easily second best. BOOK OF DELANCEY settled outside then remained wide with only a mild rally.
ORACABESSA saved ground in closest pursuit then faded on the final turn. PREFONTAINE chased along the inside and gave way readily. GO SKIPPY GO
dropped back early and was always outrun. SLAM BANG lagged far behind and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL GEM vied two wide in the early stages, then set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the turn, responded when roused in upper stretch, drew
clear and was kept to the task. GYPSY JANIE showed good speed outside, bid two wide on the turn, dueled briefly, then dug in gamely in the stretch run,
but second best. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and got third. J J LOVES
BILLY raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly near the inside in the final sixteenth. MORISSETTE was steadied at the start, raced off the pace
inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MRS. CREWS raced close up early on the rail, then chased inside and tired. SPECIAL RISK raced
off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten.

I'LL MAKE IT COACH settled well behind, advanced inside, angled out at the quarter pole, edged clear and remained safe. SHARON'S LAW hustled to the
lead inside, pulled clear before the half, was collared into the stretch but offered a game try. MISQUILLO lagged far behind then closed the gap without
threatening. RELENTLESS RUBY angled inside down the backstretch, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. GOING GOING GONE prompted the pace
between rivals and was finished by the far turn. BEYOND A MILLION was urged close up three wide and gave way after half a mile.

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE stalked the dueling leaders, moved up on her own to challenge while three wide, took charge on the turn, moved clear, pulled away
under some mild urging, then widened in hand and was geared down late. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the backside, bid
three wide on the turn, chased the winner, could not threaten that rival, then dug in late to save the place spot. SUGAR STREAK raced two wide off the
pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and missed for second. HOLMDEL PARK dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn
and tired. SOUR MASH dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and faded. NURSE RACHETT bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, did
not factor and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
VINE JET vied inside, eased back before half a mile, angled out, rallied, led at the top of the stretch then drew away in the final furlong. NIMITZ vied in the
two path then led inside, was collared into the stretch, held gamely then steadied while tiring inside the winner. UNCLE IRISH settled off the pace, steadied
between foes on the final turn and was no match for the top pair. UNDERCOVER KITTY saved ground throughout, was asked for run on the final turn but
proved empty. EGOT A POKER FACE earned a narrow advantage outside early then gave way. SOUTHERN RUNNER dropped back after the start and
was always outrun.
