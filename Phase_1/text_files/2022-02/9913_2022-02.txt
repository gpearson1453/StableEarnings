SACHEM had an awkward start, steady advance with a methodical run outside to get up in time on wire. HEY BABE pressed pace from two path, short lead
stretch, outgamed to wire. HARVEY'S PRINCESS unhurried while never far back, raced along for show spot. COURTING WAR inside speed to the front,
stayed game to deep stretch but faltered late. FORGOT PASSWORD unhurried early from outside to far turn, never really threatened. BLUEWATER LADY
bit tardy from gate, rushed while close up to far turn, gave way. HAIL TO HELEN within striking distance to far turn, could not go on and faded. TAKE A
PEAK close up between horses to the half but gave way readily.

UNDERDRESSED secured perfect position to far turn, rallied five-six wide into the stretch and was ridden out well clear in the final furlong as tons the best.
CABANA TIME off rail chase throughout while proving no match for winner in stretch while holding the place spot. OLD BEAU chased leader between
horses to far turn, gained short lead but stopped in the stretch. AFTERMATH pinched back at the start and, improved position only while no real threat.
STORM ATTACK set pace to far turn, could not keep up and stopped in the stretch. MIGHTY CRAIC was reluctant to load, raced evenly to stretch and gave
way readily. EMPIRE JAX tried to keep for a half but gave way with little resistance.

Footnotes
HANDCARVED quick to the front, set all pace, kept to task in upper stretch to prove much the best. SPRINKLEHEAD tracked inside to turn, ran on chasing
winner home while no match. BABYLON had an awkward start while unhurried to turn with a four wide run into stretch for show spot. LOFTY
ADJUDICATOR had an awkward start, no speed to stretch with an outside run to improve late. POUR ME A DOUBLE chased winner to stretch but gave
way willingly in the drive. LOVE THAT WIND inside run to stretch and gave way in the drive readily. FIRST CROWNED tracked from inside to turn, dropped
far back with nothing left.

Footnotes
POWERFUL POINT was antsy in the gate, broke well, settled in, took over far turn and ran off as much the best. MYSTIC KAT inside run to far turn, rallied
into stretch while no match late. MEMPHIS PRAYER bobbled after start, regrouped quickly, rallied into far turn, kept on in the stretch for show spot in a
good effort. CANDY CURL good position inside, bolted far turn, regrouped quickly and came back wide to improve. SONIC BURN failed to seriously
menace throughout. PERFECT PAINTING dueled leader to quarter pole but used up and gave way in the stretch. DO YOUR BEST never menaced
throughout. BLIND JUSTICE never factored. G FOR GERRY bore out at the start, rushed to good position to the half but gave way while used up. AMES
MISTER inside speed to the front, led to quarter pole but stopped readily.
