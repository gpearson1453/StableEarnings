the pace into the stretch, rallied late four wide and got up for second. JACK BE FAST broke in front, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then was
outfinished two wide. CAPTAIN RILEY stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the furlong marker then leveled off. MOBIL AT
LAST swung wide and was no threat. INSPIRED TO ROCK was no factor. MA MOO POWER was hung four wide through the clubhouse turn, advanced
before a half, had speed into the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
LA MUNECA broke in full stride and quickly opened a daylight lead, set all the pace and just lasted under right handed urging. CEVICHE chased the winner
into the stretch, dug in through the final sixteenth and just missed getting up in time two wide. BLAZING ZENNA saved ground into the turn, shifted out
nearing the quarter pole and closed a gap late. NATALIA'S TEMPLE passed tiring rivals. SIMONELA well placed, failed to respond. MRS. ROBINSON was
no threat.

Footnotes
JOYA BRILLANTE prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while being
ridden out. ABERRATION made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second.
STYLISH RAGS settled in a stalking position and lacked the needed response. MY ANGELICA failed to menace. ROMANTICAL NOTE was outrun. ESTILO
ELEGANTE was no threat.
