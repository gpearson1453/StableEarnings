Footnotes
ES IS I LIKE IT set the pace racing off the rail, went in the two path through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, held under steady handling. INDY GAL
DORO broke just a half-step slowly, settled in behind the leaders off the inside, swung six wide turning for home, was gaining but too late. D T R
DEBUTANTE chased inside, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. HAVING MORE FUN chased four to five wide,
weakened. DIAMOND ONTHE TOE lacked early speed, went in about the three path through most of the turn moving nearer the rail leaving that bend,
failed to rally. JAZZY RED raced outside, dropped back five to seven wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
QUIEN ES stalked the early pace, moved to challenge on the turn racing three to four wide and between foes on that bend, struck a narrow lead in upper
stretch and held sway under steady handling. SALTIE FIRE advanced four to five wide on the turn, was within striking distance coming to the furlong marker
but could not sustain the effort. BISCUIT SNATCHER set the pace racing off the rail in the two to three path, weakened. MEGA SOURCE raced in behind
the leaders in the two to three path on the turn, failed to rally. TRUMP RIDE reared at the start then lost footing, spotting the field about six lengths, failed to
threaten while racing inside. WISKEY CROWN stumbled at the start losing the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

went four wide into the turn, opened up, couldn't hold and finished second best. IMAGINARY RIDE was void of any early speed, advanced seven wide
through the turn and was along for third. DANIEL'S GIRL was unhurried early, raced along the inside and offered no late rally. OKIE CITY pressed the early
pace, raced between rivals and faded.
