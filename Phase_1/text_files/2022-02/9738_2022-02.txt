MOLLI WAY vied for the early lead, came around the turn three wide, took the lead, drove clear and was kept to the task. NONEYA broke a step slow,
quickly moved up within contention, came around the turn four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second, finishing willingly. VALID
BREAK raced within striking distance, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. GOODBYE GREELEY dueled on the front
end, weakened and was caught for third. LATER LATERTIFFANY lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, improved position, but was no factor. IN
FOR A PENNY raced evenly near the back and showed little. ROUX BANDIT challenged for the early advantage and faded. LOCO POCO void of early
speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
TWO MIKES N DOC G lacked early speed, moved up five wide around the second turn, made a wide bid and got up late. JAZZ IT UP went to the front
drove clear, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. HARDCORE FOLKLORE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the
final turn, made a rail bid, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. MUSCADINE raced near the back in the early part, came around
the first turn on the outside, moved up, within contention and finished evenly. UNION RIDE pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and faded.
HERE COMES MAGIC raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn six wide and finished evenly. COMMANDER SCOTT raced within
striking distance, checked around the second turn, getting in tight quarters and dropped back. TOE BANDIT broke open his gate before the start, raced in
the rear, had a wide trip and was never close. GREY ROGUE dueled for the early lead and was finished early.

the end. SHADY GRADY went to the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. MORO PHAROAH raced within striking
distance, had an outside trip and proved no match for the top two. GENERAL EISENHOWER raced within contention, weakened, finished evenly and
lacked a bid. MY BOY SAM pressed the early pace and faded. PRIORITY POINTS lacked early speed and passed tired ones. MACHO BOB vied for the
early lead and dropped back. MAJOR FREAK raced near the back and showed little. BIT PART always raced near the back, had a wide trip and was outrun.
