Footnotes
GALLANT OAK was away alertly and was sent to set the pace to the turn, shook clear of NISHICO along the bend, opened the lead into the final furlong
and drew clear in the late stages. MILEYS BLUECAT stalked the pace from the midflight to the turn, chased GALLANT OAK into the final furlong and was
no match for the winner in the end but kept on to secure second. CREATIVE ONE settled off of the early pace, improved position while three wide on the
turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch to be an easy third. ENJOY IT STRAIT hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, was steered outside of
rivals on the turn while chasing the pace and while on the left lead in the stretch did not mount a final late bid. NISHICO was hustled along to press the pace
to the turn, lost ground along the bend and into the stretch run and tired in the final stages. I GOT SPEED chased the fractions from an inside position
through the turn, steadied off of heels in tight quarters nearing the quarter-marker, angled out for the drive and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
JUMPING JILL FLASH tracked the pace to the turn while outside of foes, mounted a steady three wide bid leaving the turn to come within aim and made a
late push in the end to tag SHARP CURVE in the final strides for the win. SHARP CURVE took command of the pace into the turn while being pressured,
was able to edge away from the pressing rivals into the turn, was tiring in the final stages, was firmly urged while under pressure in the final sixteenth and
was tagged in the final strides for the win while holding for second. BIG AL'S PRINCESS was away alertly, pressed the pace to the turn while two wide
between rivals, lost ground leaving the turn, was firmly urged through the drive while making up ground in the end and was outfinished in the late stages
while clear for third. SASSY EINSTEIN was away slowly and was slow into stride in the early going, showed no speed through the turn, mounted a late rally
in the final furlong but was unable to impact the top three. UNAFIESTAPARATODOS veered in at the start, was off slowly and spotted the field several
lengths, angled to the inside for the run along the turn and closed on the leaders in the final sixteenth but could not reel them in.

Footnotes
EVENEREVENWORSE was off alertly, was sent to set fast fractions through the turn and edged clear in the final stages. MINOSO saved ground while
tracking the pace through the turn, closed along the inside through the stretch run and could not reel in the winner but bested the rest in the end. EROTIC
stalked the pace from the midflight while two wide on the turn, gained ground nearing the furlong grounds, was bothered by MCGEORGE when that rival
attempted to split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in the end while holding for third. SURPLUS tracked the fast early pace from a two
wide path through the turn, was still within aim approaching the furlong grounds but was tiring in the final stages, drifted out a path nearing the
sixteenth-marker and weakened in the late going. MCGEORGE settled off of the quick early pace while saving ground, improved position off of the turn,
attempted to split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker, took up when that hole quickly closed and did not offer a late rally. STONE GROOVE was hustled to
track the pace to the turn while outside of foes, lost ground while four wide on the bend and gave way in the late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN MID-STRETCH INVOLVING MCGEORGE AND EROTIC AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

two wide position on the turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken by the winner inside of the furlong grounds and was outfinished in
the late stages while a clear second over the rest. TORREY'S GIRL was sent leaving the break and set fast contested fractions through the turn, came

turn when SQUARED SHADY was steered out in front of her and did not have a late response in the drive.

Footnotes
CLASS CODE was hustled along after the break to dispute the early pace, took command along the backstretch run, steadily opened the lead through the
far turn and into the stretch run and held safely in the end over the closing runner-up. BLUEGRASS SKY was two wide between foes along the first turn,
was coaxed along into the backstretch run to prompt the pace to the second turn, lost ground to CLASS CODE leaving the bend, closed on the winner in the
final stages but could not reel him in while besting the rest. SHANGHAI MIST was off alertly and disputed the early pace with CLASS CODE, conceded the
lead to that rival along the backstretch run, saved ground through the far turn, improved position through the stretch but was outfinished in the end. STEIN'S
GIRL was three wide between rivals on the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn, gained on the leaders in the late stages but was outkicked in the
end. SANDY SUNSHINE bobbled at the start, was unhurried through the early stages and was not a threat. LADY DOC was five wide while close up on the
first turn, took back to stalk the pace to the second turn, maintained a four wide trip on the second turn and faded in the late going.

NOWHERE MAN was pinched at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, was allowed to settle while saving ground through the second turn, was
steered widest of the field into the drive, closed fast in the late stages and was up in time to prevail. PREMIUM FOREST was bumped at the start, settled off
of the pace through the backstretch run, was steered four wide along the far turn, gained ground leaving the bend, took command into the final sixteenth but
was tagged in the final strides by the fast closing winner while clear of the rest. SHOT OF A LIFETIME attended to the pace through the second turn,
improved position to overtake the tiring pacesetter nearing the furlong marker, was caught by PREMIUM FOREST nearing the sixteenth-marker and was
outfinished in the late stages. MULHIMA (IRE) broke in at the start and bumped NOWHERE MAN, saved ground while just off of the pace, mounted an
inside bid nearing the furlong grounds and was outkicked in the final stages. DESERT DUDE tracked the pace while two to three wide in the early stages,
gained ground leaving the far turn and gave way in deep stretch. LORETTA was hustled along to set the pace into the first turn, carved out moderate
fractions to the second turn, was caught approaching the head of the stretch and tired in the late going.

MUSIC FESTIVAL took back just off of the early pace on the first turn, was given her cue to prompt the pace to the second turn, was asked for run
approaching the furlong grounds, quickly overtook the tiring pacesetter and was ridden out in the end as much the best. VINCERO GRANDE stalked the
pace from the midflight to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker while three wide, was outkicked in the stretch run by MUSIC
FESTIVAL but kept on in tight traffic through the final sixteenth to claim the runner-up spot. DASHING DEMI was unhurried through the early stages while
saving ground, improved position while four wide on the second turn, chased the leaders into the final furlong and was outfinished in the end while just
missing for second. AUTISM INNOCENCE was away alertly and cleared the field to set the pace into the first turn, set pedestrian fractions to the second
turn, came under pressure approaching the top of the stretch and weakened in the final stages. ALESHA was allowed to settle in the early stages, gained
ground on the second turn while three wide and did not offer a final bid in the stretch. VAPING ANGEL stalked the pace while saving ground to the
backstretch run, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker, was boxed in in tight quarters approaching the top of the stretch and tired in the late going.

LONG LANCE chased the quick pace to the turn, gained ground from an inside position on the bend, tipped out for the drive, steadily closed on LORD
BRANCUSI in the final furlong and made a late push to get by the runner-up to prevail. LORD BRANCUSI was away alertly, was sent to set quick fractions
through the turn, had a clear lead approaching the furlong grounds, was all out in the final stages, could not hold off LONG LANCE in the end but was well
clear of the rest for the place. OUR BOLD PRINCE chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn, swung widest into the stretch, did not have a late kick
in the final stages but was a clear third. CHIEF JACKSON tracked the fast pace outside of foes on the turn and weakened in the drive. SQUARE DEAL
prompted the fast pace from a two wide position through the turn, lost position into the stretch run and tired in the late going. DEFENSE WINS bobbled at
the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked speed through the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DULCE EMMA saved ground while chasing the fast pace from the midflight, gained ground leaving the turn, confronted JAYS ANGEL inside of the furlong
marker, took command and kicked clear in the end. JAYS ANGEL dueled for pace duties into the turn while carving out fast fractions, shook free of
PRESKITT into the lane, had a clear lead approaching the furlong marker, was confronted by DULCE EMMA inside of the furlong marker and could not hold
the winner off in the end but held for the place over an oncoming rival. RUN FOR MY HONEY lacked early speed into the turn, saved ground along the
bend, shifted out for the stretch run and made a steady late gain to secure the show, while challenging for the place. PRESKITT was off alertly and dueled
on the front end while setting fast fractions through the turn, lost position leaving the turn and weakened in the final stages. MISS IVES was forwardly placed
in the early going, was asked for run leaving the turn and tired in the stretch run. DISTORTED QUEEN tracked the pace outside of rivals and was empty for
the stretch run. BRITTANY BREEZE chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn and gave way in the late stages. ACTION FOR AUTISM bobbled at
the start and was away a step slowly, lacked early speed while outside of foes and was not a factor.
