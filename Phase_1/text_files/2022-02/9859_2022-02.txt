Footnotes
FEELING GRAZEFUL controlled the pace on the inside, took pressure on the second bend but maintained a short lead through the turn, cleared that rival
into the stretch and held well in the late stages. BIG CLARE stalked the pace from inside then two wide leaving the first turn, moved closer leaving the
backstretch, traveled outside the top pair on the far turn, chased the winner through the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. ROSE'S
CRYSTAL brushed the gate and came away a bit slow to begin, steered down to the inside and settled off the pace, swung four wide leaving the far turn,
then closed well to keep gaining on the top pair. NORTHERN GEM stalked in the two path, bid two wide on the far turn, could not keep up with the winner
into the stretch and weakened. I'M A ROCKETTE tracked two wide early, raced outside a rival at the back up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far
turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
ROSENQUIST stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to make a clear lead, inched away on the far turn, padded the lead into the stretch and
held safely to the line. HALFBARBERBINGIE reserved in the early going from inside, angled three wide on the far turn, tipped four wide into the stretch,
summoned a rally but could not threaten the winner. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR stalked the pace from inside, lacked room through the far turn and upper
stretch, steered out into the clear and finished well. WORLD CRUISER was off a bit slow to begin, went two wide around the first turn, checked off heels at
the five-eighths pole, went three wide around the second bend and could not rally. HULK was rank early, went three deep around the clubhouse turn,
stumbled and had the rider lose his irons at the five-eighths pole, finally regain both stirrups near the seven-sixteenths marker, was closest in pursuit in the
two path through the far turn and weakened. GOT CURLY stalked in the two path, a bit off the rail on the second bend and weakened in the drive.
BATUKHAN (IRE) broke a bit slow, raced between foes, was boxed in on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BARRAZA unhurried in the early stages, traveled off the rail, angled out on the turn then got forced eight wide over the dirt crossing, rallied to the front past
the eight pole and won going away. INDIAN PEAK came away slow from outside, tracked three wide on the turn, got forced seven wide over the dirt
crossing, bid four deep in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final sixteenth but bested the rest. BEER CAN MAN stalked up close outside
the leader, moved to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, put in a bid in upper stretch but got outkicked between rivals. BOMBARD
sprinted to clear to take control angled to the inside, led two wide into the lane, clung to a short lead with a furlong remaining, was overtaken shortly after
and got edged for the show honors. BRAN (FR) stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, traveled three wide on the turn, drifted six wide over the dirt crossing,
bid in upper stretch between rivals but flattened out in deep stretch. CHAOS THEORY settled off the pace on the inside, angled out on the turn and failed to
menace. COMMANDER (FR) stumbled leaving the gate, tracked from inside through the turn, chased behind the leader in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. GUILDSMAN (FR) pulled and had to steady off heels early, chased two wide on the turn, dropped back around the bend and came up
empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FLUENT sprinted clear early, opened up around the turn, kept to task with the left-hand in the drive and held safely. GLENALL (IRE) chased outside a pair
of rivals, remained three wide to the stretch, produced a mild rally and got up for second. SCENIC MASTERPIECE was off slow and broke inward, pulled
early along the rail, saved ground inside a pair of rivals on the turn, was closest in pursuit entering the stretch, finished willingly along the fence and got
edged for the place. RUBY RAY broke well, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, chased two wide through the turn and could not rally. ANGEL
NADESHIKO broke slow, sat at the back early on, navigated the turn three wide and never made an impact. DEAR BEAU (IRE) broke slow and was forced
in a bit at the start, raced a bit off the rail into the turn, saved ground around the bend and proved no menace.
