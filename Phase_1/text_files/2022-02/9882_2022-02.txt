ROSA'S SOUL stalked the pace edging closer to loom through the turn into upper stretch bearing down outside the leader giving a final push to be up in the
final strides. DANA'S CONQUEST set a pressured pace through the turn saving ground to upper stretch digging in from the rail ceding grudgingly at the
end. SURPRISED GEM a step slow through the turn came five wide in upper stretch angling in giving a strong finish. JUSTASMALLTOWNGIRL hustled
along on the outside through the turn came four wide down the stretch needing all to hold position. ICY RAIN slow early lagged through the turn losing
ground to upper stretch racing eight wide there. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS chased the pace to upper stretch weakening on the rail. SLOANE NOEL was
never involved. TACK WISE played no factor. JUSTTEQUILATALKIN showed early speed then wavered on the turn giving way abruptly in upper stretch
