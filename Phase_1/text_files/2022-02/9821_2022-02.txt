Footnotes
ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear turning for home and held clear under a steady
drive. SWEET ACTRESS stalked the pace three wide in the clear, bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and
hung. UNMARKED MONEY was bumped nearing the first turn, raced off the pace four wide, chased two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed
rally. BORDEAUX LEGACY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. FAST FASHION set the pace along the rail and gave way readily near the
five-sixteenths. GILDED ASSET bumped with UNMARKED MONEY nearing the first turn, raced three wide around that bend, angled in nearing the far turn
and had no response.

RUNNING MEMORIES sped to the lead soon after the start and held firm around the turn, widened to a clear advantage along the inside and kept to task
under steady encouragement. RICHIES GREAT GIRL was away in good order and raced just off the top trio in opening stages then headed in pursuit
entering the turn, sustained a three wide bid for RUNNING MEMORIES through the lane and cleared second best. DIAL TO WIN was forwardly placed in
opening stages, chased after the eventual winner two wide around the turn, weakened off the top pair in the final furlong but remained well clear over the
rest. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) raced two wide in the last flight, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. PRINCESS CORA
was off a step slow at the start, raced inside in the last flight, came three wide into the lane and never menaced. FOOLISH HEART showed early response
along the rail then steadily faded.

Footnotes
ROAD TO MEATH set the pace two wide for the first mile, moved in around the final turn, drifted out past the sixteenth-pole as the rider switched to
left-hand pressure, and held firm for the decision. YAMATO saved ground through the first two turns, moved out three then four wide leaving the third turn,
finished gamely outside but did not have enough. JIMMY D went along in the two-path for a mile or so, came four wide into the stretch and rallied outside
rivals to pick up the show. AMERICAN NINJA raced close up under a firm hold early inside, came clear in the two-path turning for home the final time, bid
between horses through the furlong grounds, then steadied late behind ROAD TO MEATH losing position. OUTRAGEOUS BET raced three wide, improved
through the middle stages, then flattened out. SURF AND TURF was no factor in the second flight throughout. MERZAZ prompted the pace outside ROAD
TO MEATH, lodged a bid between horses with a quarter-mile remaining, but gave way into the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AMERICAN NINJA AGAINST ROAD TO MEATH, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SPIRIT WIND set the pace along the rail and drew off while always in hand. LONDON LADY chased the pace three wide, was no match for the winner and
churned on for the place. WITH LIBERTY pressed the winner two wide, could not keep pace under heavy pressure from the five-sixteenths and salvaged
the show. KATNISS saved ground and failed to menace. WILDCAT STAR chased the pace in the two path and came up empty in the lane. LIGEIA played
no factor while racing three wide. LITTLE PEARL hit the starting gate and was never involved.

Footnotes
WORLDLY MANNER hustled up out of the gate, took a slim lead and angled inside, continued to set a pressured pace into the stretch run, dug in gamely
two wide under a left-handed drive and held on in final stride. PHILZANO raced two to three wide in range through the turn, moved up into close contact with
the backend of SLIGHTLY FROSTED in the upper stretch, steadied slightly and angled out a path, came back under a drive, steadily inched way up closer
and just missed. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR angled inside soon after the start, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch, took closer contention then
angled to the rail, stayed on with response and captured show. CACHETON pressed the pace around the turn, continued in striking distance in the final
furlong then yielded in deep stretch. BADBADBOBBY raced off the early pace, hustled up four to five wide in the upper stretch, gathered momentum in late
stages and closed willingly. SLIGHTLY FROSTED raced up close three wide around the turn, sustained bid to mid-stretch then gave way. DIPPY EVANS
got shuffled back soon after the start and raced in the last flight, came four wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. MY BROTHER MIKE lacked early foot,
raced wide in the stretch and offered no late run. GLORY AND VICTORY was ridden along the rail through the turn then two wide in the upper stretch and
failed to move on. CRY MACHO raced three wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS failed to move into contention.
SWIFT DANCER chased in range along the inside then retreated in the stretch.

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT grabbed the lead with an alert getaway, rated along removed from the rail two to three wide, responded when roused into the
stretch and remained well clear. FLECHE D'AMOUR advanced with a four-wide run on the far turn, could not reach the winner but outfinished MISS
BETH'EL for the place. MISS BETH'EL broke out into UNBRIDLED CHROME, advanced three wide after six furlongs, moved inside for the drive and was
outfinished for second. UNBRIDLED CHROME got bumped by MISS BETH'EL at the start, raced close up four wide into the first turn, and was finished
before reaching the stretch. SECRETIVE MISS showed early speed two wide, and tired after completing a half-mile. DOLCE APRILE bobbled a couple
strides from the gate, saved ground on the turns, and faded steadily after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WICKED FAST saved ground off the pace, swung out under left-handed urging nearing the eighth pole, bumped STEEL CITY DUDE then rallied between
foes to take the lead in deep stretch. STEEL CITY DUDE rated off the pace two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, was solidly bumped by
WICKED FAST near the eighth pole, fought on outside of that foe and just missed. DEMOGORGON stalked the pace two wide, took the lead turning for
home, led to deep stretch but could not stave off the top two late. GOD IS LOVE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. ETERNAL REST was
bumped at the start, sped clear soon after, set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch then wilted in the final furlong. SUN VIKING broke inwardly and
pushed ETERNAL REST into PETER D just after the start, raced in range inside and tired in the drive. PETER D was bumped just after the start and trailed
inside. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION AND AN INQUIRY, WICKED FAST WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE GRIT was patiently handled along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane, given cue approaching the furlong marker,
responded willingly and kicked clear. SMILING TEUFLES applied pace pressure to TAPE TO TAPE soon after the start, vied with rival around the turn,
fought back to the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and held place. FIRST RULE was ridden along four wide near the quarter pole, came
five wide into the lane, stayed on with response and gained show. ENSIGN PARKER angled off the inside leaving the backstretch, hustled along three wide
near the quarter pole, came four paths wide into the lane and ran on evenly. BLACK BELT raced two wide off the pace, was ridden along five wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a rally. TAPE TO TAPE broke on top and quickly came under pressure, set a pressured pace through the turn, vied for the lead
into the upper stretch then came up empty past the furlong marker. KRAMMY BOY shifted to the outside soon after the start, raced in the back then wide
into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
DRILLOMATIC saved ground unhurried to the top of the stretch, split horses finding his best stride suddenly into the final furlong, and surged late between
rivals to get up. ASTROTURF settled in midpack for six furlongs, came four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside and was edged out late. MARISA'S
MISSION raced close up three wide to the stretch, stayed on willingly in the two-path and was outfinished. EXCHANGE DAY set the pace inside, got
headed by MISTER LEONARDO a quarter-mile out, fought back through upper stretch, then yielded late. FARM BOY saved ground on the turns, lodged a
mild bid on the rail through upper stretch but did not have enough. TIMMY M. was no menace two to three wide. MISTER LEONARDO prompted the pace
two wide, poked a head in front near the quarter-pole, lost some momentum and the lead coming off the far turn, and weakened through the drive.
CENTERFOLDPROSPECT was never in contention. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
