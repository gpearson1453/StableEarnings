for the lead from the inside, dug in inside the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. EURAMASTER dueled for the early lead while racing between
rivals and kept on to the wire. YODELERS WAY dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. BIG MACINTOSH
was off slowly, raced along the inside throughout and had not enough. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
BUD MINISTER dueled for the early lead, raced just off the inside in the stretch run and prevailed under all out pressure. WILDCAT NATION stalked the
pace, made a good rail bid through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. WEBCAM pressed the pace, raced between rivals around the far turn
through the stretch, was brushed by Bud Minister near the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. WHERE'S FREDO was off slowly, rushed to
contention from the outside, raced four wide in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. BENTLEY was allowed to settle in the early stages, angled four
wide through the lane and made a late gain. LEFT BEHIND was unhurried early, raced two to three wide and had no response. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK
was off slowly and trailed throughout.
