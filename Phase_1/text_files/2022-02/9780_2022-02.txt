FAR WEST attended the early pace, steadied off of heels approaching the backstretch run, tracked the fractions to the second turn, mounted a two wide bid
into the stretch, reeled in GOING AWAY PARTY nearing the sixteenth-marker and pulled away in the end. GOING AWAY PARTY was away alertly and was
sent to set the pace through the second turn, maintained a lead into the final furlong, was reeled in by FAR WEST in the final sixteenth but held for second
in the late stages. BERNALINHO saved ground while stalking the pace to the second turn and was outfinished in the drive. ORCZY (IRE) was allowed to
settle to the half-mile marker, was roused on the far turn while two wide between rivals and did not mount a late rally. CANYON CREST was rank along the
first turn while settling at the rear of the field, was steered to the outside along the backstretch run, was four wide along the second turn and gave way in the
stretch. ELUSIVE LOVE stalked the early pace while outside of foes, gained ground while three wide between rivals on the second turn, was shuffled back

Footnotes
TRINA was hustled after the break to dispute the quick pace to the turn, was steered two to three wide along the turn while contesting the pace, gained a
slim margin on the runner-up into the stretch and determinedly held sway in the end. MISS LADY ANN dueled for early pace duties while between rivals,
saved ground along the turn, lost a bit of ground to the winner off of the turn and could not close on that rival in the stretch but stubbornly kept on to be best
of the rest. NAMORITA lacked early speed to the turn, saved ground into the drive and made a steady late gain to be a clear third. I LOVE ROMANCE was
away well and disputed the early pace, lost position into the turn and gave way in the late stages. MOMMY ROSE chased the pace from a three wide path
on the turn and tired in the stretch run. NO COVER CHARGE chased the pace while widest of the field on the turn and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
MARILYN'S SMILE was allowed to settle through the early stages, was three wide on the turn, slipped to the two path for the drive, found racing room in
upper stretch, was urged to confront DO YOU HEAR THAT inside of the furlong grounds and made a late push to prevail. DO YOU HEAR THAT was away
alertly and dueled on the front end while carving out fast fractions, edged to a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds but was overtaken by the winner
nearing the sixteenth marker and was outfinished while besting the rest. QUEEN OF THE TRACK saved ground while tracking the pace, was in tight
nearing the quarter-marker, tipped out leaving the bend and was outkicked in the stretch run. GAYLES EVENING chased the pace while four wide on the
turn and tired in the drive. HOT RAGEOUS contested the fast early pace from a two wide path through the turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in
the late stages.

on the second turn, altered course nearing the quarter-marker, swung widest into the drive, closed in the late going and was up just in time to nail
TALISKER BAY on the line for the win. TALISKER BAY saved ground while settling off of the pace, gained ground along the second turn, came over a path
entering the stretch, mounted a two wide bid to take command into the final furlong, was firmly urged through the final sixteenth and was nailed on the line
by the winner while besting the rest. ROBIE tracked the quick pace from a two wide path through the second turn, mounted a bid nearing the furlong
grounds to vie for the lead but was outkicked in the drive while holding for the show. THEULTIMATEPRAISE was off slowly and was allowed to settle toward
the rear of the field while saving ground, improved position into the drive and was outfinished in the final stages. VANDENBERG stalked the pace through
the first half-mile, lost ground on the second turn and gave way in the late stages. TIGER'S ARROW was four wide along the first turn while rank, recovered
to stalk the pace to the second turn and faded in the late going. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD was away alertly and was sent to set a solid pace through the
second turn, was tiring when took up in tight quarters leaving the quarter-marker and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
UPO was away alertly and was sent to set all of the pace, extended the lead a bit into the stretch run, felt mild pressure in the end from OH BE ONE but
held safely for the win. OH BE ONE tracked the early pace then took back through the backstretch run, saved ground along the second turn, closed in the
drive and was unable to reel in the winner but was well clear of the rest for second. LINFIELD bore out into the first turn and carried out SUNNY SPOT,
settled in the second flight through the backstretch run, was four wide on the second turn, had trouble navigating the turn into the drive and passed tiring
foes in the late stages. AWE was forwardly placed through the backstretch run, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the stretch.
ROCKY TOUGH saved ground while stalking the pace from the second flight, was two wide along the second turn and tired in the drive. SUNNY SPOT
threw his head at the start and was off slowly, was floated five wide into the first turn, was hustled to stalk the pace to the second turn and faded in the late
stages.

ARTEMUS GORDON tracked the quick early pace from a ground saving position, mounted an inside bid to challenge BOLDACIOUS nearing the furlong
marker and had a strong late run to pull away late. BOLDACIOUS was away well and disputed the quick early pace to the turn, was pressured along the
turn and into the stretch, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds and could not hold off ARTEMUS GORDON in the end but was well
clear of the rest. TIZ A THRILL chased the pace from a four wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the drive. TABLE
FOR TWO was away a step slowly and was a bit slow into stride early, exchanged bumps with MORPHY on the run into the turn, was two wide while trailing
on the bend and did not mount a late rally in the stretch. DUDE IT'S A PARTY pressed the quick early fractions while outside of rivals and tired in the late
going. BLUE SILVER contested the pace to the turn, was three wide in tight quarters along the turn and weakened in the stretch run. MORPHY was away a
step slowly, traded bumps with TABLE FOR TWO on the run into the turn, was three wide while chasing the pace on the bend and faded in the late stages.

SADIE BLUEGRASS was off alertly and pressed the quick pace through the turn, overtook TONI TWO POCKET nearing the furlong grounds, had a clear
lead into the final stages, was confronted by REBALATION in the final strides and was all out in the end but held on to prevail. REBALATION was crowded
at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased from the rear through the turn, swung widest into the stretch, mounted a bold late rally to challenge SADIE
BLUEGRASS in the final stages but could not reel that foe in and just missed for the win while besting the rest. JOYMAKER saved ground while chasing the
pace through the turn, was roused in upper stretch, split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker and closed well late to secure the show. EYE ON TIGER tracked
the pace from a two wide path in the second flight and did not offer a final bid in the stretch run. SWANEE chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and
finished evenly in the late stages. TONI TWO POCKET crowded REBALATION at the start and was hustled leaving the break to set fast contested fractions
through the turn, was overtaken by SADIE BLUEGRASS nearing the furlong grounds and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
DOGGY DREAMS traded bumps with GOVERNOR SPECIAL leaving the start, settled off of the early pace into the turn, gained ground while two wide
along the bend, was firmly urged in the final furlong and made a final late push to reel in OH TRUTHY for the win. OH TRUTHY was away in good order and
was sent to set fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead into the stretch run, was clear into the final sixteenth but was reeled in by DOGGY
DREAMS while besting the rest. ACCORDING TO JUDY tracked the early pace, gained ground from a two wide path on the turn, gave ground into the
stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while clear for third. KIND BUT SHE LIES was bumped when in tight quarters along the rail on the run into
the turn, saved ground through the turn while chasing from midpack, angled out for the drive and was outkicked in the late stages. CITY GLITTER was
reluctant to load, was a bit slow in the early going, took up off of heels entering the turn and finished evenly in the late going. LIVIN' AT THE BU had no early
speed, improved position along the turn while four wide and lacked a final bid in the stretch run. ZAFFERANA chased the pace outside of rivals and gave
way in the drive. AFTERDINNERDRINK chased the pace from a three wide position in traffic along the bend and weakened in the stretch. PERFECTLY
JULIE tracked the early pace from a four wide path on the turn and tired in the stretch run. GOVERNOR SPECIAL exchanged bumps with DOGGY
DREAMS at the break and was shuffled back to begin slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a factor.
