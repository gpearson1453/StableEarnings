Footnotes
LAKE RUNNER set the pace, led from a pair of outer vying rivals around the far turn, gamely dueled with I'M A CUSTOM TO IT through the lane, and
prevailed via a very tight photo. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, dueled outside of a game LAKE
RUNNER through the lane, but lost the head-bob on the wire. LOOKING HOT stalked three wide, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with her
inner counterparts entering the lane, and kept on to hold show. PAT HAND GIRL laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, chased
the leading trio two wide around the far turn before tipping outside of them passing the furlong grounds, and sustained a mild late gain, but failed to reach
show. BAD GAL RIRI trailed around the first turn, then passed tired foes without factoring. RECKLESS SERGEANT stalked along the inside, chased the
leading trio around the far turn, then faded. ABSOLUTELY MINDY laid off of the pace along the inside, but was done approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
TIZ LIGHT THE WAY tracked from midpack three wide, gained around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole, then
shifted outwardly while meeting INDY TOURIST's bid at the furlong ground, and held to the wire. INDY TOURIST laid off of the pace three wide, then four
wide around the far turn before tipping further out entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of TIZ LIGHT THE WAY at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay
through the late stages. SHARPENDUP nudged an outer foe at the start, rated at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the four path before shifting out
entering the lane, then stayed on while chasing INDY TOURIST's advance, and reached show in the final sixteenth. FREEDOM FACTOR settled off of the
pace two to three wide, chased the leaders through the lane while aiming inside of TIZ LIGHT THE WAY, but failed to threaten through the final furlong, and
lost show in the final sixteenth. THE GREEN MO'STER prompted the pace two wide, but retreated to a stalking position into the far turn, tracked between
horses around that bend, but lacked a re-bid through the lane. TIGERBEACH stalked three wide, bid into the far turn, led approaching the five sixteenths
pole, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths marker, and yielded. BOURBON TAN was briefly rank through the stretch for the first
time, saved ground in midpack, but faded into and around the far turn to trail the field passing the quarter pole, but met traffic along the rail in upper stretch,
altered out, and passed tired rivals. FOOLISH STEVE stalked along the inside, came under light urging turning for home, but then caved under behind traffic
in upper stretch under no encouragement. BIG FALCON ROCKET set the pace while intentionally staying a bit away from the inner railing, but was headed
approaching the five sixteenths, and weakened in upper stretch. UPHAM trailed along the inside, but was injured at the half mile pole, lost his rider soon
after, then was vanned off. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
HOTMOLLY rated at the rear along the inside, then two wide approaching the far turn, picked off inner rivals while rallying three to five wide around that
bend, then sustained her long advance while hanging on her left lead to reel in the leader in the final sixteenth, and drove clear. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN set
the pace outside of a vying rival down the backstretch, drew clear of that rival turning for home, held sway through midstretch, but was worn down in the
final sixteenth. STAR'S DREAM tracked from midpack along the inside, came under a drive turning for home while shifting off of the rail, but was outkicked
for place by an outer rallying rival entering the lane, and chased the top pair home while proving best of the rest. MIDNIGHT TRIP broke inwardly at the
start, raced off of the pace in the two path, improved to midpack between horses down the backstretch, then fanned four wide turning for home before
getting outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, then chased for a minor share. KITTENOFTHE COURT stalked three wide, chased the leading pair
around the far turn, but was outkicked for minor placings by rivals on both sides entering the lane, and yielded on her left lead. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY
laid close up inside of the pace-setter around the first turn, vied with that foe entering the backstretch, but gave way with a quarter mile remaining, and
weakened through th elane. STAR PRADO raced far back in the two to three path around the first turn, and failed to factor. NINE LINE BIND took a bump
from an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, but faded with a half mile to go before weakening around the far turn. TWO WITH A TEN bumped an
outer rival while breaking slowly, took the first turn in the four path while at the rear of the field, and never got involved.

Footnotes
SAVVY SHIPMAN laid off of the pace two wide, then five wide around the far turn before swinging to the eight path entering the lane, rallied in pursuit of a
leading MONEY WELL SPENT through midstretch, ranged up to that foe a sixteenth from home, dueled through the late stages, and prevailed on the wire.
MONEY WELL SPENT stalked three wide, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch before gaining an advantage approaching the
furlong grounds, but flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole as SAVVY SHIPMAN menaced, battled inside of that foe thereafter, but was nailed on
the wire. G'S DEADLINE tracked two wide, then four wide around the far turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, then rallied to gain show at the
furlong grounds, and chased the top pair home while well clear of the rest. AIR GUITAR STAR raced at the rear two wide around both turns, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, and rallied on her left lead outside of foes for a minor share. TOP TEN DUCHESS prompted the pace two wide, allowed the
leader to clear off approaching the eleven-sixteenths, stalked that rival from the two path around the far turn, but only managed to chase through upper
stretch before flattening out. LIL ASHLEY B. broke slowly, raced far back three wide, took the far turn in the five path, and failed to factor. MY LITTLE JEN
raced at the rear along the inside, gained inside of foes down the backstretch, chased from midpack around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch
before fading. SPELLBINDING set the pace, inched clear at the eleven-sixteenths, managed an uncontested advantage in the two to three path around the
far turn, was guided to the five path entering the lane, but drifted in to the four path in upper stretch, and weakened in midstretch. BALOOK saved ground off
of the pace, but never got involved. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
HONEY RUN settled off of the pace in the two path, gained in the five path around the far turn, rallied to bid approaching the furlong grounds, and drove
clear therafter. SUMTING RIGHT stalked the clear leader from the two path, drifted outwardly in upper stretch, but was soon straightened before shying
from an inner drifting rival at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a bid for the lead between horses at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer
rival leaving that marker, then just saved place. CLARA BELLE popped the gate open pre-race without leaving it, rated far off of the pace along the inside,
tipped to the eight path in midstretch to be outside of leading foes, and rallied with a good kick to claim show, but missed reaching place on the wire. ZEN
(IRE) tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped to the three path turning for home, split foes two wide passing the furlong grounds to bid for place, but
flattened out late. AMERICAN DEPUTY tracked in the two path, then in the three to four path and between horses around the far turn, but was outkicked by
rivals on either side in upper stretch, flopped back to her leaft lead approaching the final sixteenth, and was one-paced late. DIAL TEN FOR G broke in
sharply and squarely bumped a rival at the start, opened up into the first turn, but came back to the field entering the lane, drifted a bit outwardly at the three
sixteenths pole, then was overhauled at the furlong grounds, and weakened. C C'S COWGIRL raced at the rear in the two path, and failed to factor.
DRESSEDTOIMPRESS broke a step slowly at the start, but avoided trouble by doing so, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the first turn, then
in the two path around the far turn, but made little impact. GOLDEN TWIST broke inwardly, tracked in midpack two to three wide, but wilted around the far
turn. UNION GRAD took a solid bump from an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path, and was eased turning for home.

Footnotes
ASSERTIVE STYLE stalked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole before being floated four wide entering the lane, forged an advantage at the three
sixteenths pole, cleared briefly before meeting STERLING MISS's bid at the furlong pole, and gamely clung to an advantage to the wire. STERLING MISS
laid off of the pace four wide, spun into the lane five wide while ranging up outside of rivals, sustained a bid outside of ASSERTIVE STYLE at the furlong
grounds, dueled with that foe to the wire, but was denied. AUSTRALASIA stalked along the inside, committed to a rail charge leaving the quarter pole, but
was tentative to slip inside of rivals in upper stretch after outer foes got a jump, but did so at the furlong grounds, then stayed on to claim show at the
sixteenth pole, and held that position late. PALIO FLAG tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but failed to keep
pace with the leading pair in upper stretch, altered outside of them at the furlong grounds, and kept on late to miss reaching show. EUPHORIC prompted the
pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, vied for show between horses through
midstretch, but flattened out late. SHORT SUMMER DRESS set the pace, vid inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, came into the lane in the two path
before being headed at the three sixteenths pole, then yielded between horses in the final furlong.

CASH LOGISTICS settled off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the four path and outside of rivals, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied
outside of the dueling leaders in the final furlong, reeled them in late, and gained an advantage on the wire via a tight photo finish. BEMMA'S BOY rated at
the rear two wide, tracked in the four path around the far turn before coming into the lane in the five path, then shifted inside of the dueling leaders in
midstretch to join the battle entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished via a tight photo on the wire. SPANISH KINGDOM stalked the clear leader from
the two path, took over from that faltering foe into the far turn as T D DANCE applied outside pressure, showed the way from that rival while in the two to
three path around the final bend, dug in gamely through upper stretch while sustaining the duel, sparred tenaciously between horses through the final
sixteenth, but was outfinished by rivals on either side. T D DANCE tracked in the two path around the first turn, made an early moved into the far turn to vie
outside of SPANISH KINGDOM while in the three to four path around that bend, dueled for the lead through upper stretch, then from between horses in the
final sixteenth, but was outfinished late and denied show. LUCKY CURLIN rated at the rear along the inside, moved up inside of foes at the half mile pole,
tracked in the two path around the far turn, but only managed to chase outer rivals through upper stretch before fading. PERFECT SPEIGHTY laid off of the
pace along the inside, then two wide down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair from the three path and between horses around the far turn, but failed to
threaten them before tiring in the final furlong. MR. HUSTLE set a clear pace early on, but stopped into the far turn, quickly wilted through the field soon
after, then was eased through the lane, and walked off.

Footnotes
PERFECT PERIGEE bobbled a bit before bumping an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, drew off in upper stretch, and lasted to the wire.
VON DOM prompted the pace three wide, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, stayed on to produce a late bid, but ran out of ground to reel that
tiring rival in. CHAMBLISS tracked four wide, then kept on late to hold show. HARBOR KNIGHT laid off of the pace three wide, swung to the six path turning
for home, then required urging to change leads at the three sixteenths pole before staying on. MEAN CANNON laid close up two wide and between horses,
but only managed to chase through midstretch before fading in the final sixteenth. GALLANT STAR was pinched back between horses soon after the start,
laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped ot the four path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. APRIORITY STORM broke outwardly and bumped a rival at
the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. MONEY AND ME was squeezed back between horses at the start, then got outrun.
