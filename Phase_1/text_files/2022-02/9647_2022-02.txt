Footnotes
THE ROBERT settled well behind, advanced along the rail throughout and pulled away late under moderate pressure. TAINO dueled pair along the inside,
edged clear on the final turn then proved no match for the winner in the final eighth. FED FEVER chased within range and continued willingly while no
factor. AMERICAN ROMA dueled between rivals to the final turn and faltered. DENNARD broke slowest, raced very wide and was never in contention.
FLATEXCEL earned a narrow advantage three wide then stopped after half a mile. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE broke out a bit at the start, raced wide and
gave way.

the leader in deep stretch and was just up at the wire. LIVE AID vied outside for the lead, shook free on the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, dug in gamely
in the final furlong and was nailed at the wire. POSSEINEFFECTTOO raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, rallied between rivals in the
stretch and gained late. JADE DELTA raced off the pace, angled out at the top of the lane and closed belatedly. DREAMINOFDASIES was outrun early,
came wide turning for home and passed tired rivals. QUEEN ABARRIO raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. YELLOWSTONE GIRL vied
between rivals for the early lead, then chased and faded. I'AM A UNICORN bobbled at the break, vied inside for the lead, chased on the turn and gave way.
ALMOST EVIL chased three wide, gave way, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

SUCCESSFUL LEGACY controlled the pace, widened on the final turn then remained safe while never seriously threatened. FAIRY WISH settled inside,
rallied into the stretch with a gradual late gain. CARMELTINI lagged far behind then advanced very wide into the stretch too late. MANI PEDI bid closer
along the inside into the far turn then flattened out. CANOOCHEE lacked speed, moved wide on the final turn rallying then faded. COTTON CANDY CUTIE
edged closer outside before half a mile then weakened. MRS. CREWS prompted the winner briefly then gave way readily. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE chased
within range between rivals then stopped in the stretch.

wide off the pace, was asked on the turn and had no rally. NO TOLERANCE raced off the pace and did not factor. SLAM BANG raced off the rail and was

widened to midstretch then weakened late. SEAMIALAUGH prompted the pacesetter outside and continued willingly to the finish. GAVICHI bid closer inside
on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. THRILLING BABY bumped early, raced far behind then passed fading rivals. B B'S ROCKET was urged close
up wide down the backstretch then retreated. THREE POTATOE FOUR dropped back inside and was never in contention. FRAME THIS trailed inside and
was always far behind. LUCKY IMAGINATION flashed speed outside briefly then stopped abruptly.

and weakened in the lane. SUPER DUPER FLY raced off the pace between horses and failed to threaten. NYSSA set the pace, opened up a comfortable
lead, dueled into the stretch and gave way. EMMA'S TOUCH stumbled badly at the start, then raced three wide and was outrun.

PERFECT DIRECTION vied briefly, drew away on the turn then widened and was never menaced under mild urging. IRIE EMPRESS outrun early,
advanced outside on the turn and closed well while no match for her stablemate. SMARTY PANTS SANDY eased back and to the inside before a quarter
mile then rallied well. WILL LEMON DANCE chased wide close up, faded briefly on the turn and lacked a rally. DAREDEVIL BULL earned a narrow lead
outside then faded after half a mile. PUMPERNICKEL dwelt at the start, rushed to contention then was no threat. LUNA FORTUNA was urged close up
inside for half a mile and gave way. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY broke very slowly and was always outrun. WITHOUT A VIEW dropped back inside and was
never in contention. MY FIRST LOVE chased near the inside and weakened steadily. SWEET BALLERINA broke very slowly and was far back throughout.
NANA'S BOOPA chased wide for half a mile and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the trainer of the third finisher against the winner for interference in the
initial quarter mile was dismissed.

RAGTIME BLUES chased on the inside, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, dug in gamely on the rail in the final furlong and
prevailed late. LA WAUN dueled outside for the lead, battled with JOHNNY RITT on the turn, dug in gamely passing the furlong marker and battled to the
wire. FLOAT ON chased in the two path early on, chased the leaders on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside rivals and dug in gamely to
the end. JOHNNY RITT dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, battled on between rivals past midstretch, then yielded. COBH chased three wide,
lacked a winning bid and weakened. MISSION WRAPITUP raced off the pace, steadied nearing the turn, raced inside into the stretch and lacked a rally.
NIMBLE BEAST raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ARRECIFE was outrun. GENGHIS raced off the pace
and did not factor.

LONG GRAY LINE settled inside, bid before half a mile, angled out in the stretch and edged clear in the final sixteenth. BARINGER SPRING stalked the
dueling pacesetters, took over midway on the turn then yielded late. DIGGERS DIAMOND dueled along the rail and weakened slightly through the stretch.
JUPI'S LIGHTNING trailed for half a mile then gained inside without menacing. KINGS HIGHWAY close up early, dropped back inside and was no factor.
FLAT OUT FLASHY alternated for the lead outside then was finished by the three eighths pole. PIGGYBANK lacked speed in the two path and was always
outrun. EL HERMANO chased wide throughout and steadily faded. CHARLIE THE GREEK dropped back early and stopped losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
DONTMESAWITHME raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out, rallied outside in the final furlong, dueled with
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON in deep stretch and edged away to prevail. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON showed good speed to set the pace, responded when
roused in upper stretch, dug in gamely, dueled with the winner in deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON chased three wide early,
chased on the turn, finished evenly in the stretch run and earned the show spot. MIDNIGHTCHARLY was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn and
rallied mildly on the rail. BROAD STREET BULLY raced off rail, off the pace, three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. NEW
COMMISSION chased on the inside, bid two wide on the turn and tired. DREAMS UNTOLD chased two wide early, raced inside on the turn and tired.
PRESS MY BETS chased four wide and gave way.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FLEET saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch and pulled away while kept to a drive. TY RAN A HOMER set a pressured pace inside,
was collared from the rail at the top of the stretch and proved no match. CATCH FIRE eased back into the far turn, came again, angled out in the stretch
with a mild bid. LOAN ME YOUR EAR lagged far behind then offered some late energy. CANTSTOPRUNNING prompted the leaders very wide and faded
on the turn. SACRED MOUNTAIN forced the pace between rivals for half a mile and gave way. E J'S REVENGE bid close up into the far turn then
weakened. CLASSIFIED INFO earned a narrow early lead, dueled through the turn and faltered.
