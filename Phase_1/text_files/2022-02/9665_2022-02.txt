Footnotes
MIGHTY TOUGH bumped with rival at the start then steadily edged up closer along the outside, challenged READYGOSEEK near the half marker, dueled
around the turn, shook clear at the head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and drew off under steady encouragement. READYSEEKGO took a solid
bump at the start then briefly held the lead, challenged by MIGHTY TOUGH nearing the half mile marker, dueled inside around the turn, was no match for
winner at the head of the lane but stayed on with response and held place. BILLY YANK raced off the second flight entering the turn, hustled along three
wide past the quarter pole, came out wider for the drive, edged closer under left handed pressure and got up late to capture show. GHOST FIGHTER
chased the top pair on the inside around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, stayed on with response then evened out in late stages. ZIGGY broke in
and bumped with rival at the start, was briefly in a bit tight mid-way through the backstretch, tipped out a path wider and headed in pursuit, chased three
then two wide through the turn, sustained bid to mid-stretch then gave way. CONGRATS AGAIN raced off the pace, was ridden along four to five wide into
the upper stretch and never threatened. ROGUE ELEMENT got bumped at the start, was reserved racing wide and failed to move into contention.
SLEEPING EMPIRE bumped with the winner at the start, was forwardly placed through early stages, retreated around the turn and continued to tire through
the lane.

KING CAB broke out bumping GLOUCESTER into GOLD SPECIAL, sped clear early off the rail, sailed along unbothered to the stretch, and widened while
on his left lead and kept busy. THE SKIPPER TOO was outsprinted early inside, hugged the rail beginning to get going approaching the quarter-pole, and
was up on the fence for second. CLAPTON chased the winner three wide to the stretch, and had no rally. BIRD WILDCAT steadied early between horses,
swung four wide approaching the stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. GOLD SPECIAL got bumped by GLOUCESTER at the break, and was
always outrun. GLOUCESTER got hip-checked into GOLD SPECIAL by KING CAB at the break, chased the latter for three furlongs and had nothing left
after that.

Footnotes
SENORITA SALSA raced between foes in the second flight midway around the turn, given cue three wide turning for home, roused forward into close
contention, dug in gamely three deep under firm handling in deep stretch and edged by in final strides. I LOVE MAGEL got bumped at the start then was
forwardly placed just off the leader, vied outside of BET ON DRAMA around the turn, remained in striking distance with a furlong left to run, dug in between
foes in deep stretch and got edged out in closing strides. BET ON DRAMA briefly cleared on top then came under pressure from I LOVE MAGEL, dueled
inside of rival around the turn, took back a slim advantage in the upper stretch, fought back into late stages but ultimately yielded. SPUN FOR LU LU raced
in contention three then four wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and gave way in the final furlong. LOOKING FOR LOVE broke in, bumped
with rival at the start and raced in the back, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn and failed to kick on. MAMA LONGLEGS was not far back
along the rail in the opening quarter, flattened out mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch run.

Footnotes
EARTH pressed the pace three wide, took over between foes near the quarter pole, vied past midstretch then drove clear. DOO WOP DON raced off the
pace three wide then rallied between foes to gain the place in the final strides. STAR WEAVER was in range while racing four wide, bid near the quarter
pole just outside of the winner, could not match strides with that foe in the lane and lost the place in the final strides. OFFICER COUNTRY saved ground off
the pace, checked early on the turn, steadied near the quarter pole, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MARCELINO set the pace in the
two path, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on through midstretch then weakened. DANI'S VICTORY chased the pace five wide and lacked the
needed rally. GRAN MALBEC failed to menace while racing two wide. MACHO BLUE chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. TRILOGY chased
the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

GIVERNY broke in putting a shoulder to ON THE RISE, quickly sprinted clear, showed the way inside to the stretch, and maintained control under pressure.
ON THE RISE received a bump from GIVERNY at the break, lagged at the back for three furlongs while off the inside, rallied on the far outside and was up
to nail FUNNY RNOUGH for the runner-up spot. FUNNY ENOUGH chased outside GIVERNY from the outset, stayed on willingly but was caught near the
wire for second. VENTRILOQUIST saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed response. SWAY ME was no factor two wide. HEELS TOGETHER
entered the turn three wide, got out steadily past the quarter-pole, and dropped far back into the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
OLD TOWN ROAD was forced to check sharply when rivals came together soon after the start, lost all momentum and dropped back, remained reserved
three wide through early stages, came under a drive four wide out of the turn, responded willingly, rallied along the outside, came in a couple paths and
swept by with ease. KING OF TRUTH raced off the pace heading into the turn, hustled along three wide into the upper stretch, gathered momentum under
steady pressure, closed with good response and gathered place. BUENO BUENO broke on top and held a slim lead in opening stages, dueled inside of
LIVING WATER around the turn, battled on into the lane, began to edge ahead to the lead then got overtaken by the winner and weakened to show. LIVING
WATER was forwardly placed in opening stages, dueled outside of BUENO BUENO around the turn, battled on for the lead into the stretch run then came
up tired in the final sixteenth. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED took the inside position leaving the backstretch, hustled up along the rail through the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane and failed to kick on. GONE NUTS chased after the embattled trio into and around the turn then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
PASS THE CHAMPAGNE brushed the starting gate and was off a bit slowly, advanced outside down the backstretch, reached even terms three deep near
the three-eighths pole, kicked clear leaving the quarter pole and widened under a drive. ONLY KIDDING settled off the early pace while racing three wide,
moved into second nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly to be clearly second best. ELUSIVE MOLLY hesitated at the start, was well last in the two
path for five furlongs then finished well between foes to gain the show. AWESOME ANNMARIE saved ground and failed to menace. PSYCHIC ABILITY
angled in soon after the start, was clipped behind nearing the half-mile pole, pressed the pace two wide, led between foes near the three-eighths marker
then tired in the drive. MIDNIGHT BALLERINA played no factor while racing four wide. MONA STELLA set the pace along the rail, gave way near the
three-eighths pole and retreated inside. SPROUT WINGS clipped heels leaving the chute, had some speed two wide and steadily faded.

Footnotes
CAPSTONE GIRL split SUPER LUNAR and JAZZY T to take over early on the first turn, moved in establishing an easy pace saving ground to the stretch,
and dug in to repel JAZZY T while drifting out through the late stages. JAZZY T was three wide up front into the first turn, prompted CAPSTONE GIRL from
outside up the backstretch, bid with a quarter-mile remaining, battled through a long drive and could not get past. KATIESDREAMGIRL broke a step slow,
raced in the second flight two wide for six furlongs, shifted out a couple paths into the stretch, and was up for the show. SUPER LUNAR was forwardly
placed inside for six furlongs, and lacked a solid closing response. BONHEUR raced three wide, had aim outside the leaders approaching the stretch, but
flattened out. CHECK TWICE raced two wide between horses on the turns, and had no rally. DOUBLE DOT broke a step slow, and was never prominent.
PARDON MY HEART faded steadily inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW, FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE.
