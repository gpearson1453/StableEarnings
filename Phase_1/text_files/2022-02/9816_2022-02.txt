set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. AFILADA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path a furlong from home, split foes to get up for the place honors inside the
final sixteenth. DUSTED chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show
honors. MOSTLY HARMLESS bumped at the start by THATS PRETTY NICE, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside, came under coaxing along the
inside midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HERECOMESANGELINA coaxed from the gate, dueled
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BELLESHAZZA hustled from the
start, dueled inside of the aforementioned foe coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
BELLA PRINCIPESSA broke in and bumped with a foe, settled under some urging, chased two then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive, gained under a left-handed crop to take the lead inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the wire and proved best under good
handling. BOURBON REBELLION was sent hard from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while asked on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, fought on well with the winner in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. TO A T brushed the inside of the gate
at the start but came out near the front, attended the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, spun into upper stretch under a drive, battled to
near the sixteenth-pole then weakened but was clear for the show. JASMINESQUE broke out at the start, settled at the rear, was urged three wide early on
the turn, shifted five wide approaching the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SWEET MISSION was bumped at the start, settled under some
urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and had nothing left. CALESCENT tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then four wide on
the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
EXALTED CHARM disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled with RUN WHITE RABBIT to near the sixteenth-pole,
disposed of that foe at that juncture and proved best under strong handling. RYE RUNNER settled off the pace, moved from three to five wide under urging
on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in at the furlong marker then again around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to narrowly get the
place. ALITE settled of the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while
narrowly able to get the show. RUN WHITE RABBIT broke in and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch,
vied in the three path on the turn, dueled with the winner to about the sixteenth-pole then weakened. WE READY settled on the outside, was urged five wide
on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. TOTAL EFFORT settled in the front half of the field, was urged three
wide on the turn and came up empty. ROMANTIC MAN settled towards the front on the outside, went four wide under urging on the turn, spun five wide into
the stretch and had nothing left. MISTER J T disputed the pace on the outside, vied between horses in the two path on the turn and tired. NAPOLEON
COMPLEX was bumped at the start, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. WAR NOVEL chased the pace,
went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and capitulated. STONE SURPRISE dropped well behind under urging, rounded the
turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and trailed.
