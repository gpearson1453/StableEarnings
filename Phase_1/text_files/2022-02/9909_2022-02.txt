Footnotes
SANTOS TO WILSON raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, engaged that rival on the turn, took over and cleared approaching the eighth pole and
remained strong to the wire under a drive. DANIEL'S MAGIC stalked the pace outside a rival, bobbled early on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
finished willingly to prove second best. KAZUHIKO (AUS) came away slow from inside, tracked along the rail then two wide on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and gained the show. SAI CON (FR) away quickly to grab the lead, showed the way along the inside into the turn, challenged by SANTOS TO
WILSON on the turn, held a short lead leaving the bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DANCE COMPANY stumbled
leaving the gate, tracked along the inside through the turn under coaxing, tipped out in the stretch and never produced a bid. WEEGEE stumbled badly in
the beginning, trailed along the inside through the turn, steered out in the lane and was not a factor. ARREST was off slow to begin, tracked two then three
wide on the turn outside a rival, moved out in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
GLORY OF CHROME sped to the front and angled to the rail on the first turn, controlled the pace in the middle stages, remained confidently ridden on the
far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under hand urging. BIG BELL was off slow to begin, tracked three then four wide on the first turn, chased
three deep up the backstretch, went two to three wide around the far turn, failed to threaten the winner in the lane and stayed on to secure the place.
RYANO ROSE stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked a bid in the stretch run and held the show. KEEP IT CLASSY traveled
along the inside into the first turn then moved to the two path, raced off the rail up the backstretch, three to two wide on the far turn and was not a factor.
NAP TIME chased three wide around the first turn, between foes in the middle stages, dropped back around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

FROSE sped to the front and and raced outside a rival into the first turn, cleared that foe and took the rail, continued to show the way into the drive, was
challenged from outside in the final furlong and held gamely. SOMMER DAISY (FR) raced inside FROSE into the first turn then ceded command and
stalked along the rail, tipped two wide on the far turn, bid outside with a furlong remaining but could not get by. NOBLE HEARTED stalked along the rail,
lacked room past the three-eighths pole and had to pause briefly, shifted to the two path around the bend, then angled out in upper stretch and bested the
rest. TAYET settled in the two path entering the clubhouse turn, went three then four wide on the second bend and could not rally. LOOKIN SO LUCKY was
off a bit slow at the start, tracked two wide then exited the far turn in the three path, got crowded a bit in upper stretch, angled inward and could not rally.
WARRIOR'S MOON was off slow to begin, pulled at the back while trying to be reserved in the early going, saved ground on the far turn and failed to
menace.

MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE got brushed leaving the gate, pressed from outside, challenged past the three-eighths pole, dueled to the stretch, took over then
cleared with a furlong remaining and drew off. LA PULCINELA set the pace on the inside with MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE applying some pressure, dueled with
that rival on the far turn, fought back in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE got
bumped between rivals at the start, tucked inside on the first turn, steered off the rail while lagging behind in the middle stages, angled back down to the rail
on the far turn and bested the rest. CHOLLIMA traveled in range on the rail, angled out leaving the far turn and failed to rally. HAPPY TRAILS broke out and
brushed rival, got crowded between rivals nearing the first turn, went two then three wide around the bend, moved out on the backstretch, went three to four
wide on the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
EXACTLY WENDY was unhurried and moved to the two path early on, spun three wide into the lane, closed well in the furlong grounds and overhauled the
runner-up late. SHE'S A BIT SASSY pulled into the first turn then was rated on the front end, held a comfortable lead into the far turn, asked into the stretch,
repelled a bid from BLONDE BOMBSHELL but could not fend off the winner late. BLONDE BOMBSHELL stalked the pace outside a rival, took aim two wide
leaving the far turn, bid outside in upper stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. ABHITA settled inside, moved out to the two path on the far
turn, steadied briefly when BUSKER ALLIE came out with a sixteenth remaining and kept on for a minor award. BUSKER ALLIE stalked the leader from
inside, roused leaving the far turn, lacked room from upper to midstretch, steered out with a sixteenth remaining but was too late. HEAVEN'S GHOST got
shuffled between rivals then became rank early on, trailed to the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY went
two to three wide around the first turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
MAD CATTER dueled for the lead from inside into and around the bend, cleared rival entering the stretch and inched away under some right-handed urging
and strong handling. BOB DANIELS broke a step slow then got shuffled between the top pair early, switch to the outside and was forwardly placed three
deep, continued three wide into the stretch, finished willingly in the furlong grounds but had to settle for second best. CONUNDRUM was off slow to begin,
entered the turn along the rail, angled out around the bend and came three wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch, summoned a mild rally and
gained the show. TUCKER'S TRIBUTE brushed with rival at the start, tracked off the rail, angled in entering the turn, moved out in the lane and got edged
for the third. HEAD FOR BUSINESS dueled for command from outside into and around the bend, lost touch with the winner entering the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. PAULAS CAUSE raced widest early on from off the pace, went four wide into the turn, raced five wide past the three-eighths
pole then angled down to the two path leaving the bend and made no impact. ADRIATIC traveled near the back of the pack well off the rail, went three wide
into the turn, got floated out past the three-eighths pole, angled back down to the inside and was not a factor. DIVINELY DIVERSE was off a bit slow at the
start while brushing with outside rival, raced in range off the early on, went four then three wide on the turn, lugged inward in the stretch and tired.

UNBRIDLED MARY settled off the pace, moved down to the two path, angled out leaving the turn, surged late and got up in time. DELMONA (IRE) was off
slow to begin, tossed her head entering the turn, drew alongside leaving the turn, cleared with a furlong to go and got run down late.
SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH was off slow to begin, dueled for command from outside, cleared inside rival into the turn, held command through the turn, lost
the lead in upper stretch and flattened late. SHE'S GOT A WAY stumbled leaving the gate, steadied off the heels of DELMONA (IRE) entering the turn, was
put in a bit tight at the half-mile pole, came four wide into the lane and gained a minor award. BIG SWITCH bobbled shortly after the start, went up to duel
for the lead from inside, chased the leader around the turn and flattened in the furlong grounds. BABY STEPS went three to four wide around the turn,
drifted out some crossing the dirt surface and weakened in the lane. PROFESSORS' PRIDE broke well then was taken in hand early, went four wide around
the turn, came out on the dirt crossing and could not rally.

Footnotes
MO GOLD sped to the front from inside, set the pace in the two path then moved to the rail nearing the turn, held a short lead over BEEF WINSLOW
through the bend, maintained the advantage in upper stretch then inched away in the final furlong. BEEF WINSLOW raced up close three deep then outside
the leader to the turn, bid two wide around the bend but was turned away in the furlong grounds. ADMIRAL HALSEY broke well then dropped back off the
pace, lacked room through the turn, tipped three wide exiting the bend and showed a mild rally to earn the show honors. HAPPY RUNNER broke a step
slow, chased the speed outside a pair of rivals, got bumped past the three-eighths pole, came four to five wide into the stretch and faltered in the furlong
grounds. DEVIL MOON was off a bit slow to begin, went up to press from inside, checked past the half-mile pole, shifted out and bumped rival early on the
turn, chased a bit off the rail into the drive and weakened. HOPPER was off slow, shifted in and bumped rival at the start, went up between rivals on the
backstretch, got knocked into rival past the three-eighths pole, traveled two then three wide on the turn and weakened. ST ANTHONY came away slowly
and brushed with inner rival, moved down toward the inside and went two then three wide on the turn and failed to menace. CARPE BELLUM broke slow
and brushed with outside rival, sat off the pace outside rivals, navigated the turn three then four wide and was not a factor. UPBEAT was off a bit slow and
got bumped leaving the gate, had to idle behind a rival who was checking at the seven-sixteenths pole, took an awkward step near the quarter pole and had
little left for the drive.
