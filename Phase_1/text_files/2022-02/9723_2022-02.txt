finished willingly while being outfinished for the place award. KITTEN'S PEEBLES was rated along early and made a four wide move on the far turn but

GOLD FELLOW broke outwardly at the start and was quickly corrected, then was well rated, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive while
advancing, then wore down the front runner late to get up under a drive. TOUCH OF PRINCE was bumped at the start, then tracked the early pace three
wide, made a middle move to duel for command down the backstretch, then was asked on the turn and shook clear by the quarter pole, then was still clear
by the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner late. FLAHERTY checked after the start, then was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the far
turn on the inside, then rallied mildly late on the inside while needing more. JOHNNY ICE was void of early speed, then advanced on the far turn and came
five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally to pass the tiring rivals. VATICAN MOON set the early pace and then dueled for command to the far turn
and weakened. TASTY'S BULLSEYE stalked the early pace three to four wide and stopped. The jockey on FLAHERTY claimed foul against both GOLD
FELLOW and TOUCH OF PRINCE coming out of the gate, after the Stewards reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
GOTANDA stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole to vie for command, then kicked clear leaving the turn and widened the
margin late to prove best under a drive. ROYAL KAZ was well placed early, then made a bid between horses to vie for command by the quarter pole, angled
out leaving the furlong marker and was up for the place award. DREAMING OF LOVE set the early pace and then vied for the lead on the inside by the
quarter pole but faded in the drive, bested rest. PHIL THE BANKER chased the early pace and weakened. METHODTOTHEMADNESS lacked a rally.
