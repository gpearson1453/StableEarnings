Footnotes
DAHTESTES HERO quickly took co0ntrol, widened on the final turn then remained safe under mild coaxing. SOCIAL JOE broke a step slowly, advanced
well to be easily second best. SPEEDY ZEPHYR angled inside early, continued to save ground and tired. WINNERS WIN urged close up, made a brief bid
on the final turn then weakened. MERGING TRAFFIC hustled from the start, chased wide and retreated. DOWNTOWN CRUMLIN ducked out at the start,
dropped back and was no factor. WHERESTHEPASSION prompted the pace for half a mile then stopped abruptly. SWEETIE PIE raced within range briefly
then gave way readily.

Footnotes
CONNOISSEUR was reluctant to load, set the pace on the inside, vied inside on the backside, shook free on the far turn, drew clear and was kept to the
task in the lane. MIKEY'S JEWEL was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied
outside but could not reach the winner. WONDER CITY raced four wide early, continued with a three or four wide trip throughout racing off the pace, came
five wide into the lane, angled in past the furlong marker and closed belatedly inside for the show spot. SAME MOON raced off the pace, moved up inside
on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and was outfinished for third. YOURINDENIAL raced three wide early, settled off the pace, went three wide on
the far turn and had no rally. STARSHIP BLANCA tracked inside early on, moved up two wide on the backside to contest the pace, chased on the far turn
and faded. CORBALLY chased close up outside early and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
SON OF A SAINT settled close up inside, took over nearing the quarter pole and drew away while kept to a drive. THOMAS KNIGHT moved clear inside,
collared after half a mile and finished willingly for the place. WILLIAM CROTTY lacked speed, advanced inside on the final turn rallying. LUXURY SUITE
trailed early then moved extremely wide into the stretch. LEGIT dropped back early, was very wide on the final turn and no threat. PRETENDANT within
range early, chased wide and failed to menace. AHSAD raced four wide down the backstretch and proved empty. GRAND OASIS saved ground off the
leaders and faltered. DIDNT DO IT was urged three wide between rivals and stopped. MUCHO MAS GRANDE prompted the pace briefly then stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
MASTER OF WAR pulled early, checked sharply entering the first turn, then settled off the pace, advanced on the backside, made a four wide run on the far
turn, rallied outside to a short lead past the furlong marker, then dueled with SAILOR AGAIN through the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. SAILOR
AGAIN stalked the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, gained a short lead, dug in gamely inside of MASTER OF WAR in the stretch
drive and battled to the wire. CITY GUY dueled inside for the lead, battled on the backside, dueled on the far turn, weakened and held on the third.
SPARTAK was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane, angled out and rallied mildly outside. THE METHOD chased inside, chased
the leaders on the far turn and lacked a rally. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT did not factor. JACKS AMERICAN PIE dueled two wide for command, battled on the
backside, dueled between rivals on the far turn and faded. HACHACHA chased three wide and gave way. BREW DOG was outrun.

STILL ALIVE dueled inside for the early lead, steadied nearing the three eighths marker, battled with PEAK OF CHIC on the turn, dug in gamely inside of
that rival passing the furlong marker and then drew clear in the final sixteenth. FLEETERTHAN raced two wide off the pace, angled out in upper stretch,
rallied between horses and finished willingly for the place spot. SYSTEMIC RISK stumbled at the start, chased inside, advanced at the quarter pole, angled
out entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside. PEAK OF CHIC dueled outside for the lead, dueled two wide on the turn, battled to midstretch and
weakened late. AWESOME PAL raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and finished evenly.

EXCURSION outrun early, advanced in the two path, drifted in at the top of the stretch and remained ahead following a long drive. RACK GIN far behind
early, rallied inside on the turn, led briefly and held on gamely. CANT STOP THIS MAN pursued the pacesetter, edged to the front midway on the turn and
continued willingly. STAY HYDRATED raced wide and continued well without threatening. MAINE sprinted clear down the backstretch then faded after half
a mile. PERFECT REVENGE dropped back outside and lacked a rally. OUCH OUCH OUCH raced wide in midpack and retreated. PRIVATE NETWORK
was urged within range along the inside and faded. ONE SLICK START raced wide throughout and failed to menace. ALONZO MOSELY dropped back

roused, drew off and widened under mild urging. PEACH PERFECT raced off the pace, moved up quickly on the rail around the turn, waited briefly for room
at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, then rallied near the inside for second. ARGENTINA GIRL vied inside for the lead, dueled with the
winner on the turn, dug in through the stretch and held for third. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, rallied mildly
inside and was outkicked. PAGEANT PRINCESS raced off the pace, went four wide on the turn and had no rally. ROSE LEGACY was bumped at the start,
stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. HOLD ME CLOSER raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the turn and tired.
DUNE JUMPER was bumped at the start, raced close up on the inside, chased on the turn and tired. ET'S PREMONITION raced off the pace between

KING KUMBALAY firmly rated, made a menacing bid into the far turn, collared the leader, led at the top of the stretch, brushed with the runner-up and
continued determinedly to the finish. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE broke alertly and set a clear pace, was collared at the quarter pole, came out and brushed
with the winner and continued gamely. PARSIMONY settled inside the pacesetter then went evenly through the stretch. INSPIRED OPTIONS prompted the
pace outside for five furlongs and faltered. HIBACHI dropped back early wide, moved inside on the final turn, and was no factor. JUMP FOR ALEX raced
close up briefly wide and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MAMAIGOTTHIS lagged far behind inside, swung wide advancing into the stretch and was just up in time. JACOHARE settled off the leaders outside, bid to
the front late then was nailed at the wire. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER saved ground, rallied to the lead briefly and continued willingly to the finish. NIANGUA
dropped far behind, rallied into the stretch, split foes and was in a bit tight late. DEFIBRILLATOR chased inside early and finished well while no threat.
GREEN GROWTH moved closer inside before half a mile then weakened. CALL ME G Q pursued the loose pacesetter, reached near even terms in the
stretch and tired. CATCH MY VIBE lacked speed and failed to menace. SPIRIT WOLF broke sluggishly and was always far behind. MOUNTAIN KING raced
three wide down the backstretch and faded. SINASHACK sprinted clear for three quarters and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against
the third finisher for interference in deep stretch was dismissed.
