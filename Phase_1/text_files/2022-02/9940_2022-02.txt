Footnotes
LATIN CASINO away in good order, soon cleared along the inside, remained clear through the turn, drew out through the lane under steady handling.
ERNIE BANKER in mid pack while off the inside, raced in traffic into the turn, steered out four wide turning for home, finished well clear of the others well out
in the strip while not a threat to the winner. BIG BOSS BEN lacked speed off the inside, floated out five wide into the lane, improved position to finish best of
the others. HANEY BOYS back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, two path exiting, improved position with some mild late interest.
DEPART off slow, dropped inside late turn, improved position through the stretch while not a serious threat while just off the rail. ABDAN forwardly placed
outside up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, remained in the second flight through the bend, tired in the drive. WHEREVER HE IS lacked speed, four
wide late in the turn, improved a bit upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. THAT'S SOMETHING closest to the leader off the inside, asked
along when chasing that rival midway on the turn, failed to respond and gave way in the drive. FAY DAN dropped inside before the turn, saved ground
through the bend, steadily faded.

Footnotes
MUN LUV never far back outside, four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane when moving to challenge the leader from the outside, took over from that
one when straightened for home, drew steadily clear while being kept to pressure. CHURCH SERVICE back off the pace just off the inside, came in to
tighten up PRAY GLORIA into the turn, remained along the inside through the turn, rallied up the rail to finish willingly and to be slowly getting to the winner
late. CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY broke sharp, shook clear before a quarter, showed the way into the turn, offered some resistance to the winner when
confronted by that one turning for home then could not keep pace nor contain the runner up, saved the show. CAMPAIGNING chased the early leader in the
two path, fell back off that one and the winner through the turn, continued in even fashion through the stretch, slowly gaining for the show. PRAY GLORIA
off a step slow, raced inside, put in tight by CHURCH SERVICE entering the turn, checked up and brushed the rail to fall back, went evenly thereafter while
remaining inside. MCMANSION off a step slow, lacked speed three wide, two path exiting the turn, failed to rally. TAP THE LINE void of speed outside, four
wide into the turn, angled in, two path exiting, remained back. MOTHERS DAY JEWEL fell back to trail soon after the start, showed little to be well beaten.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PRAY GLORIA AGAINST
CHURCH SERVICE FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
COLONEL BOWMAN in the second flight along the inside, steered out when beginning to advance exiting the turn, set down, finished full of run out in the
strip to win going away. BRAD'S TIME broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, shrugged off a foe exiting the turn, clear a furlong out, proved no match
for the winner late, clearly second best. BIG THORN closest to the winner in the run up the backstretch, moved a bit closer to that one from the outside late
in the bend, flattened out but managed to hold the show late. DEFLATER fell back to trail after the start, swung out five wide turning for home, displayed a
mild amount of late interest while remaining widest down the lane. O DOGG last to leave, trailed in lacking early speed, improved into the lane, flattened out
the final furlong to lose a position. MARVIN in the second flight while between rivals, was four wide and between foes turning for home, tired down the lane.
SPECIAL PRYCE in mid pack, four wide in the turn, backed up through the stretch. TURNSANDCONDITIONS forwardly placed early outside, steady fade
before a half.

Footnotes
LET'S CRUISE closest to the two leaders off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, took over, drew clear under pressure while
remaining out in the strip. LEGENDARY GIFT lacked early foot off the inside, dropped inside late turn, steered back out when straightened for home for
room, finished willingly to prove second best. MONTGOMERY PARK alternated up front while racing in the two path, held a slight advantage inside the
winner and between foes into the lane, proved no match for that one or the runner up through the lane, narrowly saved the show. PREMIER WISH came out
at the break to bother GEM KEY, was straightened and raced back just off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, lacked a significant closing
response. MEGAN'S CLARA dueled up front along the inside for four furlongs and began to weaken. LADY VALENTINE four wide into the turn, failed to
muster a rally when called on. TONE IT UP last to leave, trailed early, was never involved. GEM KEY bothered at the start, raced back and three wide,
trailed home.

Footnotes
TIZ MCNAMARA behind the leaders just off the inside, dropped inside midway on the second turn, advanced while saving ground into the lane, challenged
inside the leader with a sixteenth remaining, quickly clear final strides. LOCH GARMAN prompted the pace off the inside, took over when straightened for
home, clear, could not contain the winner while allowing him the inside late. AXIS broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, relinquished the advantage
nearing the furlong marker, drifted out past that pole, continued to weaken but managed to save the show. STUD PUPPY lacked early foot while four wide
into the first turn, was four wide again into the stretch, rallied mildly and was gaining for the show late. CHASE TRACKER void of speed while off the inside,
got out to be well wide into the lane, improved position down the middle of the strip while not a serious threat. SOUTHERN RAGS went one paced
throughout while four and five wide, no late punch. GRAVES MILL ROAD settled in mid pack well off the inside, steered out slightly to be four wide into the
lane, lacked a late punch to lose a couple of positions. DEMIGOD broke back, lacked early speed in trailing early, improved the third quarter inside of
several rivals and in some traffic then flattened out through the lane. MEGA MAX devoid of any early foot,continued back second turn, made no impact
through the lane. MOON IN THE SKY raced in mid pack early off the inside, tired. INTO ORBIT in the second flight inside, gave way.

MY CORALENA in the second group up the backstretch three wide, advanced on the three three wide late in the turn, took over, drew out through the lane
under steady handling. BAD OUTLOOK void of speed, brush start, moved toward the inside, two path through the turn when still well back, dropped to the
rail for the drive and finished full of run up the inside to be in time for the place. G MONEY LIV broke on top, sprinted clear, set the pace for a half, headed
by the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one, two path to the wire, nipped for the place late. CANDY'S STORY closest to the leader up the
backstretch in the two path, bit closer turn then lacked a further response through the stretch. FASHIONABLY QUICK in mid pack while racing three wide,
went evenly through the stretch. MANDONA forwardly placed early along the inside, began to weaken before a half. CORTADO void of speed, swung out
into lane, carried out further by a drifting KEINO nearing the furlong marker, improved position. ROMANTIC COMEDY fractious in the gate, broke back,
moved out three wide, picked off a couple of tiring rivals, not a serious threat. MAGGIE'S WILL raced in mid pack for a half, came up empty for the drive
while off the inside. KEINO lacked speed, four wide turn, drifted out nearing midstretch, lacked a response. FINAL TABLE hopped at the break to be off
slowly, trailed well back throughout. PACIFIC GROVE leaned out at the break to brush with BAD OUTLOOK, unseated rider.

Footnotes
CHERISHED back off the pace, dropped inside late in the turn, shifted out, finished up willingly to prove best. GHAALEB THE GREAT lacked early foot after
breaking slowly, moved outside in the turn to be five wide midway on that bend, four wide into the lane, rallied to also finished up well and be clearly second
best while getting to the winner. KASSERINE PASS broke well, help set the pace up the backstretch, dueled through the turn, held a narrow advantage a
furlong out then falrtered. NORTHERN DIAMOND in the first flight outside, dueled through the turn in the two path, also weakened the final furlong.
CANADIAN GINGER flashed speed while three wide and between rivals up the backstretch, tired. CATECHISM four wide into the turn when off the pace,
failed to muster a response. KAY BEE GEE dwelt at the start, trailed most of the way and was never involved. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE flashed early
speed between foes, steadied between horses into the turn, stopped, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
THE MARY ROSE allowed the pace to go early, steadied slightly with seven sixteenths remaining, was covered up in traffic when within striking distance
second turn, steered out three wide, quickly clear after a three wide bid, ridden out. MISTY VEIL got clear before a quarter, set the pace along the inside,
proved no match for the winner in the final furlong, kicked clear for second. W W FITZY chased the leader early, moved to engage that one in the second
turn, also proved no match in the drive, weakened late. CANDURA void of speed, advanced far turn, came four wide into the stretch, displayed a mild
amount of late interest. BLESSED AGAIN settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer outside the winner late in the final turn, flattened out in the
run to the wire. WELLINGTON WONDER was finished after half.

Footnotes
TOPF ROAD RULES away in good order, set the pace inside, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, asked along into the lane, roused midstretch, held
the runner up at bay in the final strides. BELLAMYS ROAN four wide onto the backstretch, chased into the far the turn, three wide through that bend,
continued in pursuit of the winner past the furlong marker, gained final strides, too late. TRAFFIC CONTROL forwardly placed inside, saved ground while
losing some position in the second turn, proved no match for the top two through the stretch, clear of the others. GHOST STRATEGY lacked early foot off
the inside, raced in traffic far turn, dropped inside later in that bend, steered out midstretch, improved position with some belated interest. FORSAKEN four
wide into the first turn, prompted the issue the middle half mile, weakened through the stretch. KILGORE lacked early speed, dropped inside midway on the
second turn to improve into the stretch, flattened out in the drive. SERBIAN SAILOR off the pace well wide, was five wide into the far turn, worked way down
three wide entering the stretch, lacked a response. CHALECO last to leave, raced back and failed to menace. WHELEN SPRINGS mid pack while racing off
the inside, was three wide and in some traffic second turn, had nothing for the drive. SOUTHERN PECAN in the second flight off the inside, gave way in
traffic while three wide in the far turn. ACCEL JOE remained always back, lost contact with the field late, jogged in. I STAN FOR LOVE gave way before a
half, also lost contact with the field in the stretch, jogged in as well.
