Footnotes
CARLA'S HONOR tracked just off the leaders three deep between foes on the backstretch, steadily advanced in that path to challenge for command
nearing upper stretch, angled inwards once securing a clear advantage under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. OVERTHEBLUESKY
swerved a bit in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued
with interest to close the gap on the winner late. NIGHTMIDST tracked the leaders just outside the eventual winner four wide on the backstretch, advanced
in tandem with that foe in that path to lodge a brief bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. FOXY AUSTIN broke sharply, prompted the pace outside a
rival racing to the turn and gave way between foes racing into the lane. QUEEN'S BEST, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, contested
the issue inside the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way. TIPHARAH, raced five wide between foes in early stages, angled to the inside after the
opening quarter but offered no rally. TAP INTO THE HONEY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL TIZ was settled last dropping well off the field racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far turn, then produced a steady late
response to advance inside rivals through the stretch to prevail in time under pressure. TIZ HERSELF tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the lane, was fanned six wide racing through the stretch but found her best stride late to challenge the
winner nearing the wire while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. GRANDMARY tracked off the first flight while tipping off the inside racing to the
backstretch, gained contention inside foes on the far turn, altered course slightly when caught in tight quarters nearing the quarter pole to advance between
foes, was bumped by SILVER PACKAGE racing into upper stretch, split foes just off the inside to challenge for command nearing the wire but was outkicked
by the top pair. LOVIN LIVIN tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, swung out five
wide to advance between foes racing through the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while just outkicked for a share. LA VIEXA, caught five
deep, then four wide while prompted to a forward placing racing to the backstretch, gained the advantage leaving the far turn but yielded between foes
nearing the wire. SILVER PACKAGE tracked the leaders outside a rival, raced four deep into the far turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch bumping a
rival while being urged to challenge four wide between foes but came up empty late. AUBURN, urged to the lead racing in the three path to the backstretch,
set the pace racing well off the rail to the far turn, briefly dueled inside a rival into upper stretch but emptied out leaving the furlong marker.

VALIANT VIRTUE broke readily, attended a rival's through the backstretch, was urged clear racing through the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin into
the lane and was kept to some right handed pressure widening the margin late. ALL FOOLS DAY, reserved in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into
the turn, continued with a steady effort in that path to upper stretch but couldn't close the gap on the winner while besting the others. THROWN FOR A
LOUPE tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance three wide between foes into the stretch but couldn't match terms
with the top pair while continuing well enough to earn a share. VALID EXCHANGE tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, switched out
four wide entering the stretch but had no rally. PAPA LUKE tracked off the first flight inside rivals in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. HIGHLY NOTED was urged prompting the pace inside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn and gave way nearing upper
stretch.

Footnotes
CPOWER, caught seven deep racing just off the first flight in the opening three sixteenths, shifted inwards racing into the bend advancing five wide in
tandem with several rivals, angled inwards pressing the issue outside LIL GREEN MACHINE to upper stretch and shook clear late under energetic handling.
The latter raced six wide between foes just off the leaders in early stages, was urged to advance four wide between foes entering the turn, shifted inwards
disputing the issue inside the winner to upper stretch but proved no match late while prevailing for the place honors. THE SKIPSTER, forwardly placed
inside foes in the opening stages, eased off the leaders while switching off the inside racing into the turn, raced four wide into upper stretch, shifted inwards
under pressure but improved his position to the end. CHAIRMAN FOX was settled off the leaders in early stages, raced five wide through the turn to upper
stretch and continued to gain some position. CARROTS OR CARATS, urged between foes, then along the inside pressing the pace into the turn, gave way
nearing the lane. RAL COPPERHEADROAD was settled outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the lane and passed
between tiring rivals late. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA, off A bit slowly, swung wide into the lane but never gained contention. BAHAMIAN DUDE joined the pace
four wide between foes in early stages, pressed the issue while shifting to the inside racing through the turn and faded in late stages. LA LENA, urged three
deep between foes pressing the pace from the outset, emptied out abruptly entering the bend. NEPTUNES REVENGE broke sharply, pursued the leaders
four deep between foes on the backstretch but dropped out early. LIL CROWN traced off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn but dropped back
early. STORM SEVENTEEN WAS SCRATCHED IN THE POST PARADE.

Footnotes
MCLOVIN, reserved between foes behind the second flight in the opening mile, shifted out three wide racing into the third turn, moved to challenge in that
path nearing upper stretch, contested the issue outside LE COSTE in a prolonged drive to late stages but edged forward of that foe in time under firm
handling. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half mile, switched out approaching the second bend, was prompted to
advance on the leaders three deep with three furlongs to go, bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch, contested the issue grudgingly inside the
winner to late stages but came up second best. MAKING IT tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening mile, saved ground to upper stretch,
then tipped out entering the lane and continued well enough to earn a share. BATTLE OF BRITAIN went clear along the inside soon after the start, dictated
the pace on a comfortable advantage to the third turn, set the pace to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. CHINA BEACH tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half mile, angled to the inside racing into the second bend, continued in pursuit of the leader to the
third turn and faded nearing upper stretch. THE HAPPY GIANT was settled outside foes racing behind the second flight in the opening mile and failed to
menace thereafter. PONGO LOUIE trailed throughout.

SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT broke readily, was settled last racing inside a rival to the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum tipping off the inside nearing
upper stretch, split foes three wide in the lane, then shifted four wide in the closing stages but produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in
time under firm handling. AYCAPOTE, caught four wide between foes racing to the first turn, dropped off the leaders to track those foes into the backstretch,
was prompted to advance between foes racing into the far turn, lost some ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch, shifted out three deep in the lane
while continuing with a steady effort to gain the lead between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. MIRIAM'S SKY, caught five wide while being
prompted to contend, eased off the leaders to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance three deep between foes into the
far turn bidding for command, shifted to the inside entering the lane, was bumped by MIGHTY GHOST nearing midstretch and had no final response while
edging that rival for a share. MIGHTY GHOST settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a sharp advance nearing the far
turn, circled foes four wide though that bend to gain the lead racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards bumping MIRIAM'S SKY midstretch and quickly came
up empty. PAINTER'S PRIDE was rated off the second flight in early stages, switched off the inside after a half, raced four wide through the far turn to upper
stretch but lacked the needed final bid. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, off slowly, was settled well off the leaders outside the eventual winner racing to the
backstretch and passed only tiring rivals in the lane. ENGLISH LAUGHTER angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. PICCADILLY BEAU, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the backstretch, was through
after a half. PHILO, urged inside foes from the break disputing the pace, dueled for command inside rivals to the far turn and gave way. POLLOCK, urged
three wide into the first turn forcing the pace, continued to prompt a rival to the second bend and gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
HUNTRESS MOON broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside to the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin racing into the far turn and was
kept to pressure to hold BRAMBLE BUSH safe to the end. The latter angled to the inside, was reserved out of striking distance to the far turn, switched out
three wide entering the lane and produced a steady late response to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE tracked off
the second flight while angling inside early, was prompted to advance splitting foes racing through the far turn but was outkicked for second in the drive.
MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved ground throughout but faded in the drive. SWEET TINA,
caught wide leaving the chute, tracked off the second flight outside foes, angled inwards conceding some position entering the far turn, then made an effort
to regain some position into the lane while no real threat. HURRY UP DEAR, urged to a forward placing tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of that foe to the second bend but emptied out nearing the lane 1/4. VARSITY KICKLINE (IRE) settled inside foes in early
stages, angled out racing into the stretch but proved no threat. FIRST LADY DI DA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane. WICKED INTENT settled outside foes in the opening stages, switched out to make some brief progress racing four wide into
the second bend but gave way nearing the lane. BEAUTIFULAZULENE was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
TITHED raced behind the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn, was fanned five
wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to gain the advantage under pressure and was taken in hand when going clear
approaching the wire. UNCLEJACKOMO tracked just off the pacesetter three wide between foes in the opening stages, continued with a steady bid in that
path racing into upper stretch to gain the advantage between calls late but couldn't contain the winner. EXCELLENT MARK, urged inside a rival prompting
the pace in the opening stages, conceded the lead after the opening three sixteenths, continued with a steady effort along the rail to challenge inside foes
entering the lane but was outkicked by the top pair. JACKSON STRONG, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of the that
foe three deep on the bend, moved to challenge four wide in upper stretch but finished evenly late. MIAMI CHROME, reserved off the second flight in the
opening stages, angled to the rail racing past the half mile marker, tipped out four wide racing through upper stretch and found his best stride late to gain
position to the end. GOLD DUCAT settled into stride while racing well off the inside in early stages. raced five wide through the turn, then between foes in
that path into upper stretch and continued evenly. LUCA DREW THE ACE, urged between foes forcing the pace in the opening stages, went clear along the
inside racing into the turn but failed to sustain that momentum past midstretch. FRANKIE Z was a bit slow to gather stride and failed to menace.
NANTUCKETER, urged between foes pursuing the first flight in the opening stages, dropped back, then switched outside foes racing into the turn, was
fanned six wide entering the lane but had no late response. HOLIDAY DANCER proved no factor.

Footnotes
COCHISE CHARLIE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped outside a rival on the far turn gaining a position just off the
leaders, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to challenge, came under correction when lugging inwards a bit but wrested the
advantage in time to go clear under firm handling. GOLOVKIN tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms
with the pacesetter between foes nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage leaving the furlong marker but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. VINTNER reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn to race three deep into the lane and
continued with interest to gain position while earning a share. OSPREY tracked just off the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, saved ground to
upper stretch but had no rally. JO JO KATZ, off last, was settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out four wide in the closing
stages to gain some position in an even effort. ALBIE was reserved while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide racing into
upper stretch and made no impact. BRIDGEKEEPER settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the stretch but had no
rally. BRILLIANT JOURNEY sprinted clear of the field while angling to the inside, dictated the pace through the backstretch to upper stretch but gave way
abruptly once headed midstretch. KING ANDRES was settled between foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early. BEE BY THE SEA, forwardly
placed tracking just outside the pacesetter, was fanned three wide into the far turn while being urged to lodge a brief bid but quickly emptied out into the
lane.
