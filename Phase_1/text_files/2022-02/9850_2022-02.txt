Footnotes
CLOSING DEALS broke alertly while carried in some at the start, was hustled to press the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back at the nine-sixteenths
then switched to the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained the lead around the three-sixteenths,
drifted in some inside the furlong marker then was quickly straightened by the rider, fought outside of the runner-up to the wire and proved best under strong
handling. EASY PLAY broke in then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to her inside, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the
two path, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, fought on with that foe to the wire but was outfinished while extremely far clear for
the place. BOCA KITTEN moved in under urging early, dropped well back while ridden along, saved ground on the turn and shared the show while no match
for the top two. OVER THE SAND broke out then bumped with a foe and bobbled, was coaxed along in third position on the outside, went four wide on the
turn and came up empty while able to hold a share of the show. LONDON PEARL was bumped at the start, dropped well behind under urging, angled in
before the five-eighths, raced inside to the two path on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
ROAD TO SUCCESS established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits uncontested, slipped away still on hold
widening from the rest of the field through the far turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and continued to go
clear getting geared down to prevail comfortably at the end. OCEAN DEEP three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, weakened to the finish while up for the place honors. COACH BAHE leapt up at the start
conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced four then three wide through the first turn and then four to five wide down the
backstretch, came under coaxing four wide three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MR. FIDGET just off the inside
through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went five wide for home and tired. BELLAMY DOLCE tucked from the
three path to the rail into the first turn, chased along the inside coming under coaxing from the three-eighths and faltered in the stretch. YANKEE EMPIRE
just off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the far turn, continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KING OF HOLLYWOOD showed good speed, was well rated while setting the pace, raced inside on the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and maintained a
safe advantage under steady handling then was vanned off after the race. RVINDICATED settled off the pace, was roused near the half-mile pole, went
three wide under urging on the turn, gained late on that bend, was put to a left-handed crop in the two path into upper stretch, lugged inward in the drive and
was well clear for the place. PRINCIPALITY was hustled from the start then coaxed early, dropped back with six furlongs to run then fell well behind the rest
of the field, saved ground on the turn and finished with some interest for the show. IRIE SPICE broke a step slow, angled to the outside then settled at the
rear, dropped from four wide to the rail early on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend and came up empty. GOOD TIP broke awkwardly and was off
slow, moved up under urging then was taken in hand behind the leader, switched out around the three-quarter pole then tracked the pace on the outside,
made a brief bid with a half-mile to run, dropped back in the two path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command just
inside the eighth pole, dug in dueling to the finish and gamely prevailed on the wire. MR. PETE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the
inside under pressure from KAREN'S COVE to the outside, got joined three deep by TALE OF MIST and was under pressure from a pair midway on the
turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat dueling with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong fighting on game but was
ultimately denied at the end. RAGTIME BLUES coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before making his way to the inside
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and ran on along the rail to secure the show honors.
BINKSTER coaxed from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. MANIFEST DESTINY bobbled at the start, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was outkicked. TALE OF MIST just off the pace five
wide down the backstretch, tucked four wide and advanced on the front stacking outside the top pair three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KAREN'S COVE pressed the pace four wide down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn between foes from the three-eighths when put to coaxing, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DADDY KNOWS broke out at the start and was corrected, raced four wide in aim of the leader advancing on that rival midway on the turn to latch on to the
outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and dueled with WRITER'S REGRET from that station to the eighth pole when seizing command, then
edged away to the finish kept to task. WRITER'S REGRET hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under
attendance by a pair to the outside, raced just off the inside through the turn coming under increased pressure from the aforementioned foe and was placed
to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in knocking heads to the eighth pole when displaced from command, ran on well clear of the
rest to be along second best. BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths beginning to be shaken off by the top pair, faded and went five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. T LOVES A FIGHT hustled
from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. OUR MAN MIKE hustled
from the gate, chased just off the inside coaxed along from the get go, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DURKIN'S CALL struck the
near side stall at the start getting away last and conceding four lengths to the front, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung
three wide for home and was no menace.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE FIRE was hustled from the start, established early position then was rated just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, pursued the
clear leader under a strong drive in the stretch, gained fast into the final sixteenth and got up to narrowly prevail. GRINGOTTS settled on the outside, moved
closer with five furlongs to run, chased four wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a strong drive in the stretch, gained fast into the final sixteenth, made
a bid in tandem with the winner late and just missed while clear for the place. DIVA BANKER showed good speed, was joined on the outside near the
five-eighths, vied in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, led under the crop while shortening stride into the final sixteenth
and was overtaken but held the show. SHADOLAMO was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the then moved to the two path under a strong
drive, continued under a prolonged drive in the stretch and gained late but failed to impact. VIRADIA was last to commence, climbed while racing with her
head held high to around the five-eighths, was urged four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. ANCIENT BROWN tracked the pace
on the outside under some restraint, moved up to press the leader nearing the five-eighths, chased in the three path around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
WHISTLING BIRDS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch and drew clear under a drive kept to task. SEVEN LILIES three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MORE GRAYTFUL four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TAPIZEARANCE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened. ANYTHING PAZIBLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. WINNERS LAUGH forwardly placed three then two wide, came under coaxing midway on the turn, swung three wide at
the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TRASH TALKER showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to both sides, moved clear leaving the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path
around the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. SUBSIDIZE pressed the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path through the turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. MASKED MARAUDER angled in while urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. AIR SHOW bumped with foes at the start and was
off a bit slow, was urged along near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and improved position without threatening. COLORMEPAZZI broke
through the front of the gate prior to the start, was brought back around and reloaded, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn
and tired. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE broke out then was hustled, pressed then chased the pace on the inside, dropped back along the rail on the turn and
capitulated. RUDY ROD bumped with a rival at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, swung
five wide into the stretch and came up empty. TEXAS BASIN broke out then bumped lightly with a foe and was off a step slow, was urged at the rear, went
three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
