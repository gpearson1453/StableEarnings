Footnotes
MINOSO pressed the fast pace from a two wide path between rivals, met the bid of DARKSABER at the furlong grounds, dueled with the runner-up and dug
in in the final strides to prevail. DARKSABER pressed the quick pace from a three wide path, met the bid of MINOSO at the furlong marker, dueled with that
rival to the wire and was just nipped on the line while clear of the rest. CAJUN BETTOR was slow into stride in the early running, settled at the rear of the
field while two wide, waited for racing room nearing the quarter-marker, found that room in mid-stretch and closed well late to claim third. RED HOT CAT
chased the pace while between foes on the turn and was outfinished in the late stages. HARDY CHISEL saved ground while tracking the pace and did not
mount a final bid in the stretch. KLAY NATION unseated the rider in the post parade, chased the pace outside of foes, gained ground while four wide on the
turn and weakened in the drive. HONG KONG COWBOY was away alertly and was sent to set fast fractions while being pressed through the turn, yielded
the lead into the stretch run and faded in the late going.

MURPHYS TIGER was hustled leaving the break, set quick fractions from the inside while being pressed by several rivals through the turn, shook clear of
the pressing rivals into the stretch and edged clear in the end. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE sat just off of the quick early pace while saving ground, tipped out
for the drive, closed well late and while not able to reel in the winner was best of the rest. GATOR SHINING pressed the fast early fractions from a four wide
path and gave way in the stretch. STRUT TO THE WIRE pressed the pace while three wide between horses, lost ground along the turn and weakened in
the drive. SURPLUS pressed the pace from a two wide path between rivals and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH was away in good order and took command of the fractions into the first turn, rated nicely through the backstretch run, extended the
lead into the stretch and was geared down in the final stages as much the best. M K HEART stalked the pace from a two wide path, was no match for the
winner in the drive but was best of the rest. CAT GAMER settled off of the pace to the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn and
passed tiring rivals in the late going. NORTH SEA stalked the pace to the second turn and faded in the drive. COUSIN MARK stalked the pace to the
half-mile marker, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL CREED was unhurried in the early stages, gained ground leaving the second turn, angled out for the drive, confronted SHE'S SO PRETTY just
inside of the sixteenth-marker, battled with the runner-up and determinedly dug in to prevail. SHE'S SO PRETTY tracked the pace to the second turn from a
two wide position, gained ground into the stretch run, confronted MYBLUEBELL inside of the furlong marker, was engaged by IMPERIAL CREED just inside
of the sixteenth-marker, battled with that foe and was bested in the end, while well clear of the rest. MYBLUEBELL (FR) stalked the pace from a two wide
path to the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter-marker to confront PROOF OF JAZZ, led into the final furlong but was quickly overtaken by the top
pair and outfinished in the late going while a clear third. PROOF OF JAZZ was away quickly and showed good early speed through the first half-mile, was
confronted nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the drive. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT settled off of the early pace while saving ground and did not mount a
late rally. JUSTA POPPIN was a bit wide on the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn from a three wide path and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
CLEVER CHIEFTESS was away alertly and set quick fractions from a two wide path, opened a clear lead into the stretch and had the lead cut into late by
the runner-up but held safely in the end. ARISTEIA saved ground while tracking the pace from the second flight, stayed close to the rail for the drive and
was firmly handled in the late going to close on the winner while besting the rest. LOCHMARA chased the pace from the second flight while two wide on the
turn, swung widest into the drive and rallied well in the late going to claim third. ALL chased the pace from the midflight while three wide, made a mild late
gain in the stretch and just missed for third. SHANGHAI DAZZLER tracked the quick early speed from a three wide position on the turn and weakened in the
stretch. ELIANA CHAMP took up soon after the start, settled off of the pace while four wide on the turn and did not mount a late bid in the drive. NORTH
DAWN settled off of the pace while outside of rivals and was not a factor. NIGHTBIRD chased the early quick pace while saving ground, lost ground on the
turn and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MANAALABOUTDAMONEY was away alertly, showed good speed to the turn while carving fast fractions and kicked clear in the drive. SUMMANUS was
bumped by ONE LAST THOUGHT at the break and was off slowly, saved ground along the turn, angled to the three path for the drive, gained ground in
upper stretch and while unable to reel in the winner in the end was best of the rest. ONE LAST THOUGHT bumped SUMMANUS at the break and chased
the quick fractions from a three wide position, swung widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the late going. MALIBU GHOST tracked the pace from
a three wide position on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. PRINCE CINDERELLA lacked early speed, was two wide on the turn and went by tiring
rivals in the stretch. TOM'S BIRTHDAY chased the quick fractions from a three wide position and tired in the stretch. CHUMLY was a bit erratic and hard to
place in the first quarter-mile while tracking the fast pace, lost ground on the turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
NORTHWEST FACTOR had an alert beginning and was hustled to set the fractions from a ground saving position, rated nicely through the backstretch run,
extended the lead into the stretch and pulled away in the end. JAVANICA stalked the pace from the second flight from a two wide path, was outkicked in the
stretch run but kept on to secure second. GETTIN SIDEWAYS saved ground while tracking the pace to the second turn and was outfinished in the late
stages. SCHERZO (GB) steadied off of heels into the first turn, settled at the rear through the second turn, swung widest into the drive and did not mount a
late rally. TIZ AN EDVENTURE tracked the pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the drive. DRAW ME stalked the
pace outside of rivals to the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT saved ground through the second turn while stalking the pace, angled three wide for the drive, pounced on KATZUMOTO nearing the
furlong marker and held safely over the oncoming runner-up in the end. TOUGH IT OUT was a bit slow in the early stages, settled through the backstretch
run while saving ground, waited for racing room approaching the quarter-marker, angled four wide for the drive, rallied in the stretch and could not reel in the
winner but was best of the rest. KATZUMOTO was forwardly placed to the second turn while tracking the pace, mounted a two wide bid to vie for the lead
into the stretch run, was overtaken by the winner nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late stages, while clear of the rest for third.
INVERTIGO stalked the pace from the second flight, gained ground from a three wide path on the second turn and gave way in the late going. EARNEST
stalked the pace from the midflight, was four wide on the second turn while improving position and weakened in the stretch. MEGAMEISTER was away
alertly and was hustled to set the pace to the second turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker and tired in the drive. SMOKE AND BURN
stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, was asked for run approaching the far turn and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
TEXAS CHARM was allowed to settle off of the early pace while saving ground, tipped out for the drive, was put to firm urging and responded through the
lane to overtake ARTISAN DANCER and kicked clear in the end in a good debut. ARTISAN DANCER was away alertly and showed good early speed while
setting fast fractions, held BEAUTYINTHEBEAST at bay inside of the furlong marker but was caught and overtaken by the winner in the late going while
clear of the rest. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST tracked the fast early pace through the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch but flattened in that effort and
was outkicked in the late going while holding for third over an oncoming rival. FILLY PELLI was crowded at the break by NISHICO and was away slowly,
lacked early speed to the turn and rallied well in the stretch to just miss for third. TIME TO SMILE stalked the pace outside of foes to the turn and did not
mount a late rally. FIT FOR TOM saved ground while forwardly placed through the turn and weakened in the drive. CRY ME A RUNNER stalked the pace
from a two wide path from the midflight, rider dropped his whip in mid stretch and had no late response. MAYDAYSMOON chased the pace from a three
wide position on the turn and faded in the late going. NISHICO crowded FILLY PELLI at the break and was away slowly in turn, saved ground while lacking
speed to the turn and was not a threat.
