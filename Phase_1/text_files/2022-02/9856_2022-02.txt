I AM THE CASH MAN was allowed to settle early, advanced two wide on the turn, shifted in by the three sixteenths pole, closed well on the inside to be
going away late under a drive. MR. MOSLEY set the pace while racing off the rail, then was sent down when straightened and responded well, but was
heaqded by the winner by the sixteenths pole and could not go with that rival late while being second best. JOHNNY SWISH was bumped at the start, then
stalked the pace and made a three to four wide bid leaving the quarter pole but flattened out, bested rest. WAY MORE chased the early pace four wide and
came five wide into the drive and finished evenly. LITTLE SIR JOHN steadied after the start, then settled in the back and was on the inside entering the
stretch and had a belated rally on the inside. DUNE DUNE vied for the early lead on the inside and weakened. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON was off slowly,
failed to menace. CHAUFFEUR lacked a rally. The rifer on LITTLE SIR JOHN claimed foul against the rider on MR.MOSLEY for interference at the start,
after the Stewards reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

MONEY RIDE set the pace crossing over to the inside, was well handled and sent down leaving the turn and responded well under left handed crop urging
to draw out to prove much the best. CARIBBEAN (AUS) stalked the winner three wide and failed to gain on that rival while being clearly second best.
ARMANDO R was allowed to settle three wide, advanced frour wide by the quarter pole and then finished evenly late, bested rest. HALITE was allowed to
settle on the inside and had no rally, even effort. SILENT MALICE was reserved early while three wide, swung out five wide for the drive and had no rally.
IRISH RIVIERA chased the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and tired. MY GOOD MAN was reserved early on the inside and had no
response.

CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO was well rated early drafting in behind the two pacesetters two wide, then shifted out leaving the quarter pole to make a four
wide bid leaving the turn, hit the front and kicked clear to prove best, driving. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT chased the early pace three wide and from between
rivals, then swung out seven wide leaving the turn, finished willingly gaining the place award late. RAHMER was allowed to settle early, made a four wide
move on the turn to loom boldly entering the lane, but hung late, lost place award wire. RAD PAISLEY pressed the early pace two wide and made a three
wide bid leaving the turn but weakened in the final furlong. LOADED SNIPER was allowed to settle early and saved ground throughout but lacked the
needed winning bid. FRANCIS X. chased the early pace five wide and weakened. PEDERSON'S COURAGE had no response. DIALING DIXIE set a
pressured pace on the inside and drifted out in the lane and weakened.

PRINCESS KOKACHIN set the early pace and move to the rail entering the far turn, then drew out leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the
best. ALTA VELOCITA stalked the early pace two to three wide and stayed on to be clearly second best. PAISLEY SINGING was well placed early on the
inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to best the rest. WHISKEY AND RYE chased the early pace and made a three to four wide
bid on the turn to loom boldly but came up empty in the stretch. COCONUT CAKE chased the early pace two to three wide swung out five wide for the drive
but had no rally. FED UP FIRED UP was not a factor.

Footnotes
ON THE LAM set the early pace on the inside while clear, then was headed on the turn and fell off the pace, then came again leaving the turn and vied for
command by the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. VICTORY GIVEN chased the early pace three wide, made a four wide
move on the turn to gain command by the quarter pole, but then wandered when straightened but did hold on to the place award. BIG HAMBONE was well
placed early on the inside, then eased off the inside and swung out five wide for the drive while making a bid, but needed more late while on the left lead.
COOKE BROTHERS was allowed to settle early on the inside, then shifted out to be three wide by the three sixteenths, then shifted in but had no late
punch. FRANKEE MERCH stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command between horses and weakened. KATHERN'S
JOY lacked a rally.
