Footnotes
CONUNDRUM QUEEN broke open the gate prior to the start, settled off the first flight for six furlongs near the inside, shifted three wide roused into the
stretch, kicked in on the far outside and was up at the wire. COCOA ICING tracked the leaders to the far turn, came four wide rallying into the lane, reached
the front outside CHICA BOOM in deep stretch but was nailed on the line. SINFULICIOUS broke slowly, saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out a
couple paths and finished willingly inside the top two. CHICA BOOM prompted CALI DIVINE from outside, bid between horses after six furlongs, edged to
the front through the furlong grounds, but was outkicked from there. CALI DIVINE took over from outside on the first turn, moved in showing the way to the
quarter-pole, and weakened into the stretch. ALWAYS EDEN broke slowly, and was no factor. GOLDLINER was outrun two wide. VARSITY KICKLINE
(IRE) veered out at the break spotting the field several lengths, and remained far back. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL led through the stretch the first time, bolted
entering the first turn, was pulled up and walked off. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CAPTURINI settled closest to the runaway pacesetter in the clear in the two path, reeled that foe in nearing the lane, was floated out turning for home,
drifted out while drawing clear under right-handed urging nearing the eighth pole, then straightened out and widened. LUNAR BLAST lacked speed, raced
four wide around the turn and rallied to gain the place in the final strides. FUTURE FLAY chased the pace three wide, moved into second nearing the eighth
pole but was one-paced through the lane and lost second late. JULIE BIRD (IRE) raced well back three wide, made some progress in upper stretch and
flattened out late. SHANGHAI KIMMY saved ground and failed to menace. K'S RUNNING FREE played no factor while racing three wide. PRETZEL was
outrun while racing two wide. MOONROCK was off a step slow, rushed up inside, sped clear, set the pace along the rail, drifted out nearing the lane and
wilted.

Footnotes
MISS CALIFORNIA was was off a step slow at the start and continued unhurried into the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the far turn, swung four
wide into the upper stretch, responded under left-handed pressure and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. HOLY BERRIES tracked the leader three wide up
the backstretch, launched a bid mid-way around the far turn, vied with UNBRIDLED GLITTER turning for home then shook free in the upper stretch,
continued to show the way into the final furlong then failed to hold off the late charge from the winner. STRAIGHT TO GO rated inside off the top trio,
launched a three wide bid late on the far turn, moved up into striking distance with a sixteenth left to run then finished evenly while remaining well clear over
the rest. PRESENCIA was off a step slow at the start and remained unhurried in the back, was ridden along five paths wide into the upper stretch, angled in
a couple paths under pressure and improved position. UNBRIDLED GLITTER stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a bid and vied with HOLY
BERRIES mid-way through the far turn then failed to keep pace in the upper stretch and steadily faded. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART raced off the pace four
to five wide, was ridden along the outside into the lane and failed to respond. STAKE N EGGZ opened up to a clear lead around the first turn and set the
pace up the backstretch, got collared mid-way around the final turn and steadily retreated. MORE GLORY settled three wide near mid-flight then retreated
after a half. FUNNY FACE drifted in sharply and steadied at the start, settled inside and faded around the final turn.

REINVESTMENT RISK stalked the pace three wide, took over readily approaching the quarter-pole and drove well clear through the final furlong. MILLIKEN
broke slowest, then steadied behind THINKABOUTIT in the ensuing strides, waited for room toward the inside midway on the turn, moved out four wide with
aim outside REINVESTMENT RISK at the top of the stretch, finished willingly but proved no match. NO QUE NO set the pace inside to late on the turn,
could not stay with the top two into the lane and ran on to salvage the show. GANGLY shifted out to the five-path late on the turn, and had no closing
response. THINKABOUTIT ducked into the gap shortly after the start, was righted at a cost of many lengths, and remained far back. KIDNAPPED vied early
outside NO QUE NO, and was through soon after going a half-mile.

FILLMORE EAST settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled to the rail nearing the eighth pole, bid inside of foes leaving that marker and edged
ahead under a drive. TURN IT ON raced in range two wide, angled three wide nearing the lane, took the lead outside of foes in midstretch, was unable to
match strides with the winner through the final sixteenth but stayed on to hold safe for the place. GREGS POSSE steadied at the start, raced well back
inside, went two wide around the turn and rallied inside for the show. SENORITA SALSA raced off the pace three and four wide, rallied outside and just
missed third. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) prompted the pace three wide and faded nearing the lane. TIDAL WATERS pressed the pace two wide, vied between
foes through midstretch then tired. FOR EVER OURS failed to menace while racing four wide. SHE'S CLASSY set a pressured pace inside and gave way
near the eighth pole. POLISHED LADY played no factor while racing four wide. BELLA SOFI was outrun inside. ADELE KAT was never involved.
BAHAMIAN BEAUTY saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA mildly prompted to clear the advantage and angled inside heading into the first turn, settled nicely while setting the pace by a comfortable
margin up the backstretch, widened advantage while still unleashed around the far turn, came two wide into the upper stretch and continued to dominate the
field racing in hand. INTO VANISHING was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled up two to three
wide around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and finished second best. IL MALOCCHIO secured inside position around the first turn,
rated while saving ground near midpack through early stages, launched a rail bid around the final turn, cut the corner entering the lane and sustained a
steady effort to secure show. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL tracked the pace three to four paths wide up the backstretch, prompted to advance nearing the quarter
pole, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and ran on evenly. KEY BISCAYNE raced three wide into the first turn then remained unhurried in
the back along the outside, swung five wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. HELPING LISA D settled two wide off the pace in early stages,
failed to progress under pressure around the far turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
UNPRECEDENTED sprinted to the front with an alert getaway, withstood a bid by SMOKIN RICHIE turning for home, then had enough to last over
RECONFIGURE while drifting out. RECONFIGURE raced three to four wide in midpack to the top of the stretch, rallied on the far outside and just missed.
SMOKIN RICHIE pressed UNPRECEDENTED from outside throughout, and weakened through deep stretch. KASIM broke a step slow, was outrun early,
inside, moved out for the drive and improved without threatening. TROPICAT chased two to three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing
response. LIKE WHAT I SEE went evenly inside and was no factor. LEGENDARY PRINCE broke a step slow, saved ground to the stretch, and faded.
AWESOME ANYWHERE was outrun two to three wide. FRENCHMEN STREET trailed inside.

PROPENSITY stalked the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, was immediately confronted by IMPRESSIVE SPEED, dug in inside of that
foe, dueled to the wire and prevailed. IMPRESSIVE SPEED tracked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, reached near even terms
outside of the winner leaving the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and just missed. MEAN MACHINE lacked early speed while racing two and three wide,
swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. MY MAN FLINT checked nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the
far turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch, bid nearing the eighth pole then flattened out late. RED MULE steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace
three wide around that bend then two wide around the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. UNIMPEACHED set the pace along
the rail to midstretch and weakened. SOUPER FORTUNE steadied entering the first turn, raced two wide in midpack and went evenly. NO DRAMA steadied
nearing the first turn, chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. DOUBLE BLESSING was outrun while racing four wide. RUN-UP AND
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE, FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ICONIC ADVENTURE settled nicely while rated four to five paths wide up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, vied four deep in
the final furlong, dug in gamely, edged away to a slim lead and held on. MAGIA NERA was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up
the backstretch, moved up to engage rivals for the lead at the three eighths pole, continued to battle into the final furlong, could not match strides with the
winner in deep stretch but stayed on gamely and captured show. MONTAUK POINT tracked the pace up the inside, chased two wide around the far turn,
angled to the rail at the head of the lane and moved up to duel for the lead, fought back along the rail into the final furlong then yielded nearing the wire.
PIONEERING SPIRIT settled nicely while rated between foes in early stages, chased four wide around the far turn then swung six wide into the upper
stretch, gathered strong momentum along the outside and was gaining fast to the wire. BOURBON HEIST stalked three wide up the backstretch, moved up
to duel for the lead at the three eighths pole, continued to battle back into the final furlong then lacked closing response. COMPLETE AGENDA raced two
wide near midpack, chased two wide around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and offered no late bid. MAKE WAY raced five wide off the pace,

Footnotes
STAR SEEKING (IRE) took charge early, rated along inside through an even pace, and widened through the stretch under a mild drive. QUEEN BOURBON
worked over to the inside early on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, and rallied to get the place without menacing the winner. TALKING BOOK
raced two wide in the second flight to the stretch, and picked up the show with a mild response. BLACK SAND (GB) was briefly in tight inside STAR
SEEKING into the first turn, moved out in pursuit up the backstretch, and weakened through the furlong grounds. CAROLINE'S STORY raced three wide on
the turns, and made no headway through the lane on the far outside. MAYBE LATER made no impact saving ground into the stretch. MAGNA MATER (IRE)
raced three wide, and tired after six furlongs. STARSHIP MALLOMAR never reached contention two wide. ISADORABLE AIDA was outrun inside.
APPLECROSS (IRE) dwelt spotting the field at least a half-dozen lengths, and trailed inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HIERRO set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of METEORITO when that foe reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled inside to deep stretch
then edged ahead late. METEORITO settled off the early pace outside, advanced two wide around the turn, reached even terms near the quarter pole,
dueled outside of the winner to deep stretch and was outfinished. WILD TEXAS TOM lacked speed, raced two wide around the turn and was along for the
show. VINNY DREAM chased the pace inside and had no response. KICK IN THE GAS had early speed between foes and retreated three wide around the
turn. WESTERLY WIND was outrun while saving ground around the turn and angling out in upper stretch. SPIN RATE was bumped between foes early and
played no factor while racing two wide. PALIZA came out and bumped SPIN RATE into KING SLEW soon after the start, had brief speed three wide,
faltered around the turn and was easing through the lane. KING SLEW (ARG) was bumped early, saved ground around the turn and retreated. A CLAIM OF
FOUL FROM THE TRAINER OF METEORITO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
LA MAQUINA held a slim lead around the first turn then dueled inside of FREDO up the backstretch, took on the added challenge of GROWTH CAPITAL
near the quarter pole, fought back gamely along the rail, refused to be denied, edged ahead to a slim lead and held firm. GROWTH CAPITAL stalked the
pace up the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, battled outside of LA MAQUINA into the lane, fought back gamely but
could not get by winner in final stages. DOUBLE CLUTCH raced three to four wide off the early pace, was ridden along four wide going by the quarter pole,
lugged in a couple path in the upper stretch, took closer order and captured show in final strides. CHASING THE CROWN rated three to four wide near
midpack, launched an outside bid late on the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and got outdueled for show. URBAN FOREST settled and saved ground
through early stages, continued inside through the far turn, raced in traffic in the upper stretch, shifted out five wide near the furlong marker and improved
late. VOCALIZE rated two wide just off the early pace, raced between foes around the far turn then ran on evenly in the lane. HILARIOUS AFFAIR settled
two to three wide off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. THISTLE was unhurried and saved ground,
swung wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. SON OF LIBERTY secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch,
launched a rail bid around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. CHELSEA DAGGER settled off the early pace, was
ridden along three wide around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and failed to kick on. FREDO vied in opening stages then drifted out briefly entering
the first turn, came back in and moved up to challenge the eventual winner for the early lead, dueled through the backstretch and battled on around the final
turn then came up tired in the drive. CITRUS BOY steadied sharply shortly after the start, lost all momentum and dropped back, continued reserved in the
back and failed to move into contention. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
