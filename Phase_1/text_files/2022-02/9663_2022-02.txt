Footnotes
JR'S PACIFICO went to the front, drove clear, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. XANTHUS WRATH raced in the middle of the
field, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. JALAPENO SUPREME pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
lacked a late kick. BOOGIE DOWN broke a step slow, made a steady gain, but was no factor. PALIMONIUM raced near the middle of the field, saved
ground around the turn, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. THE Z MAN raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and weakened.
OUR CORNERSTONE void of early speed, finished wide and showed little. UNSOLVED always raced near the back and was outrun. DIRTY DAWG was
loose behind the gates before the start, raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. CORN SOUP was an early factor and
dropped back.

YANK CRIME vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. WILD FIREMAKER
pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. DAPPER DAN MAN raced in the middle of the pack,
made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two. SAILING JETT dueled on the front end and faded down the home stretch. COUNTERFEIT raced near
the back, steadied, while drifting out around the first turn, came around the second turn wide and was never a threat. JUSTA SWINGING lacked early
speed, raced wide around the first turn and showed little. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE raced within contention and dropped back. FLASHBURN raced within
striking distance, came around the final turn wide and stopped.

wire. OAK HILL SENIORITA pressed the pace, saved ground, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. OVERLY SWEET void of early
speed, moved up on the rail around the second turn, gained ground and was a clear third. STANDUPDON'TKNEEL went to the front, drove clear and faded
down the home stretch. HALO'S SONG raced evenly near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and was never a factor. CUSTOM MAIDEN

Footnotes
NO QUARTER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. MY FORTUNATE SON lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, rallied wide down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. DIXIELAND MUSIC raced near the back, made a late inside bid and ran
a game third. GUN WAR raced within striking distance and finished willingly. IMA SUNNY SONG bumped start, went to the front, drove clear, saved ground
around the turn and lacked a late kick. EBONY FLASH raced within contention, came around the turn three wide and faded. MR LEO raced near the back
and was never a factor. THIRTYEIGHT bumped at the start, raced near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
NATE'S WAY challenged for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, pulled away down the lane and proved the best. ROUX GA ROUX raced
near the back in the beginning, came around the turn wide, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. DARE FELIX lacked early
speed, saved ground around the turn, made a late rail bid and was a clear third. POWERSHOT void of early speed and passed tired ones late. MIDNIGHT
SPIRIT pressed the early pace and weakened. VICTORY TRIP flashed early speed and made a steady retreat. CHASIN GRACIE pressed the pace, came
around the turn on the outside and dropped back.

Footnotes
CHAOSMOS unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide bid and got up in time. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI
sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was caught late. SIR BRONX pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the
top two. MR MAKEITHAPPEN lacked early speed, raced near the back, moved up strong around the final turn and hung down the home stretch. NIPPY
RED raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. BUCK DYNASTY raced within contention, faded and finished evenly. ONE KING CAT had
a tight start and was never close. SLAMMIN' MIKE always raced near the back and showed little. ADIOS YANKEE pressed the early pace and dropped
back.
