Footnotes
SING ALONG SUZY, in touch with the pacesetter three deep attending that rival's tempo through the backstretch, pressed outside that rival racing through
the turn, took over nearing upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. BABY BEE MERRY, urged between foes to gain the advantage in the
opening furlong, shifted to the inside leaving the chute to dictate the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, proved no match for the winner racing into upper
stretch but was best of the others. TALE OF V K, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, faded into upper stretch. LEA ME ALONE, off
slowly, was settled outside foes tracking the pace but proved no threat. MY BLONDE MARY switched off the inside in early stages tracking just off the
leaders between foes but emptied out early.

Footnotes
MA COCO, shuffled back avoiding close quarters at the start, was righted to track off the second flight on the backstretch, came under prompting to
advance while shifting out leaving the turn, was fanned four wide racing through upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail in time
under left handed pressure. MILENITA, forwardly placed racing just inside the pacesetter in the opening stages, conceded some position to track just inside
that rival racing into the turn, came through to challenge for command in upper stretch, struck the front between calls late but couldn't quite contain the
winner's late kick. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ ducked in at the start, was righted, then urged three deep prompting the pace racing past the chute, shifted
inwards nearing the turn to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage just off the inside to upper stretch, then weakened when failing to match the top pair in
the last furlong. SENA THE DUCHESS tipped out early tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, was urged to challenge three deep between
foes entering upper stretch but faded in late stages. RANSOMS REWARD tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight on the backstretch but steadily
faded nearing the lane. LA MAGNOLIA was urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening quarter but gave way early. CHILLAXIN was off slowly
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FULL SCREEN, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, threaded his way through racing through the chute to dispute the lead inside a rival racing into
the first turn, gained the advantage entering the backstretch, held sway to the second bend, came under correction while drifting out markedly entering the
far turn crossing into the path of BENNY'S FIDDLE, continued to dispute the issue outside foes racing three, then four wide into upper stretch and came
under some right handed pressure to maintain a narrow advantage to the end. KARL CARES, held up avoiding some traffic leaving the chute, settled
outside foes, was prompted to split rivals three deep racing into the far turn gaining on the leaders, angled inwards nearing the lane and continued with
interest between foes to just prevail for the place honors in time. STRONG EAGLE was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, split foes
just off the inside advancing on the leaders on the far turn, tipped out three wide to bid inside the winner in the closing stages and continued willingly while
missing for second. SIR SAFFER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled inside the winner to bid for command
between foes on the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. MOON DOG tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight to the backstretch, advanced
inside foes to lodge a brief bid for command on the far turn but soon emptied out. BAGE, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out four wide
racing into the lane but had no rally. KUNIK settled between foes in the last flight early, shifted to the inside on the backstretch making some brief progress
but came up empty racing through the far turn. MACHINEGUNPREACHER settled last early and failed to menace. POINT TO THE STARS, caught four,
then five wide racing to the first turn, was prompted with an early move to advance three deep on the leaders racing through the backstretch but emptied out
entering the far turn. BENNY'S FIDDLE broke sharply, was urged to set the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing to the first turn, was carried
out by the eventual winner nearing the three furlong marker and gave way abruptly.

Footnotes
SASSY BEAST broke readily, prompted the pace between rivals through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn, took over entering upper stretch
and went clear under firm encouragement. BAHAMIAN MOON, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue
through the turn to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while best of the others. DARK HONEY, urged along the inside dictating the pace
through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner through the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. FRU FRU ZAN, urged along
four wide on the backstretch pursuing the leaders, shifted to the inside racing through the turn but lacked the needed late bid. CAUGHT UP IN YOU broke
outwards bumping SARA MIA at the start, settled last early and passed inside tiring rivals in the closing stages. TEXAS MAGIC tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the turn and faded early. SARA MIA, bumped at the start, settled outside a rival in early stages and failed to menace.

Footnotes
COPACETIC was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, took
over while shifting well off the inside racing into upper stretch and widened the advantage late under firm encouragement. EXCEPT TEMPTATION
exchanged bumps with LALOBA FEROZ at the start, was righted to off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while
shifting out three pursuing the eventual winner into the lane but couldn't gain terms with that foe while proving best of the others. MO GIRL, reserved
between foes dropping off the second flight, conceded some position under patient handling on the backstretch, then continued with interest between foes in
the closing stages to narrowly prevail for a share in time. LALOBA FEROZ exchanged bumps at the start, then bobbled when clipping heels, was collected,
then pulled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position between foes racing through the backstretch, swung out four
wide nearing the lane while being roused to advance but lacked the needed final kick. TRANQUILLINA, reserved in early stages, angled to the inside racing
to the backstretch, gained some position while coming around tiring foes into the stretch but lacked the needed final response. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK,
urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, briefly contested the issue inside the eventual winner
and gave way into upper stretch. PRUDENT SONG, in touch prompting the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, gave way after a half. CHANSON,
caught wide racing to the first turn, proved no threat. STARSHIP UNICA flashed brief pace three deep racing to the first turn but was spent early.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT STROLL vied for command between foes a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn, tipped
out while gaining a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. QUALITY tracked off the first flight outside a rival
racing to the backstretch, shifted to the four path racing through the far turn while being urged to advance, then continued in that path to the end while
edging a rival for the place honors. TAKE A STAND joined the pace four wide racing to the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the second bend to press the
issue outside the eventual winner through the far turn, continued in pursuit of that foe in the three path into the lane, then angled inwards late to just lose
second nearing the wire. UNBRIDLED ENSIGN, bumped at the start, was urged inside rivals prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued in
pursuit of the leaders into the far turn and gave way late. AULENTI broke outwards bumping UNBRIDLED DESIGN at the start, was collected to track off the
first flight near the inside to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance nearing the far turn but steadily faded after five furlongs. SWEET
SENSATION broke slowly losing position to the field and never menaced thereafter. MAJESTIC UNION was urged three wide between foes prompting the
pace from the outset to the backstretch but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
WICKED GROOVE angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance under light reserve, steadily gained position
inside foes after five furlongs, switched off the inside to bid for command between foes approaching the quarter marker, pressed the issue in the three path
racing into upper stretch and edged forward in time under firm left handed pressure. PUGILIST broke readily, was urged prompting a rival's pace racing to
the backstretch, took over nearing the far turn, continued a bit off the rail resisting the winner's bid leaving the far turn to late stages but proved only second
best. LADY DOMINANCE, reserved off the second flight along the inside for the opening six furlongs, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch to bid
inside the top pair entering the lane but couldn't gain even terms while prevailing for a share. SHE FLED THE SCENE was rated along the rail in the
opening stages, tipped out three wide on the backstretch tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn, was fanned four wide entering upper stretch and
continued evenly. C'EST MARDI tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch and
continued evenly. ZERENIA, reserved along the inside to the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression while
gaining some position. HOITY TOITY, urged to the lead along the rail leaving the chute, disputed the pace along the inside to the far turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch. CLASSY OF COURSE, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but never seriously menaced.
GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, reserved outside foes to the backstretch, proved no factor. WORKING OVERTIME dropped out early.

Footnotes
WATER WIZARD broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, forged clear into upper stretch and held sway on
a comfortable margin under firm left handed encouragement. THE JOKES ON ME tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing
through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch, came in under pressure in late stages but prevailed for the place honors. J D'S VISTA
settled along the inside in early stages, saved ground through the bend gaining some position, tipped off the inside midstretch to advance three deep
between foes, but altered course five wide in the closing stages when losing her path but continued well enough to prevail for a share. RED PRIESTESS
tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance inside a rival as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest
inside foes to the end while being just outkicked for a share. NY BETH GETSITDONE, urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside in the opening
stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders into the turn, shifted out three deep entering the stretch and faded between foes late. THATS ALL SHEWROTE,
urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset to the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and gave way. LADY PAYNTER settled
between foes in the last flight early and never menaced. CRYSTAL LAGOON, caught four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing
the turn but never proved a serious factor. CALIFORNIA REIGN tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded
nearing upper stretch. EXAGGERATED MOMENT, caught five wide on the backstretch, came under pressure early and soon dropped out. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE RIDER OF J D'S VISTA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE JOKES ON ME ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
LATE STRETCH, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
EL PILLO, pulled a bit against restraint stalking just outside the pacesetter to the far turn, was prompted to take over and go clear with a sharp move nearing
upper stretch, held sway on a clear margin past the furlong marker and held the late challenge of AND WON under firm handling. The latter tracked just off
the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady gain in that path in late stages to close the gap on the winner but
proved only second best. MOTATAABEQ, reserved in the last flight along the inside for six furlongs, tipped out racing into upper stretch, split foes three
deep racing past the furlong marker, then angled inside the top pair while just missing for second. DAZZLING TRUTHS, bumped at the start, was righted to
track between foes off the second flight to the far turn, switched out four wide nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick. INITFORTHELOVE worked
his way to the inside racing to the backstretch tracking behind the second flight, shifted out nearing the lane and continued evenly. MYSTIC LINK angled to
the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. BIRD'S EYE VIEW, reserved along the
inside for the opening six furlongs, swung out nearing upper stretch but lacked a rally. VICARAGE settled outside a rival racing to the backstretch but failed
to menace. SMALL HOPE stumbled at the start, switched off the inside tracking the pace behind the second flight, was caught four wide racing into the far
turn and steadily faded. MISSIONATTHESPA broke out bumping a rival, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch,
held sway to the second bend and gave way abruptly once headed nearing upper stretch.
