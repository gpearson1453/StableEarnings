Footnotes
DEFIBRILLATOR tracked the pace, chased inside on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, gained a short lead past the eighth pole, then dueled with
ADMIRAL EASTWOOD in deep stretch and prevailed. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD raced off the pace inside, was in tight and checked at the three eighths pole,
dropped back a bit, moved back up entering the stretch, rallied on the rail in the final furlong, dueled late and was outfinished. LAZARETTO stalked the
pace, bid on the turn, dueled with FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL, was floated wide by that rival passing the quarter pole, then dug in through the lane and won the
show photo. PRIVATE NETWORK chased between rivals, raced three wide on the turn, rallied mildly and just missed for third. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL
steadied soon after the start, quickly recovered and made a clear lead, dueled on the turn, drifted out at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. DOUGIE
raced off the pace, went three or four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. WICK was outrun. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of ADMIRAL EASTWOOD
against the winner was dismissed.

BIG CITY RALPH raced five wide early, settled off the pace, moved up two wide on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail in the
final sixteenth and was going best late for the win. DUBROVSKY raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied alongside BIG CITY
RALPH in the stretch drive, closed between horses late and dug in gamely to the finish. MY TRAIN raced five wide early, then cleared the field and opened
up, showed the way into the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and weakened late. PRETENDANT raced four wide early, settled off the pace and
closed belatedly inside. FOREST FIRE settled off the pacesetter in the second spot, chased on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. DARK AGES raced
two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn and then flattened out. FED FEVER raced off the pace inside and did not factor. AULD LANGE SYNE
tracked on the inside and faded. PER THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, BIG CITY RALPH HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST

NOT A TRACE set a pressured pace inside, was collared at the quarter pole, came out under left handed whip through the stretch and held gamely.
GLOWING STAR prompted the pace outside, earned a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was carried out in the stretch and could not get by. FED POLICY
settled inside then continued well along the inside through the stretch. PENANCE bore out soon after the start, rushed wide to contention then went evenly
late. FRISKY FEELING chased outside, moved very wide on the final turn and stretch. MINESHAFT MAGIC moved close up inside briefly then stopped
losing contact with her field. Following a stewards inquiry and a claim of foul by the rider of the second finisher against the first finisher for interference in the
stretch, NOT A TRACE was disqualified and placed second..

WE BE THERE raced three wide off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied steadily to the front, drew clear nearing
the sixteenth marker and then dug in gamely late to prevail. ALONZO MOSELY raced off the pace, four wide on the backside, continued three or four wide
on the far turn, rallied into the stretch, closed steadily in the lane and dug in gamely between rivals to the wire. DONT BREAK THE LAW hesitated and was
off slowly, outrun early, came five wide into the lane and rallied steadily outside in deep stretch. GO HUSKIES bobbled at the break, raced off the pace
inside and closed belatedly inside for fourth. MR. TUTTLE vied two wide for the lead, dueled into the far turn, shook clear, battled in upper stretch and then
weakened. I'M BLAMING YOU raced off the pace between rivals, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. AUSTIN WHYLIE was outrun early
and did not factor. MAJESTIC SKY vied inside for the lead, dueled into the far turn and faded. GRAZELY raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased
and gave way.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP reserved early, advanced inside after the half, led at the eighth pole and pulled clear under moderate coaxing. SECRET PATH pursued
the loose pacesetter, took over at the three eighths pole, bid clear but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. HARD STING far back early, rallied
on the final turn then flattened out late. GIOCARE trailed far behind, offered a mild rally late but was never in contention. EDDIE'S CHARGE settled inside
down the backstretch then was finished by the far turn. ICY DUDE lacked speed inside and was always outrun. RONIN WARRIOR hustled to the front,
widened after half a mile then stopped. MIDLANER raced within range briefly then gave way readily.

MY FRIENDS BEER stalked three pacesetter, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside rivals into the stretch, gained a short lead and edged
away for the win. THE ANGRY MAN tracked along the inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside through the
lane and earned the place spot. EL HERMANO raced three wide early, settled off the pace, came wide into the lane, rallied and finished well. ZIPPY
stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and gained mildly. LONG GRAY LINE raced off the pace, moved up between
rivals and lacked a rally. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled between rivals turning for home and weakened in the final
furlong. KOAN raced off the pace between foes, three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. COMMISSIONER G raced four wide early, settled three
wide off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
TOMARIE pursued loose pacesetter, wore down that rival passing the eighth pole and moved clear drifting in slightly late AEGEAN SEA took control inside,
widened before the half, was collared near midstretch and steadied tiring. LEADER OF THE BAND broke slowly, chased wide, angled inside on the final
turn and stretch then flattened out. LULA'S ROADRUNNER trailed for half a mile then moved wide with a mild rally. SOUR MASH moved close up inside
then gave way readily. EXCITABLE LADY settled off the leaders and weakened steadily. MS CANELA raced outside off the leaders and stopped abruptly.
