HOCKEY PUCK was well placed throughout while three wide, then was roused by the five sixteenths to make a bid, went on even terms for command by
the furlong marker, then had a long drive with TRIPLE A. PLUS and slowly edged clear late, driving. TRIPLE A. PLUS vied for the early lead three wide,
then went on to set the pace down the backstretch and move to the inside while clear, then was headed by the furlong marker and dug in gamely but was
outfinished. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated off the pace on the inside, swung out five wide for the drive but had no
kick. INSPIRED OPTIONS chased the early pace two wide and then was on the inside on the far turn and had no rally. COPPERHEAD CREEK broke
outwardly at the start, then was rated along four wide and came five wide into the drive and had no response.

WIRETAP was rated along three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then slowly wore down MORGANS MELODY late to edge away late under
strong left handed crop urging. MORGANS MELODY dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole then
dug in gamely in the stretch but was caught around the sixteenth pole and could not go with the winner late, clearly second best. NOTE TO SELFIE was
allowed to settle early, then was two wide by the quarter pole, angled out by the furlong marker and was along for the show award. CUCKOO
FORCONONUTS stalked the pace four wide and weakened. HILL VALLEY dueled for the lead on the inside and then drifted out around the furlong marker
and weakened.

Footnotes
KATESALUCKYGIRL dueled for the early lead three wide, then made a bid and dropped down to the inside on the turn, dueled for command by the quarter
pole, then had a long drive with TIME'S ON MY SIDE and held on gamely under a drive. TIME'S ON MY SIDE pressed the early pace four wide and made a
three wide bid on the turn to duel with the winner by the quarter pole and had a long drive with that rival but was outfinished to just miss. MELODIA was
allowed to settle early and advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the drive and offered a mild late rally. FALSE RULING dueled for the lead on
the inside and weakened. LACOUGRA vied for the early lead in between horses and stopped.
