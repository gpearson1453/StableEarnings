Footnotes
BENEVENGO switched out four wide in the opening stages to gain a position just outside the first flight, advanced entering the turn to press the issue three
deep, lugged inwards under pressure racing into upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, then went clear under firm encouragement. ISLE OF
SKYE, urged inside foes to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage on the backstretch, dueled for command inside rivals through the turn to upper stretch,
but proved no match for the winner late while saving the place honors. LIVEFORTHESONG ducked inwards soon after the start dropping off the field,
gradually gathered momentum shifting off the inside racing through the turn, raced five wide entering upper stretch and produced a steady late response to
improve position nearing the wire. PAYITO, in touch with the leaders three deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards entering the turn to press the issue
between foes through the bend and gave way approaching upper stretch. KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the
turn but offered no closing response. PROFESSOR J tracked off the first flight a rival racing to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. TAP THE CANDY
angled inwards while being prompted to briefly contest the pace between foes but emptied out abruptly racing into the turn. SIDNEY'S BID was held up
avoiding close quarters at the start, settling well off the leaders and never menaced thereafter. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE OWNER OF PAYITO
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED,

Footnotes
SPARKLING PLENTY, urged inside foes through the backstretch prompting the pace, edged forward racing into the turn and steadily widened the margin
under pressure to the end. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX settled off the second flight in early stages, swung outside foes while being prompted to advance
entering the turn, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and proved best of the others. RED PRIESTESS, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the
opening stages, continued in that path outside foes into the turn prompting the leaders but weakened in the drive. C'EST PARTI tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the turn, angled out six wide racing through the lane but finished evenly. CHIACHIARONE, off a step slowly, passed only tiring rivals.
LYLA'S MARK tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, was prompted to gain some position on the bend but faded into upper
stretch. LADY PAYNTER tracked off the first flight between foes and faded early. HELLO PRINCESS flashed brief pace between foes but retreated early.
ROYAL GOLD DIGGER joined the pace four wide racing past the chute, angled inwards pressing the issue outside the eventual winner on a narrow
advantage nearing the turn but gave way after a half. MISCHIEF REIGNS broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

five path racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. CREATIVE CHOICE angled inwards tracking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight while conceding some ground to that foe on the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch to bid between foes
entering the lane but was just outkicked. ASSERT DOMINANCE tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide in
late stages and continued willingly. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked the leader three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to bid in that
path racing into upper stretch, struck the front entering the lane but flattened out late. PALACE SINGER, reserved along the inside racing behind the second
flight to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came around a tiring foe to advance inside foes but had no final bid. CAPE HEDGE settled between
foes in the last flight early and never gained contention. LET'S TRY AN ALIAS, reserved three deep between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
never gained contention. SETTE STELLE settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. FLORIDA PHARAOH, urged to the lead while
angling inside leaving the chute, went well clear along the rail racing into the backstretch, held sway into the far turn and emptied out abruptly once headed
racing into upper stretch.

ODDS ON broke readily to gain the advantage, vied for command between foes in the opening furlong, conceded the lead while shifting inside the
pacesetter nearing the turn, was urged to lodge a second challenge just off the inside between foes racing into the stretch and held PREFERRED
OUTCOME safe to the end in a prolonged drive. The latter tracked just off the leaders along the inside on the backstretch, advanced along the rail to
challenge inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but was just outkicked to the wire. MR LIGHTNING BOY broke a bit awkwardly at the start,
settled into stride along the inside then continued with interest into to the lane to improve position inside foes while prevailing for a share. HOT AND HEAVY
joined the pace three wide in early stages, drifted out four wide losing some ground to the leaders on the bend and lacked the needed final kick. TWO THE
PUNCH tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, angled five wide entering the stretch but made no real impression. I KICKN,
urged inside foes disputing the pace, gained the advantage nearing the turn, shifted to the three path entering the bend and gave way between foes in
upper stretch. GEMO, slow to gather stride, tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but had no closing bid. CANDY MY BOY failed to
menace.

TIZ TRIUMPHANT was urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, met a challenge from the inside after a half, turned
back foes to edge clear leaving midstretch and widened the margin late under some right handed pressure. SKILLFUL settled off the second flight outside
foes in early, angled inwards on the backstretch, tipped out racing through the far turn to split foes three deep in late stages and proved best of the others.
GIVE ME TWO STEPS, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, tracked outside foes in second flight on the backstretch,
gained some position four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. STARSHIP OREO tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing to the first turn, came through inside that foe after a half to press the issue into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch but
faded late. ROLL ON DUDE, in touch with the pacesetter racing to the first turn prompting the pace, continued three deep into the far turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch. RIP IT RYAN, bumped soundly at the start, recovered to gain some position while switching outside foes on the backstretch, was
caught five wide racing into the far turn but had no rally. SIAKAM tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted to the inside on the
far turn and faded into upper stretch. MORE CHANCES broke out bumping RIP IT RYAN soundly at the start, pulled her way to the contention along the
inside in the opening half but retreated early. ACTION WARRIOR, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, soon dropped out. COMMANDER KEITH tracked

Footnotes
SHESASCOLDASICE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in early stages, pressed the issue racing into the far turn, went clear entering the lane and
just lasted under right handed pressure to prevail. ENDLESS stalked just off the leaders along the inside, tipped out three wide racing into the stretch to
challenge for command late and just missed. DANCING SOPHIA was rated off the second flight while angling inwards to the backstretch, tipped a bit off the
inside on the far turn while being prompted to advance, angled inside the leaders in late stretch but continued willingly to gain position inside the top pair.
BELLA CASCATA, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the far turn
and gave way into the stretch. RIPLEY EFFECT tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn, was caught in traffic nearing the lane, then
angled inwards in the closing stages to gain some position while no real threat. CURRENT CAUSE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, steadied avoiding traffic nearing upper stretch, then switched outside rivals while making an effort to improve position. CUPIDS DREAM
tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn, lost some ground avoiding traffic nearing the lane and had no closing response. HER NAME IS
LOLA tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. WASSER was settled outside foes in the
last flight to the backstretch, was forced wide nearing upper stretch avoiding traffic and lacked a rally. HALLANVAARA ducked in at the start, was righted to
track behind the second flight along the rail, was prompted to advance inside foes racing through the far turn, checked out of tight quarters nearing the
quarter mile marker, then walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
RUN NEARING THE STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MY SARASOTA STAR broke sharply, was urged clear along the inside racing into the bend, held sway on a comfortable shifting a bit off the rail racing into
upper stretch and just held the challenge of LADY JEAN under firm right handed encouragement. The latter tracked off the second flight outside foes on the
backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders racing into the lane, shifted three deep midstretch while moving to close the gap on the winner to the end and
just missed. BELLARIFIC broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing into the turn, steadily closed the gap on the winner between
foes entering upper stretch, but finished evenly while racing in some close quarters nearing the wire. PRINCESS LIVIA, urged inside foes after the break to
gain a position inside a rival tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing into the turn, steadily faded midstretch. KITTY KITTY tracked off the second flight
between foes racing into the bend and continued evenly to late stages. ALL GOOD TIMES settled last, angled outside rivals entering the stretch and made
an effort to improve her position three deep in the lane to finish on even terms with a rival at the wire. BUMBLELICIOUS tracked off the second flight inside
rivals racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. BALLET SCHOOL settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the turn and offered no
rally. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BELLARIFIC LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN

Footnotes
FALL MOON was rated outside rivals in the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling four deep on the far turn, was
prompted to advance while fanned five wide into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. SWEET MOOCHIE settled in the last flight along
the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half, was prompted to advance on the leaders while fanned four wide into upper stretch, couldn't
match the winner's kick but narrowly prevailed for the place honors between foes on the wire. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE tracked the leaders outside a rival in
second flight to the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter racing into the far turn to wrest the advantage after six furlongs, edged clear midstretch but
failed to sustain that momentum. MUSETTA settled outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned wide into the stretch but lacked the needed final kick
while missing for a share. LULLABY LAND tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but
flattened out leaving the furlong marker. NANCY WORK tracked off the second flight early, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid.
KISSMELIPS was urged to the lead while angling inside, dueled for command inside a rival to the backstretch, dispatched that foe to gain a clear advantage
racing to the far turn but gave way once headed nearing the lane. ISLAND MAGIC angled inwards while being prompted to force the pace outside a rival
racing to the backstretch but was spent early. SUNNYMEDE DREAM BROKE THROUGH THE GATE PRIOR TO THE START AND RAN LOOSE ON THE
COURSE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, DELAYING PROCEEDINGS AND NECESSITATING HER LATE SCRATCH. ROSE E HOLIDAY WAS SCRATCHED
AT THE GATE BEFORE THE FIELD WAS RELOADED FOR THE RACE ON THE ADVICE OF THE TRACK VETERINARIAN.
