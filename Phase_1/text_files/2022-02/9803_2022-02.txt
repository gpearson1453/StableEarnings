BAVARIA set the early pace while racing in the two path, then turned back the bid from TRENDING UP on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, then
drew out in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. TRENDING UP prompted the winner and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the
drive, second best. SIMMONS was well rated early, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then lugged in by the furlong marker and held show award
late. CRYPT was off slowly, then advanced on the inside by the quarter pole but lacked the needed winning bid in the drive. TUCKERTON BAY was on the
inside into the first turn, then checked repeatedly on the first turn then by the five eighths marker, weakened. LONG TOM was void of early speed, then
failed to menace.

MAXIMUS AURELIUS stalked the early pace three wide, then when ready on the turn made a two wide bid and quickly drew clear, then drew off leaving the
turn and then widened the margin while being ridden out. URBAN MYTH was rated along the inside down the backstretch, then eased out and advanced
three wide on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. KINSALER was away alertly and soon clear to set the early pace on
the inside, then was headed by the winner on the turn and gave way, bested rest. SPOOKY ONE stumbled at the start, chased the pace four wide down the
backstretch and tired.
