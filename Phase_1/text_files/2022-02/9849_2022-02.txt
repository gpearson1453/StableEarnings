lead but could not contain winner while best of the rest. WEEKEND PASS unhurried early, widest into far turn and rallied along for show. CHELICHNA raced
evenly while inside most the way with no late kick when needed. RUBYINTHESTARS good position to far turn with no late response when needed.
STORMY MATTIE was through after the half and dropped back. DEVILISH TRUTH tracked from three wide to the half and gave way thereafter. ANNIE

UNCAPPED inside position to turn, battled gamely stretch run to earn the nod under good handling. STRUGAR good position to turn, four wide into stretch
but outgamed late. LITTLE KANSAS tracked three wide to stretch, between horses late out gamed. TALE OF FAME up to the lead, dueled through the
stretch, battled, used up. BOA NOVA (IRE) wide trip to the turn, lacked late response in the drive. WAR STROLL never menaced. LOST IN MANHATTAN
could not keep up outside and never a factor. UNCLE EARL pressed pace to the half, faltered in the stretch run. CANDY CANE LANE never a factor.
CORNBREAD HILL inside trip to save ground, no avail.

BEATBOX broke awkward and unhurried to far turn, circled field, turned for home on the wrong lead, switched quickly and proved much the best. MR
DUMAS three wide run to far turn, roused past the quarter pole to run run on for place and bested the rest. SPECTACULAR GEM was bothered a bit at the
start with no speed to far turn, settled in and rallied on for the show spot. BIG DREAMING raced between horses up close with no late response in the
stretch and vanned off following the finish. POLE SETTER speed to the front, stayed to quarter pole but weakened in the stretch run. FANCY LIQUOR
chased leader to the half but gave in and faded back in the stretch. SUGOI was through after a half and gave way readily. THE MILE TIME WAS
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LEBLON well placed while never far back, rallied out of the far turn, ran clear stretch to hold sway at the wire. CAN'TBETEMALL broke slow, raced wide to
the half, made up ground in the stretch run for the place spot. BAKWENA unhurried to far turn, rallied widest in stretch to gain show spot. COUNTER
OFFER perfect position to far turn with no late kick in the stretch run. TIZ OUR TURN pressed pace three wide to far turn, gained a short lead but faltered in
the stretch. BUGLE BARRY broke a bit awkward, never far back to quarter pole with nothing left and weakened. SCALES OF JUSTICE inside run to far
turn, angled out with nothing left in the drive. EL AHIJADO speed between horses to the half, gave in readily and faded back. HARD RYE GUY never
menaced. WILE E PEYOTE was through at the half and gave way readily. JUULSTONE flashed inside speed to far turn but dropped back steadily
thereafter.
