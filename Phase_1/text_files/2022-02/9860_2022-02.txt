in mid pack, raced between through the turn, was no match late and finished second best. SEVEN ROONEY pressed the early pace, took a brief lead
through the turn and weakened. I AM A SOUL MAN was void of any speed, went three wide into the turn and passed tired rivals. TAB ME OUT was up
close from between rivals and gave way. SANDIA'S BEST was reserved early, raced seven wide through the turn and offered no rally. GOLD MIST was
taken back early, raced nine wide and never fired. WILD FIREWATER was allowed to settle early, raced eight wide and was empty. EL MAFIA set a
pressured early pace from off the rail and faded.THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BELLA DONA tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up and held. CORRINA CORRINA was
void of any early speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out, was closing and was clearly second best. DESERT SPIRIT was unhurried
early, raced eight wide through the second turn and was along for third. RIGHT FOR YOU was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the second
turn and weakened. BERNICE WHO was taken back early, raced five wide into the second turn and never fired. LA DIAMANT was reserved early, raced
between rivals and flattened out. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was outrun early, raced along the inside and offered no rally. DELIA set a pressured early pace,
raced off the rail and tired. RUNNING FOR GRACE pressed the early pace, raced between rivals and gave way. HOLLYWOOD PRINCESS raced in mid
