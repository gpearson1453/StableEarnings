Footnotes
CLOCHARD STREET chased the early pace to the turn, closed on the pacesetter approaching the quarter-marker, battled with RUN LIKE KONA to the
sixteenth marker and shook free into the late stages, was pressured by STAND IN YOUR LOVE in the end but just lasted under firm urging. STAND IN
YOUR LOVE sat just off of the pace, was four wide along the turn, was roused in upper stretch, closed well in the late stages to pressure the winner in the
end but just missed for the win while besting the rest. RUN LIKE KONA was away alertly and was sent to set the pace, was headed by CLOCHARD
STREET approaching the quarter-marker, battled with the winner to the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in the end, while holding for third. AFTER
SUNDOWN was under a tight hold while tracking the pace to the turn, saved ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the late stages. AMBA was
unprepared at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase the fractions while outside of rivals on the turn and made a mild late gain in the end.
GARDEES WORLD chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn and was not a factor.

GET'EM TIGER was off alertly and was sent to set the pace through the turn, shook free of a pressing rival leaving the bend, was kept to task through the
lane and drew clear in the final stages. SHOUT IT OUT stalked the pace outside of rivals on the turn, gained ground into the stretch run and was outkicked
in the end, while besting the rest. HALF HOPING saved ground while tracking the pace through the turn, swung widest into the stretch and rallied in the late
going to secure the show. LAST INNING pressed the pace to the turn from a two wide position, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late
stages. THISONESFORBARRY hopped at the start and was away slowly leaving the break, was outrun to the turn and lacked a late response.

PERFECTLY JULIE was away alertly and took command of the early pace into the turn, felt pressure from LOCHMARA nearing the quarter-marker, shook
free of that rival leaving the bend and pulled away in the end. LIVIN' AT THE BU stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, was outkicked by the
winner in the late stages but kept on to be best of the rest. LOCHMARA brushed ELIANA CHAMP leaving the break when that foe broke out, chased the
pace to the turn, mounted a two wide bid to challenge PERFECTLY JULIE approaching the two-furlong marker, was repelled in that effort and weakened in
the late going. ROSARITA CARMELITA chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and tired in the stretch run. ELIANA CHAMP broke out and was away
awkwardly at the start, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

SACRED BEAUTY was away in good order and was sent to set the pace through the second turn, was headed by GOLD RUSH GAL at the quarter-marker,
battled with that foe through the stretch run, edged away in the final stages but was confronted late by the runner-up and held on to prevail. REMEMBER
SUE settled just off of the early pace while outside of rivals, improved position on the second turn while three wide, continued that rally into the stretch run,
closed on the top pair in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while edging out GOLD RUSH GAL for the place. GOLD RUSH GAL tracked the pace
from a two wide path through the backstretch run, closed on SACRED BEAUTY approaching the two furlong marker, battled with the winner through the
lane and was bested in the end while just missing for the win and place. CARASYNTHIA sat just off of the pace while saving ground through the second
turn, was in tight quarters leaving the second turn, lacked room throughout the stretch run and was outfinished in the end. TEXAS CHARM settled just off of
the pace while close up through the second turn, swung widest into the drive and lacked a late rally.

AMERICAN FARMER was floated five wide along the first turn then tucked in to settle off of the early pace, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, overtook
FREEPORT JOE leaving the furlong grounds, could not completely shake free from that rival in the end but held to prevail. FREEPORT JOE settled just off
of the early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground from a three wide path on the second turn, could not hold off AMERICAN FARMER in the drive but
kept on in the end and held for the place. HARMON saved ground while stalking the pace through backstretch run, steadily gained ground along the second
turn and into the stretch drive, split foes inside of the furlong grounds and was outclosed in the end while just missing for second. NERO prompted the pace
through the first half-mile, vied for the lead approaching the quarter-marker, was still in contention at the furlong marker and weakened in the late going.
NORTHWEST FACTOR was off sharply and was sent to the lead leaving the break, set prompted fractions through the second turn, came under pressure

Footnotes
STRUT TO THE WIRE was away alertly and was hustled to the lead leaving the break, set quick fractions while opening a clear lead along the turn, was
kept to task through the lane and kicked clear in the end. MEET THE SHERIFF stalked the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn, was outfinished in
the drive and held for the place. STORMY CHARMANT tracked the pace while saving ground to the turn, lost position along the turn and was outkicked in
the final stages, while just holding for the show. SCRATCHY APACHE was a bit keen in the early going, settled to stalk the pace from a two wide position on
the turn, was boxed in leaving the quarter-marker and approaching the furlong grounds and did not mount a late bid in the drive. AMERICA GREAT chased
the pace from the midflight and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. EL TENAMPA saved ground while chasing the quick fractions, improved position
approaching the head of the lane but flattened out in the late stages. REFI NOW chased the pace outside of rivals and did not mount a late rally in the
stretch.
