Footnotes
GREELEY WENT WEST stalked along the inside, easily slipped inside of the leader turning for home after that foe vacated the rail, led entering the lane,
and drew clear in upper stretch. SR. CLARKY set the pace along the inside of a pressing rival while intentionally staying a path off of the rail, which allowed
for GREELEY WENT WEST to slip inside turning for home, proved no match for that foe while drifting to the three path entering the lane, and saved place
from an inner rallying rival late. TIN DELAY saved ground far off of the pace, then stayed on inside of foes through the lane to bid for place in the final
sixteenth, but was denied. CAEUS IN PASADENA stalked two wide and between horses around the first turn, took back to midpack down the backstretch,
ranged up in the four path around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of the top pair turning for home, but was floated to the five path entering the lane
while failing to keep pace with inner rivals, then chased on his left lead. BINDING settled off of the pace in the two path, was outrmoved down the
backstretch to shift to the five path and outside of rivals while trailing into the far turn, then fanned to the eight path entering the lane before tucking behind
foes in upper stretch, and moved up between horses in the final furlong. LUCKY STREAKER tracked three wide, improved to stalk entering the backstretch,
chased the top pair from the three path while between foes around the far turn, but faded while drifting to the six path entering the lane. THIRTYSIX G'S was
void of early speed despite rider encouragement into the first turn, raced off of the pace in the three to four path before shifting to the seven path entering
the lane, and lacked a rally on his left lead. SENATOR CON prompted the pace in the four path while quite keen from rider restraint, vied two wide around
the far turn, but weakened in the four path entering the lane.

MCFEELY stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the leader entering the lane while being outmoved by an outer DANVILLE, switched two
wide approaching the three sixteenths to split rivals, bid at the furlong grounds, and drew off thereafter. DANVILLE trailed the field early on, gained two wide
around the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane to complete a bid for the lead in upper stretch, but failed to kick on before proving no match for
an inner bidding rival passing the furlong grounds, then prevailed for place. SILVER N LAI set the pace, dug in to resist DANVILLE's bid in upper stretch, but
failed to resist MCFEELY's challenge at the furlong grounds, battled on for place, but was bested. FREEDOM FACTOR pressed the pace two wide, but
weakened in the three path and between horses passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
THE BIG IRISHMAN broke a step slowly before being taken in hand between horses to trail the field soon after the start, saved ground at the rear, improved
inside of foes at the five-eighths before coming under a stern drive approaching the half mile pole, responded into the far turn while shifting to the three path,
sustained his steady advance to range up outside of the leaders in midstretch, completed a bid via a long drive at the sixteenth pole while hanging on his left
lead, and drew clear. A. K. SAFARI tracked in the five path around the first turn, stalked down the backstretch, vied outside of the leader while in the three
path around the far turn, gained an advantage passing the five sixteenths pole, led through midstretch as an outer THE BIG IRISHMAN menaced, but was
bested by that foe a sixteenth from home. FLASHY RICHIE tracked along the inside, chased under steady urging around the far turn while inside of THE
BIG IRISHMAN, but was outmoved by that foe entering the lane, then kept on thereafter to reach show in the final sixteenth. BIRTHDAY PARTY stalked in
the four path around the first turn, but faltered between horses at the half mile pole, lost multiple lengths of position into the far turn, then shifted to the five
path entering the lane, and came again to gain a minor share. MUSADA set a clear pace in the three path around the first turn, felt outer pressure from A K
SAFARI while in the two path into the far turn, but was headed by that rival turning for home, then gave way thereafter. ONE HITTER settled off of the pace
in the two path, took the far turn in the five path, and never got involved. SEMI CHARMED LIFE laid unhurried in the four path around the first turn, but came
under strong urging a half mile from home, lacked a response, and was outrun.

Footnotes
OLD PHO set a clear pace around the turn, and held safely as a pair of outer rivals closed in late. MY FRIEND AMY tracked the loose leader from the
inside, tipped outside of that foe in upper stretch, but only managed to chase, the lasted for place. COCO PUFF laid off of the pace three wide, then
produced a rally in the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reach place. CLASSY MISS stalked the clear leader while outside of another rival, then faded
after being outkicked by that foe in upper stretch. FANCY MARTINI hopped at the start and brushed the outer part of the gate while breaking a length
slowly, then trailed the field, into the turn, and never got involved. AMENSET settled off of the pace in the two path, came under a drive at the three furlong
pole, but tired.

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped three wide entering the lane, rallied with multiple lengths to find on a clear DENVER
CITY entering the final furlong, and reeled that foe in in the final sixteenth. DENVER CITY set the pace along the inside, drew off while well in hand passing
the quarter pole, then was roused to hold sway at the furlong grounds, did so entering the final sixteenth, but was caught approaching the wire.
PICKNNGRINN pressed the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, and chased the top pair through the final furlong
to secure show. STEADYTILLREADY took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, tipped to the six path an outside of foes at the furlong grounds, and
moved up. CRIME SPREE settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path into the turn to commence a gain, drifted to the six path entering
the lane, but lacked a kick while hanging on his left lead. IN SKY WE TRUST stalked three wide, but faded while getting floated four wide entering the lane.
LAFITTE'S FLEET trailed the field in the five path, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and made little impact.

HIDDEN WONDER prompted outside of the leader while in the four path around the first turn, bid passing the nine sixteenths pole, assumed command
approaching the five sixteenths, drew off in upper stretch under strong hand urging, and was eased up entering the final sixteenth. SPOOKY ROAD tracked
along the inside, chased HIDDEN WONDER around the far turn as that foe took charge, then failed to keep pace in upper stretch, drifted out at the furlong
grounds, and narrowed that foe's margin in the final sixteenth only due to that foe being taken well in hand. I'M BLUSHING set the pace in the three path
around the first turn, but was headed by an outer foe approaching the half mile pole, and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
BALLINONABUDJET bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three to five path around the first turn, inched closer down the backstretch,
pressed outside of the leading pair into the far turn, bid turning for home, failed to keep pace with the inner leader in upper stretch, but chased determinedly,
re bid a sixteenth out, and edged clear late. MARTINIZED vied for the lead two wide from the three path and between horses around the first turn, tucked to
the rail after clearing foes into the far turn while feeling pressure from a pair of outer rivals, shook clear of them passing the quarter pole, changed to his right
lead at the furlong grounds as BALLINONABUDJET sustained pursuit, but was bested by that foe approaching the wire. STANDING MAN stalked along the
inside while tugging into the backstretch, tracked before tipping two wide into the far turn, drifted five wide entering the lane, grinded to produce a bid for
show at the three sixteenths pole, dueled outside of SOCIAL AFLEET for that position thereafter, and prevailed. SOCIAL AFLEET prompted the pace in the
four path around the first turn before inching closer to approaching the five-eighths, vied two wide and between horses into the far turn, but came under a
drive at the three furlong pole, failed to keep pace with his vying counterparts entering the lane, dug in to duel for show inside of STANDING MAN in upper
stretch, fought on through the final furlong, but was bested in that battle. TOUCHDOWN JOE vied along the inside while in the two path around the first turn,
relaxed to stalk along the inside entering the backstretch, shifted four wide entering the lane, but checked when put to tight quarter passing the three
sixteenths pole, altered course outwardly shortly after, and stayed on to miss reaching show. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT bumped with an outer foe at the start,
trailed the field along the inside, took the far turn three wide before getting floated six wide entering the lane, and made little impact. LUCKENBACHER was
put to tight quarters between horses at he start, raced off of the pace while in the four to six path around the first turn, and was outrun thereafter. NO

Footnotes
HIGHER STANDARD set the pace inside of a pressing GILDED RULER, shook clear of that rival at the quarter pole, and held sway under driving pressure.
GILDED RULER pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, and safely held place through thereafter. SEEKING
SAWYER stalked along the inside, failed to keep pace with the leading pair entering the lane, kept on thereafter to bid for show leaving the furlong grounds,
and reached show a sixteenth out. HOLIDAY HOUSE broke a step slowly at the start, tracked three wide around the turn, chased the leading pair through
the lane, dug in for show between horses at the furlong grounds, but was bested for that position by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, but saved fourth.
FREELANCER laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted four wide entering the lane, chased to bid for show at the furlong grounds, but flattened out late
and hung for that position. RUSSIAN TANK took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally.
HOLY CITY laid close up along the inside, but steadied into the turn, was restrained back to trail the field shortly after, and was outrun. NO HEAD ON

Footnotes
GIGABLAST stalked three to two wide into the turn, shifted back to the three path again in upper stretch before bidding at the three sixteenths pole, and
drove clear. DELTA TRAVELER stalked along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, and claimed place at the furlong grounds while chasing
GIGABLAST home. SHESABEAUTYDANCER was reluctant to load raced, raced off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on to claim show in the final
sixteenth. MERCEDES LADIES tracked from the two path around the turn, but lacked a rally. CITIZENS REWARD broke a step slowly, raced far off of the
pace in the four path around the turn, then lacked a kick while hanging on her left lead through the lane. FUNKYLITTLESHACK set the pace along the
inside, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. GO MY JULIET never got involved. LADY CHURCHILL was outrun. NO HEAD ON REPLAY
