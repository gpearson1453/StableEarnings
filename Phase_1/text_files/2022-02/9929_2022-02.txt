over in upper stretch, edged clear and held well. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) was off slow from outside, moved down to the two path for the turn, angled out
late on the bend, finished well but could not get to the winner. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) chased outside a rival early on, had his path taken and got shuffled
back a bit between rivals on the turn, angled in a bit in the stretch and got up for the show. OLYMPIC LEGEND broke well, was prominent early, steadied
behind the leader at the quarter pole, bid between late on the turn, led briefly into the stretch and flattened in the final furlong. UNREAL was off alertly and
sped to the front, was a bit keen and had to be rated early, angled in on the turn, vied with rivals from the rail leaving the turn, bobbled at the top of the
stretch and weakened. ALMANERA (IRE) was off slow to begin, tugged the rider to a forward position, brushed the rail and waited behind the leader on the

bend and failed to menace.

STARSHIP CHEWBACCA was off slow to begin, went up to vie three deep for command, battled through the turn and into the stretch, took a short lead into
the furlong grounds, dueled with BIG SPORT late and gamely prevailed. BIG SPORT broke alertly to take control quickly then was rated on the front end,
vied with a pair of rivals up the backstretch, around the turn and into the lane, dueled with the winner in late stages and finished gamely to the wire.
SMILEFORME threw his head while breaking out at the start, angled out and went up to vie for the lead between rivals, battled around the turn with a short
lead, fought to midstretch and flattened to third. FULL DRAW bobbled then hopped at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, came out entering the stretch,
drifted a bit in the lane and whittled the gap while never threatening.

COTOPAXI (IRE) sped to the front, set the pace from inside to the stretch and remained clear to the wire. AUGUSTA MELODY stalked off the rail, three
deep around the turn, took aim two wide at the top of the stretch, could not threaten the winner late and held the place. JOHNNY PODRES settled outside a
rival, went two on the turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, put in a mild late bid and got up for third. DONCIC brushed with rival leaving the gate, pulled
early then was rated up the backstretch, while moving inside, coaxed along with a quarter mile left to run, cut the corner into the lane, finished evenly late
and lost the show. BRIX brushed with DONCIC at the start, trailed along the inside to the stretch, moved out a bit in the drive and never threatened. FIRST
PREZ settled along the inside, tipped two wide late on the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch and failed to menace. MUAY THAI (IRE) traveled near the
back and steered to the inside, saved ground then swung out leaving the turn and failed to rally. MCWHERTER raced up close outside the pacesetter,
chased that rival around the bend, lost ground past the quarter pole and faded.

MOVE OVER (GB) stalked in the two path, bid three deep exiting the far turn, cleared in upper stretch and held over the runner-up. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE
bobbled at the start, settled on the inside, waited for room and tipped two wide late on the far turn, angled back in a bit and split foes at the eight pole,
closed well and kept gaining to the line. COSMO tracked in the two path, eased out to the four path around the far turn, chased five wide into the furlong
grounds and gained the show. DUBBY DUBBIE moved around just before the start and came away slow, trailed on the inside into the clubhouse turn then
tipped to the two path, raced outside a rival in the middle stages, steered out leaving the second bend, moved out further at the top of the lane to race
widest and put in a mild rally to earn a minor award. ON A SPREE went two wide into the first turn the moved inside, angled three wide on the second bend
and could not rally in the lane. DUCHOSSOIS took control from inside, got pressure up the backstretch, dueled along the rail on the far turn, lost command
at the quarter pole and weakened in the late stages. FLY NIGHTLY chased two wide around the first turn, moved up to press the pace from outside while in
hand, dueled on the second turn and took a short lead with a quarter mile left to run, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.

GANADORA dueled for command from outside into and around the bend, inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane and drew off
under right-handed urging and steady handling. LADY T chased off the rail while drifting out a bit briefly, steered down to the inside and entered the turn
along the rail, angled out and took aim three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the stretch run but was clearly second best. EVERLYS
GIRL broke a bit slow at the start, tracked off the rail, three wide around the bend failed to produce a bid. BROCADE hit the gate at the start, showed brief
speed then dropped back, was a bit crowded between rivals into the turn, chased two wide to the stretch and churned on for a minor award. SO IT WOULD
SEEM dueled for the lead into and around the bend, kept the pressure on past the quarter pole and gave way. EVERYSTEPOFTHEWAY chased widest up
the backstretch, shifted near the seven-sixteenths pole, went four then three wide on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

step crossing over the dirt early, set the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, vied for command around the bend, lost the lead at the top of the stretch and
weakened along the fence. TAPWATER bobbled a bit at the start, stalked three deep to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
ELECTOR vied for command from inside, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted out a bit from left-handed urging in the lane, then got straightened out
and drew off. AMERICAN ADMIRAL was off a bit slow to begin and got bumped, steered out then came back to the two path, went three wide around the
bend, angled out into the stretch and bested the rest. SET SAIL altered inward from behind a rival early, stalked off the rail, two wide through the turn and
got outkicked for second. HOUNDSTOOTH pressed three deep up the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and flattened in the final furlong.
VITTORO hit the gate, broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled four then three wide around then bend and failed to menace. MAGNIFICENT saved
ground from off the pace and never got involved. LIL LIGHT HEADED came away well then vied for the lead between rivals, dropped back around the bend
and tired.

Footnotes
TOFINO BAY was forced to steady early, sat off the pace up the backstretch, traveled three wide into the lane, steered out in the stretch, rallied and got up
in time. AWESOME RHYTHM raced in range from off the rail, drifted out on the turn, rallied four deep in upper stretch, led late and got nailed in the final
moments. DISKO TRIBUTE was off a bit slow, chased between rivals then a bit off the rail into the lane, tipped out upper, bid alongside at the eighth pole,
led midstretch and got outkicked by the top pair. MO THEM DOWN checked hard between rivals early, got blocked behind a rival at the half-mile pole, went
three deep into the turn, lacked room and checked into the stretch, angled out from behind rivals in the drive and finished willingly to round out the
superfecta. CHARLIE'S GHOST was hustled early, balked approaching the dirt crossing and shifted out to bother rivals, recovered quickly and went up to
take back command from DELMAS, cleared that rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside, clung to a narrow lead at the eighth pole and
weakened in the late stages. ASPHALT ANDY was off slow to begin, advanced along the inside, checked past the five-sixteenths pole, kept on through the
lane and improved position. PRECEDENT came away slow, trailed up the backstretch, went two to three wide around the bend, angled out in the final
sixteenth and improved position. DELMAS broke inward, showed speed from inside and cleared briefly, was overtaken past the nine-sixteenths pole,
chased along the rail then two wide on the turn and weakened. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT got bumped and forced out crossing the dirt early, traveled wide up
the backstretch, got floated out five wide early on the turn, remained wide to the stretch and had little left for the drive. AUDACIOUS PRINCE was off a bit
slow to begin, got shuffled early, dropped back and trailed along the inside into the lane and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED CHARLIE'S GHOST FROM FIFTH TO NINTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND INTERFERING WITH MO THEM DOWN, YOU'RE MY BOY KAT
AND TOFINO BAY CROSSING OVER THE DIRT EARLY IN THE RACE.
