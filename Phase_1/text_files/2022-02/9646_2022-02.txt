Footnotes
DESIGNATE close up from the start, came through a large opening along the rail entering the stretch to make the lead near the three sixteenths pole then
widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best despite jumping tracks nearing the wire. DARLINDIVA set the pace around the clubhouse turn,
dropped back on the far turn, swung wide then came on again in the seven path to finished clearly second best. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) vied for the lead
three then two wide and went evenly. SPRING CITY GAL delayed the start while refusing to load and failed to menace. JACKIE MILTON split horses two
wide leaving the first turn to make the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch while well off the rail then gave way. NESSUM DORMA trailed.

STORM RISK broke in front, set all the pace with a clear while while unchallenged and won under strong handling. SHELL FIRE never far back, rallied
through the stretch along the inside and got up for second. LONGLIVEJUSTICE trailed early, moved closer before a half, was given a breather then finished
evenly four wide. SMASH chased the winner into the stretch then faded three wide. ENJOY BASEBALL was no factor. VALEROSO had speed for a half,
stopped and jogged to the wire.

TARTAN THE BULL had speed from the start along the inside, was in tight behind the leader entering the turn, shifted out two wide entering the stretch,
rallied determinedly to make the lead late and drew away under a hand ride. SPECTACULAR ROAD sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace
until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. AREYOUTALKINGTOME allowed to settle, finished well along the inside. JOHNNY CAB altered course
widest soon after the start and passed tiring rivals through deep stretch. THE FILTER never far back, advanced between rivals on the turn then failed to
sustain that bid. LOCK ON was a sharp threat three wide into the turn then gave way. CAJUN CHAOS steadied near the five furlong marker, shifted out,
moved up three wide on the turn then came up empty. FOREST CHATTER vied for the lead three then two wide into the stretch and stopped late.

Footnotes
AWESOME STEEL angled inside before the turn, closed fast to make the lead entering the stretch then finished full if run to win going away. HALO'S
DANCE away alertly, set a pressured pace off the rail to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. LEND AMERICA bumped at the start, was
unhurried early and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then was
outfinished. WAR DOCTOR with the second flight near the inside, angled out late and went evenly. PANAMANIAN TEASER bumped at the start and failed
to menace. RESTITUTION was bounced around between rivals at the start, clipped heels and was never involved. DORISTO with the second flight three
then two wide, faded in the stretch. WINWITHJIMMY was through early. FATTERTHANME was fractious as the gate opened, hopped out then trailed
throughout.
