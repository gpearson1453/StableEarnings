Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR broke sharply, tipped off the rail racing to the first turn disputing the pace inside foes, gained a narrow advantage entering the backstretch,
dueled for command through the far turn to upper stretch, shifted out while edging forward to a narrow advantage and maintained that margin to the end
under firm encouragement. HUSH Y'ALL, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the eventual
winner into the far turn to the stretch but proved only second best. HELLO ROSIE SAY settled outside a rival racing to the backstretch, tipped to the three
path racing through the far turn, then continued in that path through the closing stages to gain a share late. BEAUTIFUL TIZ settled into stride a bit off the
inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. MAGICGIRL was urged three deep into the first turn prompting the pace, angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight to the far turn and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
EL SAMURO settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, continued unhurried into the far turn, shifted out entering the stretch, then was
urged to split foes three wide leaving the furlong marker and just gained the advantage between foes on the wire under pressure. LAST PROMISE was
rated just off the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn, made steady progress in that path to gain the
advantage between calls in the closing stages but just failed to contain the winner. IRISH VALOR broke awkwardly dropping off the field at the start, was
reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly inside rivals to close the gap on the
leaders nearing the wire. BROADWAY PETE broke sharply, set the pace on a narrow advantage racing off the inside to the backstretch, met the challenge
of several rivals along the inside racing through the far turn, held sway past the furlong marker but yielded nearing the wire. BOURBON WISDOM, forwardly
placed three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards after a half, was urged to lodge a bid between foes racing through the far turn but faded leaving
midstretch. CODETOWIN, forwardly placed between foes racing to the backstretch, tipped out three deep nearing the far turn while being urged to lodge a
brief bid but soon gave way.

IMPERIAL BIRD broke readily, was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch
and widened the margin late under firm left handed encouragement. SWIFT DANCER broke sharply, was urged inside the eventual winner pressing the
pace from the outset to upper stretch but weakened late. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL tracked the leaders between foes leading the second flight on a narrow
advantage while out of striking distance early, lacked the needed closing bid but continued well enough to prevail for a share. THUNDER ROLLED tracked
the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly inside rivals through the stretch. GREEN DOT BRAH
ducked out at the start losing position to the field, was prompted to advance racing four wide into the turn, continued in that path into upper stretch and
proved proved no threat. TELECAST tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening quarter but steadily faded between foes into the lane.

MAGICAL WARRIOR broke readily, shifted off the rail in the opening stages while being urged disputing the pace inside a rival on a narrow advantage into
the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch, was kept to firm right handed pressure while drawing away and was taken in hand nearing the wire. KABOD
tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing three deep while leading the second flight on a narrow margin racing to the turn, then continued
evenly in that path to late stages to prove best of the others. ITS OVER, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to track the leaders between foes in
second flight racing into the turn, then continued in that path through the lane while being outkicked for the place honors. REGAL HOLIDAY urged prompting
the pace outside the eventual winner in early stages, pressed the issue racing through the turn and faded into upper stretch. MELINA'S DREAM settled
along the inside in early stages dropping well off the second flight, switched out four wide nearing the turn, then continued in that path to late stages while
lacking a rally. MENELAO settled outside a rival in the last flight early and failed to menace. C C'S KITTEN broke outwards bumping ITS OVER, was
collected, then angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but retreated early.

CARPENTERS CALL broke readily, pulled his way to the lead along the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage under rating to
the backstretch, moved away to a clear advantage racing through the far turn and held gamely to the end under steady left handed pressure. FLOP SHOT
(IRE) angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out racing into upper
stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner to the end. HIDDEN STASH was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, angled inwards a bit to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position while earning a share.
CHESS'S DREAM, reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final bid. FLY THE W tracked just off the pacesetter between foes under light rating racing to the first turn, was eased back while shifting out three
wide entering the backstretch, continued in that path into the far turn and steadily faded racing into the lane. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI, off last, trailed the field
to the stretch. KING'S MISCHIEF tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight to the backstretch, shifted inwards after a half to track the
leader between foes but gave way racing into upper stretch.

CHARGE IT JENN angled inwards racing to the first turn to track just off the pacesetter between foes under light rating, continued in that manner to the far
turn, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear under pressure.
TIZ HERSELF tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep after a half to track just outside the leaders into the
far turn, was fanned four wide racing into the lane but couldn't match the winner's kick while continuing with interest to prove best of the others. DR KAAK,
urged in the three prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted in to press the issue outside that foe racing into the far turn, briefly resisted the
winner's bid but gave way in the last furlong. ASPROPODIA, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for
command inside a rival through the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. GRANDMARY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn
but had no closing response. SILVER PACKAGE, reserved inside foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, never gained contention.
AUBURN settled outside a rival in the last flight early, angled out five wide racing through the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. LOVIN
LIVIN angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight but gave way after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE TRAINER OF TIZ

BETTERMENT, forwardly placed along the inside tracking the pacesetter under light rating, steadily closed the gap on that foe while tipping out nearing
upper stretch, took over racing into upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under strong handling. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) tracked the
leaders from just out of striking distance a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, steadily gained contention inside foes on
the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, came out while being roused through the stretch to close the gap on the leader and continued
willingly while just failing to gain even terms. MR. KRINGLE settled along the inside in early stages, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, was
prompted to advance while swinging out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share late. GATE CREW tracked the
leaders from out of striking distance outside a rival under light rating to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the far turn while being
prompted to advance but lacked the needed final bid. PIRATE PARADE sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, held sway on a clear
margin racing to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave way leaving midstretch. RECORDER was rated along the inside tracking the leaders
from out of striking distance, saved ground through the far turn and came up empty racing into upper stretch. HOLD THE SPICE settled well off the leaders
while angling to the inside racing into the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. TEMPO RUBATO dropped out early.

POSEIDEN ducked inwards at the start losing some position at the break, angled to the inside just after the break while being urged pursuing the pacesetter
through the backstretch, shifted out on the turn closing the gap on the leader, bid for command between rivals nearing upper stretch, then turned back
LUCA DREW THE ACE racing through the stretch to go clear under firm handling. The latter tracked the leaders four wide as part of the second flight in
early stages, responded with a sharp three wide advance to loom outside the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong
marker while continuing well enough to prevail for the place honors. VALID EXCHANGE tracked off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted out four
wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed late kick. TITHED, bumped at the start, settled into stride on the backstretch,
steadily gained position four wide racing into the lane, then angled inside foes leaving midstretch while finishing evenly. ALL FOOLS DAY broke outwards
bumping TITHED, was collected, then urged in brief pursuit of the leaders between foes to the turn and came up empty midway through the turn. PAPA
LUKE sprinted to the lead along the inside from the break, held sway on a clear margin into the bend and gave out abruptly after a half. VENERATE settled
outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch and proved no threat. FITZ'S MO ducked out at the start, was collected while dropping out last and failed to
menace thereafter. FREE FLAYME angled inwards tracking the leaders in second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
DAWN was rated outside a rival tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance in the two path racing into the
far turn, angled to the rail entering upper stretch while continuing with a steady late response and wrested the advantage in time under pressure. LHEEAS
JOY tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position racing into the far turn while tipping
off the inside, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch advancing in tandem with the eventual winner and prevailed for the place honors while failing
to match her rival's final kick. STANDUP COMEDIENNE pulled her way to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, went well clear racing through
the backstretch, shifted off the rail racing into upper stretch maintaining a commanding margin but faltered nearing the wire. OFF THE CHARTS, reserved
along the inside in the opening half, came around foes racing into the far turn and continued with steady late interest to gain position along the inside late.
CROSS FLEET, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, conceded some position to that rival on the backstretch, was
urged to advance along the inside entering the far turn but gave way into the lane. SOCIAL ANIMAL, caught in close quarters at the start, settled last to the
backstretch, then switched out racing through the far turn to pass some tiring rivals entering the stretch. DIGITAL ASSET, brushed at the start, settled into
stride racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch and failed to menace. SABELLE, urged to brief contention tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch,
gave way entering the far turn. CHANGE PLANS, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, faded nearing the stretch. MISS ENCISO, urged to a forward
placing three deep racing to the first turn, gave way abruptly entering the backstretch, was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under her own
power.
