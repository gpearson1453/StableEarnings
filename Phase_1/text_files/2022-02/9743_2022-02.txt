Footnotes
RICKEY B vied between horses, drew clear in the upper stretch and just lasted under left handed urging. LINCHPIN STORM raced close to the pace, bid
four wide on the turn, swung out into the stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and outnodded at the wire to just miss. BEDROCK was taken
back at the start, trailed the field, angled out on the turn, bid six wide and closed to earn show. HOUSE LIMIT pressed the pace while racing four across,
challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and hung late. WAKE UP CALL raced inside in an even effort and did not threaten. GRAY ADMIRAL vied
inside, gave way in the upper stretch and dropped back. IN THE DEEP led early, vied to the turn and stopped.

MISSCZECH brushed at the start, set the pace, drew off in the upper stretch for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. TEMPORARILY pressed the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. BIG HEAT veered out at the start, was unhurried early while never far
back, rallied on the turn to get within range, had little left, dropped back and settled for show. NIGHT MIST pressed the pace, tired into the second turn and
gave way. KEEP IT ROLLIN brushed at the start and was outrun in an even effort. STOLEN HALO was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

MORE HONOR rallied into the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. MARKET KING dueled to the
turn, drew away for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. NO SUPAH FOR YOU in close, dropped inside, shifted back out on
the turn, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and settled for show. THETRAILERGUY raced close to the pace outside, went five wide entering the stretch,
had little left for the drive and hung in the lane. GREAT ULYSSES saved ground, got through the rail on the turn and lacked a bid. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE
pressed the pace three across to the turn, gave way and dropped back. COASTLINE SERMON was not a factor. FINAL ROSE was outrun. PRICE TO PAY

Footnotes
DEPARTURE raced close to the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched clear late. FIRST CALL vied to deep
stretch and yielded grudgingly. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN stumbled at the start, led early, vied past the sixteenth pole, was unable to sustain his bid.
BECKHAM JAMES was hustled along early, fell back, awaited room on the turn and closed well once clear. HOLLYWOOD HEAT broke slowly and was
crowded at the start, fell far back early and finished well. LARRY'S LEGEND broke in, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and gave way. SKY
CONFIDENTIAL lagged while racing outside, lacked a bid and was outrun. DEVILS WORKSHOP was not a factor. YEROSILVERBIZ moved up inside to vie
for the lead and stopped on the turn.
