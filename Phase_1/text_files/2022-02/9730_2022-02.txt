Footnotes
GALILEO'S AFFAIR lagged far behind, swung wide rallying into the stretch then outgamed rival through the final furlong. FLORENCIA raced wide
throughout, moved very wide into the stretch, held a narrow lead but was outfinished late. TOWSON broke in a complete tangle dropping far behind then bid
inside before tiring late. CHANCEE settled inside behind the top pair and proved empty in the stretch. SUBSIDIARY controlled the pace, widened on the
final turn then stopped in the stretch. SOUTHERN CENTS pursued the loose pacesetter to the stretch and gave way. The stewards conducted an inquiry
into the start of the race.

SEA FRET vied two wide early on, then cleared off to set the pace, responded when roused entering the stretch and pulled away under urging. OUTLINE
chased outside in the early stages, chased the leaders on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside and got up for second. NICKYS NOTION vied
inside for the early lead, then chased, made a mild bid at the quarter pole, dug in through the lane, weakened late and lost second. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS
raced off the pace, went four wide on the turn and bested the others. NO SYMPATHY raced off the pace, between rivals on the turn and failed to threaten.
SUZY Q THE QUEEN was bumped at the start and steadied, then chased inside and tired. TREASURE SEEKER bobbled at the break and was bumped,
raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. MICHAELA VEE raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and gave way.

INSTAFAMOUS sprinted clear inside, remained safe then widened in the stretch while kept to brisk urging. BUCKS ARE MOVING saved ground, advanced
into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. BEAVER CREEK roughed early, chased off the pace between rivals, angled out into the lane with late
energy. DIABLO D ORO dropped back after the start, saved ground throughout rallying mildly. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE raced within range three wide then
began fading on the turn. MY COUSIN RICH lacked speed, chased outside and was never in contention. UNCLE ROAMIE prompted the pace in the two
path for half a mile and faltered.

MINESHAFT MAGIC hustled to the lead inside, dueled long to the stretch, was challenged again in the stretch then edged away under strong handling.
FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER settled behind the dueling leaders, angled out into the stretch, reached near even terms with the winner but yielded. BLUE SHINE
engaged the winner outside, led briefly at the quarter pole then weakened through the stretch. PECAN PATTIE dropped back in the two path and lacked a
rally. JANELLE DREAMS trailed early, saved ground and was always outrun. WEST HORIZEN raced off the leaders outside and gave way readily.

pole, rallied outside of BESS through the stretch run, dueled with that rival in the final furlong, dug in gamely outside and prevailed narrowly after a long
drive. BESS vied two wide for the lead, took over on the backside, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of MISS DILLINGHAM in the stretch drive
and battled on tenaciously to the wire. MISS LOYALTY tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and gained mildly
for third. FINE ONE WON vied inside for the early lead, tracked on the backside and weakened. TOMARIE trailed the field, raced three wide on the
backside and passed tired rivals. MISTY TASTE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, went four wide on the far turn and tired. CHARITY STRIPE
raced off the pace inside and did not factor. ASSUME CONTROL stalked two wide, raced between rivals on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SPRING EMPEROR settled close up, awaited room on the final turn, found a seam into the stretch and surged away. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM raced wide
throughout, split rivals rallying in the stretch to get up for the place. WAGON BOSS made a menacing four wide move into the far turn and continued well.
TACTICAL PLAN lacked speed, bore out on the final turn and stretch and closed well. CHARLIE THE GREEK dropped far behind outside then flattened out
in the stretch. JUPI'S LIGHTNING vied between rivals to the stretch and weakened. HOORAY FOR HARVEY earned a narrow advantage inside to the
quarter pole and tired. D T GOODIE vied three wide to midway on the final turn and gave way. ECLIPSED MOON saved ground and stopped through the
stretch.
