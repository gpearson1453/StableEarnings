Footnotes
UNIFIED CONQUEST was forwardly placed out of the gate then edged back into tracking position, picked up the pace along the rail moving through the
turn, cut the corner entering the lane, took closer order then tipped three wide in the final furlong through the stretch and kicked clear. CAJUN MANDATE
broke readily, went to the front and angled inside, showed the way by a clear advantage around the turn, was set down two wide for the drive, stayed on
with response but could not hold off the winner in late stages. JUST PRAISE chased inside a rival through the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and
stayed on with response to secure show. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE raced outside a rival while chasing after the leader around the turn, came three wide into
the upper stretch and flattened out. INDOMITO raced off the top trio through early stages, came four wide into the lane, drifted out wider under right-handed
pressure and gave way. LAGERFELDT raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch then angled inside and never
threatened. PEMBERTON raced off the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide for the drive and failed to respond. HECTOR B lacked
speed, saved ground and never reached contention.

Footnotes
HANNITA'S EMPIRE bumped with LOOK UP TO HEAVEN at the start, tracked the pace three wide, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and drew
clear under a drive. KINGSTON QUEEN set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth but held clear
of the rest. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN bumped with the winner at the start, chased the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally and was along for the show.
SHEZ RECKLESS prompted the pace two wide, reached near even terms at the quarter pole but tired in the lane. SCARLETT'S FLOWER was outrun
inside. ADIOS DIXIE stumbled at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. TWENTY ONE SHORT hit the starting gate and was off well last,
advanced outside down the backstretch, dove to the rail near the half-mile pole, chased inside around the turn and cam up empty in the lane.

CALCULATED BREEZE sprinted clear after the start, showed the way in the two-path turning for home, remained well in command past the furlong marker,
then had just enough to hang on. MITICO saved ground outsprinted early, moved out five wide approaching the stretch, rallied outside the winner and just
missed. CACHETON chased outside CALCULATED BREEZE to the stretch, stayed on his left lead lugging in, and weakened. LEGAL STAR raced two wide
on the turn, moved to the rail for the drive and could not gain. INEVITABLE ME chased three to four wide to the stretch, and tired.

Footnotes
BOB MARCO steadily moved up the inside and took over the lead just after the opening quarter, set the pace and saved ground to the far turn, repelled the
bid from STREET FACTS past the quarter pole, widened advantage in the upper stretch and remained clear under a driving finish. IT BEAST ALL tracked
the pace inside up the backstretch, came under a ride late on the far turn, angled out wider for the drive, sustained a steady outside bid and produced a
solid finish. STREET FACTS matched strides out of the chute then conceded position to BOB MARCO and remained forwardly placed up the backstretch,
loomed up to challenge BOB MARCO for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move on with eventual winner out of the turn but stayed on with response
and cleared the rest. UNION FREEDOM was well placed sitting in contention along the outside, hustled along three wide with five-sixteenths remaining,
failed to move on and gave way past upper stretch. CUPID'S DUDE was rated just off the early pace, came under a ride three to four wide around the far
turn then came up empty in the lane. AWESOME CRUSADER raced off the pace and saved ground, was ridden along the inside into the upper stretch,
briefly gained position then dropped back. LICHTMAN showed response in opening stages then dropped to last and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MERZAZ tracked the pace four wide around both turns, bid between foes in midstretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, was immediately confronted
by the runner-up, dug in inside of that foe and narrowly prevailed. TACKLE settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the
far turn, swung six wide turning for home, bid outside of the winner leaving the eighth pole, dueled head to head through the final sixteenth and was denied.
TAKE A CHANCE tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, took the lead between foes nearing the eighth
pole, could not match strides with the top two late and lasted for the show. DREAMING OF GERRY raced off the pace five wide around the first turn and
four wide around the far turn, shifted wider in upper stretch and rallied down the center of the track. TORETTO was up close inside, became rank entering
the first turn, settled inside midway around the first turn, remained in range inside around the far turn, angled three wide turning for home, bid between foes
nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked in the final furlong. MEAN MACHINE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. PROPENSITY prompted
the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, dueled between rivals to deep stretch and weakened. RICOCHET set the pace inside, was collared
near the quarter pole, battled on inside past the eighth pole then tired late. ANOTHER DUKE was outrun inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME

INVISIBLE WAR stalked the leaders three wide, bid outside S. MUFFIN and SILVER SPUR turning for home, dueled with the latter to the wire and proved
narrowly best. SILVER SPUR moved up early inside after breaking a step slow, pressed S. MUFFIN into the turn, challenged for the lead between horses a
quarter-mile out, dueled in tight along the rail with INVISIBLE WAR leaning on him through a long drive, and stayed on gamely. RIVES was outrun early
despite urging, saved ground finding his best stride into the stretch, and rallied belatedly to go clear of the remainder. REDJACK was close up early, lost
position while ridden along through the second quarter, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch and offered nothing further. EQUULEUS was a step
slow underway, raced four wide around the turn, and faded through the late stages. S. MUFFIN set the pace inside, got overhauled by the first two finishers
into the stretch, and gave way. PIGOTT broke a step slow, raced three wide and was finished after a half-mile.

SMILING TEUFLES tossed head up at the start, came away slowly and spotted the field five lengths, quickly angled inside to save ground, tracked the
pressured top flight into the turn, angled out and loomed up five wide in the upper stretch, responded willingly under a right-handed pressure, rallied along
the outside and finished clear. STRAIGHT SHOT was well placed sitting just off the embattled trio into the turn, given cue four wide at the head of the lane,
vied for the lead to the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. INTER MIAMI forced the pace soon after the start, dueled for the
lead between rivals around the turn, battled back into the lane, had no closing kick left in reserve but churned on for a share. ETCHED IN STONE raced
three deep in striking distance in early stages, moved up to match strides for the lead mid-way through the turn, fought back to mid-stretch then came up
empty. MY BOY LENNY took a slim lead soon after the start and set a pressured pace, dueled inside a duo around the turn then tired in the drive.

under a drive. READY TO FILM raced off the pace two wide early, went four wide around the far turn and stayed on to gain the place. SCIENCE FRICTION
raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily angled in through the stretch and gained the show. CAGUA lagged well back
in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn, swung seven wide near the quarter pole and improved position outside. GOLDEN BOW set the
pace along the rail and tired in the final furlong. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT stalked the pace three wide, angled in near the quarter pole and faded. AMAZIN
QUEEN played no factor while racing four wide. WAR OF AGES pressed the pace two wide, dueled two wide around the far turn, drifted out turning for
home and wilted.

Footnotes
IN DUE TIME brushed with AMERICAN ICON at the start, moved up following in behind AMERICAN ICON through the backstretch run, moved out for
clearance midway on the turn, took over from outside in the five-path past the three-sixteenths pole and drew off steadily under pressure. AMERICAN ICON
brushed with IN DUE TIME at the start, set a pressured pace inside for six furlongs, drifted to the three-path turning for home, was no match for the winner
once straightened away, and ran on to hold second. IRON WORKS was close up in a tightly-knit first flight early, lost ground to the leaders heading to the
turn despite being coaxed along, entered the stretch two wide advancing a couple spots, and ran on evenly inside SKIPPYLONGSTICKING to edge that
one for third. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING bumped with DESERT RULER at the start, pressed AMERICAN ICON from outside for six furlongs, was four wide
into the lane, weakened through the late stages and yielded the show spot. STEAL SUNSHINE was slowest away, saved ground throughout and posed no
serious threat. JUST CALL RAY raced three to four wide in the second flight, and gave way readily after six furlongs. DESERT RULER bumped with
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING at the start, raced forwardly three wide to the turn, and was finished approaching the stretch. SOUPER LEGACY was finished
early outside, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
IN A SPIN settled two wide around the first turn and continued to rate off the early pace, angled out and moved up closer leaving the far turn, shifted wide
for the drive, rallied five wide under strong handling and edged away in deep stretch. CONUNDRUM QUEEN raced two wide around the first turn and rated
near midpack, launched a bid leaving the far turn, dug in four deep a furlong out, egged ahead to a slim lead then got denied when the winner drove by late.
COCOA ICING secured inside position and tracked the pace up the backstretch, waited along the inside around the far turn, continued in traffic in the upper
stretch, found a path between, split foes near the furlong marker and lasted for show. WHAT KNOT steadied along the rail on the first turn then settled
inside off the early pace, edged up closer and lacked racing room around the far turn, continued to lack a clear path in the upper stretch, remained boxed in
until late, shitted out, came on and just missed show. FOXTROT SEVILLE was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch, continued along the rail into
the far turn, shifted out wide for the drive and closed with response. BLUE TWIRLIN was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up
the backstretch, launched a two wide bid late on the far turn, battled on to the furlong marker then gave way. SOUPSTER broke alertly and set the early
pace, repelled bids late on the final turn, battled on into the final furlong then had nothing left in late reserve. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED stalked outside
through early stages, bid three wide with a quarter-mile remaining, raced up close then came up empty in the upper stretch. ALKI PUY shook head at the
start and raced in the back, continued reserved in the rear, came four to five into the upper stretch and had no response. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE. FINAL
TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.
