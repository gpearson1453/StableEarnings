Footnotes
FELICIAS CASTLE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but bore out into the lane,
dug in when straightened away and held on with steady encouragement. LEG UP stalked the pace then challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, was forced wide into the stretch but dug in to stay on to the finish. SPECTACULO rounded the first
turn in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. PULL UP
MY SOCKS rounded the first turn in the five path and raced at even terms past the half mile pole, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths then faded on
the far turn. CHEROKEE WIND settled inside on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but was not a factor. BOUGHT BY DIVA saved ground well back. After posting the Inquiry, the Steward disqualified Felicias Castle to second place for
bearing out on Leg Up leaving the far turn, causing that one to race wide into the stretch. In addition, this race was hand timed.

JUST GETS BETTER drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, widened through the
backstretch, ran at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert down the lane. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS stalked off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. ROCK FILE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little further. CHAMPAGNE
JAM saved early ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. MIKI settled back in the
three path the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch but showed little response. DEPUTY JAMES settled off the pace inside on the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded toward the far turn.

DARK TRICKS broke sharply and set a pressured pace, dueled clear of Kaylie's Girl past the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn then dug in
through the stetch and held on while flattening stride late. BARBSGRAY LION chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn, angled outward and entered the
stretch about the six path, dug in through the final furlong to take second later yards and was gaining on the waning winner. MAKE IT A DOUBLE chased
through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the far turn and got up for third later yards. KAYLIE'S GIRL chased inside, steadied and angled off the rail
approaching the quarter pole, ran in the three path of the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. LADIES SIGNATURE chased, rounded the turn about the
four path then flattened the final sixteenth. ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path but was carried
wide into the lane. NANCYSAIDSO chased outside, raced in the five path of the turn and was not a factor. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against
the rider of Dark Tricks, lodged by the rider of Kaylie's Girl, though, found no cause for change.

Footnotes
JASONTAKESLONG took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, pulled clear of Motivated Speaker at the quarter pole,
widened through the far turn and coasted through the lane. CURLIN'S MALIBU rounded the first turn in the four path and gave chase from the nine
sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and proved no match. DIVINAS CONNECTION ducked in and was checked sharply leaving the gate then
saved ground racing well back, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. LOVE THAT
WIND settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and passed some rivals. DUDE AND
JUMPER rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase into the backstretch then flattened in the four path of the far turn. MOTIVATED SPEAKER led
most of the opening quarter mile then challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter and weakened leaving the far
turn. BUCKS LODGE raced close off the rail the first turn then faded past the three eighths pole. REGHITTO ran in the four path the first turn and was never
a factor. QUARANTINE ran in the seven path the first turn, left the turn outside and was not a factor. BIG PERFECTION rounded the first turn in the four
path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, weakened into the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
KING NEKIA rated off the pace inside the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep at the
quarter and contested the edge through the turn, dug in under determined handling and drew clear of HOBE SOUND through later yards. The latter rated a
short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage at the rail on the far turn
and continued on gamely to mid-stretch before relenting. WALL rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch. DR. DEVERA'S WAY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then weakened. SING A VERSE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole but showed little response. GAMING JACK saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SOUTHSIDE
WARRIOR rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and never factored.

Footnotes
HAN SENSE chased toward the inside, ran in the three path of the turn then dug in from the eighth pole to get up the final yards. TO THE FRONT broke in
to make contact with Freedom Is Ringing then gave chase, took the lead two deep midway on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement but was caught
in the final yards. IMPETUOUS broke outward to make contact with Interesting Legacy then set the pace inside, was caught at the rail midway on the turn,
bore out leaving the turn but came back to finish evenly. FREEDOM IS RINGING was bumped inward and into BLACK CANDY leaving the gate, gave
chase through the backstretch, came through the turn about the five path, was carried out by Impetuous entering the stretch but dug in to finish evenly.
BLACK CANDY was jostled sharply leaving the gate then steadied in the vicinity of the half mile pole, gave chase from the seven sixteenths, ran at the rail
most of the turn but followed the errant path of Impetuous leaving the turn and flattened stride. GOLD AND STRIKE steadied on the chute then gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the four path and flattened stride. INTERESTING LEGACY was bumped outward and into Black
Candy at the break, angled to the outside to give chase and never factored. Following a Stewards inquiry, the Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the
rider of Freedom Is Ringing and disqualified that one to finish behind Black Candy for making contact at the break. However, the Stewards also reviewed a
claim of foul against the rider of Impetuous, lodged by the rider of Freedom Is Ringing, and disqualified Impetuous to finish behind Freedom Is Ringing,
which put Freedom Is Ringing back to fourth place. In addition, this race was hand timed. Per Stewards ruling #25, Hans Sense has been disqualified from
purse money.

Footnotes
MY JUBA settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, drifted
toward the head of the lane, lost the lead past the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to come back between horses and take the nod under the wire. AIM'S
JUBILEE ran in the four path the first turn, started an outside bid past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, eased just outside My Juba
into the stretch and dug in gamely, though, missed the nod under the wire. WHALE OF A TIME angled to the inside and rated the early pace, was headed
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased around Castle Lights into the stretch, dueled to a
slim lead past the eighth pole and dug in gamely, but relented the final yards. PRINCESS HALO saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off
the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. BONNIE BLUETOOTH settled back off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened. CASTLE LIGHTS angled in to stalk two deep, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
dueled clear toward the five sixteenths, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then gave way inside the eighth pole. IN TO THE NIGHT raced well
back saving ground.

Footnotes
CREATIVE MINESHAFT took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole then tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile
pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and increased his margin under steady stretch handling. LUFTY'S KISSES stalked from the two and three paths,
gave chase leaving the half mile pole but dropped back off the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second best. NAZCA MYSTERY steadied off the
heels of Creative Mineshaft into the first turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed
little in the stretch. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE saved ground well off the pace on the opening turn, bid past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the
five path and passed a rival. TWOBITSARIDE showed little response past the seven sixteenths pole. J J WEDGIT MAN settled back off the rail on the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch. TAMAQUA raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and never
factored. ORIENTATED ran in the four path the first turn and was through after a half mile.
