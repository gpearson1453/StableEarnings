Footnotes
VALENTINE DIVINE pressed the early pace, raced six wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner. SHANGHAI MIKE
was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide through the turn, angled in, was no match late and finished second best. CATABILITY was reserved early,
went five wide into the turn, angled in and was along for third. YES ITSA STAR raced in mid pack early, went six wide and was empty late. COWBOY TOBY
was outrun early, raced three wide and never fired. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM was void of any early speed, raced between rivals and passed tired rivals.
BOOMER WHO was taken back and was no factor. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn and faded.
