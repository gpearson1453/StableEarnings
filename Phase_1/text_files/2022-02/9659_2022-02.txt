Footnotes
STARSHIP PRECIOUS tracked just off the first flight in early stages, angled to the inside leaving the half mile marker while being prompted to maintain
striking distance, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch, bid for command between foes while being bumped, then momentarily squeezed but edged
forward to prevail under firm handling. MORE MUCHO tracked just off the leaders, then was urged along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted
out three wide entering the turn, was prompted to advance in tandem with the winner racing four wide into upper stretch, shifted inwards bumping that rival
and was just outkicked. SUWANNEE CHICK, reserved last in early stages while angling inwards, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then
angled to the rail while finishing with interest to prevail for a share late. CARLA'S HONOR joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards
pressing the pace outside a rival on the turn, drifted out while being urged to resist the winner's challenge leaving midstretch but gave way late. STARSHIP
MACYS was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid.
REMEMBEROLDTYMES was urged disputing the pace a bit off the rail inside foes on the backstretch, was taken up nearing the midway point of the turn
and gave way early. MOOR STRENGTH, urged three deep between foes pressing the pace in early stages, shifted inwards entering the turn disputing the
issue inside a rival and gave way into upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LITTLE MISS SASSY, in touch with the leaders from the outset, attended the pace between foes on her own courage through the backstretch, pressed
inside a rival while conceding the advantage entering the turn, switched outside that foe racing into upper stretch, went clear under pressure and was taken
in hand once the issue was decided late. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN tracked off the first flight inside a rival on the backstretch, tipped out to advance between
foes entering the turn, then angled back inside the leaders to prove best of the others in the closing stages. LADY IN HEELS joined the pace three wide in
the opening stages, forced the issue outside the eventual winner gaining a brief advantage on the turn but proved no match entering the stretch and gave
way leaving the furlong marker. EROS'S GIRL was rated off the first flight outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep racing into
the bend, angled out four wide in upper stretch but had no closing response. KILLARGUE'S GIRL, off slowly, failed to menace. FIREWATER TU was urged
inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening quarter but gave way early.

Footnotes
STAYIN OR STRAYIN was reserved inside rivals racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside entering the far turn, briefly awaited an opening between
foes nearing upper stretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes entering the lane, then altered course four wide and produced a sustained response to
narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. GIOVANE'S PROMISE, tipped off the inside racing into the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, took over from that foe racing into the far turn, held sway on a clear advantage past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. KING FORCE
was rated three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position in that path entering the far turn but lacked the needed
final kick while prevailing for a share. RAMIRIN was settled last while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, saved ground to upper stretch under
patient handling, then tipped out racing through the stretch to gain some position between foes. SUPER SHOES, caught four wide racing through the first
turn tracking the leaders from out of striking distance to the backstretch, offered no rally. POSEIDONS MYTH exchanged bumps with AND THE OSCAR
GOES in the opening stages while drifting out racing to the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch to track just off the leaders, was prompted
in a brief bid nearing the far turn but faded into upper stretch. AND THE OSCAR GOES exchanged bumps, then was shuffled back out of tight quarters in
the opening three sixteenths and never gained contention. RAL COPPERHEADROAD switched outside foes avoiding some traffic in the opening stages,
was urged well clear racing to the backstretch, set the pace to the second bend and gave way once headed leaving the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE tracked just off the leaders outside a rival in the opening quarter, advanced three wide into the turn to gain terms prompting the
pacesetter, lost some ground to that foe racing into upper stretch but kept on with a steady effort to prevail in the closing stages under firm handling.
RESIDENT, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, edged forward of that foe racing into the turn, was roused clear in upper
stretch but yielded when failing to match the winner late. LAUDERDALE switched off the inside while being reserved on the backstretch, continued under
patient handling into the turn, split foes three wide entering the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. FORTUNATE FRIENDS
tracked off the second flight inside rivals, tipped outside a tiring foe racing through the turn, then continued with interest inside foes in late stages to gain
some position. ARAZI LIKE MOVE tracked just off the leaders inside the eventual winner in the opening stages, switched out racing into the turn to lodge a
bid in the four path nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. SOURCESANDMETHODS tracked outside foes off the second flight, raced four
wide through the turn but had no closing bid. OVERPRAISE came through close quarters at the start to race off the second flight, was prompted to make
brief progress between foes on the turn and emptied out in the drive. TANGLED WEB, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, gave way abruptly entering the
turn.

Footnotes
YO YO MON, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, angled outside foes to advance five
wide past the furlong marker and took over late under firm handling. REAL GOOD VYBZ sped clear leaving the chute, dictated the pace a bit off the rail
racing to the far turn, proved no match when confronted by the winner but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. JUDGE JUDITH tracked
the pacesetter from just out of striking distance early, continued three wide between foes into the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but lacked
the needed final kick. MAGIC MIKAELA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch while being urged to
challenge in tandem with several rivals but faded between foes nearing the wire. LIBERTALIA tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second
flight, tipped out racing into the stretch but had no final kick. WICKED GAL was rated along the inside, then between foes just off the second flight racing to
the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. A TOUCH OF SPADGET made brief progress four wide racing to the backstretch and emptied out early.
SERENDIPIA proved no factor. MISSPOKEN broke awkwardly dislodging her rider just after the break, was collected by the outrider after the race but
walked off under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

CHINOMADITO, unhurried inside rivals racing to the first turn, tipped out three wide racing to the backstretch while being prompted to advance, moved to
wrest the advantage racing just off the inside racing into the far turn, then met a rival's challenge racing past midstretch to regain a clear advantage under
firm encouragement. AYCAPOTE, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn, continued in that path
to the stretch and finished with a steady effort to edge a rival for second. ENGLISH LAUGHTER, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the leaders,
continued four deep between foes on the backstretch, raced just outside the pacesetter to bid for command nearing midstretch but flattened out late.
DOCTOR D J settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide after a half, continued three deep between foes into the far turn
and faded into the lane. MIGHTY GHOST settled inside foes in the last flight early, switched outside rivals after a half, then continued just off the inside on
the far turn but offered no rally. THREEOHTWOCASSIE, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch on a narrow advantage, angled
inwards nearing the second bend and soon gave way. PICCADILLY BEAU, urged inside a rival prompting the pace into the backstretch, lost some ground to
the leaders after a half, was steadied, then clipped heels racing past the seven sixteenths marker dislodging his rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE

Footnotes
BEACHSIDE BUNNY, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and held the late challenge of SARA
MIA under firm encouragement. The latter was settled outside a rival in the last flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling to the rail
entering the turn, gained position inside foes to midstretch, then tipped outside the winner while continuing willingly to the end. HOITY TOITY tracked off the
first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn, steadied in tight quarters nearing upper stretch, then angled inwards entering the lane to gain a share
in the closing stages. SILVER TUNES joined the pace three deep early, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way
leaving midstretch. SPEED SALSA settled inside foes on the backstretch and never gained contention. PRINCESS LIVIA angled to the inside tracking just
off the leaders racing to the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch but faded between foes late. BAND SWEETHEART, brushed at the start,
was held up in early stages, shifted out five wide on the backstretch, made some brief progress four wide racing into the turn but flattened out nearing the
lane. LOVIELEE ducked outwards at the start brushing a rival, was urged between rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, was taken back to track
off the first flight nearing the turn, shifted out three wide on the bend while being urged to close the gap nearing upper stretch but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TONE, reserved behind the second flight racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the turn, continued with a
steady, four wide advance through the bend to upper stretch, wrested the advantage nearing midstretch, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage and
went clear under firm handling. BASTIEN LE BROWN was rated off the first flight outside rivals racing through the backstretch, split foes racing into the turn,
shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch to bid for command inside foes but proved only second best. LIL BULL, in touch with the leaders three wide
between foes prompting the pace, pressed the issue in that path to upper stretch and weakened late. TITHED was rated just off the off leaders along the
inside, saved ground through the bend, then shifted out five wide racing through the stretch but offered no rally. GIVE ME TWO STEPS, urged prompting
the pace inside foes racing off the inside to the turn, gave way after a half. INTO PARADISE vied for command between foes on a narrow advantage in the
three path through the backstretch, held sway on a narrow advantage in that path to upper stretch and gave way. HOLIDAY DANCER, in touch with the
leaders four wide in early stages, gave way after a half. LEGIO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BILLYJANE ducked out at the start bumping ADRIATIC ROSE, was rated outside a rival dropping off the leaders racing to the turn, swung out five wide
racing into upper stretch and found her best stride late to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. TAPIT'S GIRL angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing into the bend, was prompted to advance inside foes while caught in close quarters midstretch but edged rivals for the place
honors. MONEY AND HONEY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the rail into the turn, shifted off the rail while being roused to
resist several challengers in upper stretch but yielded between foes nearing the wire. LADY JEAN, in touch with the first flight four wide in the opening
stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders in that path to upper stretch and was just outkicked. SWEET BABY RAELYNN, urged to terms with the first flight
three wide between foes in the opening stages, dropped off the first flight racing into the bend and faded into upper stretch. KONA KAI switched outside the
pacesetter to press that rival between foes racing into the bend and gave out late. ADRIATIC ROSE, bumped at the start, settled last in early stages and
never gained contention. FORT DRUM settled off the second flight along the inside and soon dropped out.
