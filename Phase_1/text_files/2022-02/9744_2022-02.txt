Footnotes
MIDNIGHT J J opened clear to dictate terms, widened on the second turn, was kept to task and held sway. CABANA TIME contended between rivals, came
under a ride into the second turn, came four wide to make a bold bid but was unable to bridge the gap. BEACH HOLIDAY settled between horses, took
closer order through the second turn, continued on well in traffic and was along for the minor award. SARGEANT BARGER was under a hard hold into the
first turn, lagged well back, looped five wide through the second turn and was making up ground. MONEY LENDER was forwardly placed along the inside,
was within striking distance to the stretch and flattened. BUCKSHOT RUN attended the pace along the inside through the second turn and tired.
LIVERYMAN broke slow, went wide and failed to threaten. LOCKDOWN LOVER was bumped at the start, settled toward the inside and failed to respond.
BULLSEYE SHOOTER was close up three wide, but came empty before going six furlongs and dropped out. GALLANT DUDE came away a step slow, was
hung wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WINWARD FLO was away in good order, vied for the early lead, settled off of the pace into the turn, bid again between horses, forged a narrow lead
entering the stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. WATERMARK checked early, shifted out and ranged up six wide, took dead aim entering the stretch,
fought on but wasn't quite good enough. FONSSAGRIVES was allowed to settle, moved up between foes on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and
continued on well. HEY BABE contended while hung wide, weakened slightly in the drive and gave way. HAIL TO HELEN checked early, settled off of the
inside, moved up between rivals, offered a mild bid but flattened. DIFFERENTBUTOK was close up between horses, was within striking distance to the final
furlong and faded. SOFIA STRONG set the pressured pace three deep, opened clear and angled in, was headed entering the stretch and gave way.
MAPLELINE was forwardly placed along the inside through the turn and tired. GO PERKY GO saved ground to no avail. STORMY DIVA broke slow and
was never a factor. WAVES showed little.

Footnotes
MARKITOFF attended the pace along the inside, was bottled up in traffic nearing the quarter pole, altered course to the outside, was surging late and was
just up in time. TAP THE MOJO settled off of the inside, launched a bold bid entering the second turn, took over and opened clear entering the stretch, kept
on well but was turned away in the last bob. COMFORT ME NOW was unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, swung six wide on
the second turn and finished fairly well to earn the minor award. CROWN TO THE GOLD broke slow, was unhurried into stride, moved up between horses,
angled out entering the stretch and improved position. BRODYTHEOXMAN settled saving ground, took closer order through the second turn, angled out
and loomed a danger entering the stretch, bumped with DOWN HOME KITTEN nearing the furlong marker and flattened. MIDNIGHT SWAP set the
pressured pace along the inside, was headed nearing the quarter pole and gave way. CHA VEZ finished with a belated improvement. TRY TRY AGAIN
prompted the pace outside, but came up empty on the second turn and retreated. DOWN HOME KITTEN broke slow, was allowed to settle, moved up
between horses, angled out into lane, bumped with BRODYTHEOXMAN nearing the eighth pole, checked off heels thereafter and lost his best chance.
DIDDLEY was forwardly placed four wide for five furlongs and dropped out. KEARNY COUNTY failed to respond. EMPEROR'S GOLD was close up
between horses for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
HABOBANERO was forwardly placed inside, got through entering the stretch, forged command and kicked away. REMAIN ANONYMOUS was hustled
along in mid pack, advanced between horses, shifted out four wide entering the stretch, loomed large but flattened and was all out to hold the place spot.
CAN'T BUY LOVE was allowed to settle while saving ground, got through and finished willingly. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) disputed the pace inside,
took over into the turn, but drifted out leaving the turn and faltered between horses. YOGURT was close up three wide, came five wide to make a mild bid
but lacked the needed late response. CALIFORNIA LILY was hustled along three wide, was fanned six wide leaving the turn and failed to make headway.
KANSAS KIS failed to respond. STOPSHOPPINGAMY contested the pace for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
GOLDENEYE disputed the pace towards the inside, opened clear on the second turn, widened into the stretch, drifted about in the drive but held sway.
ICARUS was shuffled back at the start and unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, moved up between foes, angled out leaving
the second turn, came six wide and finished well to earn the runner up spot. TIM TAL contended between horses, steadied slightly in traffic near the quarter
pole, got through entering the stretch to make his bid, loomed a danger but flattened and settled for the minor award. LESLIE CHOW was allowed to settle,
ranged into contention four wide, but flattened in the final furlong. EDGE OF GLORY was close up on the inside, shifted out and took a run at the winner into
the second turn, contested the issue to the stretch and faltered. SCHMOOZE was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to threaten.
SWATH was allowed to settle, made an early move along the inside, offered a mild bid on the second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch.
STIRLING'S GOLD was allowed to settle along the inside, shifted out and made a mild improvement. SUCCEED was allowed to settle, took closer order on
the second turn, angled out entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. HORNBEAM was hung wide and was never a factor. QUARI MASTER was
forwardly placed three wide, but came up empty after six furlongs and retreated. OFFICER NICK vied for the lead for a half and stopped. The jockey of TIM
TAL lodged an objection against GOLDENEYE for alleged interference leaving the second turn, but following the Stewards review there was no change to
the order of finish.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT DANCING pulled to the fore on the outside, opened clear on the backstretch, widened into the lane and held safe. HAMPTON SPRING was
away in good order, angled in and tightened up rivals to his inside, dropped off of the pace on the backstretch, angled out and came again entering the
stretch, finished well to prove the best of the rest. MALIBU MARLEE steadied entering the first turn, was unhurried, made a late rally circling six wide and
was along for the show. TO FAT TO FISH settled saving ground, got through and improved position. ARCH FLYER vied for the early lead, tucked in and
settled off of the leader, was within striking distance to the stretch and faltered. PIPA PAN was allowed to settle, came four wide and finished with a belated
gain between horses. HIDDEN IDENTITY was put in tight early, tracked off of the inside under a snug hold, but came up empty leaving the second turn.
BALLYBRACK LASS settled off of the inside, but lacked a response when called upon. THEYKEEPONCOMIN failed to respond. BARREL OF DESTINY
was allowed to settle, came five wide but was never a factor.

Footnotes
SUBDUED contended between horses, shifted out to make his bid three deep entering the stretch and was fully extended to wear down the determined
DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS in the final bob. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS opened clear and angled in to dictate terms, came out a bit entering the stretch, was
besieged on all sides, fought hard but grudgingly gave in. UGLY DUCKLING was forwardly placed along the inside, worked off of the inside entering the
stretch to make his attack, shifted back to the rail and found a seam, kicked on well but wasn't quite good enough. TOMAHAWK KITTEN was unhurried into
stride, mounted a late rally circling six wide and was making up ground. MALIGATOR was allowed to settle off of the inside, bid between horses entering the
stretch but lacked the needed late punch. TALLESTOFTHETALL settled saving ground, moved up through the second turn, angled out into the stretch but
failed to sustain the drive. INCLUSIVE was unhurried, wheeled to the outside entering the stretch and made a belated improvement. ESTILO PELIGROSO
settled in hand three deep, but came up empty between horses on the second turn and retreated. JOLTING JOE was allowed to settle three wide, tucked in
to save ground, but lacked a response when called upon. PISTOL BOX showed little. LORD REVELSTOKE was forwardly placed three wide and stopped.

PROMISES TO DANCE was away in good order, set a clear pace along the inside, was kept to task and led throughout. BEVERLY'S CHARGE attended
the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, loomed large but was unable to bridge the gap. IGGY BIGS was allowed to settle off of the inside,
came five wide and finished fairly well for show. PROTOMAGIC was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch five wide but failed to threaten. SMILE AT THE
STORM prompted the early pace three wide, but faltered leaving the turn and faded. MY ANGELICA failed to respond. REEM ZABEEL (IRE) saved ground
to no avail.

Footnotes
INTRADAY (BRZ) settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, advanced between horses on the second turn, angled out five wide into the stretch, quickened
in the final furlong and was up with a surge. BUY ME CANDY was allowed to settle, moved up four wide, loomed large entering the stretch, wore down
BUCK MOON inside the furlong marker, poked his head in front briefly but was unable to resist the winner. BUCK MOON set the pace off of the inside, then
along the rail through the second turn and into the lane, was collared inside the furlong marker and grudgingly gave in. JUNGLE WARFARE was allowed to
settle, ranged into striking distance between rivals, loomed a danger entering the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. PEEKACHO was allowed to settle
between foes, angled out six wide and finished with a belated improvement. CAROM contended three wide, tucked in on the second turn, got through but
lacked the needed late response. FATE OF OPHELIA passed the tiring ones. BELAFONTE broke slow, tucked in, passed some late but was never a factor.
BAYOU GEM settled saving ground, moved up on the second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. THE STIFF showed little. KANTPAYTHETOLL
was forwardly placed along the inside for six furlongs and dropped out. HAWK OF WAR chased three wide to the second turn and stopped. TIMES
PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
FEELING DANGEROUS settled saving ground, came under a ride into the second turn, made a sweeping move four wide, took over nearing the quarter
pole and drew off. SNAKE BITE settled in hand, moved up on the second turn, was bottled up in traffic inside the five-sixteenths pole, altered course to the
outside, kicked on well once clear. BLESSED WITH LUCK was forwardly placed along the inside, worked through traffic into the lane and kept on.
NIAGARA GOLD came away a beat slow, was allowed to settle, improved position but failed to seriously threaten. ICECAP was unhurried, came six wide
and finished with a belated gain. O CIGANO settled off of the inside and failed to make headway. HONORABLE tracked three wide, bid between horses, but
faltered entering the stretch and faded. CITY PEAKS saved ground to little avail. DOM CAETANO (ARG) failed to respond. RHETT THOMAS was away
alertly, angled in to set the pace, was headed midway through the second turn and gave way readily. INVENTING BLAME was close up three wide, was
through after a half and was distanced through the lane.
