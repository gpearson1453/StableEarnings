UNCONSCIOUS set the pace in the two path, shook clear turning for home and widened while ridden out. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH was bumped between
foes just after the start, tracked the pace three and four wide between foes and finished willingly for the place. TRUE BEAST prompted the pace four wide,
was no match for the winner and churned on to hold third. GRAN MAMIBELLA was bumped just after the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and
improved position in the lane. LLUVIA failed to menace while racing four wide. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY broke inwardly and bumped just after the start,
raced five wide and lacked a closing bid. GOOD TROUBLE pressed the winner three wide and retreated through the lane. BLAME THE MEDIA hit the
starting gate then was bumped between foes just after the start, was in range inside and came up empty in the lane.

LUCKY AS A SEVEN vied outside of DRUM AND DRIMMER in opening stages then cleared on top and led the way around the turn, was ridden along three
wide into the upper stretch, held a slim lead over threatening DRUM AND DRUMMER, dug in under right-handed pressure and held safe. DRUM AND
DRUMMER vied in opening stages then edged back to race just off the early leader, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch, moved up into striking
distance in the final furlong, dug in firm pressure but could not get by the winner. WINDY CITY RED tipped out to race two to three wide in opening stages,
chased between rivals around the turn, came five wide into the lane, stayed on with response and edged closer on the top pair. MAGICAL JAIME raced in
the back although never too far back, launched a rail bid heading into the lane, gained closer contention then chased on evenly in the final furlong.
POLITICAL RIOT took the inside position and chased in contention along the inside through the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, remained a strong
contender with a furlong left to run then flattened out ion the final sixteenth. WAR FEATHER raced in contention three wide around the turn, came out wider
into the upper stretch and offered no late bid.

Footnotes
ORDER AND LAW settled off the pace while racing four wide, edged a bit closer while still four deep around the far turn, seized command leaving the eighth
pole and drew off under left-handed urging. LAMPLIGHTER JACK tracked the pace three wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn, bid
between foes nearing the eighth pole, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but won the duel for the place. MO HAWK stalked the pace in the
three path, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, could not keep pace with winner leaving that marker and was narrowly outfinished for the place. SAND
DANCER raced well back three and four wide and rallied belatedly. DUROCHER failed to menace while racing two wide. OVER THE CHANNEL played no
factor while racing two wide. GO MIKE was outrun while racing two wide. TILTED TOWERS set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the
lane and gave way readily in midstretch. UNCLE B chased the pace inside and had no response. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, FRACTIONS REMOVED AND
FINAL TIME UPDATED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
OPEONGO sped to the lead at the start and held a clear advantage around the turn, was ridden along two to three wide into the upper stretch, held on to a
diminishing lead under left-handed pressure and just lasted over fast gaining runner up. DESIGNED BY KITTEN was ridden along the rail through the turn,
tipped wider for the drive, remained determinedly in pursuit of OPEONGO, was inching up on rival in final strides but ran out of time. SANITY raced three
wide near mid-pack around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response and cleared the rest. SAMMY'S TOWN was
off two lengths slow at the start, raced off the pace then swung five wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. I AM THE BOSS chased
the leader two to three wide through the turn, tipped wider for the drive, sustained bid into the final furlong then gave way. MORNING COLORS hustled
along near the inside around the turn, came three wide into the lane and never threatened. AULDWOOD LANE raced in the back and saved ground around
the turn, came out wider for the drive and offered no late bid. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CRYPTIC CREED saved ground in range for six furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch, found a seam in the two-path and prevailed in a frantic finish.
VOLTE FACE broke a step slow, advanced after six furlongs outside rivals in the four-path, bid between horses leaving the furlong grounds and was edged
out late. SAVAGE SAILOR broke a step slow, settled in the second flight to the far turn, moved out for the drive and closed willingly. SIMILAR TASTE let
GILLIGAN go on the first turn, moved out to track that one up the backstretch, took over after six furlongs and kicked clear, then weakened through the last
eighth of a mile. ICY STORM went along near the three-path for six furlongs, swung widest into the lane and gained only mildly. CLASSIC FILM raced three
wide on the turns in range, and weakened through the late stages. GILLIGAN went up to take command outside SIMILAR TASTE on the first turn, showed
the way through the middle splits, then gave way readily.

AMOUNT settled in range three wide, tipped four wide nearing the lane, closed outside under steady left-handed urging and was up in the final strides.
GUNDUZ set a pressured pace inside, dug in inside of LAW OF THE LAND through the stretch but was nailed by the winner. LAW OF THE LAND stalked
the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane, could not get past GUNDUZ and was outfinished between the top two. THE BLUE DRAGON failed to menace
while racing four wide. MARKET CAP had early speed inside, steadied leaving the three-quarters marker, chased inside to upper stretch and tired. MOMZA
pressed the pace two wide and retreated after six furlongs. CORRADO trailed in the five path. FRACTIONS REMOVED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE raced outside in the last flight up the backstretch, was ridden along late on the far turn, shifted five wide approaching the upper stretch,
launched a bid with a furlong left to run, responded under a drive and edged away away in final strides. UNO TIGER rated inside just off the second flight,
was patiently handled around the far turn, given green light four wide at the head of the lane, vied for the lead a furlong out, briefly shook free then got
denied when the winner drove by late. STRIKE THE TOP rated off the second flight up the backstretch, loomed up closer three to four wide late on the final
turn, vied for the lead with a furlong left to run then weakened to show. BUENISIMO saved ground racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane,
sustained a steady bid through the lane and gained closer contention. OFFICER COUNTRY was allowed to settle off the early pace, was ridden along four
wide around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and ran on evenly in late stages. MONTAUK SUMMER took over the lead leaving the first turn, set the
pace up the backstretch and held on top around the far turn, fought back under attack in the upper stretch then came up tired in the final furlong. DILIGENT
stalked saving ground through early stages, was ridden along the rail with a quarter-mile remaining, moved up the rail and raced in striking distance
mid-stretch then failed to keep pace in the final sixteenth. NEVERSTOPDREAMING stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a two to three wide
bid near the quarter pole, moved up into tight quarters turning for home, bumped with rival then steadily sharply and dropped out of contention. FORTY
FLASH settled and saved ground through early stages, had no response when called upon and steadily weakened with three furlongs left to run.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE THE BRIT took control after the start, rated along through leisurely early fractions inside, and dug in through the stretch to get the decision.
DIVINE EXCHANGE saved ground covered up just off the leaders for six furlongs, tipped to the two-path with a clear shot into the stretch, finished willingly
but did not have enough. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT broke a step slow and trailed early inside, angled six wide coming off the far turn, finished with good
energy outside the top two but needed more. GABBY SQUARED stayed in range two wide to the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and finished
one-paced. MAP EM UP was no factor through a ground-saving trip. STARRY HOPE raced four wide much of the way, and lacked a rally. DOMINEERING
prompted the pace outside CHARLOTTE THE BRIT for six furlongs, and gave way. KISSING FROGS made no impact three wide. SHINY EMPIRE showed
little. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, FRACTIONS REMOVED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
