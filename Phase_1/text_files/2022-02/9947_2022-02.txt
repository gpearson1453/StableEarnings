PERFETTO tracked the pace emerging to loom off the inside leader in upper stretch surging past late to win clear in the three path. LOCK ON set a
pressured pace nursing a narrow lead through the turn shaking clear along the inside in upper stretch being overpowered in the late going. SWEET N
SILVER rushed up outside to threaten on the turn wavering some coming five wide in upper stretch using even action from mid track to best the others.
MUSICAL MAN off slowly trailed through the turn losing ground to upper stretch moving up a bit six wide there. ROSAS FOR JIMMY saved ground racing
evenly through the lane posing no menace. MR. CAT pressured the pace through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. FEELING IT played no factor. TWO
STEP SLEW hustled along pressed through the turn then wilted in upper stretch.

the pace racing evenly to upper stretch rallying late four wide to get up for place. SILVER STICK STAIR stalked the pace drawing closer on the turn dueling
three deep in upper stretch coming up a bit short. RUN KITTY hustled along chased through the turn pressing in upper stretch weakening late. VAVITE
played no factor. JESS FOR KICKS set the pace being hooked in upper stretch giving way from the eighth pole. ISLAND WINTER slow early was never
involved. PANGEA played no factor. KNOCKOUT KISSES failed to mount a bid.
