Footnotes
NIGHT PROOF sat just off of the early pace on the first turn, was given rein to dispute the pace to the second turn, overtook YOU'RE THE CAUSE nearing
the top of the stretch and drew away in the late going. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was away alertly and took command of the early pace, was pressured along
the backstretch run and into the second turn by NIGHT PROOF, was overtaken by the winner leaving the second turn but kept on in the final stages to be
best of the rest. GOLDEN TRIBUTE was rank and threw his head approaching the first turn, continued to be hard to place along the far turn while saving
ground, had a high head carriage through the lane and tired in the late going. SIERRA SNOW STORM stalked the pace to the second turn, lost ground
approaching the quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages. BRANNIGAN settled off of the pace, was three wide along the second turn and lacked a
late rally. EVEN STEVEN stalked the pace from the second flight, lost ground along the second turn and weakened in the late stages.

SLEEP OVER was away alertly and took command of the early pace into the first turn, was pressed into the second turn by HULA KING, was confronted by
the runner-up nearing the furlong grounds, engaged in an extended duel with that foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail in a blanket finish for the win.
HULA KING pressed the pace to the second turn, gained ground leaving the bend to confront SLEEP OVER, dueled with that rival to the wire and was
nipped on the line for the win, while holding for second in a blanket finish. JEDI KNIGHT was forwardly placed under a tight hold in the early stages, saved
ground to the second turn while still close up, was boxed in approaching the top of the lane, tipped out for the drive, closed on the top pair in the end but
could not reel them in and just missed while clear of the rest for third. BROKEN FINGER saved ground while allowed to settle through the half-mile marker,
angled out at the head of the lane, could not reel in the top three in the end but was gaining in the final stages. FOUR O'FIVE was a bit slow leaving the
break, settled off of the pace to the second turn and showed late interest in the stretch run. ALLEYCAT settled just off of the early pace while saving ground,
was steered three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. HAWK'S RISING settled off of the pace while outside of rivals through the second turn
and did not mount a late bid in the drive. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI tracked the early pace, gained ground on the second turn while three wide and weakened
in the stretch run.

EXCEED SPEED LIMIT tracked the early quick pace, was in tight quarters entering the turn, was boxed in while two wide approaching the quarter-marker,
angled out leaving the furlong grounds and made a late push in the final sixteenth to get by the dueling top pair to prevail. HANDR'SDREAM pressed the
fast fractions from a three wide position on the turn, headed LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH leaving the furlong grounds, dueled through the final sixteenth with that
foe, was overtaken in the final strides by the winner but held on to secure second. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH was away alertly and showed good early speed
while setting fast fractions, was confronted by HANDR'SDREAM leaving the furlong marker, dueled with that foe through the final sixteenth, was passed in
the final strides by the winner and edged out for the place. FLICFLAC threw his head at the start and was off a step slowly, saved ground while tracking the
early pace and was outkicked in the stretch. PAPPY BOYINGTON chased the pace outside of rivals, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run and
flattened out in the late stages.

Footnotes
KITTY'S CANDY was content to settle through the early running while in the two path, swung out leaving the turn, closed well in mid-stretch to catch
CANAM GAL and drew clear in the final sixteenth. CANAM GAL chased the early pace to the turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn, overtook the
tiring pacesetter inside of the furlong grounds, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch but was best of the rest. GRAZEN DEB tracked the pace from a
three wide path, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked in the stretch run. MAYCEE JO contested the early quick pace to the turn,
took command nearing the quarter-marker, came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the late stages. ELGOFRANCO chased the
pace outside of rivals and gave way in the drive. ACAI broke alertly and was sent to set disputed fractions to the turn, lost position nearing the
quarter-marker and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
HAPPY AT SHADY chased LAST STARFIGHTER to the turn, confronted that foe nearing the quarter-marker, lost a bit of ground into the drive, came on
again in the final sixteenth under firm urging and was up in time to prevail. LAST STARFIGHTER was away quickly and was sent to set the pace, was
confronted by HAPPY AT SHADY nearing the quarter-marker, was able to gain a bit of ground on that foe into the stretch run, was headed again by HAPPY
AT SHADY inside of the sixteenth-marker, was all out in the end and was nailed for the win in a good runner-up debut. HAYDEN'S ANGEL chased the pace
from midpack through the turn and closed well in the late stages to secure third. DON'T TELL HYDEE chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn,
was a bit green in the stretch run while on the left lead and was outfinished in the end, while just missing for third. MOONSHINE CAT was off a bit slowly
and was unhurried through the first quarter, was two wide while trailing on the turn, angled out inside of the furlong grounds and came on in the final
sixteenth to challenge for the show. RIVER TEE chased the pace outside of rivals and gave way in the stretch run. CALIGRAPHY saved ground while
tracking the pace from the midflight, lost ground on the turn and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FLOWER was hustled after leaving the start in good order, cleared the field to set the pace through the second turn while rating nicely, came
under pressure in the final furlong and held on in the end under steady urging. REV REE stalked the pace while saving ground to the far turn, angled out
leaving the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch and just missed for the win while besting the rest. SHERILINDA stalked the pace to the second turn,
came within aim nearing the quarter-marker, continued that bid nearing the furlong grounds but was outkicked in the final stages while holding for third.
CREATIVE ROMANCE was allowed to settle off of the pace while not far off of the rail, was boxed in in tight traffic approaching the quarter-marker, lost
ground leaving the turn, shifted out for the drive and was outfinished in the late stages. BLUE DIVA was crowded a bit at the start and was away a step
slowly, settled off of the early pace, was steered five wide along the second turn and weakened in the drive. ASSIGNATION tracked the pace early pace
while outside of foes, gained ground along the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn while four wide and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
BETTOR TRIP NICK broke alertly, was hustled and cleared the field into the turn, set fast fractions into the stretch run, had a clear lead leaving the furlong
grounds, felt mild pressure in the end from the runner-up but held safely to prevail. RIDING WITH DINO tracked the pace from a three wide position on the
turn, gained ground into the stretch run, closed well in the late stages to mildly pressure the winner and held for second. PSYCHO DAR chased the early
pace from a two wide path on the turn, rallied into the stretch run and continued that gain in the final stages to just miss for second while well clear of the
rest for third. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD was content to take back in the early going, was shuffled back nearing the quarter-marker while between foes, was
roused at the head of the stretch and ran on willingly in the end, though unable to reel in the top trio. R M C HOOK'EM tracked the fast pace from a two wide
path on the turn and gave way in the drive. IN OUR A saved ground while tracking the quick early fractions, was asked for run leaving the quarter-marker,
made mild improvement leaving the bend and weakened in the final stages. I'LL STAND TALLER chased the early pace to the turn while outside of rivals,
took up nearing the quarter-marker, shifted out for the drive and did not mount a final bid.

Footnotes
EMERALD MAGIC tracked the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn, was given his cue approaching the furlong marker, overtook the leading pair in
the final furlong and kicked clear in the end. POTENTE ALBA was off well and was sent to set the fast pace while being pressured through the turn, was
overtaken by EMERALD MAGIC inside of the furlong grounds and gave way in the late going. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET pressed the quick pace from a two
wide path on the turn, vied for the lead approaching the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. REGAL BORN chased the pace from a two wide
position on the turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch. ARNO'S MANE MAN saved ground through the turn and was not a threat. HARDY CHISEL
lacked early speed while four wide into the turn and was not a factor. EARNEST chased the pace outside of rivals into the turn and tired in the stretch run.
