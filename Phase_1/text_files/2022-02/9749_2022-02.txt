Footnotes
CARASYNTHIA was a bit keen in the early going, stalked the pace to the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, confronted SACRED
BEAUTY, battled with that foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail. SACRED BEAUTY set the fractions into the second turn, was confronted by the
winner nearing the furlong marker, battled with that foe and was just bested in the end, while clear for second. BLUEBERRY EYES stalked the pace from
the midflight while three wide into the second turn and closed well in the late stages to secure third. MARANDO PASS was away alertly and took back to
track the pace to the second turn, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker but gave way in the drive. KITTYBE QUICK was shuffled back at the
start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle through the run into the second turn and was not a factor. UPTOWN RHAPSODY stalked the pace from a
ground saving position and tired in the late going.

MISS UNION was off alertly and took command of the pace, extended the lead along the turn and was kept to task through the lane to prevail in a drive.
SKY MAKER stalked the pace outside of foes to the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, closed in the late going, could not reel in the winner in the
end but was best of the rest. LOUD FUSAICHI pressed the fractions from a three wide path on the turn, gave ground into the stretch run and was
outfinished in the late stages. CHULA GIRL bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, settled off of the pace through the turn and did not mount a
late rally. TIZ A TIGER chased the pace outside of foes and gave way in the drive. MI AMARE stumbled a bit at the start, was hustled to track the pace to
the turn from an inside position, lost ground into the stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
BALL LASS was four wide along the first turn, was given rein along the backstretch to press the pace into the second turn, took command nearing the
quarter-marker and pulled away in the end as much the best. GINGERDOODLE was allowed to settle through the first half mile, gained ground on the
second turn while five wide, was not a match for the winner in the end but continued on while on the left lead to be best of the rest. ROCK N ROLL SONG
bumped LASSIE CAT sharply at the break, stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground, passed tiring foes in the stretch and was up in time
to get the nod for third. ROUSING YOU BABE settled near the rear along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run to stalk the pace into the
second turn, mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground into the stretch, did not have a late response and was edged out for third.
SAVAGE LOVE stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, slipped to the inside for the run along the second turn, lost ground into the drive and tired in the
late going. DIZZY LIZZY was away alertly and was sent to set the pace, was rank and a bit hard to place along the first turn, was pressed into the second
turn, ceded the lead nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages. LASSIE CAT was bumped sharply at the break by ROCK N ROLL SONG
and was away slowly, settled off of the pace while outside of foes to the second turn and was not a factor. DEELITEFUL LIZZY stalked the pace from the
midflight to the second turn, gave ground while three wide on the second turn and gave out in the stretch run.

NORTHVALE ROAD stalked the pace from a three wide path into the turn, confronted HEAVEN SHINES inside of the furlong grounds under firm handling
and drew clear in the end. HEAVEN SHINES pressed the pace through the turn, confronted the tiring pacesetter leaving the quarter-marker, was outkicked
by the winner in the final furlong but was best of the rest. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM had his head turned at the start and was away slowly, slipped to the
inside along the run into the turn and rallied in the stretch to secure the show. RHODIUM RUNNER was away alertly and was sent to set the fast pace from
an inside path while being pressured, was confronted leaving the quarter-marker and weakened in the drive. GO THRU THE HOLE broke in sharply at the
break and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace outside of foes along the turn while within aim, lost ground into the stretch and faded in the late going.

SONOFAFINCH was a bit green in the early going, tracked the pace from a two wide path on the turn, collared the pacesetter inside of the furlong grounds
and kicked clear in the end. SAL N LOUIE was off a step slow and stalked the pace from the second flight through the turn while saving ground, angled out
for the drive and was outkicked in the late going while besting the rest. GALOPIN GOURMET was away alertly and set the fractions through the turn, was
collared by the winner inside of the furlong marker but kept on to be a clear third. NICKEL NICKEL NINE stalked the pace outside of foes and gave way into
the drive. ACCLIDER was away awkwardly and lacked early speed, was two wide on the turn and was not a threat.

JENPIRESTRIKESBACK tracked the pace while saving ground through the turn, rallied leaving the bend along the inside, confronted BREAKING THE
CODE inside of the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that rival and won the head nod at the line to prevail. BREAKING THE CODE took command of the pace
and set moderately fast fractions through the turn, opened a clear lead into the final furlong, was headed by the winner inside of the sixteenth marker,
dueled with JENPIRESTRIKESBACK and was nipped on the line while clear of the rest. NOBLE CONTESSA stalked the pace from a two wide position on
the turn, gained ground into the stretch and was outfinished in the late stages, while clear for third. AMBER LOUISE stalked the pace outside of rivals and
weakened in the drive. LADY CHROME pressed the pace through the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

FULL OF LUCK (CHI) stalked the pace outside of rivals, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn, confronted MY SUNSHINE approaching the furlong
grounds, was firmly urged through the final furlong and responded to shake free of the runner-up in the late stages. MY SUNSHINE saved ground to the
second turn while stalking the pace, mounted an inside bid to take a narrow lead leaving the second turn, was confronted by FULL OF LUCK nearing the
furlong marker and was could not hold that rival off in the late going while holding for second. HOLY GHOST settled just off of the pace while never far back,
saved ground through the second turn, angled out for the drive and closed well in the end to claim the show. RIVER ROSE was hustled away from the gate
and set moderately fast fractions while being pressured, was caught nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the final stages. HAWK'S RISING
contested the early pace through the half-mile marker, lost ground along the second turn and was empty in the drive. PUSH THROUGH stalked the pace
from the second flight to the quarter-marker and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was away alertly, set the fractions while rating nicely, extended the lead off of the second turn and drew clear under mild urging in
the end. SHEZARUNAWAY saved ground to the second turn while stalking the pace from the midflight and was outfinished in the drive. MAGICAL
THOUGHT stalked the pace outside of foes, was three wide along the second turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch, though was well clear of the rest
for third. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was forwardly placed to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and weakened in the late stages. SILK ROAD
SALLY settled off of the pace, was three wide along the second turn and did not mount a late rally. KOKO'S MOM was unprepared at the start and was
away a step slowly, settled through the run to the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEASIDE DANCER was away alertly and took command of the fast pace into the turn, saved ground into the stretch and was kept to task to draw off in the
end. OYSTER SHOOTER was content to settle toward the rear in the early going, was steered three wide along the turn then swung widest into the drive
and while not a match for the winner in the final stages was up in time to earn the nod for second. DESERT SMOKE pressed the fast pace through the turn,
lost ground into the stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and was edged out for second in the final strides. SOMARA chased the pace from a three wide
path into the stretch and gave way in the drive. CHIRP was pinched at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from a two wide path through
the turn and tired in the late going. MISS SKI stalked the pace from the midflight through the turn and weakened in the drive. CIMARRON was a bit slow
leaving the break, lacked early speed into the turn and was not a factor.
