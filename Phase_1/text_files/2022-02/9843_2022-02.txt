Footnotes
GIFT FROM MOM was away alertly and quickly made the lead, led throughout and remained safe late under firm handling. FORTUNATE GINA pressed the
winner on the inside, could not gain late but was clearly second best. CRISTALINDA was unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and rallied. BISCAYNE
BAY was well placed early, steadied at the three eight pole and went evenly late. HIGH CUPPER never far back, lacked a late response.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE was off slowly, swung wide in the stretch and was no threat. BEST OF YOU was no menace. MY BELLE MICHELLE was outrun.
BLANCONIA flashed brief foot and was through early.
