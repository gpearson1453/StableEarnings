Footnotes
CAGED BEAR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, moved up outside around the second turn, made a wide bid, dueled late and proved the best.
SOUVENIR CHANNEL vied for the early advantage, took the lead at the head of the home stretch, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but
proved best of others. STORM BREACH raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. GRACE'S VISION showed
early speed, raced outside around the first turn and faded. IT'S TIME BABY unruly in the gates, lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor.
FILLMYPOCKETS raced near the back, came around the final turn wide and was never a threat. OLD TIME GIRL always raced near the back and showed
little. MARYJO'S DUCHESS went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. SHOTGUN ANNIE void of early speed
and was never close.

FROSTED GRACE stalked the leader in the early part, moved up around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. YOUNG BULL pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. IT MAKES SENSE raced in the back of the pack, came around the
first turn on the outside, made a wide gain and finished willingly. STEPHEN'S ANSWER went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, once collared
around the final turn, hung and lacked a finish. DOUBLE STAR void of early speed and was never close. EXTIRPATOR raced near the back, saved ground
around the second turn and was never a threat.

KINLEE'S SONG trailed in the early going, came around the turn on the outside,.made a wide bid, dueled down the lane with FIFTY PROTECTION and was
just up. FIFTY PROTECTION vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and just missed for the win, but
proved best of others. IMA SUNNY SONG challenged on the front end, saved ground and proved no match for the top two. GRAND PRADO showed early
speed, finished wide, faded and lacked a finish. BLUE RIDGE RED raced evenly near the back and was outrun. GOODROCKINALVIN was an early factor,
finished wide and was no threat late.

FLASH ME BACK pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn, drove clear and won under strong urging. HIP FOUR O FOUR unhurried in the
beginning, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SHAR'S TREASURE void of early speed, moved up, five wide
around the final turn, made a wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. QUANA DUDE lacked early speed, made a bid, lacked a late
kick and was caught for third. HOT LE ROY raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning, came around the first turn on the outside, eased back, showed
late interest, but was no factor. READY REDDING pressed the early pace and faded. FLAT OUT LOVE raced in the back of the pack, outside final turn and
was outrun. HARRY'S LIL HIPPIE raced within contention, faded, checked late and was no threat. SLOW raced in the middle of the field, dropped back,
checked late and was never close. DESIARD went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, dropped back, ducked out down the home stretch and was eased
to the wire.
