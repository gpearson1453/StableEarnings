Footnotes
NO MORE MASK , lightly bumped by SOMMER VELVET leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside that one around the turn, was carried out by
SOMMER VELVET in upper stretch, gained the lead near the eighth pole, drifted in approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SOMMER VELVET
came out at the break, sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, had room inside NO MORE MASK
in mid stretch then steadied on that one's heels when drifting out approaching the sixteenth pole. HIT A HOMER HONEY circled the turn three deep, drifted
to the four path turning for home and weakened. RUBI DE LEON , a brief factor early, was taken to the inner rail entering the stretch, remained there and
weakened. SEIZE THE WHISKEY hugged the inner rail around the turn and retreated through the stretch. I'M A LIL BOSSY , three wide leaving the turn,
was not a factor. An objection by the rider of SOMMER VELVET against the winner for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

Footnotes
CANDY LIGHT prompted the pace two wide, was put to a solid hand ride leaving the far turn, moved alongside the leader and dueled from the three
eighths, wrested command under a drive entering the lane, kicked clear a sixteenth late then held firm through the final furlong while kept to task.
CONTINENTALCONGRES , bumped at the break, was quite rank when dropping and pulling her way forward to the inside of runners, got settled near the
five eighths and stalked, eased out under pressure into the lane, worked between runners then dove back in past mid stretch, kept on gamely and earned
the place. REGINA broke forwardly despite stumbling at the break, stalked three wide, was under pressure pursuing past the three eighths, spun four wide
with aim into the lane, had aim from there but failed to seriously kick on. QUEEN CADENCE broke through the gate pre race but was apprehended quickly,
sped clear early and set the pace towards the rail, took pressure then dueled with the winner from mid turn to upper stretch, lacked a punch leaving the
three sixteenths and weakened. DOOMSCROLLER stalked outside a rival, was under asking mid turn but failed to respond. DETERMINED EMPIRE
stumbled at the break then bumped with a rival causing her rider to briefly lose the irons, regrouped and found herself well back after a quarter mile, raced
off the rail in the drive and failed to threaten. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but no action was taken.

KRACHENWAGEN saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, remained along the inner rail through the stretch, closed steadily and took the lead
approaching the finish. PAY THE KID raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the three path turning for home, gained a short lead outside horses
near the sixteenth pole, raced on his left lead late and flattened out. JUNGLE WARRIOR opened up on the turn, raced in the two path through the stretch
and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. LECTRIC CHOKE bobbled and was caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail
on the turn and was not a factor. TAPPIN FOR GLORY , three wide on the turn, was outrun. SEIZE THE DAY , chased the pace outside JUNGLE
WARRIOR around the turn and gave way. LINDA'S NEKIA , well off the inner rail on the turn, gave way. ALWAYS FORGIVEN trailed.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN prompted the pace outside of HOLY SYNCHRONICITY, inherited a clear lead when that one stumbled nearing the half mile marker, was
nursed around on the turn, spurted away under solid handling in mid stretch then held sway while kept alert in the final fifty yards. NIGHT BOSS rated close
up while saving ground early on, eased out to go around then between foes near the half mile pole, dropped back in to stalk around the turn, came out in
upper stretch, gave game chase from there and steadily gained. BALTIMORE BULLEIT lost ground four wide outside rivals, gave hard chase while even a
bit wider into the lane but came up empty late. SENATOR KELLY broke a step slow, edged up behind foes past the three quarter pole, checked when put in
close entering the turn, regrouped and stalked two wide between runners past the three eighths, pursued past the three sixteenths and faded. CACHIRULO
rated off the pace, angled out around the turn, made headway five wide under asking past the three eighths then flattened out through the lane.
AUSPICIOUS LAD , three wide between rivals stalking the pace, failed to kick on under asking entering the lane and gave way. CALL ME A DREAMER
gave early chase to the inside of runners then faltered. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY took over early and set the pace towards the rail, lost his footing in his left
front and stumbled near the half mile marker, was pulled up nearing the lane and walked off.

ALBERTANO , patiently handled down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, closed steadily inside ICE RAIN and took the lead approaching the
finish. ICE RAIN stalked the pace, maneuvered the turn in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. TRADITION , caught in close
quarters leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn and passed tired horses. DEJOHN set the pace near the inner rail and gave way. TINY TIN
bore out leaving the starting gate and passed tired horses in the drive. TRIPLE AMERICANO , three wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. ARTILLERY ,
wide on the turn, was outrun. STAND MY GROUND gave way leaving the turn. MAXIMO STRONG dropped back on the turn. INJECT THE LIGHT showed
speed along the inner rail and faltered on the turn.

MAGIC IN ME vied three wide between rivals nearing the half mile marker, dropped in and set a pressured pace two wide and under rating around the turn,
spurted away without much asking leaving the three sixteenths, was kept alert with some right handed asking with a sixteenth to go then was only under
mild hand asking late. DERBY JULEP , with the pace four deep nearing the turn, pressed three wide outside the winner around the turn and into the lane,
failed to keep pace in mid stretch but continued with effort and held down the place. CHASING ARTEMIS dropped well back early on and settled, came four
wide into the stretch, shifted further out and leveled off to finish well. HEIDI T vied between runners early, rated back off the leaders approaching the turn,
eased out and moved up three wide in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain in the final seventy yards. HARPER'S DO settled in the clear and off the
early pace, came under a ride mid turn, angled out but failed to kick on. TEXAS GIRL broke a step slow, pulled her way forward past the five eighths sat in a
good spot off of a four way scramble, was put to a ride three wide mid turn, failed to go on entering the stretch and faded. ILLUSION OF HOPE vied inside
rivals early on, dropped back off the leaders around the turn, was tough to handle and attempting to lug out entering the lane, dropped back and wandered
outward in the final furlong.

hugged the inner rail, dueled with the winner throughout and finished gamely. MAUREENLOVESFRANK stalked the duel around the turn, was three wide
turning for home and failed to rally. JOYFUL NOISE , off the duel while three wide on the turn, angled to the four path at the head of the stretch and lacked a
rally. GRACE ISABELLA chased the duel racing near the inner rail around the turn and weakened. RAVENEL raced along the inner rail most of the trip and
trailed.

Footnotes
ILLUSTRIOUS sped up to join PHRA PHROM leaving the chute and dueled towards the rail, was urged along while holding a short lead mid turn, shook
clear under a hearty ride near the three sixteenths, widened a sixteenth later then held sway while kept to task. BRETTMEISTER edged up early and got a
good spot stalking the dueling leaders, was coaxed along three wide approaching the stretch, switched over to his correct lead with a sixteenth remaining
and kept on willingly to gain. PHRA PHROM , bumped at the break, moved up and held a slim early lead while disputing the pace with the winner, ceded to
that one into the turn, stayed on to battle to upper stretch, continued with effort past the furlong grounds then faded. AMICALOLA FALLS , brushed at the
break, corrected and was taken to rate off the pace, moved up a bit two wide nearing the lane, shifted in and came up empty. BISCOTTO D'ORO , off slow
after he broke outward and brushed with the winner, moved up towards the rail into the turn, chased to the five sixteenths then gave way. KEEN ON YOU
leaned outward and hit the gate then bumped with a rival, rated back wide and was not a factor. SMOOZER , urged along two wide chasing the early pace,
dropped back before going a half mile.
