Footnotes
AZZURRA settled in the three path the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals five wide and
took the lead midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. LADY STORM settled off the rail on the first turn, bid toward the three
eighths pole and raced close in the three and four paths of the far turn, moved to the outside into the stretch and dug in to take second mid-stretch.
DISTORTED SPLENDOR rated a slim lead inside, was caught past the seven sixteenths pole and gave close chase from that point, but dropped back
mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. GRACE ELIZABETH saved ground close to the early pace, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn off the rail, was eased outward in the upper stretch and passed a rival. OCEAN LILLY rounded the first turn in the four path, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. COACH RUBE
stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, closed to the lead past the seven sixteenths pole but was caught while between horses and two deep
midway on the far turn, then weakened inside the eighth pole. VICTORY ROYALE stalked off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but faded readily.

turn about the five path and just missed third. SWISS HORIZON pressured the pace two deep while between horses but dropped back midway on the turn
and flattened the final sixteenth. IN THE NEWS was briefly close to the early pace while giving chase, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
BULLETS LADY stalked from the three path, took aim at the seven sixteenths pole then pulled herself to the front approaching the five sixteenths, drew
clear into the far turn then steadily drew off with minimal urging. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER raced off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but proved no match. LOVE CALIFORNIA steadied off the heels of
Speeding Ticket into the first turn then stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened
inside the eighth pole while able to maintain third. RHYTHM AND POWER was shuffled back early and rounded the first turn about the five path, bid past
the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. SPEEDING TICKET angled in and rated the pace inside, came under
pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was caught approaching the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. SUPERSTASIA ran in
the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. DAFFYDILL saved ground on the
first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and ran at the rail on the far turn.
