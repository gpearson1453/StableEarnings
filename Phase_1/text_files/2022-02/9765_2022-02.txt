Footnotes
MISTA VALENTINE was bumped between horses at the start, settled far off of the pace along the inside, launched a three wide rally into the far turn, gained
while tipping outside of the leading trio entering the lane, sustained his charge to gain an advantage approaching the final furlong while hanging on her left
lead, then changed leads while drawing clear entering the final sixteenth. JOEBOY broke inwardly at the start, tracked three wide, inched closer to press
into the far turn, bid entering the lane as an outer MISTA VALENTINE ranged up, but was outkicked by that foe approaching the final furlong, and proved
second best. UNBRIDLED HOPE set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressers around the far turn, met their bids and another outer
rival entering the lane, but proved no match for his widest rival approaching midstretch, and held show. MY LITTLE LEO stalked along the inside, chased
the leading trio around the far turn, and stayed on while one-paced. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked two
wide, pressed between horses while under strong urging around the far turn, but yielded while brushing an outer rival in upper stretch. MAXIMUM FURY
hesitated significantly at the start, raced far off of the pace three to two wide, and made little impact. REACHFORTHESABER tracked from midpack along
the inside, but faded around the far turn. CLASSIC'S OMEGA was bumped and put to crowded quarters at the start, then got outrun.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN broke inwardly and quickly at the start, set the pace, drew away from a pressing rival into the far turn, stayed in the three path around that
bend before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, then drifted many paths outwardly at the furlong grounds, but held sway to the wire. GET THEM
JUSTIN broke inwardly at the start, stalked two wide, chased the clearing leader from the three path around the far turn, gained place in upper stretch with a
few lengths to find, but failed to gain late, and was second best. CITY PARK broke a step slowly, settled far off of the pace in the three path, retreated to the
rear three wide into the far turn, swung to the nine path in upper stretch, and rallied to gain show in the final sixteenth. PAYDAY TOO rated far off of the
pace along the inside, then two wide into the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on between horses late. LOUISIANA MOON
raced in midpack in the five to four path around the first turn, came into the lane in the six path, stayed on to vie for show in the final furlong, but flattened out
between horses late. BUDRO TALKING saved ground at the rear, tipped to the two path turning for home, altered course outwardly in upper stretch, but
only produced a mild kick between horse. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT tracked from midpack in the three path, gained show at the furlong grounds, but tired.
JACI'S ROYALTY bumped with an inner rival while taking up between horses at the start, raced at the rear two wide, then four wide into the far turn before
taking that bend in the five path, swung to the eight path entering the lane, but failed to rally. WAR COUNT pressed outside of the leader, but failed to keep
pace into the far turn, then weakened in upper stretch. OUR BLUE JAY got a bit antsy in the gate, took a bump from an outer foe at the start, then stalked
along the inside, but faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
MOON OVER TUSCANY vied along the inside of FISN N CHICK, and drew off at the quarter pole. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB laid off of the pace two wide
and between horses while in the three path around the turn, shifted to the rail at the three sixteenths pole for clear sailing, claimed place from an outer rival
at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. KATIE'S KARAT trailed early on, raced off of the pace in the five path and outside of rivals around the turn,
tipped to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on through the final furlong to reach show at the wire. SNEAK PEEK tracked along the inside while a
path off of the rail around the turn, gained place passing the quarter pole while taking aim on the clear leader, but drifted out at the furlong grounds while
getting outkicked by an inner rival for that position, then faded, and was nailed on the wire for show. SWEET BAY raced off of the pace among foes,
retreated to trail the field in the four path at the three furlong pole, then passed tired foes in the lane without threatening. STRONG CHICK stalked outside of

Footnotes
HEALING tracked from midpack two wide, came under urging in the two path into the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied to bid inside of
the leader entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. FIREWATER JAKE bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, ranged
up in the three path around the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, led in upper stretch, drew clear before drifting out at the furlong grounds, but was
bested by an inner foe in the final sixteenth. MISHKO tracked from midpack along the inside, inched closer to stalk at the half mile pole, awaited in the
pocket around the far turn, but tipped outside of the early pace-setter as FIREWATER JAKE drew clear, chased that rival before getting outkicked for minors
in midstretch, then stayed on to claim show at the sixteenth pole. MOONSHINE NOW was severely sandwiched between horses soon after the start, raced
far off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven path at the furlong grounds, and stayed on to claim a minor share late. MAJESTIC SIGN stalked in
the three path, retreated to midpack at the half mile pole, chased the leaders from the four path and under urging around the far turn before fanning to the
six path entering the lane, but flattened out soon after. JACK THE UMPIRE set a clear pace while staying a path off of the rail, met FIREWATER JAKE's bid
around the far turn, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. PEACOCK KITTEN saved ground at the rear around both
turns, shifted out to the four path entering the lane, but failed to rally. GUNNISON bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace along the
inside, then two wide into the far turn before swinging to the six path entering the lane, but made little impact.

THE COMPLETE COURT dueled for the lead outside of CUSTOM FOR CARLITA while in the three path around the turn, led in the four path entering the
lane, shifted inwardly a path at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead, dueled with a rail bidding rival through the final sixteenth, and just lasted
to the wire while drifting outwardly late. TUFFOLOGY stalked along the inside, grinded away along the rail through the lane to bid for the lead a sixteenth
pole, dueled with THE COMPLETE COURT to the wire, but lost the bob via a tight photo finish. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA rushed to duel for the lead inside
of THE COMPLETE COURT, briefly failed to keep pace entering the lane, then chased two wide and between horses thereafter, and just saved show late.
ACTIVE GIRL broke step slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six to seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on while shifting
ground inwardly through midstretch, but missed reaching show. PEACEFUL VISION stalked in the two path, bid for place three wide in upper stretch, but
altered course outwardly after the outer leader drifted back in at the furlong grounds, and faltered. BOBBIES REASON never got involved. GILDED APPLE
tracked the pace setters from the four path, but faded in the five path in midstretch. KEHRON'S CREED raced off of the pace along the inside while a path
off of the rail, and tired.

LOLLOPING tracked from the midpack in the three path, moved early at the half mile pole to vie outside of a pair of rivals while in the four path around the
far turn, led entering the lane, showed the way from multiple bidders on either side in midstretch, and gamely held to the wire. PORONUI laid in midpack
along the inside, saved ground before tipping to the three path in upper stretch, rallied to split foes at the furlong grounds, produced a bid inside of the
leader approaching the final sixteenth, but was denied. PRIMA BALLERINA tracked from the two path, allowed an outer LOLLOPING to make first run into
the far turn, tracked the leading trio from the three path around the far turn before tipping to the five path and outside of that rival entering the lane, grinded
away to attempt a bid, but only managed to chase through the final furlong. PARIS PARAMOUR trailed in the three path around the first turn, split foes in
the two path at the five sixteenths pole while commencing a rally, swung to the six path entering the lane, completed a bid in midstretch while outside of
foes, but flattened out a sixteenth from home. SPRING MAGIC stalked two wide and from the three path around the first turn, inched closer entering the
backstretch to press the pace setter, vied in the three path and between horses into the far turn, led briefly passing the five sixteenths pole, but was headed
entering the lane, and gave way inside of a quartet of rivals at the furlong grounds. FLOWER GARDEN raced far off of the pace along the inside, then two
wide around the far turn, and never got involved. FORDLAND stalked in the two path around the first turn, but weakened at the half mile pole, and was done
early. ZISISIT (IRE) laid off of the pace in the four path around the turns, and faded through the lane. VINEGAR VEGGIES set the pace, met a pair of bids
into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. AWESOME HOPE raced at the rear two to three wide, and showed little.

HOIST THE GOLD broke a step slowly, stalked along the inside, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, blew past the leaders under mild urging at the furlong
grounds, and swiftly drew off before being wrapped up through the final sixteenth. FEROCIOUSLY bobbled at the start without being costed position,
cleared to the rail early on, set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals into the turn, gamely dug in turning for home, but offered little resistance to an
outer bidder at the furlong grounds, then held place through the late stages. KISSALOT prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied around the
turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidding HOIST THE GOLD at the furlong grounds, then yielded. CANDY LANDING pressed the pace three wide, but
subtly drifted out entering the lane, and faded four wide at the quarter pole. JESUIT laid at the rear outside of a rival, but came under urging in the four path
into the turn, floated five wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick with a paddling stride.

Footnotes
FLATTER ME SILLY shied a bit inwardly at the start, settled far back in the two path, took the far turn four wide before tipping outside of foes entering the
lane, rallied well through the final furlong to bid in the late stages, dueled outside of YOUENS to the wire, and prevailed. YOUENS laid off of the pace along
the inside, then three wide and between horses around the far turn, dove to the rail entering the lane for clear sailing, rallied to bid inside of the leader at the
sixteenth pole, dueled with a bidding FLATTER ME SILLY through the closing stages, but was bested. BLESSED ANNA tracked along the inside, stalked
around the far turn, gained an advantage passing the quarter pole after the leader drifted, drew clear in upper stretch, but tired between horses in the final
sixteenth. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE was put to a bit of tight quarters between horses early on, laid off of the pace in the three path, gained before tracking
two wide and between horses around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch and chased.
SCARLETT LACE stalked two wide, pressed between horses into the far turn, but was floated out by the leader entering the lane, then yielded between
horses in midstretch. HOHOHOHO set the pace along the inside, but drifted outwardly entering the lane, and weakened between horses.
PAYTONSATTHEPLATE lagged well behind the field, then passed tired rivals. BLOSSOM ROAD broke inwardly and bumped the gate, then was keen to
place before tracking in the two path around the first turn, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, then tired through the lane. BELIEVING tugged
forward into the first turn while achieving a stalking position in the five to three path, pressed three wide into the far turn, but caved while floating out entering
the lane. PRINCESS LEA laid off of the pace in the four path, but went wrong and was injured at the nine sixteenths pole, pulled up approaching the half
mile marker, then was vanned off.

DUVEE set the pace, widened his advantage around the far turn, and drew off under mild hand urging. CHIEF KIMOSABI laid off of the pace in the four to
three paths around the turns, then rallied in the two path through upper stretch, and caught an outer foe for place on the wire. HELAIRE stalked the leader
from the two path, chased that rival while proving no match, then got nailed on the wire by an inner foe for place. MR ELVIN stalked three wide, chased the
clear leader around the far turn, then faded in upper stretch. BIG BOO tracked four wide around the first turn, but faded along the inside around the far turn.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN was never involved. VERO CAMPIONE was off slowly and got outrun.
