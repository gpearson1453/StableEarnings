Footnotes
SENSEI LAWRENCE bumped with KHOPILOT and was shut off by MAKART at the start, rushed up outside, took the lead near the half-mile pole, drew
clear in the two path around the turn and widened under a drive. MILLENNIUM CONDO chased the pace two wide, tipped three wide turning for home,
continued on the left lead in the lane, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold the place. MAKART broke inwardly, stalked the pace three wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. KHOPILOT bumped with the winner at the start, chased the pace four wide and never
threatened. THE BEAST set the early pace along the rail, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn and tired in the drive. CATCHING MAGIC
was outrun inside. EYOKILE trailed outside, was eased nearing the lane, cantered across the finish line and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CAJUN MANDATE sped to the lead soon after the start and angled inside, held firm around the turn, roused for more entering the upper stretch, responded
willingly, widened to a clear advantage, tapped twice left handed with a furlong left to run then stayed sharp while ridden out. MIMI'S BEACH HOUSE raced
between foes in close pursuit of the early leader, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and cleared second best. DANGER RANGER raced inside near
midpack, tipped out three wide late on the turn, ran on two to three wide through the lane and secured a share. TETRAGRAMMATON was forwardly placed
along the inside soon after the start, remained in close contention around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane then flattened in the final furlong. GLORY
AND VICTORY got bumped a bit after the start, chased three to four near midpack then ran on evenly through the lane. INDEED INDEED raced in the last
flight, came two wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. FROSTY THE BULL got bumped just after the start, raced four wide through
the turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. ARIES REIGNS bumped with rivals just after the start, angled in three wide and raced up
close just off the early leader, sustained bid to the mid-way point on the turn then gave way. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE raced two to three wide just off
mid-flight then failed to respond around the turn. BETTINGONADREAM saved ground and never moved into contention.

Footnotes
WAR STAR sat behind the leading trio around the turn, came four wide gathering momentum into the stretch, reached the front from outside a sixteenth out
and drove clear. SIMPLY THE BEST was slow from the gate and steadied inside FOLLOW ME MOM a couple strides later, raced in the second flight two
then three wide to the stretch, and rallied with good energy between horses. FOLLOW ME MOM steadied inside PROPER MANNERS entering the turn well
back, moved out for the drive and found her best stride belatedly outside the runner-up. MOANAS POWER set the pace inside to the stretch, and
weakened. PROPER MANNERS saved ground and lacked a rally. ROMANTIC TALE broke slowest, and was no factor three wide. BABY MO tracked
outside the leaders to the stretch, and tired. DOMINEER pressed the early pace between horses, and tired after three furlongs. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

I BELIEVE IN MAGIC vied four wide down the backstretch, contested the lead while in the three path around the turn then drove clear in the lane. OAXACA
set a pressured pace inside, resisted the winner past the eighth pole and held clear of the rest. HOTTER THAN JULY broke inwardly, chased the pace
inside down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn and was along for the show. RACING COLORS was off slow, saved ground well, swung five
wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MILES OF SMILES had early speed between foes, could not quite keep pace nearing the turn, angled to the rail
entering the bend, chased inside and lacked a rally. DOVE IN CHARGE was up close three wide between foes down the backstretch, chased two wide
around the turn and tired in the drive. OHTONQUI played no factor while racing three wide. STEPSTONES was outrun while racing three wide.

EMIRATES AFFAIR was prompted to a forward placing in opening stages then moved up to engage the top pair midway around the turn, dueled three deep
into the final furlong then kicked clear under right-handed pressure. SUPER LUNAR raced in the back but never far from the front-end, launched an outside
bid leaving the turn, produced a solid finish five then four wide but had to settle for second best. SACRED SUNDAY came away last and angled to the rail,
moved up closer with three furlongs left to run, tipped out four wide late on the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and gained show. MONEY AND
HONEY vied inside of WORKINONBEINGSINGLE in opening stages, took on the added challenge of EMIRATES AFFAIR mid-way through the turn, battled
on to the furlong grounds then gave way. WORKINONBEINSINGLE dueled outside of MONEY AND HONEY in the early going, took on the added challenge
of the winner mid-way through the turn, fought back between foes to the furlong grounds then weakened.

Footnotes
TREASURE KING was slowest away, advanced three wide through the middle stages, remained in the three-path joining the leaders from outside at the top
of the stretch, had SPACE RUNNER get away from him through the furlong grounds, then stayed on task and wore that rival down late. SPACE RUNNER
contested a slow pace inside, responded when hooked after six furlongs, spurted clear with an eighth of a mile remaining, but could not withstand the winner
in the closing yards. VINTAGE YEAR broke slowly and trailed for six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn and rallied mildly to wind up a distant third. MR.
CELLULAR prompted SPACE RUNNER from outside, poked a head in front after six furlongs, then weakened between horses leaving the far turn.
GLOBES saved ground in range early, then faded steadily. ETERNAL FLAME was forwardly placed early, and tired approaching the stretch.

DISC JOCKEY raced in range while bottled up behind horses for six furlongs, angled four wide near the quarter pole, surged forward, seized command
turning for home, quickly drew off as the rider dropped the left rein, stuck on the left lead to the sixteenth pole, angled in while finally switching leads and
widened under minimal urging. LITTLE DEMON stalked the pace three wide, briefly led between foes leaving the quarter pole, was no match for the winner
but stayed on to be clearly second best. BOLDNESS set the pace along the rail, yielded leaving the quarter pole and held third. RACE CRAFT failed to
menace while racing four wide. FLIPPING FISH pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole then retreated through the lane. SIR
KAHN trailed inside.

Footnotes
AMUSING ANTICS tracked the clear top two leaders through early stages, was patiently handled two wide between foes around the far turn, swung six wide
into the lane, dug in determinedly under right-handed pressure and edged away in deep stretch. LOVE IN THE AIR bumped with foe at the start then was
forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair through early going, launched a five wide bid leaving the far turn, dug in between foes in
deep stretch and gained place. MONA STELLA angled inside soon after the start and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid
near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane, dug in between in final stages and captured show. ABUSE OF POWER cleared soon after the start and
angled inside, set the pace with MONA STELLA the only close pursuer in the early going, got collared for the lead late on the far turn, launched a game
rebid along the rail in the final furlong, took back a slight edge then yielded in final stages. SECRET TIME (GER) settled three wide up the backstretch then
loomed boldly and took over a slim lead late on the far turn, continued on top with a furlong left to run then came up empty in the final sixteenth.
COMMANDERS PALACE raced in the back and saved ground, swung wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. LILAC GIRL rated inside up the
backstretch, was ridden along the rail into the lane and failed to kick on. WOW raced off the early pace, made a brief move with three furlongs left to run but
could not sustain bid and flattened out. THREE TIPSY CHIX was unhurried three wide, chased two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
RIVENDELL saved ground to no avail. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
LUNI SIMA was allowed to settle early, split horses moving out to the three-path leaving the quarter-pole, overpowered BACKATYA from outside in upper
stretch and drew off under a mild drive. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT chased after BACKATYA through the opening half-mile, could not match the winner's kick
turning for home, but ran on willingly to be clearly second best. VLADISLAV raced four wide around the turn, and was along for the show without
threatening. GRAN ANDREWS raced three wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. ADVENTURE SEEKER broke slowly and was no factor inside.
BACKATYA set the pace in the two-path, and was empty as the winner ran by in upper stretch. DOCTOR RON chased early two wide, and was through
after a half-mile.

along the inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, tipped five wide nearing the lane and rallied outside to gain the place late. RED HOT AND BLUE
was in range while racing two wide between foes, moved into the second inside of foes leaving the eighth pole but was outfinished for the place. NEPOTISM
tracked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn and weakened a bit in the lane. MARIA'S REVENGE failed to menace
