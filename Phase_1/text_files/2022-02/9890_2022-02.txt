Footnotes
DESIARD vied for the early lead, drove clear, saved ground and was kept to the task. PAT ME DOWN void of early speed, saved ground around the turn,
made a rail bid and got up for second. BAYOU BEAUX pressed the pace, saved ground and was caught late for second. SAILING JETT pressed the early
pace, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. HOT LE ROY lacked early speed, came around the turn five wide,and finished evenly. MAXIMILIANO
raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. MARVELOUS RED dueled on the front end and dropped back. PAY DIRT always raced near the back
and showed little.
