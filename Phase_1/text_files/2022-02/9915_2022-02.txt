Footnotes
GALAXINA hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide under some pressure from EMPIRE LILY early on and TONIGHT WE LOVE
to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and inched away to the finish kept to task.
BIG BEAN CHRISTINE just off the inside early on, grew a bit rank and got out to the five or six path with six furlongs to go, the rider correcting with a right
handed crop, went five wide through the turn and then six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. COSTANTI five
then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. TONIGHT
WE LOVE hustled from the gate, prompted the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued along the inside into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. FROSTY INVASION hustled from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. LINARITE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response. EMPIRE LILY showed speed prompting the pace four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of fading, went three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
LOKOYA ROAD was sent hard from the start, raced in a good spot in fourth position while ridden along, went four then five wide on the turn, pursued the
leading duo under the crop into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up in a prolonged drive to prevail. SPECTATORLESS showed good
speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, fought on
gamely with PROFUSION into the final sixteenth and bested that foe for the place but was overtaken by the winner. PROFUSION pressed the pace on the
outside of the leader then in the three path on the turn, drew even under the crop into upper stretch, dueled outside of SPECTATORLESS into the final
sixteenth and was overtaken by the winner then just missed the place but narrowly held the show. IT'S MANDATORY was sluggish in the early going and
displayed no speed, went three then four wide under urging on the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the
show. FOREVER WICKED settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response. SCOTTY bobbled ever so slightly at the start, was urged along well off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. KID
CHOCOLATE dropped well off the pace on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. JACOBA was
urged along near the back, saved ground while hard ridden on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and was no factor. RESPECT FOR ALL tracked
the pace on the outside, chased in the four path through the turn and faded.

REGGAE MUSIC MAN dueled from the two path with JOHNNY FONTAINE to his inside, shook off that rival inside the five-sixteenths and came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was under a light hand ride through the final stages to
the wire. FORTY COMETS chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. A
LONGLONGTIMEAGO broke in at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. TACO BEAN chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and weakened. THE COBBLER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, paused
and altered out around the backing up injured foe a furlong from home, then got eased home to the finish. JOHNNY FONTAINE dueled inside of REGGAE
MUSIC MAN from the get go coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off inside the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
in pursuit, suffered an injury to his right hind nearing the eighth pole and was immediately placed to a strong protective hold, the rider looking around to
ensure his rivals could clear before being expertly eased up before being pulled up inside the eighth pole, then was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
BELLS ON HER TOES settled towards the rear of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, commenced a rally into upper stretch, tipped out while
gaining into the final furlong, closed fast to get the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. KAY TEE GAL was hustled to the
front, set the pace under light pressure, inched away with a half-mile to run, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, led to the just before the sixteenth-pole before being collared by the winner and missed but was
clear for second. MY FIRST LOVE pressed the pace on inside of the leader, was eased back near the half-mile pole, tracked inside for most of the turn,
shifted three wide while asked outside the quarter-pole, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. ICE
KREEM SUNDAE broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. PALS ALLY was
reserved off the pace, came under stronger restraint while off heels near the half-mile pole, saved ground while let out on the turn, was asked for her best
into upper stretch and failed to rally. DARE TO BE GREAT settled just off the pace then dropped back with five furlongs to run, was urged four then five
wide on the turn and came up empty. KOKUTAI tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back under the crop late on
that bend and capitulated. ALARRA stumbled at the start, steadied behind foes inside the three-quarter pole, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to
respond. FALSE HOPE settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

GREEN LIGHT GO went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. DOUBLY
BLESSED bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was coaxed early then settled off the pace, came under urging along the rail on the turn, tipped into the
two path under a drive in upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. MILTON THE MONSTER broke out and bumped lightly with an
opponent, showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost touch with the winner at the quarter-pole, chased that
foe in the stretch and weakened but just held the show. PIRATE'S PUNCH made light contact with a foe at the start, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased three wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. WAXMAN bumped lightly
with a foe at the start and was off a step slow, angled out at the rear while ridden along, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. OUR LAST
BUCK was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged four wide on the turn then spun five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response.

AMONG MEN broke in at the start brushing HANGAR ONE, prompted the leader from the outside four paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking
to the two path into the turn, advanced to take over the front three furlongs from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under lone threat and was caught in the late going while safe for the place honors. FOREST SPIRIT hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. VICTORY BUILT showed the way in hand three then two wide
under pressure from HONOR AMONG MEN to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and was headed for the front by that rival, took the inside route
into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish. D'VINICRIS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into
