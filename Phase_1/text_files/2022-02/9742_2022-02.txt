Footnotes
RAHMER moved up three deep leaving the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and drove clear. VANHOOFER rushed up to take the early lead, set
the pace along the rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and failed to match strides with the winner. BOURBON ON THE BAY , in the two path
chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace in an even effort. AMAZING ROCKET saved ground around
the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and was no factor. CALLYOURIGHTBACK , sluggish to begin, circled the turn four wide, raced on his left lead
in the stretch and failed to rally. DECEIVING bobbled slightly leaving the starting gate, trailed and raced along the inner rail on the turn.

Footnotes
SWING WEST broke inward and bumped with rival, regrouped and found himself last early on, responded when given his cue and quickly advanced
heading into the turn then stalked two wide between rivals, emerged as the closest pursuer of STROLL SMOKIN heading into the stretch, advanced to have
aim in mid stretch, continued grinding while on his left lead and forged ahead under a drive in the final yards. STROLL SMOKIN was hard sent to go clear
early, set the pace in the two path, remained well clear into the stretch, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner strides.
MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU was rated back off foes early on, settled in the clear leaving the far turn, angled four wide for the drive and churned on willingly. A
PENN LEGACY , away alertly, was hung out four deep while chasing the pace but kept on with interest. FIZBO drafted back off the early pace and raced
outside a rival, angled five wide approaching the stretch, straightened and offered a belated kick. THE WALK was steadied off foes nearing the half mile
marker, chased to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn but failed to rally. HARD FOUGHT , three wide between runners while stalking the pace, was
under pressure approaching the stretch and came up empty. COMMANDING GENERAL stumbled badly and was bumped by the winner at the break,
recovered and edged up, chased to the inside of three rivals to mid turn, stayed on with interest to about mid stretch then faded.

Footnotes
PEACE OUT , quickly clear, saved ground on the turn, held on gamely. I CAN DO IT , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the
two path in mid stretch and rallied. HALEIGH B , snugly rated down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch and
showed a mild gain. KILLY START chased the pace racing in the two to three path on the turn, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and weakened.
UTTERLY COURAGEOUS , wide on the turn, was not a factor. ISLAND PHILO swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TASFEEQ ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, was outrun. BOURBON GYPSY , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was unhurried early and trailed through the
stretch.

Footnotes
ACADIAN GIRL cleared early and set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when roused in upper stretch, widened under a solid drive leaving mid
stretch and was kept alert to the final yards. VIKING QUEEN edged up between rivals around the first turn and garnered a stalking spot, was under pressure
pursuing past the five sixteenths, wandered outward a bit in the drive but kept on trying and was clear of the rest. GLOWING STAR , off the pace while
saving ground, eased out and moved up between runners leaving the far turn, shifted back in a bit to chase in upper stretch but went evenly through the
final furlong. SIERRA LEONA lagged back while four wide into the backstretch, remained about four wide into the far turn, came very wide for the drive and
had some late life. GOLDEN GRANT , four wide, was under pressure into the far turn, remained four wide chasing into the lane and came up empty.
TAYLER'S CHROME stalked three wide, was under a ride around the final turn then faded through the final eighth. NANA'S SHOES , off the pace while
between foes, shifted five wide into the lane but lacked a rally. HETTY G. was rated back from between horses nearing the first turn, lagged back then
dropped further back through he lane. ARBUTUS saved ground while in range to the half mile marker, failed to kick on from there and faltered.

BOLD BANDIT and weakened in upper stretch. DAPER'S DRINK , no factor, was fanned four wide turning for home. LITTLE BAY was outrun. QUAD

STICKIT TO THE MAN vied two wide outside a rival, battled on between foes heading to the quarter pole, responded when roused soon into the lane, shook
clear leaving the three sixteenths and eagerly widened under strong handling. FASHIONISTA eased out early and took aim of the dueling leaders, bid three
deep mid turn, vied into the lane, failed to kick on with the winner in mid stretch but kept on with effort to be second best. MISS FOXANN leaned in at the
break and brushed with SULLIVAN STREET, corrected and disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, kept up the fight to upper stretch, began a retreat
in mid stretch and wandered out several paths in the final sixteenth. SULLIVAN STREET , four wide near the half mile marker, was under asking three wide
mid turn, altered in near the sixteenth pole and came up empty. CROSSTOWN GIRL , sluggish from the gate, found herself well back early on, was under a
ride leaving the far turn and failed to respond.

MAJESTIC FRONTIER , rated behind horses while along the inner rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, slipped through along the rail at the head of
the stretch, was under urging in the drive and drew away. THE ADDISON POUR , eager while under snug rating outside horses on the first turn, remained
well off the rail on the far turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. SCRIPT , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch and on the
far turn, was carried to the three path at the head of the stretch and gave way the final furlong. MAXIMUM IMPACT lacked speed, swung to the seven path
in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. SHADY MUNNI , three wide chasing the pace, gave way in upper stretch. MR. MOX set the pace along the inner
rail, drifted to the two path entering the stretch then faltered. SOUPER ROYAL MOON stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the
far turn and was no factor.

PROPER ATTIRE sped clear early, set a rated pace about two wide, responded when set down three wide in upper stretch, raced erratically as she opened
up but maintained a comfortable advantage while kept to task. HOPE HAS A NAME settled in the clear while not too far back, came under a ride past the
three eighths, shifted four wide into the lane and kept on willingly to be second best. DARIA'S ANGEL lagged back early and saved some ground into the
turn, angled out approaching the stretch, shifted wider near the three sixteenths and churned on. FRAUDULENT CHARGE tracked the winner from the
outside, ranged up mid turn, had dead aim nearing the quarter pole, failed to respond soon into the stretch and faltered through the final furlong. DULCE
KIARA lacked speed while off the rail, came five wide for the drive, steadied off heels near the three sixteenths, angled in but failed to menace.

RED MESA disputed the pace between rivals, raced on his left lead in the stretch until the sixteenth pole and prevailed in an extended drive. VINNY , three
deep disputing the pace around the turn, was floated out a bit in upper stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch and continued gamely. PLAYBOY ROY , under
urging midway down the backstretch, was four deep midway on the turn, angled in near the three sixteenths pole, was forced to alter course to the outside
of SKY OF GOLD near the eighth pole and had a mild rally between foes. SKY OF GOLD saved ground around the turn disputing the pace, drifted out in
upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and gave way. SELVATICO showed speed between horses the opening furlong, failed to keep pace and faded.
