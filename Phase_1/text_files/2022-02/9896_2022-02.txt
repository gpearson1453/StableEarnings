UNCLE MAGIC sprinted clear to set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off and extended the lead while ridden out. COASTAL KING was
crowded at the start, stalked the pace while racing inside, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, dropped back and was no match for the winner. FLYING
CHARLIE trailed the field, angled out for the drive, went six wide and offered a mild bid to earn show. GREENBRIER showed speed to the turn and flattened
out. INDIAN NIGHTS raced close to the pace, ralled four wide on the turn, loomed a threat and stopped.

FIRE WHEN READY set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and inched clear late to prove best. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM got away well,
pressed the pace while racing inside, challenged along the rail on the turn, dueled through the stretch and yielded late. WE'RE JUST SAYIN broke
awkwardly to be away slow, trailed far back and finished well inside to earn show. MR. PICKLES raced close to the pace inside, angled out, went widest in
the drive and lacked a bid. RIDEO stalked the pace, challenged three across on the turn, came up empty and stopped.

TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE challenged between horses along the backstretch, drew off leaving the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. KEEP IT
ROLLIN stalked the pace, challenged for the lead into the second turn, fell back and finished second best. BALAS was hustled along the inside, dueled to
the second turn, leveled off and held for show. MAGIC START veered out at the start, pressed the pace along the inside, fell back and steadily faded.
SEENEVA THE CAT stalked the pace while racing outside, was through early and dropped back. SHEZA HOME HIT was impeded at the start, clipped
heels and trailed the field. Following a stewards' inquiry, MAGIC START was disqualified and placed sixth for causing interference at the start.
