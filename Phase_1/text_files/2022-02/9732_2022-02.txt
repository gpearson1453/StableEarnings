Footnotes
PINK POSSE set a well handled pace from the start, drew off in the stretch and was kept to task in the end while clear. LIGHT SHIFT was unhurried early
then rallied and started a run on the turn, moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive and was gaining ground to be second best. BLACK MAGIC LADY
was unhurried early then rallied on the turn, swung out to be six wide in upper stretch and closed ground willingly in the end. THINKITASADONATION
chased the early pace while two wide, was hard used on the turn and gave way in the stretch. FADED MEMORIES was hustled along the inside to be in
contention then saved ground on the turn but faltered in the stretch. TELLING THYME chased the early pace while inside, was used up then gave way.
SHEDIALED BURREAUX was unhurried early then moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive and was no threat. CURIOUS SENSATION was
unhurried early and no threat. JAN'S BABY was inside and trailed throughout.
