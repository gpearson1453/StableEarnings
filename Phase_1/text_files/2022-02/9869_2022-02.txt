Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE pressed the issue early off the inside, fell back off the leader when three wide into the lane, shaken up, when straightened for home,
came again late and was edging away late under firm handling. SIDETOWN broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, shook clear when straightened for
home while still in hand, roused late when confronted, could not contain the winner. MAJOR ATTRACTION forwardly placed toward the inside, continued to
save ground into the lane, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, remained clear of the others. BROTHER AARON turned in an even effort with a
three wide trip. GAINER raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. STOCK DEAL off a step slow, trailed for a
half while outside, five wide into the lane, also lacked a closing response. TOOBADSOSAD void of speed, five wide exiting the turn, remained back as well
in the run to the wire. LADY GUSTO in mid pack along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
FASTEST SPIN behind the pace toward the inside for a half, moved closer and challenged in the three path and between horses turning into the stretch,
shook clear, kept to task the final furlong. SIMONA'S CHOICE chased the early leader just off the inside continued in the two path while losing some
position through the turn, set down drive, rerallied for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. UNHERDOF lacked early speed outside, raced four wide
through the turn, along for the show. GRAPEVINE within striking distance well out in the strip, also raced four wide through the bend, had little left final
furlong. LITTLE BURRITO in the main group off the inside, dropped to the inside late in the turn, lacked a closing kick. VERY SPICY made little impact while
racing three wide. MERCURY HEAD broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, set the pace for a half then gave way when headed entering the stretch. SPILLED
PERFUME off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
LIFE OF SATURDAYS off the early pace toward the inside, tipped out to be four wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, set down for the drive,
finished with good resolve to be going away at the end. MISS RITA away in good order, narrowly set the early pace while angling toward the inside, dropped
all the way to the rail early in the turn, shook well clear soon after, continued to hold a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the
winner, clearly second best. WAR MUSIC settled off the pace and the inside, asked along in the two path exiting the turn, had little for the top two the final
furlong, well clear of the others. MAZIE G broke on top, dueled early inside the runner up, checked up along the rail into the turn, fell back off that rival
immediately afterward, went evenly through the lane. JERI DAWN lacked speed, three wide through the turn, in some traffic late in the turn, improved into
the lane, no late gain. CANCAN SAREE back off the speed, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. SHINING
TERRI four wide into the turn when well off the pace, floated out to be five wide turning for home, failed to rally. ANGIE'S REVRAC forwardly placed while
three wide for a half then gave way. TALLANDLONG within striking distance up the backstretch along the inside, backed up through the stretch. FEMININE
ALLURE broke back, was always outrun. KENKEAD off a step slow, was never close.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN outsprinted while in hand, patiently handled through the turn, split foes exiting the turn, roused, edged away while fully extended to
prevail. ONE FOR RICHIE with the early pace while in the two path, came out a bit to be three wide into the stretch, long drive for the place spot, gained the
nod while unable to match the winner late. CUMBERLAND AVENUE prompted the pace outside, five down to four wide turn, extended duel for the place,
missed. BABY I'M PERFECT narrowly set the pace along the inside for a half, began to weaken when headed by the runner up midway on the turn,
continued to tire through the lane while narrowly holding position. CAVE RUN forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, three wide through the rest of
the bend while in some traffic, widest drive, went evenly to the wire. COLOSI last to leave, raced back, lacked a serious rally. WRONGWAYHIGHWAY
flashed brief speed while between foes,, finished before a half.

Footnotes
BIG BASE prominent from the start off the inside, dueled the middle half in the two path, put that rival away after being headed late in the final turn,
responded when challenged by the runner up, dug in late to find more and gain the nod. DESCENTE in some traffic along the inside into the first turn,
moved out a bit, continued off the pace the middle half, came three to four wide out of the final turn, challenged outside the winner late, missed. CLOSE TO

Footnotes
SMOKIN WILLIE broke with the leaders, stalked three wide into the turn, set down entering the stretch, closed with good resolve to be in time under brisk
encouragement. SINNER'S SIN narrowly set the pace along the inside, shook clear of the other speed when straightened for home, drifted out slightly as
the winner was moving to challenge late, no match, held sway 2nd. EL GEMAR off a step slow, raced back well back for a half just off the inside, steered out
up upper stretch for room, finished up willingly to be up for the show and to also be getting to the top two. GHAALEB'S BIG WIN off a step slow, raced back,
dropped inside for the run through the turn, two path into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late interest to also close the gap on the top two.
IMPROBABLE JOURNEY with the pace up the backstretch three wide, continued to contest the issue then weakened in the drive. BIGTIME TEGRIDY
broke sluggishly, raced back while well wide, four to five wide turning for home, improved position with some belated interest. PORTSMOUTH went one
paced throughout while racing three wide. SMOKEY STORY off a step slow, raced back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. DRAG
MALIBU raced in mid pack early, failed to menace while three to four wide late in the turn. COLD CITY forwardly placed and four wide into the turn, had little
left for the stretch run. '. CHIRON was outrun while three wide. COACH HAPPY vied up front between horses for a half and stopped.

NECKER ISLAND settled off the rail, closer second turn, split foes turning for home, kicked down the leader under firm handling. CONCERT TOUR sprinted
clear through the first turn, held a sizable advantage up the backstretch while setting a lively pace, rebroke to once again be clear when straightened for
home, could not contain the winner, comfortably held the place. GUN IT in mid pack while four wide through the first turn, remained outside and was four
wide again through the second bend, finished willingly to be getting to the top two late while remaining widest through the stretch. MO MOSA settled behind
the pace along the inside, continued to save ground in an even effort, lacked closing kick. MUCHO raced closest to the runner up while just off the inside,
moved closer in the second turn then flattened out in the drive. WELLS BAYOU raced in the second flight while three wide, had little for the drive.
ATTACHMENT RATE last to leave, trailed throughout.

MOCHA KISS washy, broke with the field, raced in the second flight in the two path, in some traffic late in the turn, clear for the drive, could do little little with
the winner the final furlong, second best. HOT SPRINGS BLING void of speed, raced four out to five wide through the turn, staged a mild rally while
remaining well wide to earn the show. MY DAMS ATITUDE off a step slow, lacked speed while racing off the inside, three to four wide through the turn, also
improved position with some moderate late interest. STARRGARITA void of speed, steadied nearing the half mile marker, saved ground early in the turn,
two path into the stretch when improving then flattened out in the final furlong. SERIOUSLY SASSY away well, set or forced the pace for a half while
between foes, faltered in the drive. TRULY A ROCKET prompted the pace for a half in the four path, weakened in the drive. MS SASSY ATITUDE off a step
slow, failed to menace. OOCHIE vied up front early along the inside, began to give way in the turn, continued to tire through the stretch. ROSE MARIE B
settled in mid pack and three wide, failed to muster a rally. DERBY DAY LASSIE off slowly, moved up to race in the main body for a half, three to four wide
turn, tired in the drive. LOUEMMA fell back, checked up before a quarter, trailed home.
