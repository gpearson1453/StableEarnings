Footnotes
MURDO settled far off of the pace two wide into the turn, shifted four wide and outside of the leading group turning for home, rallied through the final furlong
with a good kick to reel in the clear leader late, and got up in a very tight photo. CHAPEL BARN set the pace, managed a clear advantage around the turn,
drew off entering the lane, but tired in the final sixteenth, and got nailed. DEANO stalked along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, grinded away
on his left lead to gain place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position a sixteenth out. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) pressed
the leader from the outside early on, chased him around the turn, then tired after losing place at the furlong grounds. WILL KNOWS saved ground off of the
pace, but failed to rally. THE GRAY BLUR was outrun. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

Footnotes
WICKED WONDER stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, easily split the leaders split the leaders after CHATON ROUGE bore out
approaching the lane, ranged up outside of ALLOCATE passing the quarter pole, and drew off entering the final furlong. ALLOCATE set the pace along the
inside, met WICKED WONDER's bid in upper stretch, but proved no match for that rival at the furlong grounds, and stayed well clear of show. LADY
MAEVE (IRE) broke a bit outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, tucked to the rail at the three quarter pole, saved ground
around the far turn before advancing inside of rivals entering the lane to claim show, shifted outside of the leading pair inside the quarter pole, but failed to
keep pace with those rivals through the final furlong, and was best of the rest. CHATON ROUGE took minor bumps from rivals on either side at the start,
stalked two wide, vied into the far turn, but bore out to the four path turning for home, then weakened entering the lane. BEE RIGHT broke inwardly at the
start, trailed the field along the inside around the first turn, chased from off of the pace in the three path and between horses into the far turn, then was mildly
shut off when a clear LADY MAEVE (IRE) shifted across her path passing the quarter pole, and lacked a rally thereafter. BURNING DESIRE brushed an
inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, came under a drive in the four path at the three furlong pole, got floated to the five path approaching the lane, and
tired on her left lead. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

Footnotes
CYPRIANO tracked in the four path around the first turn, bid for the lead two wide and between horses into the far turn, vied before forging an advantage
with a quarter mile to go, and held through the lane as his inner counterpart battled on. RANCH BADGE vied two wide around the first turn before clearing
into the backstretch, showed the way before meeting a pair of bids into the far turn, got headed by his most immediate rival turning for home, fought on
gamely through the lane, but was unable to re-reach his counterpart's throatlatch. HENNING stayed in the five path while far off of the pace around the first
turn, gained outside of rivals approaching the half mile marker, pressed three wide around the far turn from outside of the leaders' flanks, but failed to keep
pace with them in upper stretch, and held show. BITSY'S OTHER HALF stalked the leading pair from the three path around the first turn before tucking to
the rail approaching the backstretch, lost position approaching the half mile pole, tracked along the inside around the far turn, but only managed to chase
along the rail through the lane without progressing. IBEAM raced off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. NOW NOW MAN vied along the inside
around the first turn, allowed his outer vying counterpart to clear off entering the backstretch, but was outmoved by outer foes into the far turn, then tired
through the lane. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT broke a step slowly, and was outrun. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

SWOT ANALYSIS set the pace inside of a pressing CREOLE CHARLIE, drew off passing the quarter pole, widened under mild hand urging through
midstretch, and required right rein correction to keep from lugging in through the final sixteenth. RELEASE THE BEAST trailed, swung to the six path
entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to reach place at the sixteenth pole. CREOLE CHARLIE pressed the leader from the outside around the turn,
but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, and lost place to an outer rival a sixteenth from home. PICKENS tracked along the inside, came into the lane in
the two path, but lacked a bid. ZION tracked the pace three wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but tired. WIDDLE ZEE tracked to wide and from
between horses, came into the lane in the three path, and faded. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

YIN YANG stalked along the inside while trailing the short field around the turn, slipped inside of the leader through a narrow seam in upper stretch, and
drew off at the furlong grounds. FOUR DAWN set the pace while staying a path off of the inner railing, which allowed for YIN YANG to squeeze his way
through in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with that foe at the furlong grounds, and was second best. RUNNIN HAPPY stalked in the four path and outside
of the rest of the field, inched closer approaching the five sixteenths, but failed to keep pace a pair of inner foes at the quarter pole. KIT KELLER chased

drivng pressure. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced to track from midpack into the turn, tipped outside of the leading pair
in upper stretch, rallied to claim place at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. SUMITUP set the pace in the two path around the turn, but offered
little resistance for an inner bidder approaching the three sixteenths pole, and lost place at the furlong grounds while giving way. LIL ADEAU bumped with
an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, then moved up in side of foes approaching the final furlong. MAGGIE'S
RETURN broke a step slowly before bumping an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and split
tiring foes leaving the furlong grounds. ELSIE GIRL pressed outside of the leader while in the three path around the turn, but faded approaching the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. PHILLY WINS laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. BOX OF
PICTURES tracked from midpack in the four path and outside of the leading trio around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL
raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and was outrun. NO HEAD ON REPLAY WAS SHOWN

Footnotes
ZIPPIN GIGI set a clear pace in the two path, received a breather into and around the far turn as a pair of outer foes closed in, but swiftly kicked away again
passing the quarter pole, and held sway under driving pressure. CAUSE TO CRUISE settled far back in the two path, improved along the inside passing the
five furlong pole, chased from midpack around the far turn, saved ground and claimed place from outer foes at the three sixteenths pole, dug in to resist
FIRST GLIMPSE's bid for that position at the sixteenth pole, and held gamely. FIRST GLIMPSE settled off of the pace in the four path, commenced a gain
around the far turn, sustained his long rally through the final furlong to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, dueled for that position through the late stages, but
was denied via a photo finish. STITCHED tracked from the two path, ranged up three wide around the far turn to bid for place entering the lane, but was
outkicked by an inner foe for that position at the three-sixteenths while flattening out, then yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. MATH MAN rated
at the rear along the inside, then passed tiring rivals approaching midstretch. FORMAL ORDER trailed in the three path around both turns, fanned to the five
path entering the lane, and moved up. EXCELLENCY stalked the clear leader from the two to three path around the first turn, closed into that foes margin at
the three furlong pole, but stalled approaching the lane, and weakened between horses at the quarter pole. RITHMICALLEA tracked in the four to three path
around the first turn, and steadily faded thereafter. NO HEAD ON REPLAY WAS SHOWN

SUNDAY SCHEMING rushed to set the pace along the inside, inched away from a pressing rival turning for home, drew off in upper stretch, then tired well
into the final furlong, but lasted to the wire. CAVE CREEK broke outwardly, tracked four wide around the turn, then rallied through the final furlong, but failed
to reel in the tiring leader late. TIME FOR A SONG stalked three wide, gained place entering the lane, grinded away at the leader's margin in the final
furlong, but was outkicked for place in the late stages. WINNING QUALITY pressed outside of the leader into the turn, but failed to keep pace at the five
sixteenths pole, lost place to outer foes at the quarter pole, and yielded. BLONDIE LOX BABE chased along the inside, but failed to threaten. ALTERED
