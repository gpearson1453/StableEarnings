RESERVENOTATTAINED roused forward and vied outside of ALLEGEDLY PERFECT for the lead soon after the start, continued to match strides into the
turn then shook clear past the three eighths pole, roused for more approaching the upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away and raced in hand late.
AWESOME BEACH was ridden along off the early pace, went three wide through the turn, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and gained
second best. LUSITANO raced off the early pace, swung wide into the lane, finished with response and captured show. HARD BELLE raced widest in the
back through early stages, moved in for the turn, hustled along two wide in the stretch and got edged for show. ONE FAST chased the to pair through the
turn, sustained a three wide bid to mid-stretch then gave way. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT bobbled strides out of the gate and advanced to a slim lead, vied
inside the eventual winner to the three eighths pole then chased rival through the turn, continued an inside bid into the lane and came up empty in the final
sixteenth. STRATEGIC VISION chased the top flight near the inside, shifted to the outside leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CALIDAD took command at once, rated along two to three wide to the stretch, and was driving to 70 yards out before being geared down. FEARLESS GIRL
broke two lengths slow, was taken to the far outside soon after, raced four wide around the turn, and was clearly second best. MAGNA COLORS chased
between horses three wide for five furlongs, and tired. SANGFROID chased two wide between horses into the turn, and was through before reaching the
stretch. FIVE K KITTEN broke awkwardly, chased inside, and stopped soon after completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
SPENDARELLA was forwardly placed around the first turn and applied pace pressure to ROYAL BLUSH up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the
far turn, shook clear in the upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp under steady encouragement. AL QAHIRA stalked the top two
leaders through early stages, picked up the pace mid-way around the far turn, sustained a solid bid through the lane but was no match for the clear winner.
EMPRESS ELLIE came away last at the start and remained unhurried into the first turn, settled in the back three wide up the backstretch, produced a five
wide bid turning for home, rallied along the outside and captured show. QUEEN MACHA tracked the pace along the outside through early stages, launched
a four wide bid around the far turn, sustained response into the upper stretch then ran on evenly and got edged for show. POINT WELL TAKEN raced two
wide around the first turn and settled off the early pace, came under a ride with five sixteenths left to run, steadied slightly exiting the turn, shifted to the
outside then moved back in to race two wide in the final furlong and had a mild improve. ROYAL BLUSH set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled
around the final turn, was no match for the eventual winner past upper stretch and faded. POINT PLEASANT got bumped at the start, rated just off mid-flight
up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide through the final turn, failed to kick on then retreated in the lane. CUMULONIMBUS raced off the pace and
saved ground, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and had no response. ESTATE raced inside midpack through early stages, was ridden along the rail
through the far turn and faded in the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FREEZER BURN broke sharply and angled inward clearing the field, showed the way inside to the stretch, and remained well in command under pressure.
CAPTURINI saved ground early, was ridden along through the turn while moving out three wide, and rallied to be clearly second best. FUTURE FLAY raced
two three wide around the turn, and proved much best of the rest with an even finish. JULIE BIRD (IRE) was no factor inside. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT faded
steadily three wide. PRETZEL tired early two wide. DAY'S HUMOR pursued the winner for three furlongs, and had nothing left. THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
CURRENT SITUATION set the pace in the two path and held sway under a drive. MIDNIGHT BELLA tracked the pace two wide around the first turn and
three deep around the far turn and rallied four wide for the place. DESTINIQUE stalked the pace from the rail, could not gain on the winner and just lasted
for the show. SERENADE A KITTEN prompted the winner in the three path, could not gain on that foe in the lane and just missed third. MONEY FACTOR
failed to menace while racing two wide around the turns and angling four wide in upper stretch. CLASSY OF COURSE played no factor while racing three
wide. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was outrun inside and was vanned off after the finish.

Footnotes
NATURAL POWER (IRE) lacked speed and raced in the back through early stages, went two wide around the turn, swung six wide and given cue entering
the upper stretch, rallied under a left handed drive while drifting inward a few paths got up approaching the wire. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE broke alertly
from the outside draw and tracked the top pair into the turn, came under a drive three then two wide in the stretch, briefly edged up to a slim lead in deep
stretch then got caught when the winner surged by. SHEKKY SHEBAZ dueled outside of LIKE WHAT I SEE through early stages, shook free at the head of
the lane, continued clear on top into the final furlong then got caught in deep stretch. KASIM chased in range through opening stages and chased two wide
through the turn, tipped a path wider for the drive, continued with response into the final furlong then yielded. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF raced off the early pace,
shifted out in the upper stretch, showed interest under a drive and had a mild improve. EXTRAVAGANT KID raced in range through opening stages,
dropped to the rail entering the turn, saved ground then tipped two wide for the drive, sustained bid to mid-stretch then flattened out. EMBOLDEN raced
inside and steadied when rival dropped over entering the turn, saved ground through the turn and lacked a needed rally. LIKE WHAT I SEE held a slim lead
in opening stages, quickly challenged and dueled inside of SHEKKY SHEBAZ around the turn, failed to match strides approaching the upper stretch and
gave way. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID hit the right side of the gate and bumped with THE MIGHTY JUDGE coming out, recovered to take the lead, set a sharp pace slightly off the
inside, and responded through the lane to keep BRASSTOWN at bay. BRASSTOWN prompted TRAPPEZOID from outside throughout, could not mount a
serious threat through the stretch but was clearly second best. HERO TIGER raced two to three wide around the turn, and ran on evenly through the stretch
unable to rally. BLESSED JOURNEY was no factor inside. SIR AGGRAVATOR bumped with THE MIGHTY JUDGE at the start, and never menaced three
to four wide. THE MIGHTY JUDGE was bumped lightly between horses at the start, and trailed. RACE TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.

BRIT'S CANDYMAN vied two wide down the backstretch, cleared entering the turn, angled in leaving the three-eighths marker, continued on the left lead in
the lane and widened under a drive. SUNSET PROVISION had early speed inside of the winner, could not keep pace nearing the turn, angled two wide
leaving the three-eighths, chased outside of the winner from there and was clearly second best. BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN broke inwardly and bumped
STRAIGHT TIME just after the start, stalked the pace three wide, was no match for the top two in the lane and churned on for the show.
TRAVELINGBLUESMAN lacked speed while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and improved position outside. STRAIGHT TIME was
bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. WOOTDAREITIS failed to menace while racing three wide. STRONG AGAIN
was outrun inside. CASSIDYS GOLD broke slowly then was in tight just after the start and trailed throughout while racing off the rail. RUN-UP
