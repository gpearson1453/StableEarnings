flight four across, swung nine wide at the top of the stretch and earned place while no match for the winner. KEEPINMYPROMISE chased the pace, went
eight wide in the drive, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. LAURA BELLE showed good early speed while racing along the rail, angled
out for the drive and lacked a stretch response. TOP LADY MARGIE was in tight between horses early, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. HOT
AUGUST STORM was outrun.

Footnotes
NORTH OF EDEN vied inside to the second turn, drew clear and just lasted at the wire. MISS YOU MOM was void of early speed, shifted out for the drive,
closed willingly, was gaining fast late and just missed. CONVINCE dueled two wide to the second turn, fell back into the stretch, continued willingly to the
wire and narrowed the gap. PIPER ROSE stalked the pace while racing inside, fell back, closed steadily and gained late. SHOE GAME went five wide on
the first turn, pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back and lacked the needed late rally. STARS OF BLUEGRASS went six wide on the first
turn, pressed the pace five wide and lacked a rally. AROUSE N GO pressed the pace three across to the second turn, swung wide and gave way.

Footnotes
SHARMEL stalked the pace, bid inside on the second turn, inched away and held well. NOUMEA was unhurried early, rallied around the turn, closed well,
was gaining fast late and got up for place. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was never far back, bid willingly to loom a threat and hung late. AMERICAN ROYALTY
lagged early, finished well inside and narrowed the gap. CARMON'S DANCE was hustled along, led around the first turn, was rated along the backstretch
and lacked a bid. MONGOLIAN WINDOW was outrun in an even effort. FICTIONAL was rank at the start to be off slowly, went widest in the drive and did
not threaten. THUNDER WOMAN assumed command entering the backstretch, led well off the rail, bore out badly on the turn and dropped back.
MONGOLIAN EMPIRE was through after a half. Hand timed.

Footnotes
IRRESISTIBLY SEXY pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, bid five wide, closed steadily, wore down his rivals and drew clear late. MR. ARTISTIC
pressed the pace inside, angled out on the turn and finished well to get up for place. BIG TONY brushed at the start, was hustled along, drew off on the turn
for a clear late, yielded late and held for show. FISHIN THE RIVER broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, raced in the back, closed well and gained
late. KEEN JAMES improved position in a steady effort. RISE UP MOSCOW brushed at the start and lacked a rally. AGUA DORADO was not a factor.
SNIGGLE was never far back, bid to get within range and came up empty late. ROUGE SUNSET broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, showed speed
to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. FRED was outrun.

Footnotes
LOOPY set the pace and held well in a driving finish. LADY COMMISSIONER raced mid pack, rallied into the turn, bid seven wide, found her best stride late
and was gaining ground. YES PLEASE stalked the pace while racing inside, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. BARONESS VONTRAPPE raced
close to the pace, bid to loom a threat and came up empty late. MS SALLY bumped at the start, was crowded and checked and raced evenly. SABINOS
PRIDE stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. LEXOPHILIA broke slowly and was not a factor. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU bumped at the start,
had brief speed only and not urged in the stretch.
