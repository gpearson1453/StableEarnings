BOLD REY sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead, was tiring in the drive and held under steady urging. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was unhurried
early, rallied around the turn, bid six wide, closed steadily and was gaining ground. AROUSE N GO chased the pace, lacked a late response and settled for
show. IKNOWYOURFACE was never far back, advanced along the rail on the turn, had nothing left and dropped back. STARLIGHT TWIST was outrun.
EBB AND FLOW was never a factor.

Footnotes
MY INDY raced close to the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, challenged three across, dueled to mid stretch, drew clear and held off the late
charge of KENNEBEC. KENNEBEC was steadied entering the first turn, raced mid pack, angled out for the drive, bore out under left handed urging and was
gaining fast late. GIANT PAYDAY was in tight at the start, was boxed in along the inside, altered course mid stretch and closed gamely. TIGER DAD bore
out and was checked hard on the first turn, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled to the eighth pole and faltered. AX MAN
set the pace, responded when challenged to duel to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO raced in the back, swung wide
entering the stretch and lacked a bid. CARIBOU CLUB was in tight at the start, was impeded and checked on the first turn and was through after a half.
PINTXOS was steadied after the start and trailed the field. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference on the first turn. No change
was made.

Footnotes
NORMA JEAN B. was unhurried early, bid six wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, wore down her rivals and was clear late. SHORE BREAK (IRE) raced
close to the pace outside, bid between horses on the turn, shifted out for the drive and closed to earn place. QUIET SECRETARY set a pressured pace,
drew off on the turn for a clear lead, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held for show. PRANCE raced mid pack, bid inside on the turn to get within range
and hung late. GLOBAL BRAND was void of early speed, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and closed well late. COVER VERSION stalked the
pace, went six wide leaving the turn and had little left for drive. LADY COMMISSIONER was void of early speed, lacked a bid and was not a threat.
HURRICAIN HUNTER pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. BACCHANALIA was through after a half. LITTLE MISS BELLE stalked the
pace while racing inside, tired on the turn and stopped.
