Footnotes
FEISTY AND SASSY stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled clear toward the
quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on. SONDE ST BLUES stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadied lightly between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and was gaining
slowly late. NAUTICAL WARRIOR raced off the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far
turn then dueled through the stretch for third. CHESTNUT LIME saved ground just off the pace, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran off the rail
on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. HARD BEING ME saved ground and could only improve his position. NAZCA MYSTERY
took the lead nearing the three quarter pole then angled to the rail to rate the pace, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point
but weakened at the rail approaching the top of the stretch. The Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Feisty And Sassy, lodged by the riders
of Nautical Warrior and Sonde St Blues, though, found no action necessary.

Footnotes
POSTINO'S STORY settled close inside, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, took the nod into the stretch and held well under
steady stretch handling. HEROIC DEED came in to make contact with Don't Throw Stones leaving the gate then rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was caught past the eighth pole, though, finished well in second. BREWING STORM
saved ground off the pace, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. CIOPPINO stalked the earlier
pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. VITO ANDOLINI
was bumped leaving the gate then settled off the pace about the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn.
DON'T THROW STONES was bumped inward and into Vito Andolini at the break, rounded the first turn about the five path and showed little response
through the backstretch. PLAY CHARADES settled off the rail on the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch then her rider lost her whip
into the stretch. FOR ARTS SAKE was never a factor.

far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on. AIM'S JUBILEE wsa forced out into the first turn and raced well off the pace
into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, had range on the lead in the three path of the far turn but was outfinished in a stretch
long duel. LONG LEGS LOUISE settled off the pace about the four path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the

and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. CEDAR'S WISH was forced inward and
into PRINCESS HALO soon after the start then raced with the pace and took a brief lead two deep midway on the opening turn, gave up the lead leaving the
