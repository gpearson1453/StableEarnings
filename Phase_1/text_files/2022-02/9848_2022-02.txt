Footnotes
BELGRADE bobbled slightly at the start, then switched off the inside early dropping off the leaders, was rated outside foes tracking off the first flight to the
turn, shifted out four wide midway through the bend commencing a steady advance, moved to terms with the leaders three deep racing into upper stretch,
then wrested a narrow advantage approaching the wire under some left handed pressure and confident handling. MORGAN POINT angled to the inside
leaving the chute while being urged to the prompt the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command racing into the stretch and just failed to contain the
winner's final bid. VIVA VICTORY, in touch three wide prompting the pace in the opening stages, shifted inwards on the bend dueling for command between
foes but weakened in late stages. BUBBA DREAMS, forwardly placed four wide tracking off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to lodge a brief,
three wide bid entering the turn but came up empty in the drive. SAN COSTANTINO tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch and steadily faded. OVER IT vied briefly between foes prompting the pace but gave way approaching the turn.

Footnotes
TWELVE RED ROSES was rated between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half continuing under patient
handling, tipped out three wide entering the lane and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under firm right handed pressure. KIZZY angled
inwards while being urged clear leaving the chute dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, met the challenge of NEW WAYS TO DREAM,
then grudgingly repelled that foe nearing the sixteenth marker but failed to contain the winner. NEW WAYS TO DREAM, threw her head while pulling a bit
racing through the chute, tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, split foes with an early move to gain terms with the pacesetter
entering the far turn, pressed the issue outside that foe into upper stretch, but yielded leaving the sixteenth marker. FIRST LADY DI DA tracked off the
second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no rally. SYLLABUS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight and faded after a
half. BOB'S LADY tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS
settled last to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. LADY MANHATTAN, reserved between foes in early stages, was prompted to make brief
progress three deep nearing the far turn but soon flattened out. J D'S VISTA, caught four wide leaving the chute, continued in that path to the backstretch
and soon retreated. OUR MAGICAL GIRL tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was caught four deep racing into the far turn and
soon emptied out.

Footnotes
LADY WOOD broke readily, dictated the pace outside foes racing well off the rail on the backstretch, disputed the issue outside a rival through the turn to
upper stretch, then turned back that challenger to go clear late under firm right handed pressure. LUNA'S TREASURE, bumped at the start while being
forced into the path of SUWANNEE CHICK, quickly recovered to gain a position just inside the pacesetter prompting that foe through the backstretch,
pressed the issue along the rail through the turn to gain even terms, dueled into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while just prevailing for the
place honors on the wire. TAHAWEEL tracked off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch to the turn, tipped out three wide racing through
the stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap on the top pair while just missing for second. SUWANNEE CHICK, bumped at the start, settled
last in early stages, was prompted to advance three deep into the lane while going a bit erratically racing into upper stretch, but continued with interest to
improve her position between foes to the end. AMAZING MSKITTY swerved out at the start bumping LUNA'S TREASURE, was settled along the inside on
the backstretch and never menaced thereafter. CALL TONY tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into
upper stretch and gave way. HELEONORTIZ tracked just off the leaders along the inside but retreated early.

Footnotes
XCARET was rated off the second flight while angling inside racing to the first turn, saved ground throughout and came through inside foes to wrest the
advantage midstretch under firm encouragement. SONG OF THE HEART was rated off the first flight racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals racing to
the backstretch gaining a forward placing three deep, pressed the issue outside BABY LUCK on the far turn, was carried out by that foe while being bumped
racing into upper stretch but continued willingly to contest the issue while just failing to match the winner. LIFENHOWULIVIT was settled outside foes racing
to the backstretch, circled foes with a sharp advance five wide through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. NANA FANNY, urged
inside foes racing through the chute to contest the lead, conceded the lead entering the first turn to track the pacesetter inside foes, was urged to advance
inside the leaders when presented an opening racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. SAFE TRAVELS, pulling between foes under restraint in early
stages, tracked off the second flight between foes, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and made an effort to improve her placing. BABY LUCK,
urged to the lead between foes, angled to the rail entering the first turn, dueled for command inside foes to the far turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch
bumping SONG OF THE HEART and quickly emptied out. CAPETOWN CANDY tracked off the second flight outside foes, made brief progress four wide
between foes racing through the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. LOVE CHANNEL settled last early and failed to menace. SIGN AND SEAL,
restless in the gate before the start, required a veterinarian's inspection prior to being reloaded, was urged between foes pursuing the leaders in second
flight to the backstretch and faded early. AVE FENIX, forwardly placed outside the leaders racing to the first turn, pressed the issue outside a rival into the
backstretch and gave way abruptly nearing the second bend.

Footnotes
ONLYAMATTEROFTIME, urged three deep between foes racing to the first turn, took over from the pacesetter midway through the backstretch to dictate
terms on a narrow advantage, dueled outside KING FORCE through the far turn, was carried out by that foe racing through the stretch but responded to firm
handling to wrest a clear advantage in time. KING FORCE, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the backstretch, came around a rival after a half to
advance inside the pacesetter, moved to press the issue inside that foe into upper stretch, shifted out disputing the issue to strike the front midstretch but
couldn't match that rival late. SUPER SHOES, reserved in early stages, shifted out three deep splitting foes racing into the far turn, gained on the leaders in
that path on the far turn, then angled inside the top pair racing through the stretch while moving to close the gap. PRIVATE CODE settled last to the
backstretch, swung out five wide racing through the far turn and continued with an effort to improve position. AND THE OSCAR GOES was prompted to
contend between foes in the opening stages, eased off the second flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. RAMIRIN, urged to terms with the
leaders four wide between foes into the first turn, pressed the issue three deep into the backstretch and gave way racing through the far turn. BUSTER,
reserved in early stages, switched outside foes to make brief progress four wide on the backstretch but soon emptied out. HIS WILL BE DONE was hustled
five deep to the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch once gaining the advantage to set the pace along the rail but soon gave out once headed
by the winner.

Footnotes
FEETS OF FEATHER was reserved outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the second bend, split foes four deep entering
the far turn, circled rivals in that path to challenge for command racing past midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. IRISH DREAM GIRL,
forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival to the backstretch, steadily gained between foes nearing upper stretch to challenge for command
midstretch but couldn't match the winner while prevailing for the place honors. THUNDER BUGGY broke sharply, went clear while angling to the inside
leaving the chute, held sway on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, set the pace while shifting out racing into upper stretch but yielded between foes
late. TAKE TO THE SKIES, reserved between foes in early stages, split foes steadily gaining position racing into the far turn, angled inside the leaders
racing into the stretch to challenge but lacked the needed final kick. SLIME QUEEN was rated outside foes off the second flight to the backstretch, was
caught five wide racing into the far turn and had no closing bid. PRINCESS JAVONCIA tipped outside the second flight racing to the backstretch to make
brief progress three wide advancing on the pacesetter to the far turn but emptied out between foes in the drive. JARA, urged in pursuit of the leader three
deep into the first turn, angled inside on the backstretch but emptied out early. WHISTLER DIXIE urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the
backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. TAKE ME AS I AM worked her way to the inside racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, was
shuffled back behind a tiring rivals racing into the far turn and soon dropped out. LA ALHAMBRA dropped out early.

with LUSCIOUS racing through upper stretch, shifted out once gaining the advantage leaving the furlong marker, brushed MELANCHOLY BLUES nearing
the wire and just held that foe to the end under brisk handling. MELANCHOLY BLUES, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders in the opening stages,
continued with a steady effort four wide through the turn to upper stretch, was floated to the five path in late stages, then was brushed by the winner
approaching the wire to just miss. LUSCIOUS vied for command three between foes through the backstretch, continued to duel between foes through the
turn to upper stretch, was bumped by the winner nearing the furlong marker and weakened late. QUALITY TOO SPARE was rated off the first flight off the
inside racing to the turn and continued evenly three wide between foes to gain some position late. BAHAMA PEARL, urged inside foes prompting the pace
on the backstretch, advanced inside foes to press the issue on a narrow advantage through the turn, but gave way leaving midstretch. EMPEROR'S SONG,
urged between foes in the opening stages prompting the pace, was taken up avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn and had no closing response. CHILLIN

Footnotes
PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY broke sharply, angled inwards pressing the pace outside a rival into the turn, then edged forward in the closing stages under firm
handling. POSEIDON'S PASSION was settled last in the opening stages, gathered momentum rallying four deep into the turn, split foes in that path racing
into upper stretch and continued with a solid late kick to prevail for the place honors late. SENORA ROMA broke outwards bumping DANA'S BEAUTY, was
quickly righted, then urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, pressed the issue to midstretch but yielded late. BEANTOWN BABY tracked off
the second flight between foes in the opening quarter, shifted out three wide leaving the bend and continued with an effort to improve position. BILLYJANE
was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the bend, came around a tiring foe racing into the lane and continued evenly inside foes
while gaining some position. BAND SWEETHEART tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted to the inside on the bend and faded into the
stretch. DANA'S BEAUTY, bumped at the start, settled out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn, then shifted five wide racing through the
stretch gaining some position while making no real impression. COVENANT LADY caught five wide racing through the opening three sixteenths, never
gained contention. BEAUTIFUL GRACE, urged four wide between foes pursuing the leaders in the opening furlong, shifted inwards entering the turn to track
those foes outside foes in second flight and gave way racing into the lane. MAMBA WAMBA (IRE) settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to
menace thereafter. BEACHSIDE BUNNY tracked the leaders inside rivals just off the second flight, was held up avoiding tight quarters racing into the turn
and soon gave way. MUDSLIDE WICKED trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BASQUIAT tracked off the first flight three deep between foes through the backstretch, gradually gained momentum splitting foes three wide nearing upper
stretch and continued with solid late momentum to wrest the advantage and go clear late under firm handling. LIFE CHANGER tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing to the bend, saved ground on the turn, then tipped outside a tiring foe to gain the place honors inside foes late. SHALDAG was rated
four deep between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to press the issue three deep on the turn, struck the front and held sway
into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. ELLAS MY LOVE was rated off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch, advanced five wide
racing through the turn and continued with an effort to improve position. STYNER, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave
way into upper stretch. IMPERIAL KING tracked the leaders five wide in second flight in the opening stages, continued in brief pursuit four wide between
foes into the turn and came up empty in the drive. RIDE EM, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, gave way after a half. JACK
RABBIT QUICK angled inwards in the opening stages to prompt the pace three wide but was spent early. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight on the backstretch, was taken up after three furlongs and dropped out early. DIVINE CONTROL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER was urged to the lead shifting off the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening three sixteenths, held sway along the
inside into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to widen the margin late. XY SPEED was urged prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch to the turn, couldn't match that foe but continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors. THE CONNECTOR angled to the
inside in early stages tracking just off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch, was urged to advance along the rail but was outkicked for second.
DISCREET TUNE was rated off the second flight racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve
position. BACKTOHISROOTS settled off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, angled inside on the turn and gained some position in an
even effort. BAD BEAT BRIAN tracked the leaders three deep between in second flight racing into the turn and faded in the drive. SKIPPY'S STRIKE settled
last while angling to the inside early and failed to menace thereafter. JAZZY TIMES, restless in the gate prior to the start, tracked just off the first flight
between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. HARD COUNT tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing into the turn and
gave way nearing the lane.
