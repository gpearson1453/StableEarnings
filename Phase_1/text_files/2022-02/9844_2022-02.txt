Footnotes
BIG JAVA closest to the early leader off the inside, continued to pressure that one the middle half from the outside, ranged up to put a head in front turning
for home, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker while drifting in, continued to drift toward the inside in the run to the wire, fully extended to
prevail. BURROW DOWN broke on top, showed the way into the first turn while working way to the inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch,
responded when headed by the winner exiting the final turn, dueled while being floated in to the wire, proved stubborn to the end. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE four
wide into the first turn, raced in mid pack while remaining outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide again in the second turn, angled to the inside for
the drive, finished up along the rail to be clear of the others, no threat to the top two. KEEN CONTENDER off the early pace toward the inside, continued to
save some ground into the far turn, steered out three wide into the lane and improved position while not a threat to the top three. PURRFECT MISTRESS
forwardly placed while three wide, crept a bit closer far turn, weakened in the drive. BUNNIE RAE settled off the pace while racing inside, failed to rally.
BAJA FOG off a step slow, moved out to be four wide late in the first turn, continued four wide through the second turn and remained back. BLAME NELLIE
also off a beat slow, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF BURROW DOWN AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
SMARTY GRIMES bothered and steadied in tight just after the start, raced back ,for a half while three wide through the turn, split foes turning for home,
rallied through traffic to win going away. PRAETORIAN within striking distance along the inside early, steered to the outside for room turning for home,
rallied midtrack for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. TIZ SHOWBIZ void of early foot off the inside, raced three out to four wide through the turn,
displayed some moderate late interest to be along for the show. KIERKEGAARD in mid pack early outside, raced four out to five wide turning for home,
shifted out a bit further to be widest through the stretch, improved late with some belated interest. PAST POST broke alertly, cleared early off the inside,
continued to show the way through the turn, garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, faltered late when headed. AGAVE KID chased the early
leader from the outside, dropped steadily toward the inside, rode the rail into the stretch and began to weaken. FORT RIDGE went one paced throughout
while racing three wide. POPIZAR void of speed for four furlongs, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TRUE SAINT forwardly
placed while three wide and outside, came three wide when forcing the issue into the lane, gave way soon after. TWO DOT in the second flight while racing
three wide, had nothing for the drive. EL VENUE lost right iron after being last away, raced back and outside, 4-5w late turn, remained back. BURTNJOE
finished early, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
LORD M forwardly placed early outside, three wide into the turn, advanced and took over n the two path turning for home, drew well clear under continued
steady handoling. MAX'S HEART in the second flight off the inside early, asked along while remaining off the inside late in the turn, proved no match for the
winner, held sway for the place. LOU'S ARROW off a step slow, moved out while racing back, four wide through the bend, slowly getting to the runner up
late while fully extended to hold the show spot. THE BUS lacked early foot while racing outside, five to six wide late in the turn, improved position with some
late interest down the center of the strip. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY fell back to trail the opening quarter, two path turn, also improved position the lane with some
belated interest. BACKGATE RED settled off the pace, two path through the turn, three wide exiting, came up empty for the drive. POINT BLANK back off
the pace along the inside, moved out in the two path around a tiring rival late in the turn, made little impact in the drive. YOUNG O' DAINE made little impact
in the three path. JACKYS BACK lacked speed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a factor. LUCKS BIG BOY cleared soon after the start,
showed the way for a half then gave way when headed into the stretch. MO HAWK MAN raced in mid pack early, tired from those early efforts.
PREACHER'S PET dropped inside the opening quarter, chased the early leader from along the inside into the turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
RIVER ECHO (GB) within striking distance while saving ground, continued to save ground second turn, rail bid midway on that bend, showed the way into
the lane, clear, drifted, kept to task. ZITMAN in mid pack inside, began to advance into the far turn in the two path, dropped inside late in that bend, rallied
and finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. ARRIVAL forwardly placed off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide just as the winner was
mounting a bid along the rail midway on the final turn, flattened out in the drive, saved the show. CASHANOVA void of speed off the inside, four wide into
the stretch, staged a mild rally to improve position. TEZ four wide into the first turn when well off the early pace, continued in mid pack, two path second
turn, failed to lodge a significant closing response. EAGLE PASS last away, raced back, improved with a middle move three wide in the second turn, failed
to sustain that advance in the drive. GAMBLER away in good order, clear first turn, extended that advantage before a half, allowed the winner the rail while
being challenged between horses second turn, gave way when headed. DARREN'S FORTUNE in mid pack while racing outside through the first turn, four
to five wide late in the final bend, weakened in the drive. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER chased the leader for five furlongs in the two path and caved in.
MISSISSIPPI void of speed while three wide early, saved ground through the second turn, failed to mount a bid in the drive. KING FORD was finished early,
well beaten.

Footnotes
ROYAL DAAHER broke alertly, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage through the turn, dueled upper stretch, edged away late
under steady handling. TOP GUNNER pressed the winner from the outside up the backstretch, closer turn, vied between horsed into and through upper
stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, comfortably held the place. ATOKA in the second flight while between horses and firmly in
hand, ranged up closer three wide late in the turn, set down when stalling nearing midstretch, could not get to the top two, well clear of the rest. FULL
AUTHORITY in the second group while in the two path, came up empty for the drive. WHISKEY DOUBLE fell back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after
the issue had been decided. AMERICAN MANDATE back off the pace, four wide midway on the turn, lacked a closing response. ESTABLISHED lacked
speed in trailing most of the way, never a threat.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL closest to the leader off the inside, continued to prompt that one the middle half, took over in the second turn, drifted out when clear past
the furlong marker, held the runner up at bay. WARTIME HERO forwardly placed off the inside, raced three wide through the second turn, chased the leader
into the lane, could do little with that one the final furlong, clearly second best. TILLIS last away, raced back and off the inside three wide through the second
turn when beginning to rally, continued with moderate interest to finish well clear of the others, no match for the top two. ENGLANDER broke alertly, set the
pace inside, weakened when headed by the winner in the second turn. CALL OF HONOR settled off the pace just off the inside, lacked a response in the
drive. SHOFAR lacked speed, improved position while saving ground into the stretch, not a real threat. SUN DADDY went evenly toward the inside in
lacking a closing response. GREAT FACES moved outside, four wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing kick. GENERATOR void of speed, failed to
menace. MAKE NOISE mid pack and outside, four wide through the first turn, continued well wide, came six wide out of the second bend, faded. JUDGE
PHILLIP M was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
NOVEL SQUALL in the second flight in the two path, dropped inside midway on the turn, challenged inside the leader past the furlong marker, shook clear.
MELTING SNOW void of speed along the inside early steered out three wide turning for home, rallied for the place. ALBERTA SUN broke alertly, set the
pace along the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, drifted out a bit approaching the furlong grounds allowing the winner the inside,
continued to drift while weakening further, managed to save the show. COPPELIA forwardly placed while racing three wide, remained within striking
distance turning for home, lacked a closing response. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, went
evenly through the lane to also be found lacking. CHERISHED prompted the pace while racing four wide, tired. MISS IMPERIAL in the second group
outside, four wide through the turn, had nothing for the drive. BERRY GOOD last away, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. SOUTHERN GRAYCE
chased the runner up off the inside, two path turn then gave way and backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
TRIDENT HIT unhurried in the early going while saving some ground, two path into the far turn, steered out to be four wide into the lane, roused, closed with
good resolve to kick down the leader in the late going. MARKET ANALYSIS last to leave, moved up quickly to a forward position past the wire the first time,
pressed middle half, took over into the lane, clear, gave ground grudgingly to the winner in the late going. MY SIXTH SENSE settled in the two path behind
the pace, continued toward the inside second turn, could do little with the top two through the stretch, determined for the show. CATDADDY pressed the
issue early when a bit slow to settle, fell back into the far turn while three wide, came again to a degree through the lane to be gaining for the show late.
TRUCULENT fell back while four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again second bend, lacked a closing kick through the lane. FORT PECK off the
early pace and the inside, three wide middle move to reach contention far turn, flattened out in the drive. HUGE BIGLY broke on top, set the pace inside,
relinquished when confronted by the runner up in the second turn.

HAPPY SOUL away in good order, tracked the two leaders early inside, advanced and challenged along the rail through the turn, disposed of the other
speed when straightened for home, drew clear then held the runner up comfortably safe under steady handling. VERYLITTLECENTS in the second flight
along the inside early, put in a bit tight with five furlongs remaining, angled out a bit when called on for run turning for home, finished well to be clear for the
place, no real threat late to the winner. HYPERSPORT in the second flight after breaking with the leaders, checked up in some traffic a furlong in, fell back,
raced four wide through most of the turn, along for the show late with some mild interest, not a threat to the top two. WICKED HALO last away, raced back
early, fell back a bit further late in the turn, improved a bit by picking off a couple of tiring rivals. PRETTY BIRDIE broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch off the inside, allowed the winner the rail turn, dueled with that one into the stretch then began to give way. DING DING forced the issue for a
half in the three path and stopped.

Footnotes
RUNNIN' RAY broke alertly, set the pace inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, shook clear when straightened for home, enough left to hold the runner
up safe late. HARVARD in the second group while outside, two path into the lane when beginning a slow, steady advance, grinding late, ran out of track
late. CADDO RIVER in the second flight while outside, raced three wide in the second turn, continued with striking distance on the outside turning for home,
bothered a furlong out by a drifting DEFENDER, lacked a closing punch. SHOTSKI settled in midpack, saved all the ground. BANKIT in mid pack while in
the two path through the first turn, three wide through the second turn, improved a bit with some mild late interest. DEFENDER pressed the pace off the
inside, continued to force the issue into the far turn, began to tire in the three path turning for home, lugged out with a furlong remaining, continued to
weaken. WHAT A COUNTRY four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to be in the two path second turn, failed to muster a response in the drive. HOT
SHOT KID remained always back in failing to threaten. RAM off a step slow, was always outrun. SIMOVITCH staged a steady retreat to trail home.
