Footnotes
FUNNY ACTOR raced within contention, moved up, three wide around the final turn, made a late bid, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win.
RIVER KING pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win, but held on for second. OXBOW WIND raced within striking
distance, came around the final turn on the outside, made a wide bid and finished willingly. ROBTADI STORM raced in the middle of the field, saved ground
around the final turn, made a late try and was outfinished. LUNDI went to the front, drove clear and weakened inside. MAJESTIC SOCIETY void of early
speed, raced outside around the second turn, finished wide and was no threat. CLEVER PRINCE lacked early speed and was never a factor. GONNA
GETCHA raced near the back, drifted out around the first turn and was never close. PARTY OF FIFTEEN raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back.

COOL INDIVIDUAL unhurried in the early going, moved up wide around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and won under steady urging. HATTIES
JEWEL lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ARCHIE vied for
the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. FOREVAMO challenged for the early advantage, raced close throughout
and lacked a finish. MIDNIGHT REVOLT raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. QUEETEN pressed the pace, weakened
and was no threat late. TUNE MY GUITAR void of early speed and was never close. SAVING ARGUMENT showed early speed, saved ground around the
final turn and stopped.

REAUX broke in, racing in the back, had a wide trip, made a bid and was a clear second at the wire. ZULTAN pressed the pace, saved ground around the
final turn, angled out, made a bid and got up for third. SPECIAL BREED went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and weakened. SMART ANALYSIS
broke out, pressed the pace and faded. OTTOMAN EMPIRE raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. NATE'S REVENGE bumped at the start,
tight quarters, raced near the back and was never close. BIRCH always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
SPA CITY stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up around the final turn, pulled away down the home stretch and won handily. WARRIOR'S MAP vied
for the early lead, took command around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. ITS A WRAP showed early speed, saved
ground around the final turn, faded and proved no match for the top two. TAPAGE lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. NATE'S ATTACK void
of early speed, came around the second turn wide and was never close. HOUR CITY pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn and faded.
RIGHTANDJUST challenged for the early lead and dropped back.

Footnotes
DREWMAZING broke in, raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. DEAL WITH HIM
raced in the middle of the field, moved up, between rivals around the turn, finished willingly and got up for second. GUITAR DOCTOR went to the front,
drove clear and lacked a finish. KILLINGSWORTH broke out, raced near the back, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
PITCH AND RUN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. ST JOE showed early speed and faded. MAJESTIC ARTIE pressed the early
pace, saved ground around the turn and retreated. MY MAN LOUIE shuffled back at the start and was never close. BIG RUSSSS pressed the early pace
and dropped back. QUARTER RAT raced in the back, lost rider entering the turn and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE
RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
