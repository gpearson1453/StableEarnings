Footnotes
FIVE DREAMS away well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set the pace through the turn, shook clear entering
the stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage the final furlong while being kept to task. VIOLENT GIGI in the second flight inside, moved closer along the
rail late in the turn, lacked room behind the winner entering the stretch, steered out a bit, up for the place. WHEREVER HE IS in mid pack outside the runner
up and between foes, advanced with that one in traffic late in the bend, angled out for room into the lane, gained the nod for the show, no threat to the top
two. THAT'S SOMETHING void of speed for a half, moved out widest for the drive, closed with interest down the middle of the strip while too late. THE
FEATURE back off the pace outside, loomed a threat four wide late li n the turn, chased the winner upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong.
ROAD BIBLE in the second flight outside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing response. SHACKS WAY pressed the pace in the two path and
faltered. BITCOIN BANKER last away, remained always back. ALPINE GHOST forwardly placed for a half while three wide, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
RIVER REDEMPTION unhurried early, pulled the middle half mile off the inside, closer then waited behind a wall of horses turning for home, shifted out,
finished full of run to quickly collar the leader and draw clear. CRONUS last away, raced back, advanced into contention while four wide in the second turn,
took over into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late while inside that rival, well clear of the rest. BEST TIME took command soon after the start,
set the pace along the inside, could not match the top two in the drive when weakening a bit, comfortably saved the show. PORTSMOUTH pressed the
issue up front while between foes, dueled into the far turn then faltered in the drive. RESERVE shuffled back from between horses when with the first flight
into the initial turn, went evenly the middle half, inched a bit closer late in the final bend, finished up one paced in lacking a further response. KING OF
STING went one paced throughout in also lacking a closing bid. BRODY BOUCHER void of speed, improved position well off the inside in the second turn
then flattened out in the drive. MR FROST saved ground to no avail. BENEDICTUS prompted the pace while racing three wide, gave way turning for home.
GUNSTONE finished early, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

NOTARY outrun in the early going, two path into the far turn, angled four wide late in the bend when advancing, challenged three wide and outside the
dueling leaders past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. SAQEEL settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into far turn, three wide
bid into lane, dueled, no match winner late, drew clear for the place. MOTION PICTURE in the second flight while between horses, advanced with the
runner up inside that one to challenge turning for home, dueled upper stretch, also had little for the winner the final furlong, outkicked for the place.
BEACHWALKER off a step slow, trailed for five furlongs, improved position three wide with some mild interest, not a threat to the top three. HANKS in the
second flight toward the inside, in the two path through the second turn, lacked a closing punch. PURE ROCKET off a step slow, raced off the pace, floated
out five wide into the lane, also found lacking. JUNESANDRA lacked speed after breaking a step slow, remained back while racing three wide. ONE LAST
HAND dueled up front in the two path for six furlongs and began to give way, continued to back up stretch. UNEMBELLISHED dueled up front inside,
stopped after five furlongs, distanced stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
YOU VEE CEE broke alertly, vied up front closest to the inside, headed in the two path when allowing BELLAMYS ROAN the rail late in the turn, dueled,
fought back and edged clear before holding the runner up safe late. EV'S SHERMAN off the pace toward the inside, improved through traffic in the turn,
continued willingly through the lane to be clear for the place. BELLAMYS ROAN back off the pace just off the rail, advanced along the rail to challenge
inside the winner mid to late turn, held a narrow advantage late in the bend, weakened in the drive and was overtaken for the second spot. TRAFFIC
CONTROL in the second flight between horses, three to four wide turning for home, went evenly the final furlong, not enough for the show. PEACE DOG
pressed the issue for a half four out to five wide in the turn, weakened gradually through the lane. J'S LITTLE MAN went one paced along the inside.
FETCHS BRAHM bumped just after the start, raced well back for a half, improved by passing tiring rivals while never a serious threat. SLIMER four wide
into the turn when outrun, failed to rally while remaining outside. KISSOFTHENILE pressed the issue three wide for a half and began to tire. ROYAL DE BE
broke back and was never threat. LOUD BOY flashed brief speed outside the winner, gave way in the drive. UNCLE O. G. balked at loading, came out to
bump just after the start with FETCHS BRAHM, remained always outrun.

PARKIN IN THE REAR broke alertly, cleared soon after, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when challenged by the winner late, dug in
to find just enough in the final strides to last. AIRBORNE GAL forwardly placed while racing three wide, chased the winner through the turn, lost some
ground to that one into the lane, challenged outside late, denied. A REAL JEWEL in the second flight inside, continued to save ground turn, proved no
match for the top two through the lane, clear of others. LADY SHAMAN in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive.
HOPING FOR A RING raced back and off the inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. ROCK STAR PARKING in mid pack while racing
three wide, had little left for the drive. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY broke in good order, raced forwardly for a half just off the inside, tired in the stretch. MY BOSS
LADY off a step slow, raced back and outside, lacked closing response. LADY GUSTO remained always back. BEAUTY DAY was finished early, well
beaten.

TAPPIN FORA DANCE close up in the run up the backstretch three wide, ranged up to challenge turning into the stretch, took over, drove steadily clear.
SECRETARY AT WAR within striking distance outside, ranged up closer three wide exiting the turn, do little more with the winner in the run to the wire, clear
for the second splot. SOUIXPER CHARGER moved out when racing in mid pack early, four wide through the turn, along for the show, no real threat to the
top two. MR. ANKENY broke alertly, set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, headed by the winner entering the stretch and faltered. LOOKIN FOR
EIGHT lacked speed, fell back a bit more while four wide through the turn, improved position through the stretch with some renewed interest. AMERICAIN
JOEY lacked speed, raced three wide through the turn, also picked up some position through the lane with some mild interest. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER last
away, trailed early, picked off a few tiring rivals. BASEBALL POLITICS settled in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty
for the stretch run. HIDDEN PROMISE faded while racing just off the inside. TOMATO BILL forwardly placed along the inside early, shuffled back along the
rail into the turn and steadily faded. PLATINUM EQUITY fell back along the inside, pulled up late turn after bleeding from the nostrils, vanned off.

Footnotes
STRATOFORTRESS in the second group up the backstretch while racing outside, 4w turn, advanced three wide to challenge exiting the turn, long duel to
the wire, proved best under firm handling. LIFE IS HARD broke with the leaders, pressed the leader up the backstretch, advanced to duel with that one from
the outside through the turn, hooked up with the winner while disposing of the other speed turning for home, proved stubborn to the end. KINGMAKER
lacked early foot after breaking a step slow, came four wide into the lane, up for the show with a mild rally, no match for the top two. INVARIABLY dwelt at
the start to spot the field a few lengths, trailed early as a result, came three wide out of the turn, widest in the drive, rallied with some belated interest.
GRAPNEL went evenly while racing off the inside. SPARTY SENSE forwardly placed along the inside, came up empty for the drive. THUNDERHEART
made little impact while racing four wide. STAINLESS STEEL took command soon after breaking in good order, showed the way into the turn, dueled with
the runner up inside that one through the bend then gave way for the drive. TENTH OF GOLD remained always back. QUARANTINE WHISKEY finished
early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MISS BIGLY patiently handled in the second flight just off the inside, continued in hand second turn, split foes nearing midstretch, took command then held
the next two safe under firm handling. SHE'S ALL WOLFE unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside and in hand second turn, slipped through
along the rail nearing the furlong grounds, could not get to the winner late while gaining the nod for the place. JILTED BRIDE settled off the pace and the
inside, in hand while creeping closer three wide late in the final turn, roused for the drive, staged a mild rally while widest of the first flight at the wire, missed
the second spot. COACH broke on top, pressed early off the rail, dueled the middle half remaining off the inside, narrowly showed the way through early
stretch then weakened the final furlong to lose several positions. QUEEN GODDESS prompted the issue from the three path for six furlongs then came up
empty when the real running began at the head of the lane. MATERA moved up along the inside to show the way into the first turn, continued to help set the
pace the middle four furlongs then also weakened entering the stretch.

Footnotes
JOYFUL CADENCE broke sharp, narrowly set the pace closest to the inside of the first flight, shook clear when straightened for home, larger lead, just held
late. PHAROAH'S HEART back off the early pace, advanced five wide late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker and was getting to that
one late. KABOOM BABY shuffled back soon after the start when in tight, raced back, waited in traffic midway on the turn, staged a mild rally to annex the
show when clear for the drive, not a threat to the top two. AVA'S GRACE pressed the issue while between foes in the two path, weakened gradually through
the stretch, lost the show late. URSULINA back off the pace, moved closer four wide through the turn, failed to sustain that effort in the drive.
MONTGOMERY PARK away in good order from the outside, prompted the issue three wide, had little left for the stretch run. WINGS OF AN ANGEL in the
second flight while between foes, shuffled back in continued traffic into the turn, did not recover. SUPER CHIANTI off a step slow, moved up to within
striking distance the opening quarter, weakened while continuing inside into the stretch. FLIPPING FAST was never involved in remaining back throughout.
LADY ASTRID trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
PLAINSMAN away in good order, pressed the leader into the first turn, dueled to that one's outside up the backstretch and into the far turn, remained on
equal terms into the stretch, dug in late to narrowly prevail. THOMAS SHELBY broke alertly and to the inside to slightly bother PROMISE KEEPER , dueled
up front along the inside, continued to do battle into and through the stretch, hung on gamely to be clearly second best. POPULAR KID in the second flight
while moving off the inside first turn, continued to stalk the middle half, came three wide into the lane, set down for the drive, slowly getting to the top two
late while outside that pair. PROMISE KEEPER bothered at the start to race back early, continued to lack speed while tracking outside, came four wide into
the lane, staged a mild rally while not posing a serious threat. RATED R SUPERSTAR void of speed while racing off the inside, continued to lag up the back
stretch, three to four wide into the lane, angled inside of traffic nearing midstretch, lacked a significant closing kick. LONE ROCK in the second flight while
outside, came four wide out of the final turn, came up empty as well when the running began at the head of the lane. LAST SAMURAI settled off the pace
and the inside, had little for the drive. SUPER STOCK within striking distance toward the inside, backed up through the stretch.

three wide second, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. ROME slow to settle, steadied in some traffic when a bit rank first turn, continued to race within
