Footnotes
SWEETENER bumped at the start, showed good speed to clear field, continued clear into the stretch and held sway in a nice effort. MY SIS CINDY chased
leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in between on the turn and into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and gamely held second. MISS
HELEN BACK chased leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and outkicked by top two in
the lane to just miss second. MY BELLA CHICK bumped with outside rival at the start, stalked pace along the rail on the backstretch, continued on the rail,
entered stretch in the two path and launched a mild rally to improve. MY TIGRESS broke a step slow, tried to show speed but lacked needed room, went to
rail on the backstretch, chased leader through the turn and into the stretch, kept on well enough to split the field. PROJECT LOGIC chased leader four wide
on the backstretch, continued wide trip through the turn and into the lane, one paced in the lane a weakened inside the final sixteenth. FOR MY BROTHER
stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide throughout and lacked the needed response in the lane. BALLET ROYALTY settled off the
pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, swung out widest into the stretch and lacked needed kick in the lane to improve.
GODDESS APHRODITE not asked early and settled off the pace along the inside, continued along the rail throughout and lacked needed rally to improve.
