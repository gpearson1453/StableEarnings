Footnotes
LOVELY HUSSAR stalked the pace outside of rivals, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run, overtook LUCKY LARA leaving the furlong marker and
held driving in the end. MARZANNA stalked the early pace to the turn, was three wide approaching the quarter-marker, tucked in behind the leading pair
then angled out for the drive, closed well in the late stages and could not reel in the winner but was up in time for second. CLOSED CIRCUIT pressed the
pace through the turn, vied for the lead leaving the eighth pole and was outfinished in the end, while holding for the show. LIL TINKER lacked early speed to
the turn, saved ground into the stretch run, mounted a late rally in the drive and just missed for third. LUCKY LARA broke alertly and was hustled to set
pressured fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner leaving the furlong grounds and weakened in the late going.

SEGURO stalked the quick fractions from a two wide path along the turn, was roused leaving the furlong grounds, came within aim of EDDIE'S SISTER
inside of the final sixteenth and made a late push to prevail. EDDIE'S SISTER broke sharply and sped to the front in the early stages, set a quick pace
through the turn, was confronted by SEGURO inside of the final sixteenth, was drifting out a bit in the end and could not hold that one off but was clear of
the rest for the place. AUSTRIAN NAVY chased the pace outside of rivals through the turn and was outkicked in the drive. SIMMER DOWN chased the
pace from a three wide path along the turn and gave way in the stretch.

BOLD ARTICLE broke alertly and took command of the pace into the first turn, rated nicely while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the
lead into the stretch and held safely in the end. BANDEENA prompted the fractions to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run, was outkicked in the
late going but kept on in the end to get up for the place. GOOD TIME DOLLY saved ground while stalking the pace, gained ground into the stretch run and
was outfinished in the late going. NICOLE GRACE tracked the pace while outside of rivals and did not have a late kick in the stretch. SUMMER
APPARITION was away a step slowly, lagged through the early stages, saved ground through the far turn, circled six wide into the stretch run and showed
late interest but did not make an impact.

ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions to the turn, was pressed along the bend by EARNEST, shook free of that foe into the
drive and edged clear in the end. HARDY CHISEL stalked the early pace from a two wide path, gained ground into the stretch run and was outfinished in the
late going. EARNEST was hustled to press the pace into the turn, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the late stages. BERNIE'S BIG BOY
steadied off of heels in the early going, chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn, lacked room in the stretch run and did not have a late response.
REGAL BORN tracked the pace outside of rivals along the turn and gave way in the drive. KLAY NATION chased the pace from an inside path and
weakened in the stretch. CAJUN BETTOR lacked early speed to the turn, saved ground along the bend, swung widest into the stretch run and did not mount
a late bid.

Footnotes
CLEM LABINE settled off of the quick early pace while saving ground, circled four wide into the stretch run, surged in the final sixteenth and was up in time
to prevail. HEY MATE settled off of the fast early pace while saving ground, improved position approaching the furlong grounds, came within aim leaving the
sixteenth marker and was nipped for the win getting up in time for the place. WAR GAMES confronted LET'S REJOYCE leaving the break, dueled with that
rival while carving out fast fractions through the turn, overtook LET'S REJOYCE at the sixteenth-marker to take command and was caught in the final strides
by the oncoming top pair. LET'S REJOYCE broke alertly and was sent to the front leaving the break, was engaged by WAR GAMES soon after the start,
dueled for pace duties with that foe through the turn, was put to firm urging in the final furlong and gave way in the late stages.

SLAM DUNK SERMON was hustled leaving the break to press the pace into the turn, was given a breather along the bend into the top of the lane, came on
again to confront HONEYMOONZ OVER nearing the final sixteenth and made a late push to prevail in the end. HONEYMOONZ OVER was off alertly and
was sent to the front leaving the break, was pressed into the turn by SLAM DUNK SERMON, edged clear of that foe along the turn and into the stretch, was
confronted again by SLAM DUNK SERMON approaching the sixteenth-marker, battled against that foe's bid but could not hold him off in the end and was
best of the rest. SUNSET DRAGUNN stalked the pace while saving ground through the turn, improved position into the stretch run and was outkicked in the
final stages. COLORMEMONEY chased the pace, was two wide between foes on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. CANNONBALL COMIN
tracked the pace outside of rivals and tired in the stretch run. RINSE AND REPEAT took back leaving the break, saved ground while lacking speed to the
turn and did not offer a late rally.

EXCESSIVE CAT broke sharply and sped to the front in the early stages, carved out fast fractions while extending the lead along the turn and was ridden
out in the end as much the best. BOURBONWITHATWIST exchanged bumps with DI LAURIAN leaving the break, tracked the quick pace from an inside
position through the turn, was outkicked by EXCESSIVE CAT in the late going but was clear of the rest for the place. MAYBE SOMETIME was a bit slow
into stride, chased the pace from a two wide path through the turn, did not have a late kick in the stretch run but was an easy third. K P SILVER BULLET
steadied off of heels just after the start, lacked speed to the turn, was steered five wide approaching the quarter-marker and did not mount a late rally.
SHORT RIB chased the pace from the midflight in the early stages, lost ground on the turn while four wide and tired in the late going. DI LAURIAN traded
bumps at the start with BOURBONWITHATWIST, chased the pace from the inside through the turn and faded in the drive. PIVOTAL FEVER was hustled
leaving the break to track the early fast fractions, lost ground along the turn while two wide and stopped in the late stages.
