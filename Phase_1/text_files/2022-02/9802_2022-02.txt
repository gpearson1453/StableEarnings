into the lane and lacked a rally. LUNA FORTUNA showed good speed inside to set the pace, dueled on the turn and weakened in the lane. CALIENTE RUM

KIKKERLAND vied wide down the backstretch, moved clear on the turn then drifted out while remaining safe. I'M BLAMING YOU pressed the pace in the
two path and three path and continued gamely. THE METHOD far behind early, swung wide into the stretch and closed well. FIFTY CENTS prompted the
leaders along the inside then went evenly late. HEATED BATTLE stumbled at the start, raced close up wide and tired. SIT DOWN GRANDPA pressed the
pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened. CHOCLATE BODIE was urged close up to the turn and faltered. VOY A TI saved ground off the leaders
and was never a factor. HACHACHA trailed far behind then passed a fading rival. HALSTAAT had his rider lose his right iron at the start and left iron soon
afterward losing any chance. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

Footnotes
DIVINE MIRACLE set the pace, dueled with IRISH HONOR turning for home, bumped with that rival, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and edged
away for a determined victory. IRISH HONOR stalked close up racing outside of DIVINE MIRACLE, bid on the turn, dueled with that rival into the stretch,
bumped at the top of the lane, then dug in gamely outside to the finish. PATEGORY ONE stumbled at the start, raced two wide off the pace and rallied
inside in the stretch run. JOHNNY RITT chased on the inside, rallied four wide into the stretch and then flattened out. EXCURSION bobbled at the break
and broke outward, raced off the rail, off the pace and had no rally. FAST BOB stumbled at the start, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten.
ALFATEI was fractious in the gate, off slowly and steadied, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MIDLANER bobbled after the start, raced off the
pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

SACRAMENTO Q tracked close up on the inside, tracked the leaders on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, bid at the eighth pole, then dueled
through the final furlong and surged late to prevail. SOCIAL GROUP vied between rivals in a three way early tussle, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely in
the stretch drive, dueled to the wire and got the nod for second. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM raced five wide early, settled three or four wide off the pace, came
six wide into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch duel and got up for third at the wire. MR THRIFTY stalked close up outside a rival, chased on the far turn,
rallied five wide into the stretch, dueled through the lane and missed for the show spot. DIGGERS DIAMOND steadied at the start, vied inside for the lead,
dueled inside on the turn, battled on inside of rivals through the stretch run and was outkicked. AHSAD raced four wide early, vied three wide for the lead,
dueled on the far turn, battled past midstretch and was outkicked. GRIT'N'GRIND raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
THE ROBERT trailed the field and did not factor. SPRING EMPEROR raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. BLUGRASCAT'S
SMILE raced between horses on the first turn, settled off the pace and did not factor. LUCKY HERO was reluctant to load, raced four wide early, three wide
off the pace and gave way.
