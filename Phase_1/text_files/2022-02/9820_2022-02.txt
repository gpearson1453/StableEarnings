Footnotes
POSO CREEK tracked the early pace to the turn, was given her cue nearing the quarter-marker to overtake the pacesetter, had a clear lead into the stretch,
felt pressure from oncoming rivals in the late stages but held safely in the end. WINK AND A DREAM saved ground while stalking the pace on the turn,
closed in the stretch run and kept on to secure second. SIERRA MELODY stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and rallied in the drive, was
denied for the place but was an easy third. TWIRLING DERBY was a bit slow in the early going and lacked speed to the turn, was four wide along the bend
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch drive. BATTLING GERVINHO bobbled at the start then was hustled to set the quick fractions through the turn, was
overtaken by POSO CREEK nearing the quarter-marker and faded in the late stages. BERNIE'S BIG BOY chased the pace from a three wide path on the
turn and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
ALL saved ground while sitting off of the pace, rallied along the rail in the stretch and kept on while on the left lead to hold safely in the end over the
oncoming runner-up. ARISTEIA chased the pace from a five wide path through the turn, mounted a steady bid into the stretch run and just missed in the end
while getting up in time for the place. LOVELY HUSSAR tracked the pace from a two wide path, closed well in the late stages and was up in time for the
show. MARZANNA chased the early pace, made a three wide bid into the lane and was outfinished in the final stages, while just missing for third. ROSES
FOR MARILYN was off a bit slowly, lacked speed to the turn and made a mild late rally in the stretch. LADY SKYWALKER pressed the pace through the
turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the drive. LUCKY LARA was sent leaving the break and set disputed fractions through
the turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
CIRCULODEGANADORAS was away alertly, was hustled to show good early speed while carving reasonably fast fractions through the turn, felt late
pressure from the oncoming runner-up but held under firm urging in the end. BIG CHICK stalked the pace from the second flight, improved position on the
turn and continued that run into the stretch to pressure the winner in the final stages but was denied in that attempt while getting up in time to secure
second. GOOD TIME DOLLY stalked the pace from a three wide path to the turn, closed through the final stages to earn the show and just missed for the
place. HEAT SEEKING LETA sat off of the pace through the turn, was roused nearing the quarter-marker to make a five wide rally in the stretch and
improved
position

was

CIRCULODEGANADORAS nearing the quarter-marker, was turned away in that effort and was outfinished in the late stages. BORN TO REIGN was away a
bit slowly and spotted the field leaving the break, lacked early speed to the turn, saved ground into the stretch run and offered a mild late gain. FOGGY
BOTTOM chased the pace to the turn, lost position along the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISTY CAT was forwardly placed in the early stages, steadily gained on AWESOME AMANDA leaving the second turn, caught that foe leaving the furlong
marker and edged clear in the end. AWESOME AMANDA was away alertly and took command of the pace into the first turn, was a bit keen through the run
to the second turn, came under pressure from MISTY CAT approaching the furlong grounds, ceded the lead to that foe but kept on to be an easy second
over the rest. FABRIANA settled off of the pace, gained ground along the second turn and passed tiring rivals for third in the stretch. GRIGORO stalked the
pace from a two wide path to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the late going. MISS EVER READY was away a bit slowly, was
unhurried through the backstretch run and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ROSE was allowed to settle along the first turn, was asked to stalk the pace outside of foes along the backstretch run, continued to improve
position while four wide along the second turn, closed well in the late stages and was up just in time get the nod for the win. MALIBU JEWEL stalked the
early pace from the midflight, gained ground along the second turn, vied for the lead leaving the furlong grounds, drifted in into RED DAHLIA in the final
sixteenth and was nipped on the wire by the oncoming NORTHERN ROSE while besting the rest in the late stages. RED DAHLIA disputed the early pace
then took command of the fractions into the far turn, had a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds, was caught leaving the eighth pole, drifted out a bit into
MALIBU JEWEL in the final sixteenth and was outfinished in the final stages. FIRE DIAMONDS hopped at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried
through the second turn run, rallied well off of the bend but was unable to reel in the top three. LACEY'S RAINBOW settled off of the pace to the half-mile
marker, took up in tight quarters entering the second turn, angled out for the drive and lacked a late rally. PULPIT SINGER pressed the pace to the second
turn and gave way in the stretch run. SLEW OF FASHION was forwardly placed to the half-mile marker and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
KEEP ON DANZING tracked the early pace while outside of rivals and under a snug hold, made a three wide bid into the stretch run to confront AUTISM
BLUE nearing the furlong grounds, overtook that foe and drew clear in the end, holding safely over the oncoming runner-up. AWESOME CURLIN was away
slowly and was allowed to settle to the half-mile marker, gained ground while four wide on the second turn, continued that rally into the stretch while widest
of the field and was unable to reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. AUTISM BLUE was away in good order and set all of the pace to the
second turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken by KEEP ON DANZING leaving the furlong marker, was outfinished in the
end but kept on to be a clear third. RUNNING ON EMPTY tracked the pace to the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. HANDSOME HUSSAR was
unhurried in the early stages and was not a threat. NATIONWIDE PRIDE saved ground while settling just off of the pace, lost contact leaving the second
turn, was eased in the late stages and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MOHAWK KING (IRE) was away alertly and was sent to set all of the pace,rated nicely into the second turn, extended the lead leaving the bend and kicked
clear in the end. ROCKTILLYOUDROP settled off of the pace, made a two wide bid on the second turn to come within range nearing the top of the stretch,
tipped out for the drive, was outkicked in the late going by the winner but kept on to be second best. PAINT ME LUCKY attended to the pace to the second
turn, lost position into the stretch run, weakened in the final stages and just saved third. FINAL FINAL was away slowly and was allowed to settle in the early
going, was steered four to five wide on the second turn approaching the head of the stretch and did not mount a late rally, but just missed for third. DARK
PRINCE tracked pace outside of rivals on the first turn, slipped to the inside for the backstretch run and into the second turn and tired in the stretch drive,
while just missing for third. BIGFOOT CITY sat just off of the early pace from the second flight, improved position while three wide between rivals on the far
turn and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND GHOST was away well and was hustled to set fast fractions through the turn, shook clear of TIZLIGHTNING leaving the turn and kicked clear in
the end. MOB BOSS tracked the pace outside of foes, was outfinished in the stretch run and just held on to secure second. TIZLIGHTNING pressed the fast
pace from a three wide position, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the final sixteenth while just missing for second. LOVE'EM N
LEAVE'EM chased the pace from the rear, was two wide between rivals approaching the quarter-marker and finished evenly in the late stages.
TOLONISITO broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals and was empty for the stretch run. BANDERA AZTECA
was pinched at the start and was away a bit slowly, saved ground while chasing the pace and weakened in the drive. FASCINATED tracked the pace from a
ground saving position and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
TRIBAL STORM chased the early pace to the turn, mounted a five wide bid nearing the quarter-marker, was kept to steady urging through the stretch,
caught KATZUMOTO inside of the final sixteenth and dug in to prevail. KATZUMOTO checked off of heels in the early going, chased the pace outside of
foes to the turn, rushed into contention nearing the quarter-marker, took command into the stretch run, was caught in the final sixteenth but kept on to hold
second. GOBSMACK was unhurried in the early stages, was roused along the turn while two wide, swung widest into the lane, made a good late rally and
kept on to be a clear third. PERFECT D chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn, gained ground leaving the turn, was blocked nearing the
sixteenth-marker and was outkicked in the late stages. CONTINENTAL UNION disputed the early pace, took back heading into the turn to track the pace
while two wide and was outfinished in the drive. OUR EXPECTATION lacked early speed to the turn while saving ground, was still along the rail for the
stretch drive and closed willingly in the final stages. HARBOR KITTY bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals and
did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. CINDERELLAS PRINCE was under a tight hold to the turn while disputing the early pace, was still within aim
leaving the turn, was blocked nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. STREET MOXIE was away alertly and disputed the pace into
the turn, took a clear advantage to the quarter-marker, came under pressure leaving the bend and gave way in the drive.
