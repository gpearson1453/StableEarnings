Footnotes
CONFIDENCE BUILDER hopped at the start and traded bumps with CHELINA leaving the break, settled just off of the early pace while saving ground,
angled four wide for the drive, caught PRAY TO AN ANGEL nearing the sixteenth marker and kicked clear in the end. PRAY TO AN ANGEL tracked the
pace while saving ground, made a two wide bid into the stretch run to take command, was caught approaching the sixteenth-marker and just saved second
in the end. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY was unhurried in the early stages, was asked for run from a four wide path on the second turn, made a good late rally in
the stretch and just missed in the end for the place. LA POPIS stalked the pace outside of rivals, gained ground while three wide on the second turn and
weakened in the drive. FINGER TIP was away in good order and took command of the early pace, came under pressure approaching the furlong grounds
and tired in the late stages. CHELINA broke out at the start, exchanged bumps with CONFIDENCE BUILDER and was away slowly, was allowed to settle
through the early stages, was steered to the inside along the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COLLUSION DELUSION settled off of the pace while saving ground in the early stages, was steered four wide along the second turn, closed on the leaders
into the stretch run, confronted RICH WARRIOR with a sixteenth to go, dueled to the line and just got up at the wire to win the nod. RICH WARRIOR was
away alertly and was sent to dispute the early pace, took back through the backstretch run, was roused approaching the quarter-marker, edged clear
leaving the furlong grounds, was headed by COLLUSION DELUSION nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled with the winner to the line and was just nipped
for the win. RULER OF ANGELS sat off of the pace through the first half-mile, gained ground while three wide between foes on the second turn and was
outfinished in the stretch, while well clear of the rest for third. LASTBESTHOPE sat off of the pace while saving ground and did not mount a late rally. WILD
WAGER saved ground while settling through the second turn and was not a factor. TIME IS GONE disputed the pace along the first turn then went on to set
solo fractions while on a long lead, was tiring approaching the quarter-marker, was caught heading into the lane and faded in the late going.

SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was unprepared leaving the break and spotted field several lengths away from the gate, recovered to sit off of the pace through the
second turn, mounted a three wide rally leaving the far turn, surged in the final sixteenth and was up just in time to prevail. MANGOTANGO tracked the slow
pace from a two wide path to the half-mile marker, lost a bit of ground along the far turn while two wide, closed in the stretch run to pass the top pair inside
of the sixteenth-marker and was nailed on the line by the surging winner in the end. FANTASTIC SECRET was away in good order, was hustled to the front
after the break then set slow fractions to the second turn, came under pressure at the top of the stretch, kept on to the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished
in the end while clear for third. SILK ROAD SALLY saved ground while tracking the pace to the second turn, vied for the lead approaching the
quarter-marker and was outkicked in the final stages. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was off slowly and settled off of the pace into the backstretch run, steadily

MANAALABOUTDAMONEY tracked the quick pace from a two wide path, was roused in upper stretch, confronted STANFORD BAY nearing the furlong
grounds, shook free of the runner-up and drew clear in the end. STANFORD BAY was away alertly and was hustled to set fast fractions through the turn,
came under pressure from MANAALABOUTDAMONEY nearing the furlong grounds, could not hold the winner off in the stretch but kept on to be a clear
runner-up. SAULS CALL saved ground while stalking the pace from the midflight and was outkicked in the stretch run. SUMMANUS chased the fractions
from a three wide position on the turn and gave way in the late stages. MEDINA MAN chased the fast pace outside of rivals on the turn and weakened in the

SMILING THUNDER was away a step slowly, was hustled to chase the pace outside of rivals to the turn, steadily gained on the leaders while three then
four wide into the lane, overtook ARTISAN DANCER in the final sixteenth and drew clear in the end in a good debut. ARTISAN DANCER was away alertly
and was sent to contest the early pace with TROPICANA GIRL, shook free of that rival on the turn, had a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds, was
overtaken in the final sixteenth by SMILING THUNDER but held on for second over an oncoming rival. FILLY PELLI bobbled at the start and was away a
step slowly, lacked speed to the turn, was steered out from the two path on the turn to be widest into the stretch run, rallied in the final furlong and just
missed for the place. TROPICANA GIRL was sent to dispute the early pace, lost ground along turn and tired in the drive. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ stalked the
pace from a two wide path on the turn and gave way in the late going. SALLY SLEW broke in and was bumped at the start, was outrun to the turn and was
not a factor. GOOD WOMAN chased the pace while saving ground on the turn and gave out in the late stages.

BROOKYS TAPIT was off alertly and was sent to set the pace, was well handled while in a good rhythm through the backstretch run and into the far turn,
came in a path leaving the three furlong marker into the path of ROYAL 'N RANDO, was kept to task in upper stretch and pulled away in the end. DIMMI
QUANDO was unhurried in the early going, improved position while five wide on the second turn, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to hold for the place.
ROYAL 'N RANDO saved ground while sitting just off of the pace, steadily advanced into the far turn, took up sharply in tight quarters leaving the three
furlong marker, rallied leaving the turn and could not reel in the winner in the end but just missed for second. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM stalked the pace from
the midflight, made a four wide bid along the second turn, was outkicked into the drive and flattened out in the late going. UNUSUAL CODE was allowed to
settle just off of the pace while outside of rivals, gained ground on the far turn from a five wide path and gave way in the stretch run. WILL IS CHILL was
rank and hard to place along the first turn and into the backstretch run, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground while three wide on the second
turn and tired in the late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO ROYAL 'N RANDO TAKING UP LEAVING THE THREE-FURLONG
MARKER AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT ROYAL 'N RANDO HAD ESTABLISHED HIS PATH AND BROOKYS TAPIT INTERFERED
WITH ROYAL 'N RANDO BY COMING IN A PATH AND DISQUALIFIED BROOKYS TAPIT FROM FIRST TO THIRD. AN OBJECTION WAS ALSO
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF ROYAL 'N RANDO AGAINST THE RIDER OF BROOKYS TAPIT FOR THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
MALIBU GHOST broke alertly and was hustled to set the pace to the turn, turned away the challenge of SONORA SERMON leaving the quarter-marker,
was pressured by that rival again in the final sixteenth and held to prevail in the end over the oncoming runner-up. TOM'S BIRTHDAY was shuffled back at
the start, chased the pace from the rear to the turn, mounted an inside rally leaving the bend and was gaining on MALIBU GHOST in the end but could not
reel him in while getting up in time to secure second. SONORA SERMON pressed the pace to the turn, lost ground into the stretch run, came on again in
the final sixteenth but was outfinished in the late stages while just missing for second. LOVER BOY TOM chased the early pace to the turn while between
rivals, was two wide between foes while in tight quarters approaching the two-furlong marker, closed in the stretch but was unable to reel in the top three.
PRINCE CINDERELLA tracked the pace outside of rivals on the turn and was outclosed in the stretch run. ONE LAST THOUGHT saved ground while
stalking the pace through the turn, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the late going.
