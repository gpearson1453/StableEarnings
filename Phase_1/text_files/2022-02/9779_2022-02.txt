Footnotes
SKY HIGH SUSAN tracked two wide and between horses, moved up down the backstretch to press at the half mile pole, vied between horses around the
far turn before her outer counterpart forged an advantage turning for home, but outkicked that green rival in upper stretch, and swiftly kicked away.
CONNECT IT laid off of the pace along the inside, chased the leading trio around the far turn, tipped to the six path in midstretch while rallying, and wore
down a pair of inner foes late to gain place at the wire. CHEAPSKATE DIVA stalked three wide while tugging in the bit around the first turn, pressed down
the backstretch before bidding into the far turn, showed the way from a pair of inner rivals around that bend, but greenly resisted the rider's encouragement
to change leads passing the quarter pole causing him to fail to keep pace with an inner rival, then lugged inwardly from a right handed crop before losing
momentum due to heavy rider correction at the furlong grounds, met a pair of outer place-biding rivals in the final sixteenth, and got nailed on the wire for
that position while saving show. MS. CAJUN QUEEN settled off of the pace in the three path, tracked the leading trio two wide around the far turn, swung
outside of them entering the lane, but lugged inwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, wandered about while bidding for place a sixteenth
out, but was outfinished and missed show. SHELLI'S ANGEL lagged well behind around the first turn, closed in on the rest of the field down the backstretch,
then surpassed tiring rivals around the far turn, and improved for a minor share on the wire. MACEE set the pace, met a pair of bids into the far turn, got
headed around that bend, gave way turning for home, and weakened. LUCKY LINDA was put to a bit of tight quarters between horses early on, raced at the
rear in the four path around both turns, and never got involved. SAVANNAH'S HERE tracked in the five to four path around the first turn, but tired into the far
turn. SCRAPPY stalked two wide into the first turn, tucked to the rail around that bend, but faded approaching the far turn, was done early, and eased
through the lane

Footnotes
LIKE MIKE bumped with an inner rival while being put to tight quarters between horses at the start, tracked three wide, gained in the four path around the far
turn to bid for the lead in the six path passing the quarter pole, sparred outside of RUN ROCKET while maintaining a narrow margin through the final
furlong, and held to the wire. RUN ROCKET stalked along the inside, bid along the rail entering the lane, dueled with an outer LIKE MIKE through
midstretch, but was only second best. UNRESTRICTED was jostled between horses at the start, trailed the field around both turns, swung from the three
path to the eight path entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes while hanging on his left lead to reach show at the wire. DREWCITABLE saved ground
far back early on, then in midpack around the far turn, chased along the rail through the lane to bid for show entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished.
RELUCTANT WARRIOR stalked while intentionally staying in the four path and multiple paths away from rivals, chased in the three to four path around the
far turn, bid for the lead between horses in the five path at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by a pair of bidders on either side approaching midstretch,
yielded leaving the furlong grounds, and lost show late. CABO'S RUMOR tracked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, and failed to
factor. MR. FOUR SEVENS bumped an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path at the five furlong pole, but took
back from between horses into the far turn, took that bend in the two path, shifted outwardly in upper stretch, and improved mildly between horses. I'M
D'CAT took solid bumps from rivals on either side at the start, raced far back two wide, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor. KRAFTY BOY
broke inwardly, rated far back in the four to three path, then in the five path around the far turn, but faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. GUILTY
LOVER rushed to open up a wide advantage around the first turn, but came back to chasing rivals around the far turn, drifted a bit outwardly entering the
lane, and weakened between horses thereafter.

Footnotes
HOMBRAZO tracked in the two path from multiple lengths off around the first turn, gained three wide around the far turn to bid with a quarter mile to go, and
readily drew off through the lane. PERFECT CUT laid off of the pace along the inside, closed in to chase right behind the leaders into the far turn, tipped
three wide entering the lane as HOMBRAZO took over, then stayed on to reach the early pace-setter for place in the closing stages. GIMME SOME MO set
the pace along the inside, met HOMBRAZO's challenge turning for home, proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and lost place in the late stages.
OUTLIER pressed the pace-setter from the outside, but faded between horses turning for home. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
EMRO prompted the pace two wide, vied turning for home, came into the lane in the three path, then kicked clear at the three sixteenths pole, and inched
away thereafter. INAJIFFY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked from off of the pace two wide around the turn, swung seven wide entering
the lane, took a minor brush from an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole while commencing a rally, and surged in the final furlong to reach place on the
wire. READY FOR CHANGE stalked along the inside, bid along the rail passing the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner at the
three sixteenths pole, battled for place along with an outer RISKY REWARD thereafter, but was outfinished for that position by another outer rallying rival on
the wire. RISKY REWARD bumped an inner foe at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, tipped outside of the leaders entering the lane,
vied for place in midstretch, but was outfinished by an outer rival late and missed reaching show. DANCE RHYTHMS stalked close up three wide and
between horses, failed to keep pace while altering six wide entering the lane, then was mildly herded out a path while between horses at the three
sixteenths pole, then got outkicked by an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, and kept on for a minor share. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK stalked four wide,
chased five wide entering the lane, but hung on his her left lead, drifted out a bid at the three sixteenths pole, then shifted inwardly after getting outkicked by
outer rivals entering the final furlong, and gave way. MUCHA MEZQUINA took a bump from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside
around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, but made little impact while hanging on her left lead. VIVIDLY (GB) trailed in the five path around the turn, and
was outrun. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, but weakened between horses at the three
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RISING EMPIRE stalked outside of the leader from the three path, pressed that foe around the far turn, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole
while hanging on his left lead, fought on thereafter without changing over, bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. ARDANWOOD set
a clear pace in the two path early on, felt pressure from an outer RISING EMPIRE around the far turn, shook away from that foe at the quarter pole, but
could not resist that rival late, and was worn down in the final sixteenth. TIWANAKU laid off of the pace two wide, chased the leading pair while clinging to
show around the far turn, and maintained that position through the lane. TONAL IMPACT trailed early on, raced in the rear three to four wide around the far
turn, and moved up. GLOBAL EMPIRE stalked along the inside, but faded into the far turn. FENWICK got keen approaching the seven furlong pole while off
of the pace along the inside, raced at the rear two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
CLARA PEETERS (GB) stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, and drew off at the furlong grounds. MAGICAL PEAPOD set the
pace while staying well off of the rail, which allowed for racing room for an inner CLARA PEETERS (GB), proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then
held place to the wire. POSTNUP stalked two wide, then three wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side shortly after, regained show
from an outer flattening foe at the sixteenth pole, and kept on late, but failed to reel in the early pace-setter for place late. RUSSIAN MAFIA rated at the rear
along the inside, gained three wide around the far turn to bid four wide at the quarter pole, but flattened out passing the three sixteenths pole. GO BIG
GREEN raced at the rear two wide, then five wide around the far turn, and was outrun in the center of the track through the lane.

Footnotes
APHRODITES REVENGE tracked two wide, tipped to the five path and outside of the leading pair entering the lane, then grinded away on her left lead to
bid in midstretch, then edged clear late. ENOUGH HEART lunged outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, vied three wide, led at the five sixteenths pole,
cleared in upper stretch, but was bested late. CHEYANN GLITTERS vied two wide and between horses early on, then inside of a rival around the turn, gave
way in upper stretch, but just saved show. SHE'S OUR STAR broke outwardly, trailed the field into the turn, and improved along the rail to miss show.
ALLSTAR MAGIC was brushed at the start, raced off of the pace four wide, then chased on his left lead, but missed reaching show. AUDACIOUS GIRL vied
along the inside early on, but chased outer foes into the turn, weakened in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong. STORMY SPOTS was
brushed by an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, and tired. MISSBUDLITELIME stalked along the inside, but faded into the turn, and was
done early.
