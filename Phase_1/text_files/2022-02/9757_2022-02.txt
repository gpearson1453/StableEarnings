Footnotes
STONE'S RIVER broke out, bumped rival and stumbled badly, almost unseating the rider in the process, recovered well and went up to make a clear lead,
set all the pace to the stretch and held gamely in the closing moments. PRIMER DIMER was rated off the rail in the early going, traveled outside a rival then
came three wide into the lane, was gaining late but lacked the needed final kick to overtake the winner. ENDLESS SUNSET steadied off heels on the first
turn, tracked in the two path then angled to the inside at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. ALGERIA (IRE)
stalked the leader on the inside, tipped out a bit on the far turn and took aim two wide into the stretch, chased between runners in the lane, got bothered by
ENDLESS SUNSET past the sixteenth pole and flattened late. MONGOL ALTAI got bumped from inside at the start, trailed into the lane, moved out in the
stretch and failed to menace.

MASHHAD FLATS vied between foes for the lead, dueled outside MAD STEVEN on the far turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared into the lane and
drew off. MAD STEVEN vied for command from inside, dueled with MASHHAD FLATS on the far turn, lost touch with the winner into the lane, drifted out
some in the stretch and held the place. ABADON broke out, chased four then three wide on the first turn at the back, lagged behind up the backstretch,
angled to the rail on the far turn and was along for the show. RIVIERA CHAMP attended the pace four deep to the far turn, chased the top pair four wide on
the that bend and faded. PRINCE HUSSAR vied for command three deep to the far turn, could not keep pace with the top pair past the three-eighths pole,
chased two to three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SMUGGLER'S RUN settled off the pace, advanced three wide through the turn, moved out in the lane and overhauled MOOSE MITCHELL under hand
urging. MOOSE MITCHELL pressed the pace from outside, dueled for command on the turn, took a short lead with a quarter mile left to run, battled into the
furlong grounds, put away inside rival with a sixteenth remaining but could not stave off the late charge from the winner. FRANKLIN ONE STAR dropped
back quickly, checked off heels early, lacked room on the inside near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide around the bend, angled out further in the
stretch and got up for the show. WHO'S CANDY set the pace along the rail under pressure, dueled around the turn, lost command at the quarter pole,
fought on to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. IM STILL THIRSTY was forwardly placed in the beginning, chased outside in the two path around the
turn and weakened. STAR ENTRY tracked the top pair off the rail, went two wide into the bend, moved down to the rail but lacked room entering the stretch,
angled out in the lane and could not rally. THIRSTY ALWAYS broke slow and came in at the start, was ridden along cautiously while steadying over the dirt
crossing, moved closer up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty. RICHARDS THE DREAM checked hard early when losing his
path early, trailed into the lane and could not recover.

BELLA RENELLA angled inward while tracking the pace, waited for room along the inside through the turn, gained a clear path at the top of the stretch,
launched a rail bid inside the top trio and bested TIZ A MASTER in the final sixteenth. TIZ A MASTER sped to the front from inside, set the pace under
pressure to the turn, cleared rival early on the turn, challenged by a pair of rivals past the quarter pole, battled down the lane, held a short lead into deep
stretch and yielded grudgingly to the winner. LI'L GRAZEN was off a bit slow to begin, stalked the pace well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, bid
three deep past the quarter pole, fought four deep in the stretch and faltered. SWIRLING stumbled a bit at the start, raced up close outside the top pair, bid
two wide outside TIZ A MASTER with a quarter mile left to run, fought between foes in the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. CALIFORNIA COOL

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT'S GIRL dueled outside SO SOFTLY, cleared that rival with a quarter mile left to run, then drew off under some right-handed urging and strong
handling. NEVER SWAY tracked two then three wide around the turn and bested the rest. MO CONNELLY was off a bit slow, stalked the dueling pair from
inside, tipped two wide on the turn while being asked and got edged for place. SILENT BEAUTY settled off the pace, went four wide into the turn, angled
down to the rail and was put in tight quarter trying to advanced at the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch, angled out in the lane and needed
to find more in the final furlong. SO SOFTLY dueled from inside, lost touch approaching the quarter pole and faded along the rail. RAVENCLAW was off
slow at the start, lagged behind early, angled out early on the turn, steered back to the inside around the bend and made no impact. STARSHIP
DIPLOMACY stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to be forwardly placed behind the top pair, traveled three then four wide on the turn while
losing ground and faded in the lane. LUCY JANE chased from outside up the backstretch, started to weaken around the turn, exited the turn four to five
wide, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
IAN GLASS stalked off the rail early on, went two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, took over approaching the eighth pole, cleared soon
after and held safely in the closing moments. GRIT AND CURIOSITY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went two then three wide around the turn, angled out
in upper stretch and closed well to best the rest. FRONTIER MARKET sat off the pace early on, steered down to the two path, angled out around the bend
and came four wide into the stretch and got outkicked for the place honors. VIA EGNATIA fractious in the gate, sped to the front, set the pace on the inside
into the turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PREACHING TRAINER was off slow to
start, steadied off heels soon after, pulled early on and went between rivals then moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room along the fence
with a furlong left to run and could not rally. VERY IRISH sat off the pace and moved inside, exited the turn two wide and lacked a rally. CASTLE raced up
close outside the pacesetter, chased two then three wide around the turn and weakened in the drive.
