Footnotes
WICKOSITY saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew aim three wide midway on the far turn and dueled for the lead later yards. ADARA
stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and took a slim lead inside the eighth, dug in leaving the far turn but was outfinished
through later yards. CHROME HEIR settled off the rail, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, left the turn outside
and finished well to take third later yards. OBOY raced with the pace inside, dueled CAN'T STOP MAXEY from the three eighths pole, ran briefly clear
midway on the far turn but was met inside the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. The latter raced with the pace two deep, dueled from the three
eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. UNKNOWN AGENDA raced well back and never factored. POINT US HOME lost traction at the break,
showed no response and only galloped around.

Footnotes
GREAT SPIRIT pressured the pace and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole, widened off the rail on the turn and was kept alert through the stretch.
SLEWING chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, was carried out leaving the turn but dug in to take second later yards.
TIMETOGETUP chased the pace, rounded the turn in the six path, left the turn outside, finished well and just missed second. DIXIE YODELER gave chase,
raced near the rail on the turn, was eased to the four path leaving the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. WINDSOR'S PLAY chased inside, raced at the
rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. CASTLE TOY set a pressured pace most of the opening quarter mile, but was met a the five sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. LEMONSONDESURPRISE chased, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and
weakened. EMBERLY chased the pace, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. SIENTE LA BRISA chased inside, was blocked at the rail
off the heels of Windsor's Play approaching the eighth pole and weakened. DIVA ROSE was never a factor.

Footnotes
WHY LEA was roughed from tight quarters between horses into the first turn and ran in the three path through the turn, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead late stretch and drew clear toward the wire. PRINCESS MIA ROSE took over
while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was
steadily handled leaving the turn, but relented late while able to hold second. CREDIT COMMITTEE rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase
into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. CHANTILLY MOON (PER) rounded the first turn in the three
path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN
stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but weakened nearing mid-stretch.
HOLY HIP steadied at the start, raced well back in the five path on the first turn and could only improve her position. I'M SO EXTRA stalked four wide, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and weakened in the lane. AMERICAN LEGACY saved ground. T J STORM
VISION became a bit edgy in the gate and steadied off the heels of Princess Mia Rose into the first turn, saved ground through the turn, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn and was eased.
