Footnotes
DR. STEVE set a fast pace while clear and racing off the rail, drew off on the far turn, then was kept to pressure to prove much the best. DEE JAY was off a
step slow, rated early and advanced between rivals leaving the six furlong marker, then dropped to the inside by the half mile marker, advanced on the
inside on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. BRILLIANT CHASE tracked the early pace three wide, switched to be two
wide on the far turn and weakened, held show award. LOOSE ENDS was allowed to settle early, four to five wide on the far turn and passed the tiring rivals.
JAYJAYDEE stalked the winner four wide and came five wide into the lane and tired. COPPERHEAD CREEK lacked a rally. RADIEUX hopped at the start
and failed to menace. JO JO HANS chased the early pace and then stopped.
