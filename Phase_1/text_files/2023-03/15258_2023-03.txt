Footnotes
LUCKY CAT TOO unhurried to the turn, rallied into the stretch, edged clear. MISS SOVELIA rated off leaders to the turn, urged on to a short lead in the
stretch but weakened while shortening stride for spot place. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART no speed to the stretch, ran on steadily to improve for third.
AZAMANA EMPIRE good position, in tight and steadied out of turn and mid stretch, kept on in the final sixteenth. SHE'S A KEEPER inside position, pressed
pace to stretch but weakened in the late going. MAMBO KITTEN had no speed with only mild improvement. MARSANNE sprinted clear on lead, headed into
stretch, weakened in drive. FUN N TEARS chased three wide to the turn, could not go on and faded. ZERO CLICK never threatened. SLENDER BETSY
failed to menace throughout. BANNED FROM MIDWAY always outrun. QUIET PRETTY KITTY was through early and dropped back readily.
