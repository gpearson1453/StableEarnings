Footnotes
KENTUCKY KISS set the pace along the rail and held firm under a steady drive. STARSHIP AURORA raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide near
the quarter pole and finished well. WAY TOO EARLY prompted the winner two wide, was unable to gain on that foe in the lane but fought on between rivals
so hold third. CUMBERLAND FALLS stalked the pace from the rail, lacked a clear path throughout the stretch run and just missed third. RANSOM STYLE
raced in range two wide around the first turn, chased four wide around the far turn and was outkicked between foes in the stretch. EXCLUSIVE JONI saved
ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. ARMONIA saved ground off the early pace, went two wide between foes around
the far turn and lacked the needed rally. RACHELS SONG was rank at the start, raced off the pace three wide, circled six wide around the far turn and faded
in the lane. YANKEE STORM broke a bit awkwardly, trailed in the two path early, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. MI CORAZON
played no factor while racing four and five wide. ANCIENT RELIC was pulling four and five wide, retreated around the far turn and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
I AM THE GAME settled up close in the two path, was short of room while under light rousing along the rail around the far turn, bumped out an outer foe to
make an opening just past the quarter pole and bid while floating out to the five path at the top of the lane, took over the lead and drew clear. PARADISE
DRIVE settled in range around the four path, was under a drive rounding the far turn, had to steady just past the quarter pole from an outward shifting inner
rival and was in the seven path entering the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. NETWORKING tracked in the two path, shifted to the rail and
was cued rounding the far turn, shifted out to the three path into the lane, and kept on while tipping outwards thru the final furlong for show. FROSTEDBIRD
travelled in the three path around the first turn and stalked in the four path down the backside, was ridden in the three path around the far turn but got
bumped outward by an inner rival just past the quarter pole, and evened out from the six path in upper stretch. HEART BOY raced in the two path around
the first turn and was wellback in the four path down the backstretch, was in the six path and under a ride rounding the far turn and floated out to the eight
path entering the lane, but was no factor. ENZO'S WORLD rushed up in the five path around the first turn and set the pace from around the three path into
the backstretch, was roused in the two path rounding the far turn but yielded at the top of the stretch. LUSCIOUS DANCER chased in the five path but was
empty from the six path entering the lane. SCREEN DOOR rated along the inside but never threatened from the four path in the stretch. JACK FLASH
trailed throughout and was eased into the stretch. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER TURNING INTO
THE STRETCH, NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

CARAMEL CHIP stalked the pace in the three path, closed steadily and was up in deep stretch. CONCRETE GLORY set the pace in the two path,
continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted in under right-handed urging in midstretch, straightened out under left-handed pressure soon after and and
yielded late. PROVERB chased the top two from the rail, was no threat in the lane but bested the rest. DOO WOP DON failed to menace while racing three
wide. AEQUOR trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
STRONG SILENT broke out and brushed an outer foe, trailed along the rail and had to steady slightly into the turn, tipped out to the four path around the
turn and was cued passing the quarter pole, was in the five path and began a rally entering the stretch, got bumped by an inner foe just past the eight pole,
but continued to rally and drew past another inner foe in the final strides to win. OPEONGO set the pace from the four path into the turn, shifted inwards and
was roused from the two path into the stretch, kept on under right handed encouragement through the stretch, but was caught late by a closing outer foe to
place. ULIKEAPPLES tracked in the four path, was coaxed turning into the lane, tipped out passing the eighth pole and bumped the eventual winner, and
evened out for show. TEMPORA was prompted along inside of foes in the two path, lost ground around the turn and was in the four path at the top of the
lane, but was no factor. ADIOS BABE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, was coaxed from the two path midway around the
turn and driven into the stretch, but did not threaten. SAMMY'S TOWN stalked between foes in the three path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
LINN PIER stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, moved up between foes to take the lead early on the backstretch, dueled two wide from there
and dug in gamely inside foes to repel multiple late challengers. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole,
had aim outside of the winner throughout the stretch and could not quite get by. AMUNET settled two wide in range, went four wide around the far turn then
rallied widest. SISTER NELL saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was narrowly outkicked.
RECONNECTING raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. LOVE MY JOB set the pace along the rail, dueled to
midstretch and tired. BLUSTERY had her head turned at the start, raced well back three and four wide and never threatened. ANDIE ONE chased the pace
three wide and lacked a closing bid. TAPPLE CIDER raced four wide around the first turn, made a three wide middle move early on the backstretch,
pressed three deep to the five-sixteenths marker and gave way.

Footnotes
PAPA KATZ raced wellback in the two path, was under light rousing in the three path rounding the turn, tipped out to the six path and was cued at the top of
the lane, rallied between foes and was up in the final sixteenth. BLUEY tracked in the five path, was under coaxing rounding the turn and urged left handed
while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on down the center for place. CAN'T BE BROKEN pressed in the four path, was ridden along
while making a bid around the turn, got floated out the five path into the lane, but kept on for show. WHEATSHEAF set the pace in the two path, was in the
three path under confident handling around the turn and tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, tipped back inwards in upper stretch and was
under urging inside of rivals in the final furlong, and stayed on but was outrun late to miss minor rewards. CORPORATE AFFAIR prompted the pace in the
five path, was roused midway around the turn and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, but finished evenly. TOYI chased in the six path, was ridden
around the turn and fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but was one paced. FORT ATTITUDE rated in the four path, was asked for more run
midway around the turn and in the five path entering the lane, but was no factor. BLAST THE MUSIC raced off the pace in the three path but never
threatened along the inside in the stretch. SHEA ON THE LAM stalked in the two path, was cued turning into the lane, but faded around the three path.
TICO G trailed throughout around the two to four paths.

Footnotes
KIKILOVE settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane, closed outside, took over
near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. CARLOTUK lacked early speed at the rail, advanced inside around the turn, tipped two wide near the quarter pole
and was up for the place inside of foes in the final strides. LOOKING FOR HOPE prompted the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole,
led to the sixteenth marker and lost second late. ATTHECROSSROADS raced in range two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. FORCES SWEETHEART had early speed three wide and faded around the turn. JELLICLE KATZ broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide and
never threatened. LE BOIANA was outrun inside. BON DIA set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SANURA set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the far turn and in the three path at the top of the lane, dug in under right handed urging,
and held gamely. LUCKY PERIDOT raced in the three path around the first turn and rated in the five path down the backside, was roused around the far
turn and tipped out to the seven path entering the lane, and ran on to get up for place. LAY THE GROUNDWORK prompted the pace under a hold around
the four path, was roused to bid around the far turn, headed the eventual winner passing the quarter pole and was in the five path at the top of the stretch,
was repelled by the winner inside the final furlong, but kept on for show. JAZZY T tracked in the four path, was under urging rounding the far turn and was in
the six path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. PENTAGON chased in the two path, was under a ride in the four path around the far turn, but never
factored around the five path in the stretch. MARIA'S REVENGE trailed around the two path early and never threatened. RIVETING SPIRIT stalked around
the three path but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
RED'S REVENGE saved ground in range, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the front in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
IMPOSTER SYNDROME was slammed sideways soon after the start, raced off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued
on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the place. NO ILL WILL raced off the pace three wide, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, angled back out in
upper stretch and was along for the show. VICTORY LINE set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, continued
on the left lead in the lane and weakened through the final furlong. MASTER OOGWAY failed to menace while racing two wide. TIO TONY was bumped
soon after the start, raced well back two wide, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. RULE IT played no factor while racing four wide.
SOMNUS was forced out entering the first turn, angled in later on the bend, chased two wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. FABLED PRINCE
was bumped between foes soon after the start, raced three wide and and was never in contention. LOST CITY was up close early, was forced out entering
the first turn, chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. JAY'S DELIGHT fought restraint early, got out and was further checked entering the
first turn, prompted the pace two wide and retreated nearing the quarter pole.
