Footnotes
ALWAYS ROYAL settled in range inside, came through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, took a narrow lead in midstretch, dueled inside of foes and
edged ahead late. MYSTIC SUNRISE lacked speed, saved ground around the first turn, circled four and five wide around the far turn, rallied widest and
gained the place late. LIGHT AND PATH set the pace in the two path, was collared near the eighth pole and fought on between foes. LOVE MAMI LOVE
raced off the early pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, reached near even terms turning for
home but was outkicked between foes in the lane. APPLE LOVER saved ground and failed to menace. EGOZ UNIT was outrun inside. GYMNAST chased
the pace three wide, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and continued to fade. ALGARCA prompted the pace two and three wide and came up empty in
the lane.

Footnotes
TAKE THE PODIUM was in the three path around the first turn and tracked in the four path down the backstretch, was ridden in the five path around the far
turn, bumped with an inner foe while making a bid in the six path at the top of the lane, drew past a pair of inner rivals inside the final furlong and held off a
late charging outer foe to win. STRONG EMBRACE stalked along the inside of rivals around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch,
was coaxed in the three path around the far turn and cued right handed while angling out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place in
the closing stages. TRUE BLUE PEARL traveled in the four path around the first turn and was under a hold while tipping out to the five path into the
backstretch, shifted back into the the four path around the far turn and was cued approaching the quarter pole, made a bid in the five path while bumping
with the outer eventual winner at the top of the lane, and kept on but hung late for show. ZEN (IRE) prompted the pace in the three path, was cued to bid
around the far turn and took the lead while shifting into the two path approaching the quarter pole, was under a drive while floating out to the four path into
the stretch, and dug to the eighth pole, but yielded in the final furlong. BELLA MIURA was fractious in the gate, broke well but was taken back and trailed
along the inside into the backstretch, fanned out around the far turn and was in the eight path going into the stretch, but was no factor. KUKARO was sent
from the gate to set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside approaching the far turn, but gaveway midway around the far turn.

speed between the top two finishers but faded inside around the turn. GLENHOLME failed to menace while racing two wide. CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM

Footnotes
RAVE ON prompted the pace in the four path, was roused to bid approaching the quarter pole, took the lead in the three path in upper stretch, shifted to the
rail while opening up under left handed encouragement passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. ROYAL KITTEN chased in the five path, was driven around
the turn and urged right handed in the seven path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. ANOTHER DUKE stumbled at the start, trailed
along the inside and was under a ride into the turn, tipped out passing the three eighths pole and was in the eight path at the top of the lane, and ran on
down the center to get up for show late. PURE SPEIGHT pressed the pacesetter along the inside into the turn, lost ground and was coaxed approaching the
three eighths pole, shifted out to the six path turning into the stretch, and stayed on under left handed urging, but was caught by an outer foe late to miss
minor rewards. FULTON STREET tracked in the three path, was roused around the turn and tipped out to the five path into the stretch, and was no factor.
ENSIGN PARKER set the pace in the three path, was coaxed in the two path when challenged by an outer foe passing the quarter pole, and gaveway going
into the final furlong. READTHETRANSCRIPT raced from wellback in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
SIENA LADY raced up close along the rail, angled two wide nearing the eighth pole, split rivals to seize command soon after and dug in to repel a
challenge. NEVER (IRE) tracked the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied outside but was held at bay late. HOT FOOT SUSIE raced
off the pace five wide, continued on the left lead in the stretch and rallied for the show. ACE UP HER SLEEVE lagged in the two path, swung seven wide in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. STAKE A CLAIM went evenly while racing two wide. KISS UPON A STAR was off a step slow, raced off the pace three
wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. GRACE CANDY prompted the pace in the three path and weakened through the final furlong.
LIANA B set the pace in the two path, angled to the rail in midstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CATCH bobbled at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn and rated in the four path down the backstretch, was ridden around the far
turn and ranged up to bid from the seven path into the stretch, took the lead approaching the final sixteenth, and drew clear. MR. RIPPLE was in the two
path around the first turn and prompted the pace in the three path into the backstretch, bid passing the three eighths pole and took a narrow lead into the
stretch, was caught by an outer foe nearing the sixteenth pole, and held place. POINT PROVEN stalked in the three path around the first turn and was in the
five path down the backstretch, tipped into the four path around the far turn and was driven to bid from the six path entering the lane, but evened out for
show. RUN CORY RUN tracked along the inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was under a drive while angling out to
the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. DEVIL'S CAY brushed with an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside, was roused when headed
midway around the far turn, dug in under right handed urging in upper stretch, but yielded passing the eighth pole. GAME CHANGE bumped with an inner
foe at the start, raced off the pace outside of rivals in the six path down the backstretch and was no menace.
