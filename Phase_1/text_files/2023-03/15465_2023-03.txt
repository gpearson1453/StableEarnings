Footnotes
BLOW TORCH forwardly placed from the start along the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, outside bid nearing midstretch, kicked clear.
PISTOL OR SHOTGUN broke back, lacked speed for a half, asked along into the stretch while racing toward the inside, angled out a bit and finished up
willingly to be in time for the place. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY away in good order, bumped with the other speed soon after, dueled up front off the inside, held a
narrow advantage through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. LUCKY DUDE off a step slow, raced
back and off the inside, swung out to be five wide turning into the stretch, improved position with some mild late interest. EE YAH broke alertly, exchanged
bumps with MIDNIGHT MAJESTY early, dueled with that same rival for a half along the inside, faltered in the drive. VOBISCUM lacked early foot, five wide
late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. COMMANDER CARL in mid pack while off the inside, four wide late in the turn, fell back into lane. SUITABLE in the
second flight while off the rail, faded.

POINT BLANK forwardly placed from the start, stalked the pace in the three path up the backstretch, ranged up outside the leader to take over into the
stretch, drew steadily clear through the lane. PIZZA CHARLIE prompted the pace along the inside, continued to save ground far turn, came in the two path
for the drive, rallied to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. OUT OF ALCATRAZ settled off the pace along the inside, asked along second turn,
mild interest, up late for the show. MR WORKS broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, set the pace, weakened when headed by the winner turning for
home. MR. WULLY BULLY chased in the two path, faltered in the drive. SUNSIGN lacked early foot, raced in the two path, failed to muster a rally.
STRICKLAND off a step slow, remained always back. RIANTE SKY off a step slow, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON behind the pace along the inside, continued to track the winner into and through upper stretch, switched out with less than a furlong
remaining, roused briskly, up in the final strides. PIONEERING PAPA broke on top narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear when
straightened for home, maintained a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, shortened stride toward the wire, nipped in the final strides while remaining
clear for the place. COLONEL BOWMAN in the second flight while between horses, steadied into the bend, continued to maintain contact with the winner
through the turn, went evenly through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. LT. JUNIOR GRADE in the second group while racing between horses and
three wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch, vanned off after wire. ALEX'S STRIKE last away, trailed up the backstretch, two path turn, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. DRIFTER void of speed well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, lacked a response. FREUDIAN FATE tired
while racing four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY BOURBON unhurried early well out in the strip after dwelling and then breaking sharply outward, four wide into the stretch, outside bid nearing
midstretch, drove clear. ORDER OF MERIT in mid pack toward the inside, two path into the lane, bid between horses and inside the winner past the furlong
marker, could not match strides with that latter rival late, clearly second best. MATTFOLEYVANMAN away in good order, alternated up front for a half in the
two path through some lively fractions, weakened, comfortably saved the show. UPTOWN SOCIAL dueled up front through those lively fractions along the
inside, first to blink into the stretch, continued to weaken to the wire. WORK ALL DAY chased the dueling leaders in the run up the backstretch, began to
retreat before a a half. THINKINGNDRINKING finished early, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
REEF'S DESTINY vied early along the inside, fell back off the two leaders by midway on the turn, moved out, came four wide for the drive, outside, bid, took
over, clear, enough left to hold off the runner up late. MAHOMEY in the second flight early outside, raced four out to five wide turning for home, steadily
gaining on the winner late, narrowly missed, well clear of the others. HERITAGE PARK washy, broke on top, set or forced the pace outside, dueled turn,
could not match the top two through the lane, narrowly lasted for the show. HOLDING PATTERN away in good order, vied between horses up the
backstretch, dueled turn inside, weakened in the drive. OJITOS in mid pack while racing just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, one
paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN off a beat slow, lacked speed while racing three wide, made little impact
through the stretch. OBVIOUSLY TOO off a step slow, trailed early as a result, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ORBITAL STARR
broke through the gate prior to the start, settled in the main body outside, four wide late in the turn, had nothing for the stretch drive. HAMAZING WISDOM
finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ARMAN close from the start after an alert break, pressed the leader from the outside into the turn while a bit washy, put a head in front while getting out
exiting the turn, regained the advantage inside the furlong marker and kicked home with good energy to be edging clear. EASY ACTION away in good
order, showed the way up the backstretch and through most of the turn, was headed turning for home, regained the advantage past the furlong marker after
that rival got out entering the stretch, headed again with less than a furlong remaining, could not match strides with the winner to the wire, clearly second
best. BACKSIDE BUZZ back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide into the stretch, finished up clear of the rest while no threat to the top two.
COFFEE CALIENTE void of speed outside, also came four wide for the drive, improved a bit late by picking off a couple of rivals after the issue had been
decided. G T FIVE HUNDRED in the second flight for three and a half furlongs outside, had little for the drive. AMERICAN OUTLAW off a step slow, moved
up between foes, traffic into the turn, had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK POWDER broke alertly, cleared to the inside into the first turn, rated while setting a soft pace, shook off his nearest pursuer entering the stretch,
stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. STAND PROUD in the two path while racing in the second flight, continued to race within striking distance
into the far turn, called on for some run late in that bend, moved out slightly for the drive and rallied for the second spot. LIFE ON THE NILE pressed the
winner in the two path through the first turn, continued to prompt that one up the backstretch, advanced and lodged a brief bid in the second turn, stalled in
the drive and was caught late for the second spot. BOLZY broke inward, was righted and prompted the pace three wide, continued to race within striking
distance the middle half, lacked a winning response in the drive. MOUNT CRAIG rank while breaking inward and was then pinched back, trailed early as a
result, improved into the lane then flattened out a bit through the lane. ATLANTIC DANCER in tight at the start, moved out and raced back, failed to menace
while remaining off the inside. ONTHESTAGE in the second flight while three wide, scruffed along second turn, tired in the run through the lane. HUMOR
ME NOW popped stall doors prior to the start, broke back, asked a bit in some early traffic, slow to settle, remained well back throughout.

Footnotes
MAJOR BLUE broke well, dueled up front off the inside, salted away the other speed when straightened for home, held the runner up at bay in the final
furlong under steady handling. WILD MULE in the second flight while racing inside through the turn, eased out a bit for the drive, closest to the winner in
upper stretch, could do little more with that one the final furlong, well clear of the rest. TOO MUCH INFO within striking distance outside, four wide through
the turn, along for the show late while not a threat to the top two. TIVY asked for some run after breaking with the leaders, maintained inside position and
dueled through the turn with the winner, weakened in upper stretch, caught late for the show. LIL SWEET THANG last to leave, trailed early, four wide
through the turn, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. WARREN L back off the pace, steered out four wide turning for home, lacked a significant
closing response while remaining out in the strip. JEREMY'S JET close up early off the inside, got out a bit and steadied early in the turn, fell back and
continued to fade through the lane. SCATAMARAN back off the pace and the inside, slight bother when JEREMY'S JET got out a bit early in the turn, four
wide, angled inside, backed up.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR outrun in the early going well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting when beginning to rally, closed with good resolve in a
well measured ride to prove best. PEACE DOG behind the pace inside, saved ground turn, asked to run late in the bend, moved out a bit and finished
willingly between horses to earn the place. BETTYS CASH broke sharp, soon clear, extended that advantage through the turn, continued to show the way
by daylight past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going, narrowly salvaged the show. DATA STORM broke back brushed in some early traffic, moved
closer into the turn, saw that progress stall in traffic early in the turn, three wide midway on the turn then dropped inside, some late interest, not enough for
the show. MACHO ROCCO away in good order, chased the leader up the backstretch from the outside, continued to race closest to that one turn, gradually
weakened through the stretch,. STOMPING HOTROD in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the turn, continued to race one paced through the lane
to finish up evenly. ASPEN CLUB jostled back to trail early from tight quarters, moved out, raced four to five wide through the bend, improved position down
the stretch while widest in the drive. AFLEET SKY lacked speed out in the strip, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a closing response. TOPF
ROAD RULES back off the pace inside, steered out around a troubled rival late in the turn, went evenly through the lane after recovering. CLASSY SOCKS
back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, tired. WESTHEIMER STREET off a step slow, raced well back off the pace three wide, not
involved. MIRI A COINCIDENCE broke out into a lane vacated by WESTHEIMER STREET, was quickly straightened to race forwardly for a half, was tiring
when steadied late in the turn, continued to back up through the stretch.
