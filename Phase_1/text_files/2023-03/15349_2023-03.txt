MOUNT OLYMPIC sent to a clear lead, continued clear along the turn and into the lane, entered lane in the clear, shortened stride late and just held.
SHARP WARNING bumped inside rival at the start, settled off the pace as usual, stayed off the rail on the turn, found a seam in between horses in upper
stretch and rallied well. MONGOLIAN BOX broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save
ground on the turn, launched bid along the rail in the stretch, angled out late and outclosed by outside rival. ROUGH RIDE bumped around at the start,
asked for speed and settled into a chasing position off the rail, entered lane in range and outfinished by closing rivals. JAY BOY settled well off the pace
three wide on the backstretch, continued wide on the turn and mildly gain in the lane while in the five path.
