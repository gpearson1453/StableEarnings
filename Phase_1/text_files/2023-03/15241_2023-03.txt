Footnotes
LIAM'S CHAMP went to the front, set the pace with company to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside of a foe on the turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, inched clear under a left-handed crop into the final furlong and held under strong
urging. GIFTED tracked then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the
winner while outside in the final furlong and gained gradually to get the place. PITCH CLOCK had her saddle adjusted behind the gate, bumped with a rival
at the break, prompted the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the three path around the turn, was asked just inside the five-sixteenths, turned into
upper stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead late and was outfinished then
caught for the place while clear for the show. TRYINMYHEARTOUT bumped with a foe at the start and was taken up badly, spotted the front several
lengths, settled at the rear, was urged in the two path around the turn, was driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ACCEL ROSE was
coaxed along on the inside then dropped back under stronger urging late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
VICTORY WAY was rated just off the pace, came under urging while wanting to move up approaching the five-eighths but had the hole closed by a rival,
continued just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide while asked later on that bend, rallied to the lead into upper stretch,
shook clear into the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. TREATY OBLIGATION bumped soundly with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on
the outside, moved in while asked to pick it up outside the five-eighths while trying to keep VICTORY WAY behind horses, turned up the pressure in the two
path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, battled between foes under a drive in upper stretch, switched out after dropping
behind the winner at the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. LIGHT THE WAY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was
coaxed to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for the show. GOOD RAPPORT broke out and bumped with an
opponent, settled off the pace, was clipped behind by WHENLOVETAKESOVER approaching the five-eighths, moved out behind horses near the
nine-sixteenths, was roused four then five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong
marker then swapped to the proper lead while dropping back and weakened. WHENLOVETAKESOVER settled off the pace, tossed his head outside the
five-eighths then clipped heels with GOOD RAPPORT and stumbled, dropped back late on the backstretch, traveled three wide around the turn and was no
factor. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES climbed greenly into the kickback early then dropped back, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed
to threaten. GOTTA CONNECT broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then five wide around the turn,
dropped back late on that bend and capitulated.

MARKET ALERT was asked for speed leaving the gate, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, extended the advantage into upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best while
kept to the task under light urging. UNCLE MOONLIGHT brushed with a rival at the start, settled at the rear, angled out leaving the chute, raced on the far
outside, was roused five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place. KINETIC SKY tracked the pace on the inside
of a rival, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the three path through the turn and tired while able to get the show. FAMISHED tracked the
pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn and capitulated. MILTON THE MONSTER was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger
encouragement midway down the backstretch, dropped back inside around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then angled out and had nothing
left.

on the turn, shook clear approaching the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong but was overtaken before
the sixteenth-pole while able to get the place. CAPELLA came inward at the start while hustled, was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was given her cue inside the three--eighths, pursued the top two in the stretch and kept on with good courage to get the show.
ZIAERATI was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back late on that
bend, came out into upper stretch and tired. LA VITA SOFIA bumped with a rival at the start, was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the two path
while between foes on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT was carried in at the start then

ADVANCED STRATEGY was hustled from the gate, settled comfortably on the outside, was roused leaving the backstretch, went four wide while ridden
along on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, moved clear into the final sixteenth then was
eased up while much the best. OPTIC WAY broke well and went straight to the front, showed the way under some pressure, moved clear near the
nine-sixteenths, drew off in the two path on the turn, shortened stride under a drive in upper stretch and was overtaken while able to get the place. CAERUS
settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path under urging around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and improved for the show. MY
FRIENDS BEER was hustled from the gate, raced up close under coaxing, chased the leader late on the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the
two path then dropped to the rail, came out into the stretch and tired. MOUNT TRAVERS was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside,
dropped back with five furlongs to run, went three wide around most of the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. JALEN
JOURNEY was urged along on the outside, dropped in late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
failed to respond. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS dropped well behind under urging while void of speed, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no
factor. IT'S MANDATORY settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went four then five wide around the turn, came seven wide into the
stretch and showed little.

SIGNAL CORPS moved up after the start then chased the pace on the outside, went five to six wide around the turn, gained under a drive in upper stretch,
took the lead into the final furlong then kicked clear and was eased up late while much the best. RUNANDSCORE bumped with a rival at the start, dropped
back under urging, went around the turn in the two path, was guided out inside the furlong marker and improved to just get the place. DISARMED went to
the front, showed the way under pressure, was asked in the two to three path on the turn, led under a drive into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner into the final furlong and proved no match then just lost the place while clear for the show. RUSSI showed speed between horses then pressed the
pace, chased in the three to four path around the turn and weakened. MAKAR veered in and hit the gate, moved out while urged early then was taken in
hand behind the pacesetter, raced inside to the two path on the turn, made a bid inside the pacesetter inside the three-eighths, dropped back under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. FORTY ONE TALES bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, angled in towards the rail early, saved ground
on the turn, came off the rail in the stretch, had the rider fumble his crop in the final sixteenth and failed to threaten. WOODSIDE WARRIOR stumbled after
the start, was urged along on the outside, lost action some while green into kickback near the half-mile pole, went five wide around the turn and was no
factor. POP COYER showed speed on the outside of two foes then pressed the pace, chased in the four to five path around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
ROYAL TRYST showed no speed while hard ridden on the outside, went four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the
final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final stride. HANDSOME CAT settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, came out into the
stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong, took the advantage into the final sixteenth, led to the final stride but was denied while able to get the place.
JAKE ROCKS was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into the final sixteenth
and finished well to just get the show. IKIGAI broke very fast then was sent hard, showed the way with a clear advantage, traveled inside around the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just lost the show.
ROTKNEE was unsettled in the gate, chased the pace on the inside of a rival, rounded the turn in the two path, pursued the leader into the final furlong and
was out-kicked then just missed the show. PRESSURE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around, came out into upper stretch and
weakened. WINTER SON was off a step slow then showed no speed under urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch

Footnotes
LITTLE VIC chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, inched clear into the final
furlong and held under steady urging. RUNNINSONOFAGUN was well placed down the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, came out
five wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and narrowly earned the place. NAKATOMI brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace,
was urged along late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, chased outside while remaining on his
inside lead into until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. EASTERN
BAY settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and just missed the
show. PIRATE RICK broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, went four then five wide around the turn, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DRAFTED was bumped at the start then dropped back while in tight between foes, raced at the
rear under urging, went two then three wide around the turn, swung eight wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed to
threaten. WENDELL FONG was last to commence, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. CHATEAU went to the front, moved clear outside the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, lost the advantage to the
winner into upper stretch and faltered then was eased late.

RAISE CAIN settled off the pace, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, went three wide early on the turn then dropped in, checked off heels while gaining
outside the quarter-pole, swung out four wide into upper stretch, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker, remained on his inside lead until until just
before the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and drew clear under steady urging. SLIP MAHONEY was off slow and spotted the front several
lengths, raced at the rear, went four to five wide early on the turn, angled eight wide late on that bend, came nine wide into the stretch and was along for the
place. GENERAL BANKER broke in and bumped lightly with a rival, moved out early while off the pace, went three to four wide early on the turn, angled
seven wide late on that bend, came eight wide into the stretch and improved for the show. EYEING CLOVER showed speed between horses then dropped
just off the pace, chased three then four wide around the turn, led under a drive into upper stretch but weakened then was caught for the show. CLEAR THE
AIR settled off the pace, was urged in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then paused in tight off heels at the three-sixteenths,
moved in some in the final furlong and failed to rally. MR. SWAGGER bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved out outside the
five-eighths then bumped with an opponent, dropped in to save ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. LUGAN KNIGHT was urged along off
the pace, steadied between horses leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. CARMEL ROAD
bumped with a rivals at the start, disputed the pace, vied inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path behind the loose horse, dropped back in
upper stretch and also weakened. RADIO RED was hustled from the gate then forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide around the turn, spun
seven wide into the stretch and came up empty. TRANSECT angled out while off the pace, went six wide around the turn, dropped in some in the stretch
and was no factor. RECRUITER showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path around the turn, dropped back five
wide into upper stretch and tired. UNCORRELATED bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, bumped with a rival outside the
five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. CLUBHOUSE was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch,
raced inside early on the turn then moved well out in the track and faltered. HOWGREATISNATE stumbled badly at the start and unseated the rider.

Footnotes
BRACIOLE bumped with foes after the start then was taken up between horses, raced at the rear under strong urging, went four wide around the turn, came
six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. VICTORIOUS WAVE bumped
with a rival at the start, was urged early then settled off the pace, moved out around the nine-sixteenths, traveled four wide around the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole but missed while up for the place. MIDNIGHT WORKER
chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished then lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. MOTION TO STRIKE broke in and bumped with a foe, moved in while going clear
early, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and missed the
trifecta. CALLALOO was urged along towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path and finished well but reached his best stride too late. KING
JAMES bumped with a foe at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn and tired. CHARLIE FIVE O bumped with an
opponent at the start, chased the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, pursued the leader into the final furlong, moved out in the vicinity of the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. BOURBON READY bumped with a foe after the start then was taken in hand, moved out while off the pace, went
five wide around the turn, was driven seven widee into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PINE VALLEY settled under some urging, went two
then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally.
