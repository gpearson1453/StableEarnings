Footnotes
NEBRASKA RED chased the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide in the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling.
SEGOVIANA dueled for the early lead from the outside of rival, had a clear lead near the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second
best. TRICKY MOM was forced in tight at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, advanced towards the leaders through the far turn
and made a good late rally while racing four wide to wide. HOT CAVIAR was hustled from the inside, raced three wide between in the drive and had not
enough. LOT'SA SILVER dueled for the early lead along the rail and gave way.

Footnotes
JUDGE'S BRIBE hesitated at the break, pulled early, took command and drew off in the drive to be well clear under strong handling. PAISANO JIM showed
good early foot but was no match for the winner while racing two wide. HUSKER LEGACY stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the far turn into
the stretch and kept on for third. CHIEF TY HE raced off the early pace, was four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. PRINCE B dropped back
to race mid pack and failed to respond. P R WHY NOT settled off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. DIAMANTE
JOSE showed little.
