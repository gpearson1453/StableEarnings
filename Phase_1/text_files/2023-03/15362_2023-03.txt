SMOOCHER unhurried early, closed willingly in the six path through the stretch, made the lead near the sixteenth marker proved best by a narrow margin
while fully extended. THE GOSPEL OF MARK trailed for a half while racing widest of all, rallied determinedly through deep stretch in the seven path and just
missed. MIXTER JENSEN took the lead nearing the five furlong marker in the six path, drew off before the far turn, set the pace until deep stretch then was
outfinished. ANIMO ROBERTO failed to menace. PLAYING BALL away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the five path for a little over a quarter mile, chased
theleader into the far turn then weakened. LITTLE RONS ROCKET well placed, gave way in the stretch.

was along in time under a strong hand ride. MYRRH away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. DARK TEMPTRESS was
a forward factor from the start, offered a strong bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. LITTLE BIRD FLASH trailed into the stretch then
found his best stride late three wide. TARA DAWN failed to menace. I GOT HOPE was no threat. HEIDI T inside, failed to respond.
DONTLOSETHATNUMBER bore out at the start, stalked the pace three deep into the stretch then gave way late.

Footnotes
BEAV'S BOO forwardly placed, closed willingly four wide through the far turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under a brisk hand ride.
PERFECTINGTHEVIEW stalked the pace into the far turn, dropped back a bit then came on again three wide and finished second best. WINDY LU WHO
away alertly, set a pressed pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. BLAZING ZENNA never far back, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch
then failed to sustain that bid. INCESSANT pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. SHE'S CRAFTY was no factor. AUNT BEE was no
threat. BACKSPLASH was through after a half.
