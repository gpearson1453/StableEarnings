Footnotes
JUBA'S HOUSE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn outside then lugged in through the stretch and got up the
final strides. ALL WORKED UP was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was
caught in the final strides. CHURCH KEY chased inside and raced near the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn, steadied lightly mid-stretch and was
shuffled back from between the top two in late yards. BESTLA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, altered course toward
the outside mid-stretch and finished strong. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. REVEIRS
MINUTE chased through the backstretch, raced in the two and three paths of the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MODELO RUBIA saved
ground.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SALLY rated a slim lead inside, dueled Weavinyouinthedust from the three eighths pole and drew clear of that one toward the five sixteenths, was
met by JUJU ON DA BEAT and dueled at mostly even terms nearest the rail, dug in determinedly leaving the turn and kept a head in front. The latter was
rated close inside on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely to the
wire. SUNSET QUEEN settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, then flattened in the lane.
BANK CARD saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was steadied in tight at the rail midway on the far turn but came back to
finish evenly. AFLEET PENGUIN rated close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far
turn. WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST raced with the pace two deep, dueled leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and
weakened on the far turn. XALTINGRUN rounded the opening turn about the four path and never factored. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of
foul against the rider of Sunset Queen for alleged interference on the far turn, lodged by the rider of Bank Card.

GREAT SPIRIT pressured the pace and contested even terms two deep leaving the quarter pole, dug in determinedly through the stretch and inched ahead
of STRYDA through the final yards. The latter set a pressured pace inside, was met at even terms leaving the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail
and dug in gamely through the lane, though, reluctantly ceded late yards. KEEP ON SPURRIN gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the
turn and dug in for third nearing mid-stretch. LUCKY BLONDE came away a bit awkwardly and steadied leaving the chute, picked up the chase toward the
outside, rounded the turn two deep and ran evenly in the lane. LA MADDALENA chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail but drifted into the lane and
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and showed
little in the lane. Lucky Bop ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
JALEBI BABY took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. IRISH SAMURAI became a bit anxious in the gate and rated close inside on the first
turn, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested the far turn still three wide and dueled for a clear second nearing the sixteenth pole.
LADY WHISTLEDOWN broke outward and made contact with Fort Zanna then rated close in the three and four paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and came along for third later yards. CHANNEL SCENT steadied early and raced well off the pace inside, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled six wide on the far turn and passed rivals in an even finish. KOBE'S GIRL stalked the pace two deep, challenged
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn, but flattened inside the eighth pole.
FORT ZANNA was bumped outward and into Uptown Belle leaving the gate, raced well back on the opening turn and never factored. PRETTY
SPECTACULAR rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far
turn. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER was not a factor. ULTIMATE BREEZE raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response. UPTOWN BELLE was
bumped leaving the gate then saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
BEST VIRGINIA accelerated to the lead at the three quarter pole and angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane but immediately recovered the advantage and dueled clear later yards.
PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS was bumped leaving the gate then rated close inside, challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail
on the far turn, took a brief slim lead entering the stretch but relented past the eighth pole and flattened inside the sixteenth. APPEALING ROAD rated close
off the rail on the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third later yards. I
SHALLBE RELEASED rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three
path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MAY MAYS CASTLE bore in and made contact with Pettyforurthoughts leaving the gate then settled in the
three path of the opening turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but flattened leaving the eighth pole. ALLI
BOBBY rounded the first turn in the four path, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved

Footnotes
DULINI rounded the opening turn in the five path, started a bid into the backstretch and steadily progressed from that point, rounded the far turn near the
rail, got up for the lead between horses mid-stretch and held on well. WHY LEA rounded the first turn in the four path, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, dueled through the stretch and took second late yards. SHADES OF BLUE rated off the early
pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn then
outfinished for second in late yards. I'M SO EXTRA tapered in and took over at the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching
the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. CAN'T FIGURE became extremely fractious and
sat in the gate, rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened
in the lane. REGGAETONI saved ground racing well back, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the six and seven paths and passed rivals outside. UNBRIDLED IRISH raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
then flattened off the rail on the far turn. DAPPLESANDDIAMONDS rounded the first turn in the six path, left the turn outside and showed little response.
MAKO MISS stalked the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. JO AMY became extremely
fractious and sat in the gate, raced in the three path the first turn, never factored and was eased leaving the far turn.
