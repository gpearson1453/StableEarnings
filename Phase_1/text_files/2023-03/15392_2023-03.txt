Footnotes
KALIK tracked in the two path early, tipped out to the four path and was roused around the far turn, took aim from the six path into the stretch, was rallying
while tipping slightly inwards through the stretch, got bumped by an inner foe while closing in near the finish, but got up on the wire to win. CUMBERLAND
set the pace inside of rivals just off the rail around the two path, was coaxed into the far turn and under a ride while floating out to the four path at the top of
the lane, dug in but veered out twice in the final furlong bumping an outer foe, but was nailed by that foe on the wire to place. HARDY CHOICE broke out
and brushed with an outer foe, was steadied midway around the first turn while between foes in the three path and was wellback in the two path down the
backside, was roused while tipping out passing the quarter pole and was in the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. FORGE IN FIRE was out
in the five path around the first turn and trailed in the four path down the backstretch, was driven from the six path turning into the stretch, but finished
evenly. LEFTEMBEHIND brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, was under rousing around the far turn and urged from
the eighth path at the top of the lane, lugged in in upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. WIMHOF settled in midfield around the two path, lost
ground along the rail rounding the far turn, was short of room turning into the lane and angled out to the five path, but was unable to factor. CERTAIN
prompted the pace in the three path but faded in the stretch. ODE TO WAR chased around the four path but never threatened. AMERICA'S GUEST stalked
around the three path early but yielded turning into the lane. WINDSOR PARK raced in midpack around the three path but was never a menace. NO
CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE STRETCH RUN,

SIN FOR A SEASON pressed the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and dug in to repel PRINCIPIA's
late bid. PRINCIPIA settled off the pace while racing three wide, tipped out in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. MAMA MARIA broke out and
bumped CONFER at the start, set the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. SASSY BUT PRECIOUS chased the pace two wide and lacked the
needed rally. CECILIA'S WINGS prompted the pace four wide, reached near even terms near the three-eights pole and tired in the lane. CONFER was
bumped at the start, advanced at the rail around the turn but came up empty in the lane.

FAMOUS GENT chased in the five path, was ridden around the turn and in the six path at the top of the lane, and rallied past an inner quartet in the final
furlong to win. HEYMACKIT'SJACK was bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe leaving the gate, tracked under a hold in the three path, was patiently
ridden in the two path rounding the turn and was cued in the three path at the top of the stretch, and ran on between foes passing the eighth pole to place.
NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) prompted the pace in the five path, loomed in the four path rounding the turn and was roused to bid from the five path entering the
stretch, and kept on but was outrun on both sides late to finish with show. BELLA FUTURE stalked in the four path, was stymied turning into the lane,
angled out to the seven path into the final furlong to find clear running room, and stayed on but missed minor rewards. INEVTABL CONECTION pressed in
the three path, bid passing the quarter pole and was roused into the stretch, but faded between foes. RUGGED UNION broke in and bumped an inner foe
but was sent to set the early pace along the inside, was under coaxing around the turn and in the two path at the top of the lane, but gaveway passing the

FATHER DELAY stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off handily. SOLOMONS GOLD settled off the pace
while racing three and four wide and ran on for the place. EVENTFUL raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. SOUND DOCTRINE
dropped far back while racing greenly early, went four wide around the turn and improved position in the lane. SUPER UNISON pressed the pace two wide
and tired in the lane. W. P. CADET chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. SPANISH FURY had a shoe repair in the paddock, set the pace
along the rail and retreated after a half. NOBLE TIGER had only brief speed inside.

BETH'S DREAM stalked out in the center of the course early and tipped into the six path into the turn, bid in hand from the four path midturn and took
command passing the quarter pole, opened up rapidly from the five path into the stretch under confident handling and was much the best. SOUL OF AN
ANGEL raced wellback in the four path into the turn, was coaxed in the two path around the turn and tipped back out to the four path into the lane, drifted
out after left handed cues passing the eighth pole, but kept on to secure place. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) tracked outside the eventual winner in the center of
the course early and tipped inwards to the seven path into the turn, was under a ride in the five path midway around the turn, got floated out to the seven
path in upper stretch, and flattened out, but held show. ROSE E HOLIDAY was behind along the rail into the turn and never threatened from the three path
in the stretch. MUSIC CITY STAR set the pace in the five path, was roused in the two path around the turn, surrendered the lead nearing the quarter pole,
and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
EXACT ESTIMATE settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over in midstretch, drifted out under
left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole and held safe. OGLETHORPE bumped DR KRINGLE at the start, raced off the pace three wide, tipped further out
in upper stretch, closed outside while switching leads back and forth several times, was herded out by the winner near the sixteenth pole and settled for
second best. HAPPY RUNNER set the early pace along the rail, rated back when RACKET became intent on the lead late on the first turn, stalked inside
down the backstretch, made light contact with the rail entering the far turn, tipped two wide midway around the bend, took the lead in upper stretch, lugged
in throughout the stretch and just lasted for the show. ORTUS saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. DR KRINGLE was off slow then bumped,
raced well back two wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and had a mild gain widest. MOST WANTED MAN saved ground off the pace, went three wide
around the far turn and never threatened. LEVITY saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and made little impact. RACKET hit the
starting gate, advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn, led to
the quarter pole and gave way. MEMORIES R MAGIC had early speed two wide and retreated three wide around the far turn.

TREVESS steadied early, tracked in the four path, loomed up rounding the turn and was roused to bid while floating out to the six path into the lane, swept
to the lead passing the eighth pole, and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off an inner foe late. DESIGNED BY KITTEN broke outward leaving the
gate, stalked under a hold in the two path, was stymied and had to wait for room inside of foes from the two path rounding the turn, was coaxed thru an
opening between in the three path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. FOXY LADY chased in the two path, tipped out and ranged up under coaxing
around the turn, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. MERCURY HEAD prompted the pace in the three path, bid while under a
ride between foes passing the quarter pole and was in the four path entering the lane, but flattened passing the eighth pole. HAY HAY PAULA had a
hesitant start, trailed in the three path into the turn but failed to threaten from around the five path in the stretch. LOVIN MAKES CENTS set the pace in the
two path, was under rousing passing the quarter pole and yielded passing the eighth pole.

Footnotes
MASTEROFTHESENATE settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained through the lane and was up
late. SKI PATROL raced in range three wide, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner and gained the place late. MY
SEA COTTAGE (IRE) set the pace two wide around the first turn, opened up a sizable lead down the backstretch, remained clear at the rail around the far
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. GROUP HUG raced well back two and three wide, angled further out in upper stretch
and rallied belatedly. CHASING RAINBOWS had early speed inside, rated back and angled into the two path midway around the first turn, chased in the
clear down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane. ROYAL SPIRIT saved ground and failed to menace.
ROCKSTAR RO played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S STORM set the pace in the two path, was roused while being challenged by a pair of outer foes approaching the quarter pole, floated out to the
five path into the lane, stayed on thru the lane, was cued right handed into the final furlong, and turned away an outer challenger passing the sixteenth pole
to draw clear. MUGURUZA chased from the six path into the turn, ranged up under confident handling around the turn and was coaxed to bid from the
seven path into the stretch, ran on to sustain that bid into the final furlong but was repelled passing the sixteenth pole to place. DEMURELY pressed in the
four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn and was under a heavy drive between foes while being floated out to the six path into the lane, evened out
passing the eighth pole, but held show. MUDSHAFT rated from the six path into the turn, was roused around the turn and in the eight path going into the
stretch, finished evenly but was no factor. ADIOS DIXIE bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, prompted the leading duo in the three path, was urged
right handed in the four path turning into the stretch, but flattened. SADE PURSE raced wellback along the rail and was no factor. BALI BABY bumped with
an inner foe leaving the gate, tracked in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but never threatened from the five path in the stretch.
QUEEN CUPID trailed from the three path into the turn and was never involved from the six path in the stretch. POLITELY CROWNED raced off the pace in
the four path but never menaced.
