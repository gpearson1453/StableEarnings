Footnotes
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was three wide early while being rated off the leader, moved up at bit after the three eighths pole, matched strides with the leader
leaving the turn and drew off. SERMONONTHEMOUNT set the pace, was challenged at the quarter pole, dug in and raced gamely but was second best
today. TIO BLAS settled in hands mid pack early, starting building momentum at the half mile pole from the five path, continued to gain ground through the
turn while still being five wide, was within striking distance at the quarter pole, raced four wide in the lane, struggled to switch leads and finished flat. COLOR
FAST raced off the pace, was asked around the half mile marker, made one run while racing wide and came up short. THE GRAY BLUR raced along the
rail while being well off the pace and was no factor.

Footnotes
BINDING AGREEMENT chased the top trio from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, drifted to the six path while
taking aim, sustained a grinding charge to bid in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. HALF AGAIN prompted the pace outside of the leader,
pressed between horses around the turn, bid turning for home sparking a duel with his inner counterpart, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds,
drew clear before an outer BINDING AGREEMENT inched closer in the final sixteenth, and was caught late. COACH KENNY settled off of the pace in the
five path around the turn, and rallied willingly while hanging on his left lead. GOLD MERRITT rushed forward after breaking half a beat slow to dispute the
pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressers while in the two path around the turn, resisted his most immediate rival's bid turning for home,
but was headed at the furlong grounds, and gave way. ZION lacked speed two wide and between horses, but retreated to last entering the turn, and never
got involved while surpassing tired rivals late. MUCHO MARVIN broke a bit outwardly at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, pressed them from the four
path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane. FLASHY BREW saved ground towards the rear around the turn, but to no avail.

pressure from rivals on the inside and just behind him, started to launch a bid in the second turn repelled an inside challenger at the five sixteenths pole,
shifted out at the eighth pole and secured the victory. PATH TO SUCCESS was five wide going into the first turn, settled in hands just off the leader, stayed
wide into the second turn, launched an attack coming out of the second turn and was in full force while still being wide in the lane, had aim on the wire and
was closing well but didn't have enough, ran gamely and was up for second. SUMMER LOVER was off slow, moved up in between horses leaving the first
tun from the three and four path, shifted down to the rail saving ground through the second turn, shifted out at the top of the lane but ran even.
GLUCKSTADT was up front early secured the rail, had pressure from the outside, attended the pace until the quarter pole, struggled to switch leads and
gave way late. KLIMTOMANIAC was off slow, was allowed to find his stride, while saving ground starting gaining ground at the five eighths pole, shifted out
to pass another rival in the second turn, shifted back to the inside coming out of the turn was able to travel up the rail while closing but tired late. LITTLE

Footnotes
HELAIRE tracked four wide, rallied entering the lane to drive past the leaders in upper stretch, and kicked away through the final furlong. GEORGE ALLEN
set the pace inside of a pair of pressers around the turn, shook free of them before proving no match for an outer bidder nearing the furlong grounds, and
lasted for place to the wire. IRON IN THE FIRE chased along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, and stayed on in the late stages, but ran out of
ground to achieve place. TWO B shied mildly from crowded quarters when an outer rival shifted across his path early on, shifted out and stalked outside of
the top pair, moved forward to press them nearing the turn, but hung on her left lead while failing to keep pace with the leader and getting outkicked by an
outer bidder in upper stretch, and yielded. DREWMAZING pressed two wide and from between horses into the turn, but gave way turning for home.
HOLIDAY DIAMOND was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
WUPKAR took a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked from behind the top pair while a path off of the rail around the turn, shifted outside of them
nearing the lane, took aim from the five path at the quarter pole, offered a good kick to drive clear of inner rivals in upper stretch, and drew off under hand
urging. GIGABLAST was fractious in the post parade, then was kept from warming up pre-race, lacked speed in the two path despite rider's urging into the
turn, then sustained a rail rally through the final furlong to reach place leaving the sixteenth pole. G'S SQUEEZE tracked from midpack in the three path,
inched closer to be between horses entering the lane, shifted out while chasing in midstretch, and stayed on to reach show late. LAKE MARIE rushed
between horses after bumping an inner rival while off flat-footed at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside, shook free entering the lane, but offered
little resistance to an outer bidder in upper stretch, lost place to an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, and yielded. SERIOUSLY SAM took a mild brush from an
inner rival soon after the start, trailed along the inside, and improved coming to midstretch. SEE SASSY RUN lacked speed in the four path, altered course
outwardly in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. LA FEME JOLIE chased outside of the top pair and from the four path, but weakened in the five path entering
the lane. SUMITUP dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ESCAPOLOGIST tracked along the inside, pursued patiently from the pocket around the far turn, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch, bid along with
an outer foe at the furlong grounds, dueled with that foe into the final sixteenth, and prevailed. CAROOM bobbled while taking a bump from an outer rival
leaving the gates, trailed two wide into the first turn, gained quickly in the three path around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, sustained his
charge while shifting inwardly and across foes as he hung on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over before producing a bid for the lead at the furlong
grounds, sparred with a rail bidder through the late stages, but was bested. MONJID set the pace along the inside, shook free of outer pressers entering the
lane, shifted out before meeting bids approaching the furlong grounds, but was quickly outkicked by rivals on either side leaving that station, and held show.
SOLOMON VANDY pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but yielded in upper stretch, and saved a minor share from a pair of outer rivals in the
closing stages. MCGOLDEN bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, but gave way between horses approaching
midstretch. MO TIME AT ALL brushed the inner part of the gate while coming out a step slow, tracked in the three path while pulling behind the leaders
through the lane for the first time, settled into stride down the backstretch, tipped four wide while between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked while
hanging on his left lead, and lacked a bid thereafter. CIVILRIGHTSLEGEND leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, and never got involved.
ICE AXE leaned in at the start and broke a step slow, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
MUCHO MACHO GIRL rushed forward after breaking a step slow, dueled for the lead two wide and among foes, inched clear at the three sixteenths pole,
and held sway from a chasing foe through the final furlong. GOING THE DISTANCE pressed four wide, ranged up three wide turning for home to attempt a
bid in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader at the three sixteenths pole, and chased that foe home well through the final furlong.
SANDRA D bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid close up along the inside, sat the pocket around the turn, but searched for racing room while
pursuing behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped out three wide at the furlong pole, and chased evenly. GENEROUS LOVER bobbled before bumping
with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, shifted out leaving the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid. THE PRINCESS
SAYS broke slowly before bumping with rivals on either side at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, took a bump from an outer rival nearing the
turn, encountered traffic in upper stretch before tipping four wide approaching midstretch, and chased. ARMY KITTEN broke slow, bumped with an outer foe
before being put to tight quarters at the start, trailed in the two path into the turn, shifted out turning for home before fanning to the seven path in upper
stretch, and moved up. MISS ARLINGTON pursued from midpack in the four to five paths, chased while being floated outwardly approaching midstretch,
and tried. L J'S EMMA dueled for the along the inside, and weakened at the three sixteenths pole. ART DECO bumped the gate while losing balance and
breaking slowly at the start, lacked speed two wide, bumped an inner rival and steadied nearing the turn, and was outrun thereafter. CURLIN SERENADE
vied three wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position with three furlongs to go, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
INFINITESIMAL was bumped and bothered by an outer foe causing him to bump an inner rival at the start, steadied from between horses passing the
fifteen-sixteenths pole, raced rank into the first turn before settling along the inside, improved inside of foes nearing the far turn, took aim outside of the new
leader before bidding with five sixteenths to go, and drove clear in upper stretch. ST PIERRE bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack
in the two path, chased the leaders from the four path around the far turn, and sustained stride through the lane to gain place with a sixteenth to go. TSURIS
took a bump from outer foes at the start, stalked along the inside, slipped through with seven sixteenths to go to show the way into the far turn, et an outer
rival's bid around that bend, proved no match entering the lane, and gave way. MINE YOUR BIZ tracked three wide, chased from the six path around the far
turn, and kept on while hanging on his left lead. RONALDS GATSBY settled off of the pace in the four path, tucked and saved ground around the far turn,
improved to claim fourth turning for home, and flattened out. ELIEZER pursued from midpack in the four to six paths, and made little impact. HENNY'S
TURN got antsy just before the gates sprung, laid off of the pace while hung in the five to seven paths around the turns, and faded. LIT A SHUCK stumbled
and bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace off of the rail, got headed by an inner bidder nearing the far turn, and weakened in the five path around
that bend. ASTROLOGY WONOWON was reluctant to load, bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide, but weakened between horses
entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane. TUCKER THE GRUMP showed little before easing through the lane.
