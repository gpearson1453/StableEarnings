CHANTRY FLATS in tight first turn, inside to far turn, edged out for a clear path to finish full of run in a good effort. BEAR OAK tracked leader to the half,
took over into far turn while all out in the stretch run but nailed on wire. BLESS THE KITTEN unhurried to far turn, rallied wide past the quarter pole and ran
on evenly in the stretch run for show spot. PROTONIC POWER lagged back to far turn, ran on in the stretch to improve position late. SOARING BIRD
forced five wide first turn, angled to rail at the half with no gain in the stretch while evenly to the wire. NILES CHANNEL speed to the front, stayed to the half
with nothing left from there. ARTIE'S LADY inside run while close up to far turn and gave way readily thereafter. ARGENTELLO (IRE) had an awkward start

Footnotes
DARK SIDE (IRE) never far back, skimming the rail around the far turn to the stretch, got the opening needed, responded to urging and cleared in lane with
a perfect trip to the wire to hang on. ROYAL SANDRIN never far back, swept five wide into the stretch kept on in the final sixteenth but too late with a game
effort. MY BOY TONY outside route to the lead, stayed game into the stretch between horses but weakened in the final seventy yards with a game effort.
AUGUSTUS BLUE crossed over to the rail, dueled early on but stayed on in the late stages for the super. IM A MODEST MAN good position to far turn,
shuffled back and leveled off. KING OF KENTUCKY rank into first turn inside, three wide outside quarter pole faded back in the stretch run. PERFECT
UPSTART unhurried early, off rail with a bid far turn, faltered stretch. LE COOP showed no speed and never menaced throughout. LAZARUS never
factored. STORMIN MIDNIGHT mid pack to the half with a steady retreat from the far turn.
