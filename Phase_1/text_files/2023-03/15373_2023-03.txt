Footnotes
SAN COSTANTINO tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the four path around the turn and in upper stretch and edged clear
late. CHARGING AERO pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and could not
stay with the winner near the wire. THE BIG CALICO led the way between horses early, dueled from the two path around the turn, was caught in midstretch
and kept on to the finish. MY MAN VITO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the five path
and improved position in the lane. ROGER MCQUEEN hit the gate leaving it, recovered to chase the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. AERONAUT stalked the pace setters between horses through the opening stages, came around
the turn in the three path and weakened in the lane. BLAKENSTEIN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
showed no kick. ASTRONAUT OSCAR raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the four path and faded in the lane.

CALL ME ICE MAN stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the
lane. SENTIR ZULIANO veered out leaving the gate, recovered to chase the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
four path and chased the winner home in the stretch. BRIGHT FORECAST bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace in the
early going, raced in the three path around the bend and improved position in the stretch. AZTEC LEGEND was reluctant to load, broke well and led the
field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DAWGMENTALITY tracked the leaders
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and faded in the lane. TIZ A BEAST bumped with the horse to his
outside and steadied at the break, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. STARSTRUCK NOTION
raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the bend in the two path and made no bid.
AWESOMEBROTHERBILL pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in the lane.
