Footnotes
PICK BYMY FRIEND Perfectly maneuvered to rail in run to first turn, saw opening created by L'ARACHIDE at the seven-sixteenths pole and moved through
to a clear lead, shook clear from the field, never in doubt from that point in a dominant effort. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY Stalked three wide into the first turn,
prodded by rider to pursue blitzing leader at the three-eighths pole, always chasing an easy winner, clearly bested the rest. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN Vied
two wide into the first turn, became uncomfortable by inner and outer rivals around the three-eighths pole, re-engaged to chase on the inner paths, evenly to
the wire. IGO Advanced three wide from the second flight shortly after moving into the first turn, called upon to keep pace at the quarter pole while moving in
the four path, move flattened out through the lane. MISS MY MAMMA Established position on the rail in the second flight, never got involved. DYNAMIC
WOMAN Settled well in the second grouping around the first bend but shortly before the move to the backstretch started to become rank, got out sharply,
always detached from there and not pushed on in the run home. L'ARACHIDE Flashed early speed along the rail, drifted out around the opening bend and
allowed PICK BYMY FRIEND to move through at the seven-sixteenths pole, maintained positioning along the rail, backed out at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF LOVE Kept runaway leader in view from the outset, settled in the two path, began to fully commence at the quarter pole, threatened two wide,
moved to a narrow lead at the eighth pole, grinded through lane to victory. BREXTON Stalked in the three path well off the leader, moved at the
five-sixteenths to challenge three wide, idled from the eighth to the sixteenth pole on the wrong lead, could not match the rally of the winner. HULA KING
Fluidly strode to the lead without any rivals joining, opened up on field through the backstretch, two rivals approached on the outside at the quarter pole and
rider got to work, fought along willingly on the rail, did not have enough to hold on. FOCUS FIRST Let top flight runners head out and then proceeded
towards the rail, tracked off the pace well inside of a rival, pressed along without much response at the quarter pole while traveling in the four path, never a
threat to the top trio. INCLUDE HOO Was always detached in the rear and never improved position.

OUR EMPIRE Sent to challenge inside around the quarter pole, dueled from that marker around the turn and through the lane, held a narrow lead down the
stretch, won the battle. READY TO FORGIVE Rushed up two wide shortly after the start, dueled on the outside from the quarter pole to the wire, held off in
a fierce duel. RETURN TO HARBOR Broke on top but was quickly outsprinted early by the dueling rivals who dominated this event, never able to match
their pace. BAJA BRIDGE Lagged behind much quicker rivals, never involved and never fired.
