Footnotes
HUNTER trailed in the three path and was put under a ride while shifting inside early around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane and
was rallying between foes passing the eighth pole, brushed with a yielding inner foe nearing the sixteenth pole, but was able to sustain the rally and was up
in the final strides. MAJOR KING brushed with an outer foe at the start, rated from the six path into the turn, was ridden around the turn and urged right
handed in the eight path into the stretch, and ran on for place. ACTION DREAM pressed in the four path, was prompted to bid into the turn and took a
narrow lead from the five path into the stretch, and kept on under steady urging but was caught on both sides late to show. RARE JEWEL brushed with an
inner foe at the start, stalked from the five path into the turn, floated out to the seven path and was cued right handed into the stretch, and stayed on but was
outrun to miss minor rewards. CUPID'S DART was hustled along in range around the three path, under right handed urging from the five path at the top of
the stretch, and flattened. I FOUND IT set the pace in the two path, was roused early around the turn, headed by an outer foe nearing the quarter pole,
yielded passing the eighth pole, and brushed with an outer foe late. PACIFIC LEGEND tracked along the inside but was empty from around the two path in
the stretch. WHISKEYONHISLIPS chased in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
SHA TIN pressed the pace in the three path, took over leaving the three-eighths pole and drove clear. BOBBY'S CANDY tracked the pace two wide, angled
out near the quarter pole, ducked to the rail in upper stretch, was unable to gain on the winner but was well clear of the rest. TACTICAL FORCE chased the
pace four wide, could not keep pace in upper stretch and bested the rest. DEN STREET failed to menace while racing four wide. SUPER GREMLIN set the
pace in the two path and retreated through the lane. CAPT COMPLICATED hopped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. SPY TOWN played
no factor while racing three wide. TRUE IDENTITY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CHESS NOT CHECKERS steadied in the two path leaving the first turn and rated from the three path into the backstretch, was confidently handled around
the far turn, cued right handed nearing the quarter pole and angled out to the eight path into the lane, rallied down the center and was up in closing stages.
SPIRIT OF POWER raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and tipped out to the five path down the backside, was cued to range up early
around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on for place. LET FREEDOM REIN tracked in the four path, bid into the far turn,
took the lead and was ridden around the five path into the lane, and kept on but was caught by a pair of outer foes late to show. TRUE BLUE PEARL raced
up close along the inside, was driven from the rail around the far turn, but faded while drifting out in the stretch. ZEN (IRE) stalked in the four path, was
under light rousing between foes midway around the far turn, but lost ground and was no factor around the six path in the stretch. FLOURISHING set the
pace in the two path, was under a ride early around the far turn, and gaveway going into the stretch. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) was unhurried while in range
around the two path but dropped out of it rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
MINT EDITION raced off the pace two wide, was a bit rank rounding the first turn, advanced in the three path around the far turn, angled four wide nearing
the quarter pole, ranged up outside to take the lead in midstretch and readily drew off under a drive. BUILT DIFFERENT lacked early speed inside,
advanced inside down the backstretch, raced mostly in two path rounding the far turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole, bid outside of the winner
nearing the eighth pole but was no match for that foe in the final furlong. BALL GOWN pressed the pace three wide, took the lead midway around the far
turn, led to midstretch and held well enough to preserve the show. ZISISIT (IRE) settled off the early pace while racing four wide, bid four wide midway
around the far turn, vied between to midstretch and flattened out late. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) saved ground in range, advanced two wide around the far
turn, angled back to the rail in upper stretch, bid inside foes nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. DULCE AMBICION failed to menace
while racing two and three wide. MY MAGGIE MOO played no factor while racing four and five wide. INTO TOURING chased the pace three wide around
the first turn and two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. ONE TRACK MINE set the pace inside and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
BOUNCER set the pace in the two path, was roused around the turn, cued right handed while tipping out to the five path into the lane, stayed on through the
lane, drifted out after a left handed cue passing the eighth pole, but held on. ROLL ON BIG JOE broke out at the start, pressed in the three path, bid in the
four path around the turn but drifted out to the nine path into the stretch, continued to drift out against right handed urging, but ran on to hold place.
KHOZEIRESS stalked in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and was one paced for show.
ROCKIN ROLLER broke outward at the start, rated in the five path, was under coaxing around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. UNCAPTURED STAR
chased along the inside but never menaced around the three path in the stretch. DROPKICK MURPHY trailed throughout from the two to six paths.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S WISH stalked along the inside, was cued midway around the turn, bid between foes while tipping out to the four path into the lane, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, drew clear, and was under wraps late. SISTREN chased in the four path, was driven around the turn and fanned out to the six path
into the stretch, and ran on for place. BUC N BEAUTY set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the three eighths pole and urged left handed from
the three path at the top of the lane, but yielded in the final furlong to finish with show. TURN ON THE CHARM prompted the pace in the three path, was
coaxed in the four path midway around the turn, but faded around the five path through the stretch. STURDY GIRL rated in the two path but was no
menace.

Footnotes
LANIAKEA STORM bumped LINNY KATE at the start, settled off the pace in the two path, cruised up three wide around the far turn, seized command near
the quarter pole, quickly cleared, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under a mild drive. LINNY KATE was bumped between foes at the start,
raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied for the place. STREAKING GREY bumped LINNY KATE at the start, was rank and steadied repeatedly
early, moved up inside to take the lead midway around the first turn, settled down soon after, set the pace along the rail to the quarter pole and held well
enough for the show. LEXINATOR raced in range four wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and never
threatened. SPECTACULAR GAL stalked the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive. BRITTIZ led early,
rated back midway around the first turn, saved ground off the pace, faltered in the lane and was eased.
