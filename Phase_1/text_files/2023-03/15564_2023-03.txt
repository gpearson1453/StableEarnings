FAME STREET was in a steady drive to track the pace between rivals down the backstretch, was urging on the far turn to rally in the stretch then kicked
clear in the final furlong to prove best in the end. TIZ A KNOCKOUT tracked the pace from the three path while racing down the backstretch, then moved up
two wide to duel for the lead throughout the second turn and into the early stretch, lugged in, then continued to rally gamely but was outkicked by an outer
rival in the end. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL tracked the pace from the inside, was rated on the far turn to menace in the stretch and was closing well and was
up for the show prize. WISE MEMORIES stalked the pace while two down the backstretch, then lead the way briefly heading into the second turn, dueled
with an outer rival coming into the stretch drive but was used up and gave way in late stretch. GIRL ON THE GO was moving up the backstretch while three
wide to stalk the pace, then made a mild bid from the inside on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. A LITTLE GOOD NEWS was unhurried and
failed to rally. CECE WAVE set the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive then slowly faded throughout the second turn and
had no final bid in the stretch.

GOLD ACCOUNT settled in the two path down the backstretch, was steadily gaining ground while three wide on the far turn to rally mid stretch, then kicked
clear under a driving hand proving best in the end. LOVING LUCKY was allowed to settle along the rail the first half of the course, then bid from the two path
on the far turn, came out four wide in the stretch to rally in the late stretch and was up for the place position. SCHOENHARDT chased the pace down the
backstretch while two wide, was moving up to duel for the lead on the far turn and into the turn, then gave way in late stretch and was best for show.
DELIRIUM angled in towards the rail into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was challenged for the lead by an outer rival on the far turn,
was used up and tired in the late stretch. BIG RESULTS chased the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout the course and needed more in the
end. TEXAS GOLD RUSH chased the pace while three wide, was in a hard dive entering the second turn, was used up and stopped.

lead between rivals in the upper stretch and was second best in the end. BRAHMS BOY lead the way from the start, was in a hard drive throughout the turn,
then vied to keep the lead in the stretch but was used up and gave way in the end. WILTON was unhurried early, then was moving up from the inside on the

tight around the three eighths marker, re bid on the turn to rally in the stretch then flattened out in the end. WIN WON DOBBS raced while three wide at an
even pace throughout the course and needed more. CHARLIE'S TOWN chased the pace from the inside into the turn and needed more in the end.

down the backstretch, then slowly faded throughout the far turn and was no menace. VICTOR VALENTINO was in tight entering the first turn, steadied then
was out run and passed a tiring rival in the end. BRILLIANT COLORS chased the pace while three wide into the second half of the course then flattened out

Footnotes
CANATLAN settled behind the field while two wide on the backstretch, was ferociously gaining ground on the far turn to menace in the stretch and was up
just in time to win by a head in the end. TAPITS KASH lead the way into the first turn, then settled along the inside to stalk the new leader down the
backstretch, came out two wide on the far turn to surge down the early stretch, gained command again in the final sixteenth but was overtaken by an outside
rival and lost by a head bob. MOROLICIOUS was in a steady drive to chase the pace from the inside from the first turn into the second turn, then rallied in
the late stretch and was up for the show prize. GOLIATH RIDGE was moving up on the first turn to gain the lead in the early backstretch, lead the way into
the second turn, then gave way in the late stretch. PHARME'S PHAITH raced along the rail from the first turn into the second turn at a steady pace then
closed well from the three path in the home stretch but it wasn't enough in the end. NIGHTWIND was in a steady drive to track the pace from the inside
down the backstretch, bid three wide on the far turn then flattened out in the end. FANDO was unhurried early, then made a mild bid along the rail on the far
turn and was no threat. DOUGH BOY was unhurried early and no menace. WITT AMERICA chased the pace between rivals down the backstretch, then
faded throughout the second turn and had no final bid in the end. CAPTAINS COVE chased the pace while three wide, then was steadily urging on the far
turn and never fired in the stretch.
