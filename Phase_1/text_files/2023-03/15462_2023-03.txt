ran evenly in the lane. CHERRYS CROSS ducked out leaving the gate and entered the first turn about the six path, left the turn inside and picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened inside the eighth pole. FRONT PORCH raced well off the pace in the
four path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. GORUN raced well
off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the
stretch. GANDHI'S ORION raced with the early leader, took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure toward
the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened in the lane. DAKOTA BOY raced with the pace inside, gave
chase from the nine sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. THATZA ALPHA stalked in the four path the first turn then faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
DULCIMER DAME rated a slim lead inside then kept the edge over SENECA ROCKS leaving the three eighths pole, came under pressure at the rail
midway on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. The latter stalked two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and raced close
two deep on the far turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. WILL OR WON'T rated off the early pace about the three path, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MADY ROSE settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up
the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. GOLDEN SWEETS rated off the pace inside on the
first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened.
