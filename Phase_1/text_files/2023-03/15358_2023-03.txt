KARMA GHIA settled in the four path down the backstretch, shifted out five wide entering the stretch, surged under mild left handed urging and was along in
time. HOLIDAY DECISION stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in between rivals late and got up for second. FRACING NASTY sped to the lead soon after
the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. VERY WEALTHY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch angled inside the leader at the
furlong marker and weakened late. LOVE'S TAVITO was no factor. UNDERCOVER LADY had good early speed and was through after a half.

Footnotes
FIRST CITIZEN made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while nicely rated and won going away under a hand ride. JOHN'S ROCK stalked the
pace into the stretch, improved position outside, drifted out late under a hand ride and finished clear for second. ENERGIZER checked repeatedly along the
rail through the first turn, moved up to pressure the winner before a half, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then faded. COMPLY failed to menace.
DISCLOSURE trailed early, moved up inside rivals on the far turn then came up empty. CHIEF RANDEL with the second flight three wide, gave way in the
stretch. MIDNIGHT J J within striking distance for six furlongs, flattened out.

drew away under a hand ride. INDY CARR stalked the early pace inside, angled out on the turn, had a mild late rally in the six path and finished clear for
second. RUNAWAY RUSSELL battled with the winner early along the inside, chased that one until deep stretch then faded. BIG TIME FLIRT passed tiring
rivals along the inside. DANES HEART with the second flight two wide, gave way in the stretch. ALDUIN was outrun. A K A FIBBER MCGEE was through
after a half. MY HOMBRE bumped with the winner at the start and had brief speed.
