Footnotes
HEATHGUARD broke outwardly and pushed FOR THE CHIEF into AARON, stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the quarter pole,
could not get past the pacesetter until the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. FORTHELOVEOFART set the pace along the rail, dug in when
winner reached near even terms late on the turn, led to the sixteenth pole and held clear of the rest. AARON was bumped at the start, was a bit rank while
racing four wide around the first turn, edged closer four wide around the far turn and finished evenly to gain the show. FOR THE CHIEF was bumped at the
start, trailed in the three path, angled five wide in upper stretch and ran on for a minor share. ENSIGN SKIP pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes
nearing the quarter pole and faded in the lane. VICTORIA'S CHIEF was outrun while racing two wide. QUICK QUICK WHIT chased the pace inside and
lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
BIG AND CLASSY rated in the four path into the turn, was cued from the three path midway around the turn, swung out to the seven path under a ride into
the stretch, rallied while tipping in under a heavy drive through the stretch, and overtook the inner pacesetter in final strides to win. ADIOS ASHER set the
pace in the three path, was roused in the two path rounding the turn and cued right handed entering the stretch, stayed on to open up slightly passing the
eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe in final strides to finish with place honors. QUITE READY chased in the two path, was coaxed rounding the turn
and angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and ran on down the center under left handed encouragement for show. MONFORTE tracked from the
three path into the turn, was roused midway around the turn and was still in the three path at the top of the lane, but evened out in the final furlong.
TORETTO prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the three path around the turn and floated out to the four path into the stretch, but flattened. BRIT'S
CANDYMAN stalked from the six path into the turn, asked for more from the four path midway around the turn, and faded around the six path in the stretch.
FORTY FLASH raced off the pace along the rail but was never a menace.

Footnotes
MURDER HORNET hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch, kicked in, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole
and won a late duel. ALGARCA settled off the early pace while racing two wide, was in a bit tight in upper stretch, found a seam three wide soon after,
rallied between foes and was narrowly outfinished. MACASSA tracked the pace four wide, took the lead in midstretch but was outfinished between the top
two. KINDNESS IS FREE raced off the pace four wide and rallied mildly. INTERESTING GEM failed to menace while racing four wide. APPLE SAUCY
stalked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. MY INSANITY was fractious in the gate and outrun while racing three wide. BLUEBERRY QUEEN was
outrun outside. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER raced without hind shoes, bumped with GOOD TALK early, saved ground in midpack and lacked the needed rally.
OUR LA DOLCE VITA dueled along the rail to midstretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. GOOD TALK was bumped early, dueled two wide
and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
COLLABORATE rated in the four path, ranged up while in hand from the three path around the turn, was roused to bid while being carried out to the six path
into the lane, lugged in slightly and brushed with the inner pacesetter just before the eighth pole, was corrected and edged past that foe in the final sixteenth
to win. PICKING UP PENNIES set the pace in the five path early, shifted in to the two path and was roused rounding the turn, floated out to the five path
while being challenged by an outer foe into the stretch, was brushed by that foe while staying on in upper stretch under right handed urging, but was edged
out late to finish with place. YES I'M A BEAST prompted the early pace in the two path, was between foes rounding the turn, was cued right handed passing
the quarter pole, tipped out and was in the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. DOC AMSTER chased in the two path, was
driven in the four path into the stretch, but did not threaten. LIVING WATER stalked along the inside, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, but gaveway
at the top of the lane.

MEETMEATTHEBEACH set the pace just off the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under confident handling. STARSHIP SUNRISE saved
ground in midpack, advanced along the rail in the stretch angled out late and narrowed the gap. FACE THE MUSIC hit the starting gate, raced up close
inside, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane to hold third. FOREVER UNCAPTURED settled off the pace while racing two wide,
angled out in upper stretch and rallied for a minor slice. HITS DIFFERENT saved ground and failed to menace. CHAINA steadied early, raced four wide and
never threatened. DAN'S CANDI GIRL pressed the winner two wide between foes and weakened in the lane. KRABI raced off the pace three wide, was
shut off in upper stretch and lacked a rally once clear nearing the eighth pole. DANDELION chased the pace four wide and faded in the drive. MIGHTY GIN
GIN stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the stretch. CHILLY CHOCOLATE steadied at the start, raced two wide and was never involved.
OUR FORTUNE COOKIE bobbled soon after the start, raced two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
CALL CURT raced in the two path around the first turn and settled off the pace in the four path down the backside, shifted inwards to the two path and
brushed an inner foe into the far turn, was under a ride around the far turn and in the four path at the top of the lane, shifted out to the six path into the final
furlong, and rallied past a trio of inner rivals for the win. LIGHT FURY travelled in the two path around the first turn and stalked in the five path down the
backstretch, shifted to the three path around the far turn and was under a drive in the four path at the top of the stretch, ran on to take a brief lead inside the
final furlong but was quickly over taken by the outer winner to finish with place. SPLIT THE WICKETS trailed around the four path down the backstretch,
was coaxed from the six path turning into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. BORDER TOWN was up close in the two path around the first
turn and vied for the lead in the five path down the backside, shifted into the two path into the far turn and was roused midway around the far turn, took a
narrow lead in upper stretch, but was outrun by a trio of outer foes in the final furlong. BOB MARCO was in the three path around the first turn and tracked in
the six path down the backstretch, was roused in the five path into the far turn and urged right handed into the stretch, but was no factor. CALIBRATOR led
along the inside around the first turn and dueled with an outer foe for pace-making duties in the two path down the backside, shifted to the rail around the far
turn and was under a ride entering the lane, yielded down the lane, was pulled up during the gallop out and vanned off. VLADISLAV rated around the three
path down the backstretch, was roused nearing the far turn while shifting to the rail but had to check into the far turn, and never threatened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ACCEDE stalked the pace two and three wide between foes, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch, quickly cleared
under left-handed urging and held safe while drifting a bit late. MAERDAMA bumped with DEKANTER at the start, angled out nearing the far turn, advanced
four wide around the turn and stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. DEKANTER bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide and was along for
the show. SNOW PRINCESS disputed the pace two wide, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker, steadied leaving the quarter pole and lacked further
bids. SHE'S AWESOME pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead midway around the turn, led to upper stretch and weakened. SUGAR BOO
steadied after the start, raced two wide and never threatened. ETNA'S NAPPER was bumped at the start, raced three wide and made little impact.
CINDYLOUWHO had only brief speed inside. PORTAGE hesitated at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
TICKING vied for the lead in the three path, took over into the turn and was roused in the two path midway around the turn, received a right handed cue
while floating out to the four path into the lane, and drew clear under steady right handed encouragement through the lane. GREAT NAVIGATOR rated in
the five path, ranged up under coaxing in the four path around the turn, took aim from the six path into the stretch, ran on but drifted out in the final furlong,
and held place. STREET SWAGG stalked in the four path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn and was under a heavy drive in the five path
at the top of the stretch, kept on in upper stretch, began to even out late, but held on to show. GOLD MAGIC prompted the pace in the two path, was ridden
along the rail around the turn, lost ground and shifted out to the seven path into the lane, appeared to rebreak and began to stay on in the final furlong, but
could not get back up for show. BANK FRENZY was held up off the pace in the two path but was no menace from the seven path in the stretch. ENGLISH
BOB showed brief speed along the inside to lead through the opening quarter but gaveway going into the turn.

Footnotes
PRELIMINARY (GB) was strung out five wide nearing the first turn, angled in early on the turn to race mostly in the two path around that bend, tipped out
down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, surged to the front, drifted out late under left-handed urging
and held clear. MAKE THE BOYS WINK saved ground off the pace, steadied midway around the first turn and tipped two wide soon after, edged closer
three wide around the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and was clearly second best. MILIEU raced off the pace between foes,
angled into the two path midway around the first turn, edged closer at the rail around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole but was no match
for the top two in the final furlong. LAKESIDE GETAWAY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong.
FANCY steadied early, raced three wide in midpack, bid between foes in upper stretch and flattened out. SOLICITATION tracked the pace under a stout
hold two wide and had little left for the drive. TAR HEEL GIRL was outrun inside. PARTY TIME was off slowly, raced three and four wide and never
threatened. CONSEILLANTE set a fast pace inside, led to upper stretch and was eased. RED ROULETTE raced in range two wide and retreated while
lugging in badly through the lane.
