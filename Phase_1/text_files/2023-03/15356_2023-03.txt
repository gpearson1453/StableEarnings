Footnotes
COLORS raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground coming
around the turn and drew off in the lane. KALINBA hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to duel from the three path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the second turn, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE raced
in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, dropped back to race off the pace in the three path around the
far bend and improved position late. DEVIL'S MYTH saved ground around the first turn, fought his rider while stalking the leaders headed into the
backstretch, dropped back to trail the field from the rail around the second turn and showed no kick. TIMMINS dueled on the inside through the opening half
mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CALL BROS raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around
the second turn, and dueled to the wire to just hold the victory after his rider dropped the whip in upper stretch. SEA SPLENDOR raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn turn and dueled to the finish to narrowly miss.
KHOZANDO saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second bend in the three path
and improved position late. ENGLISH LAUGHTER raced in the two path early, stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the four path and finished evenly. COLONIST raced in the four path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around
the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. SHAKEM N BREAKEM saved ground around the first bend, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the four path and was empty in the lane. HONDO GUSTO raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and made no bid.

JESS'S GYPSY GIRL chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, challenged nearing the quarter pole and drew off in the
stretch. RITABOOK led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the two path around the bend, gave way in upper stretch and
chased the winner home from there. LAVEAU raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up while racing in the two
path around the turn and continued to gain ground in the lane while proving to be no match for the winner. LUNA AMARILLA trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and made up some ground in the stretch while never threatening. LIFENHOWULIVIT raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the turn and showed no kick. I CALLED IT RIGHT raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. GILDED CHARMROSE raced in the middle of the pack between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back quickly while saving ground around the turn and was eased to the wire.
