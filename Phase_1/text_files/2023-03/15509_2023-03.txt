Footnotes
NORTHERNREFLECTION was pinched at the break as he was pushed into the horse on his outside because of an inner foe bumping into him, he settled in
along the rail while racing off the pace, he was unhurried, patiently waited for the right place to make his move, angled out into the four path in the upper
stretch and started his winning bid, he was aggressively ridden and gamely raced down the lane and was able to run down the leader, scoring a nice win.
BANKROLL broke sharp and took back off the pace, raced six wide down the backside, was asked to start running at the half mile pole, responded well and
went into the second turn five wide, circled the field, was the first one to the quarter pole, showed the way from there until the last sixteenth of a mile where
he was run down late by an unexpected foe and had to settle for second. CHROMPTON was bumped at the start, regained his balance and settled mid
pack five wide down the backside, was encouraged to make up ground at the half mile pole, responded well and chased through the turn, was two wide at
the upper stretch, closed gamely but had to much to do, was able to pick up third place honors. J B GRAY broke very hard into the two horse, was
corrected, stalked the leader, was well placed and in contention through the turn, was pushed out leaving the turn by an inside, foe, was six wide in the
stretch, was encouraged and kept on point but didn't have enough today. THE THREE KS vied for the early lead, matched strides for two furlongs with
another rival, took command and showed the way, was collared at the quarter pole, and flattened out late. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE vied for the early lead,
battled for two furlongs, took back and stalked from the two path, stopped after the quarter pole. CPRIORITY was off slow, raced four wide, was eased in
the stretch.

Footnotes
BET ON BOURBON pulled inside of the top pair before altering outside of them at the five furlong pole, tugged to reach the fore at the half mile pole,
cleared and crossed over entering the lane, widened his margin in upper stretch, but weakened in the final furlong, and lasted desperately to the wire.
ALLSTAR MAGIC bumped with an outer rival while breaking a step slow, tracked in the two to three paths, gained place at the three sixteenths pole with
many lengths to find on the clear leader, yet quickly closed the gap as that foe weakened in the final sixteenth, but came up a stride short. RYAN'S GRACE
lacked speed in the four to five paths, closed in late while dueling with an inner for show through the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. THE GREY
BEAUTY chased from midpack in the three to four paths, stayed on while battling with an outer rival for show through the final furlong, and got nailed at the
wire. HAPPY SAILS bumped with an inner rival while off a beat slow, trailed in the five path, and improved late. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR prompted the
pace along the inside, checked back at the nine sixteenths pole, failed to sustain position entering the turn, and faded. RUBY BEGONIA showed the way
early on, but was headed by an outer rival at the half mile pole, chased that foe from the two path around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
CHAD'S FLASH broke outwardly at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing rival around the turn, inched clear of him at the quarter pole, and held sway
thereafter. FRIEND'S DO CARE pressed the eventual winner from the outside, briefly failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, and chased that foe home well
to hold place. TUCKER THE GRUMP shied from an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack two wide into the turn, got nudged by his
inner counterpart to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then sustained a grinding charge to attempt a bid for place in the closing stages, but missed.
APRIORITY ROCKET broke out at the start, stalked outside of the top pair early on, tucked behind them around the turn, but failed to slip through very
narrow rail quarters inside of the leader approaching midstretch, chased in the final furlong, and yielded late. STORMIN SUNDAY took a bump from an
outer rival soon after the start causing him to back out of tight quarters, advanced to midpack along the inside entering the turn, brushed an outer foe while
shifting to the three path at the five sixteenths pole, chased the main group while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, and failed to menace. RAZZ
was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the six path, and moved up. RONALDS GATSBY tossed his head while rank and
off slow at the start, broke inwardly in the process, raced far back along the inside around the turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a
rally and made little impact between horses while under light handling through the final furlong. LORD HELP ME broke slowly, trailed in the three path, and
failed to factor. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY broke through the gate pre-race, jogged for a sixteenth of a mile before being returned and reloaded, then lacked
speed in the five path, and got outrun. STAR READY tracked along the inside inside, and weakened.

Footnotes
MAX PANDOWDY laid off of the pace along the inside, slipped inside of foes to gain place in upper stretch, took aim outside of the clear leader at the three
sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid in the final furlong, and edged clear late. ANICLUDE vied two wide, cleared entering the backstretch, showed the way in
hand around the far turn as a trio of outer rivals pursued from striking range, shook away from them in upper stretch, but was collared approaching the final
sixteenth, and was bested late. MATH MAN settled far back two wide,, gained inside of foes around the far turn, split rivals three wide while sustaining his
charge, and belatedly closed in on the top pair late. DA GOLD ROOM tracked along the inside, attempted a bid two wide and between horses around the far
turn, but tired. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES steadied out of tight quarters between horses early on, recovered to reach a stalking position in the three path
around the first turn, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, but weakened once floated five wide in upper stretch. GENIUS vied along the inside,
allowed an outer rival to clear in order to stalk from the three path down the backstretch, inched closer between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep
pace in upper stretch, chased, and faded in the final furlong. VALIANT DEFENDER pursued form midpack two wide and between horses, and gave way
turning for home. COURAGEOUS TIMMY raced far back in the six to four paths around the first turn, and got outrun. BASSETT lacked speed along the
inside, took the far turn in the four path before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT broke slowly and
showed little. XIETELEHUAS laid off of the pace four wide, and weakened.

Footnotes
REGAL KINGDOM broke half a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, tracked around the far turn, split foes in the five path at
the quarter pole to bid in upper stretch, drifted out to the outer fence in midstretch while clearing and hanging on his left lead, and edged away. RANCH
WATER vied along the inside, allowed an outer rival to clear down the backstretch, stalked while relegated to midpack around the far turn, yet split foes two
wide to offer a rebid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder soon after, and proved second best. FRENCHY DEPARTED leaned out at the
start, raced at the rear along the inside early on, improved in the three path and between horses into the far turn, then chased behind rivals through the lane,
sustained stride to bid for show late, and prevailed. THE BOSS SOSS stalked in the three path, bid into the far turn, vied two wide and between horses
around that bend, led entering the lane, but was outkicked by bidders on both sides in upper stretch, and tired late. MO CREDO laid off of the pace in the
five path, gained approaching the far turn to press the top pair from the four path around that bend, but was outkicked while floated five wide entering the
lane, and chased thereafter. GO BROTHER GO tracked along the inside, retreated approaching the far turn, fanned out to the outer part of the course
approaching midstretch, and moved up late. STIFF DRINK lacked speed in the six to five paths around the turn, and failed to factor. ITS WILD AGAIN laid
off of the pace in the two path, checked to the four path around the first turn, raced between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. AMAVI tugged
in the four path around the first turn to vie two wide at the five furlong pole, led before tucking approaching the far turn, sparred with an outer bidder around
that bend, got headed entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. WESTERN STAR pursued from midpack along the inside, but was done early.

SCOOTERIA set the pace two wide early on, cleared and showed the way in the two path around the turn, then held late while tiring in the closing stages.
GUTZY prompted the pace inside of his uncoupled entry-mate early on, chased that foe around the turn, then gained outside of him in the closing stages,
but did not have enough to reel him in. MR. CROMWELL chased in the three path and was the best of the rest. VETERANS DAY broke a step slow, trailed
along the inside, and rallied along the rail to gain a minor placing in midstretch. BIG BOO stalked three wide and weakened through the lane. LIL WOADIE
pursued from midpack along the inside around the turn, and failed to menace. SALUTE NOW lacked speed in the two to three paths, and made little impact.
JAMAICAN ME laid off of the pace in the three to four paths and faded.

Footnotes
CATCHIN DRAMA broke a step slow, raced far back along the inside, gained in the five path around the far turn, and sustained a rally while hanging on his
left lead to wear down the top pair in the closing stages. PARTY LITTLE BOY pressed two wide, bid turning for home, but was repelled entering the lane,
kept on as an outer rival rallied alongside, rebid with that one in the final sixteenth, and got outfinished. SEA OF LIGHT set the pace along the inside, met an
outer challenge at the quarter pole, repelled that foe entering the lane, but was caught in the final sixteenth. OUR HEATSEEKER laid off of the pace in the
three to two paths, was driven for gain in the four path around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival while leveling off in midstretch. TRADER
PRICE veered in at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, inched closer in the two path behind the leaders around the far turn, but failed to
sustain a bid in upper stretch, and weakened. CREOLE REB hopped and checked at the start as an outer rival dove across his path, lagged behind,
advanced in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. RUN ON ACES tracked from midpack along the inside,
but faded at the three furlong pole. IRON N STEEL stalked the top pair from the four to three paths, but weakened between horses turning for home.
GOLDEN CONFUSION tracked two wide, but faded into the far turn. CAJUN CONNECTION was bumped by an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the
pace in the four to three paths early on, but faltered in the six path around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SALVAJE tracked in the three path, fanned to the nine path in upper stretch, and offered a good kick in the outer part of the course in the final furlong to
drive past the clear leader in the closing stages. PERFECT HAPPINESS set the pace inside of a vying rival while a bit off of the rail, shifted out to the five
path entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. MISTY DAY tracked two wide, spun into the lane in the five path,
stayed on while shifting in, and gained show from an outer rival passing the sixteenth pole. MARGIE'S KITCHEN vied outside of the pace setter while kept
in the three path by that foe around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. ROSE PALACE was hung in the
five path whilst midpack around the turn, then kept on after shifting ground inwardly in midstretch. LADY JEOPARDY laid off of the pace in the three path,
and failed to menace. HIGH SPEED raced at the rear in the four path, came into the lane in the six path, but steadied when put to tight quarters in
midstretch, and lacked a bid. RUMPUS bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased along the inside, and weakened through the final furlong. TEXAS
BLUEBONNET exchanged a bump with an outer foe at the start, and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
GUNTOWN was settled in hands off the pace early on in the three path, was encouraged at the half mile pole, gained ground, was lightly tapped at the three
eighths pole, responded well and was two wide entering the stretch, was driven past rivals and split the leading group of rivals at the eighth mile pole,

Footnotes
BUDRO TALKING saved ground while rating off of the pace, split foes three wide while launching a rally entering the lane, and drove past the leaders
approaching midstretch before kicking clear. OAK HILL LG bumped an outer rival at the start, opened up a wide margin around the first turn, came back to
the field entering the lane, met a pair of bids approaching midstretch, and proved no match for his widest challenger while repelling the other for place
leaving that station. WISE VERDICT tracked from midpack along the inside, gained place from an outer rival around the far turn, closed in along with an
outer bidder in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one nearing the furlong grounds before bidding for place, but was turned away for that position as well.
BALLINONABUDJET laid off of the pace in the four path, was urged for gain in the three path around the far turn before fanning five wide entering the lane,
and ran on for a minor share. UNANIMOUSLY took back from crowded quarters between rivals soon after the start, lacked speed three wide, and failed to
threaten between horses. PINCH ASSAULT was void of speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four to six paths, and made little impact. HOME
VISIT tracked the run-away leader from the three to two paths around the first turn, chased outside of a rival while losing place around the far turn, and
weakened. BAYOU JAM broke a step slow, pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, and yielded turning for home. MAGEEZ was
bumped by an inner rival leaving the gates, lagged behind, and was outrun.

DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) set a clear pace in the three path, saved ground on the front end around the far turn, met a bid turning for home, shook free of that
foe in the three path in upper stretch, and held firm through the final furlong. CHARGING stalked two wide, moved to the six path in the early stages of the
backstretch, engaged the leader from the three path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one while drifting to the six path in upper stretch,
and chased while fended off through the final furlong. TWO RIVERS OVER tracked from midpack four wide around both turns, and ran on. BOURBON DAY
tracked three wide, then chased evenly through the lane. BON BUENO saved ground off of the pace, shifted out to the eight path coming to midstretch, and
moved up without threatening. MORE THAN FIVE tracked along the inside, and weakened. FUJIN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. OCEAN
CITY stumbled at the start, raced far back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. HERO'S MEDAL bobbled at the start,
lagged behind, and never got involved. TUFNEL broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, and weakened.

ROYAL O'HAIGAIN bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide and between horses, rallied to drive past the tiring leader at the furlong
grounds, and was wrapped up through the late stages. GALAXY THIRTYSIX saved ground off of the pace, rallied two wide and between horses through the
lane to bid for place along with an outer rival, sppared for that position late, and prevailed. MI LIA stalked two wide and between horses, chased three wide
in midstretch, bid for place along with an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, and got outfinished. BLESSED ANNA tracked five wide, then stayed on to hold
fourth from an outer bidder. MISS JANA laid off of the pace six wide, and stayed on mildly to be fended off for fouth. OURPERFECTPRINCESS chased
along the inside, and gave way. LADY HOPPER opened up around the turn, but was overhauled at the furlong grounds, and stopped. G'S SQUEEZE never
got involved. SCARLETT O'HARA bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, chased between horses around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
TOUCHUPONASTAR set an uncontested pace while well within himself, met BEHEMAH STAR's challenge approaching the far turn, maintained an
advantage before shaking free of that one entering the lane, and drew off under very light handling. BEHEMAH STAR stuttered a step at the start, but was
hustled forward between horses soon after, stalked the leader from the two path while inside of a foe around the first turn, came under a drive to engage the
pace setter at the half mile pole, pressed under urging around the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and proved second best. HIGHLAND
CREEK stalked three wide, chased the top pair around the far turn, and remained clear of the others. BLUE CHEESE laid off of the slow pace, and lacked a
bid. COSMIC TRAIN trailed around both turns, and offered late improvement without threatening. SMARTY ALEX pursued from midpack along the inside,
and faded.

Footnotes
FIRST I'VE SEEN stalked the top pair from the four path, bid entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, and held from an outer challenger late.
WHOLELOTTAMO trailed in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, shifted out to the outer lanes in midstretch, and offered a belated
kick. SNOWBALL laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, chased the clear leader to bid for place in the final sixteenth, but
was outkicked by an outer rallying rival, and achieved show late. FINAL QUEST tracked in midpack two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, sustained
a grinding charge to gain place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. CHARLIE T broke out and bumped a
rival at the start, had her hind quarters knocked out from underneath her when that rival returned the favor in the aftermath, stalked along the inside around
the turn, split foes two wide entering the lane, but lacked a rail punch. WORLD WAR took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start, trailed in the two
path, moved between horses turning for home before fanning to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. BELEOUT was bumped by an inner rival
into an outer foe, bounced off that one back into her inner counterpart in the aftermath, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, shifted three wide in
upper stretch, but altered course back inwardly at the furlong ground, and was flat thereafter. MAESTRIA pressed two wide and between horses while in the
three path around the turn, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and caved between horses at the furlong grounds. DROP DEAD
SEXY set the pace in the two path, showed the way from pair of outer pressers around the turn, got headed entering the lane, and faltered.

Footnotes
NOSILVERSPOONSHERE settled off of the pace three wide, saved ground in pursuit of the main group around the far turn, tipped back outside of the top
pair at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid leaving the furlong grounds, and edged ahead. A G'S CHARLOTTE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of
the leader to be between horses turning for home, bid two wide entering the lane, led in upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge leaving the furlong
pole, and got bested late. MISHPACHAH set the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, gave way, yet saved show at
the wire. FREE LIKE A GIRL was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, fanned outside of the leading quartet
around the far turn, kept on in the final furlong, but missed reaching show. FORT POLK stalked the top pair from the four path, but yielded in upper stretch.
WINNING ROMANCE broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path while between horses, chased among foes around
the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. MO BLING raced at the rear, and never got involved. MEDLEY leaned in, bumped a rival, and steadied back at
the start, then was outrun along the inside.
