end. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE tracked the pace while three wide, then rallied leaving the turn and found its best stride in late stretch and was best for
second. DEVITO was allowed to settle behind the field while two wide, then bid mildly on the turn to close well in the stretch but it was not enough. MORO
TRENDSETTER settled along the inside then came out two wide to rally on the turn and was closing well but it was too little too late. MARVINS' WARRIOR
dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, continued to rally gamely entering the stretch, but was used up and tired in the end. TEXAN FARMER was
moving up the backstretch while four wide to menace throughout the turn then flattened out in the lane. BLINGO was in a hard drive to duel for the lead
down the backstretch and into the turn, was used up and weakened in the end. RUNAWAY RULER chased the pace from the inside, then slowly faded
heading into the turn and never fired in the stretch.

THE NEXT BIG BLING dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, drew away in upper stretch and was kept to task in late stretch. BUD GIRL chased
the early pace while four wide into the turn, rallied in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in late stretch. SATIN HEART dueled for the lead while
inside, was in a long drive but faltered in the stretch drive. RUN WITT RUN was very hard to load then raced three wide into the turn while chasing the pace,
was used up and was no menace in the stretch. DOC'S RUNNER was unhurried early then made a late rally while inside in the stretch but was no threat.
PHARME'S PHINALE chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, was used up and gave way. HAILEY'S JEWEL chased the early pace while inside
into the turn then faltered in the drive. NOMOROTHAT trailed throughout.
