HOT N SPICY LOVE prompted the pace three wide outside THE ANGRY MAN, took over in hand mid turn, moved clear and was guided a bit wider into the
stretch, was put to right handed rousing in mid stretch, kept on leaving the sixteenth marker, was shown the whip late and narrowly prevailed. CAMP
PENDLETON rated between rivals while close up heading to the turn, rated back and was angled out around the turn, circled five wide under a ride into the
lane, gave hard chase of the winner leaving mid stretch, kept on grinding and just missed. THE ANGRY MAN broke a step slow, was sent up outside rivals
early on to take command, moved clear and set the pace two wide, ceded the lead mid turn, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. VINNY edged up
to the inside of rivals heading to the three quarter pole, prompted the pace into the turn, lacked a response leaving the three eighths and gave way.

TROPHY ROOM sprinted clear soon after the break, was slightly off the rail on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and held
sway under urging. DR. SNYDER circled the turn three to four wide, drifted five deep in upper stretch, advanced to mid stretch and flattened out.
CORRECTED PEDIGREE saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, remained near the inner rail through the stretch and faded. CATCHING STARS
lacked speed, was four deep on the turn, drifted six wide turning for home and showed a mild gain outside foes. GREAT COCKTAIL , caught in tight
quarters after breaking slowly, hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and failed to rally. ELUSIVE IMAGE , reluctant to
load into the starting gate, chased the pace between horses to the stretch then gave way. CRUISE ON BY was outrun.

SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , between rivals early, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide gathering momentum into the lane, leveled off under left
handed asks, rolled by the embattled leaders leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear under steady handling. RAD PAISLEY was shoved on from the
get go, moved clear of ROMINSKI leaving the half mile marker, met an outside challenge from ALL THREES heading to the quarter pole, sparred with that
one from upper stretch to about the sixteenth marker, could not contain the winner but held well for the place. ALL THREES stalked outside foes early on,
ranged up two to three wide mid turn, drew alongside RAD PAISLEY into the lane, dueled past mid stretch then was out kicked late. BERKS eased back off
the leaders while saving ground past the five eighths, gave hard chase saving ground mid turn and faded. ROMINSKI prompted in hand from the rail, lightly
steadied back off the leader heading to the turn, tracked past the three eighths, dropped back entering the lane, eased late and was reported by the
stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
TAM CHAR broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear, remained slightly off the rail throughout and dug in tenaciously late. A GIRL NAMED JAC , steadied briefly
waiting for room entering the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. R AVERIE LYNN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, took
aim on the lead in mid stretch then weakened. UTTERLY ENCHANTING , four wide around the turn, was in striking position outside horses in mid stretch
and weakened late. TIMELY TRADITION lacked speed, swung to the five path in mid stretch and failed to rally. PRAY FOR THE U S A lacked speed along
the inner rail, angled six wide in upper stretch and showed some late interest.

Footnotes
ELLIE VICTORINA , in the clear stalking a contested pace, moved up in hand to take closer order mid turn, bid four wide to take over entering the lane,
kicked clear under right handed urging past the three sixteenths, was kept alert leaving the eighth pole and was only shown the whip in deep stretch. LADY
LANCER had speed then rated just off the leader while two to three wide, moved to the attack leaving the far turn, dueled, gained a slim lead past the five
sixteenths, was taken on by the winner soon after, could not match strides nearing mid stretch but stayed on well to hold down the place. AUNTIE RONA
broke a step slow, regrouped and advanced off the rail heading to the far turn, continued progression past the five sixteenths, swung out four wide for the
drive and churned on. OUT OF LUCK saved ground off the pace, angled four wide nearing the lane and offered a mild kick. NAMI lagged back off the pace,
raced outside a rival leaving the far turn, came three to four wide for the drive and had belated action. WINDS OF FORTUNE , sluggish from the gate, saved
ground while well back mid turn, remained inside and failed to respond. EXCLUSIVE ROSE was sent from the gate and took over from LADY LANCER after
a furlong, set the pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the far turn, battled to upper stretch then faltered through the final furlong.

HE'S ON FIRE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and dug in stubbornly late. THTWASTHENTHISISNW disputed
the pace outside the winner, remained on his left lead through the stretch until inside the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. BONDED , along the inner rail
stalking the duel, swung three wide approaching the stretch and rallied. OROCOVIX , up close stalking the duel for six furlongs, swung to the four path at
the head of the stretch and came up empty. BLOWN SAVE , pinched back by FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL leaving the starting gate, lacked speed, raced in the
two path on the far turn and failed to rally. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL , steadied when bearing out leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
MOODY WOMAN settled off the contested pace, took closer order under some coaxing leaving the five sixteenths, shifted five wide continuing progress into
the lane, rolled up from the outside to engage BENEATH THE STARS in mid stretch, took control soon after and eagerly widened under steady hand
encouragement. DECO STRONG broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, continued inside into the lane, made a grinding run through the final furlong
and just got up for the place. BENEATH THE STARS rated off the embattled leaders, moved menacingly leaving the far turn, bid three deep mid turn, was
guided four wide when clearing into the stretch, kept on under pressure heading to the eighth pole, failed to contain the winner and faded very late.
AMERICAN PYRAMID disputed the pace towards the rail, held a slim lead past the three eighths, fought on past the three sixteenths then weakened
through the final furlong. TODO SOLA bobbled at the break, vied outside AMERICAN PYRAMID, raced between runners leaving the five sixteenths, lacked
a response in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
YOUR ANALYSIS stalked the duel for five furlongs, moved up three wide leaving the turn, secured command approaching the eighth pole then drew out
under brisk urging. SUCCEED lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, raced outside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE
disputed the pace two wide to upper stretch then gave way. CURTEIS raced along the inner rail around the turn, gave way in mid stretch and was eased
late. RARE BREED hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, faltered in mid stretch and was eased late. POPPY B dropped back early.
