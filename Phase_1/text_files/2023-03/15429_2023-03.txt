under a drive. PALACE MAGIC was bumped at the start, then steadied slightly and shifted out four wide, made a three wide move on the turn to press the
winner, then had a long drive with that rival but was outfinished. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN was well placed early, then rated behind the leaders on the turn,
angled out leaving the turn for aim, was slowly gaining but needed more. ALMAFUERTE stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and

Footnotes
BIG BLUE was bumped at the start, prompted the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then dueled with the pace setter leaving the furlong
marker and got up late to prove best under a drive. STORM'S REFLECTION set the pace on the inside, then was pressured on the turn, dug in gamely in
the stretch but was caught late to just miss. RIP IT RYAN was allowed to settle early, made a four wide run on the turn but lacked the needed winning bid in
the lane. WHERE'S LUCKY checked after the start and was relegated to the back on the inside, angled out in the stretch and had a belated rally. TOP
NOTE was allowed to settle on the inside and weakened. FUTURE VISION pressed the pace three wide and was in between rivals at the half mile marker
and then tired on the turn.

Footnotes
KING TITO was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving.
AGAVE KID pressed the pace two wide, came three wie into the lane tracking the winner, kept on to hold the place award. ONE WAY HOME showed good
early speed on the inside but was shuffled back entering the turn, saved ground on the turn, then shifted out in the lane and finished well. D'FEVER broke in
the air at the start, far back early, angled out in the stretch and closed well late. RISKY BOY stalked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and
had no kick. DEVIL'S RULE was rated early, made a inside bid but flattened out. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND was unhurried early, far back and then had a
belated rally. BEL BIMBO failed to menace. GEMO RAIN chased the early pace five wide, steadied near the seven sixteenths, wide on the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
ASTI SKY broke sharply, tracked the pace after WILDWOOD DREAMER took the lead near the nine sixteenths, tracked in the three to four path on the turn,
came three wide into the lane, loomed outside the leader through midstretch, drove to the lead near the sixteenth and edged ahead. WILDWOOD
DREAMER was nudged inside early and took the lead near the nine sixteenths, set the pace while clear in the two path around the far turn, was driven
inside of ASTI SKY in the lane, grudgingly relinquished the lead near the sixteenth mark and kept on a clear second best. DEMAND RANSOM broke
outward and bumped COMING UP ACES in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, raced into
the lane inside of ASTI SKY, lacked the needed kick to match that foe, but chased on mildly and held clear for the show. COMING UP ACES was bumped
between DEMAND RANSOM and SENOR MIKE in the opening strides, trailed down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came into the lane
inside and ultimately proved no threat. W W TRAFALGAR reared at the start and broke slowly, inched up inside of SENOR MIKE approaching the half,
chased well behind the leading trio while hugging the rail on the turn, was driven three wide between horses in the lane, drifted out and lacked the needed
rally. SENOR MIKE broke outward and bumped COMING UP ACES in the opening strides, chased well behind the leading trio down the back straight, was
driven in the four to five path on the turn, and had no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
EDITOR IN CHIEF tracked the pace on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead, then edged clear to prove best under a drive.
HIGH BROW was allowed to settle early on the outside, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but hung in the final furlong, second best. MISTER
CHARMING was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out, bested rest. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was
reserved early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. EVERLOVINGHAND set the pace while racing off the inside, then was headed and drifted out
leaving the turn and gave way. COWBOYS DREAM was void of early speed and never factored. BEARS WATCHING was settled early in between rivals
and tired.

Footnotes
MADLY set the early pace on the inside, three wide off the turn and then drew clear by the furlong marker and then drew off while drifting out. LADA KALINA
prompted the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane, could not go with the winner while staying on for the place award, second best. BUMPER GIRL
was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed winning stretch bid, bested rest. EVIE JEAN was allowed to settle early, came
six wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. AMARI S. was bumped at the start, settled four wide and had no rally. PRINCESS TONI broke in at the
start, settled between rivals and lacked a rally. TWICK OR TWEAT was fractious in the gate, off slowly and not a factor. TIS SYRIAN KITTY was bumped at
the start and was not a threat.
