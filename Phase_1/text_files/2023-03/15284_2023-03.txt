Footnotes
VETERANS DAY broke a bit slow while bumping with an inner rival, was given a chance to find his stride from the three path down the backside, was
encouraged to gain ground along the inside in the turn and was well placed and patient coming out of the turn, at the quarter pole was asked again
responded in time to split horses from the three path and take control, was kept to task and driven while switching leads after the eighth pole and was up for
the win. GOT ME A CHRYSLER settled into the second tier along the backside, hooked company and sat behind the first set from the three path, was urged
a bit in the turn and responded while still in a set, was floated out leaving the turn by an inside rival and ended up six to seven wide in the lane, was driven
and pushed in the lane and lugged in a bit, was corrected and continued to drive and was able to place while hanging on his left lead.. GRAY DANE was
bumped by an inner foe soon after the start ,settled into stride well off the pace from the four path, was urged and asked repeatedly through the turn, and
responded with a persistent effort while being six wide down the lane, but was able to keep coming and ran the whole race while scoring the show spot.
APRIORITY AVENGER was off a little awkwardly, was rated in the second tier along the inside, while in a set with another foe, was angled out from behind
the top pair at the quarter pole and five wide in the lane then tired on his left lead. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was slow into his stride, raced wide through out
while showing one pace, and out finished the rest. HE'S TROUBLE vied for the early lead from the rail, set the pace with a co leader to his outside, and
faded in the stretch. HAPPY SEASON bumped an outer foe soon after the start, was forwardly placed within himself, was allowed a comfortable rein,
balancing himself while running, weakened late. SAUCY ARGUMENT was off slowly while bumping with an outer rival, and never got involved.

Footnotes
KEYS INCLUDED tracked the top pair from the four path, bid four wide in upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong, and prevailed. ARCTIC ROSE
showed the way with a comfortable clear margin down the backstretch, remained in hand in the two path around the far turn, dug in approaching midstretch
dueled between horses in the final furlong, sparred gamely to the wire, but got nailed. OVERTHOUGHT stalked along the inside while rating under snug
restraint, produced a rail bid at the furlong grounds, vied inside of a pair of rivals in the late stages, but was kept at bay. EAST LEX tracked from midpack
two wide and between horses, chased in the three path around the far turn, and lacked a bid before catching a tiring rival for fourth at the wire.
FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN stalked the loose leader from the three path, was urged in hopes of pressing around the far turn, produced a mild bid entering the
lane as an outer rival ranged up alongside, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. MUSCADINE lacked speed in the two path, took the far turn in
the four path, but lugged inwardly multiple paths in upper stretch, and failed to factor. OCTOBER SURPRISE lagged behind and never got involved.
XIETELEHUAS lacked speed along the inside, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ROYA stalked in the three path, ranged up to the clear leader in the five path leaving the quarter pole, got slightly herded outwardly by the drifting leader
while producing a bid coming to midstretch, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, and prevailed. TOTAL MALICE set the pace two wide entering the
first turn, tugged to a clear margin entering the backstretch, showed the way uncontested around the far turn, but drifted multiple paths outwardly while
being confronted by an outer rival in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead once straightened at the furlong grounds, sparred gamely through the late
stages, but was bested. IZEONPOINT saved ground towards the rear, then rallied between horses at the furlong grounds, to claim show approaching the
sixteenth pole. ROMANTIC BEAST tracked along the inside, chased from further off of the pace around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, bid
for show in midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival while flattening out. QUINN MURPHY lacked speed two wide, and surpassed tired rivals in the
final furlong. QUEEN'S MISSION stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch, lost show at the furlong grounds, and
was eased through the final sixteenth. ANGEL OF VERDUN pursued from midpack in the two to three paths, chased under urging around the far turn before
coming into the lane four wide, and weakened.

Footnotes
NORTHERNREFLECTION was off a touch slow, settled well off the pace from the outside, was slowing gaining momentum and closing with each stride,
circled the field from the outside through the turn while maintaining momentum, had his mind set on winning at the quarter pole and kept closing, drifted a bit
in and out in the lane late, but still had forward motion, and kept closing all the way to the wire where he took the win in the last stride of the race.
LIFEASWEKNOWIT vied for the early lead from the two patch, set the pace in the middle of a set of three, had pressure on both of his sides until after the
quarter pole when both early rivals ran out of steam, looked like the winner but got caught late from an outside foe. ran very game today. WAR TROLLEY
was far off the pace early, saved ground from the inside, was in touch with the field by the quarter pole, was able to angle out after the eighth mile pole,
where he was shook up a bit and showed a turn of foot and was up for third. PERFECT STRIKE settled for the second tier in between two other rivals where
he had pressure from both sides, ran his race from the two and three paths struggled to switch leads and faltered late. MIZSPELT vied for the early lead
from the four and five paths raced on the front with the same two rivals on his inside through out most of the race and tired after the eighth mile marker.
GILDERSLEEVE was off slow, stayed five to six paths wide through out, chased, after others and hung on his left lead and tired. GOTTA DEAL was just off
the pace in the second tier while riding the rail, shuffled back a bit going into the turn, made up that ground by having the inside advantage, but tired before
the eighth mile pole. CIGAR VAN was sent to the early lead using the one post position , challenged by two others foes the whole trip until he tired and
dropped back. KINGS WAGER vied from the outside in the second tier, four to five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS KENNEDY set the pace, felt mild pressure from an outer rival around the far turn, shook free of him entering the lane, and held sway safely. VIOLA
STAR settled off of the pace along inside, gradually advanced inside of rivals down the backstretch to achieve a stalking position into the far turn, pursued
the top pair around that bend, then sustained a rail chase to gain place at the furlong grounds, and held that position late. TRINITY HOPE broke slowly,
settled at the rear in the two path, swung out to the five path while picking up stride turning for home, floated six wide coming to midstretch, and rallied
outside of foes in the closing stages, but was fended off for place. CZAR'S BALLERINA bobbled inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked from behind
leaders while a bit off of the rail, moved to press outside of the pace setter approaching the far turn, inched closer under urging around that bend, but failed
to keep pace entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. SKY HIGH SUSAN tracked from the three path, chased three wide around the far turn,
shifted out four wide at the furlong grounds while being outkicked by an outer rival, and lacked a bid. LOVERS NEVER SAY leaned in a touch at the start,
pressed outside of the leader and from the three path around the first turn, but failed to sustain pressing position down the backstretch, and weakened
between horses entering the far turn. MEAN AMERICAN pursued from midpack in the four path, was urged along four wide in hopes of gaining around the
far turn, but failed to reach contention before yielding five wide and between horses in midstretch. FUHR MEO laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, then saved ground around the far turn, and made little impact. START WELL took contact from an outer rival while breaking slowly, bobbled a stride
in the aftermath, and got outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
TRANSPARENCY brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked two to three wide, bid in upper stretch, and drove clear at the furlong grounds. MAGIC
PALACE broke a touch inwardly, stalked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, but lacked a rail seam inside of BLAME THE TOLL
in upper stretch, checked for multiple strides coming to the three sixteenths pole, searched for racing room briefly before recommitting to a rail charge once
that rival shifted out slightly, but failed to slip through before that foe closed the door once more in midstretch, steadied while stymied at the furlong grounds,
tipped between horses at the sixteenth pole for clear sailing well after the eventual winner kicked clear, and gained place in the closing stages.
SOULTITLESREADY took brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, trailed along the inside, improved entering the far turn, vacated the rail entering the
lane, tipped outside of the main group in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. BLAME THE TOLL brushed an outer rival leaving the gates, set the pace,
dueled with an outer presser around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth. KIKI KRAZY
pressed the pace setter from the outside, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked while weakening in upper stretch. QUALITY laid off of the pace while
tucking behind rivals from the three to two paths around the first turn, and faded around the far turn. I AM UP bobbled while off slow leaving the, laid off of
the pace four to three wide, but was through approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
ZOOM ERIN set a clear pace in the two path, met a mild challenge from an outer foe turning for home, shook free entering the lane, drifted out with a clear
margin in midstretch, and held sway safely. ANNA'S ARABESQUE steadied out of tight rail quarters when bumped by outer rivals in the early stages, trailed
in the two path into the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied with a good kick in upper stretch, shifted in and between horses at the furlong
grounds, and secured place while chasing the clear leader home. AUDACIOUSNESS settled far back in the two to three paths, then rallied to bid for place
inside of foes in the final furlong, but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. ISLANDINTHESTREAM came in and put multiple foes to tight quarters while
clearing them in the early stages, shifted outside of the top pair shortly after, ranged up in the three path to bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep
pace while drifting to the five path entering the lane, sustained a chase before flopping back to his left lead i midstretch, and yielded minor rewards to a pair
of inner rivals in the final furlong. SISTER SEEK chased along the inside, got outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, pursued the top pair from off of
the rail in upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds. BADGELAND bobbled a bit at the start, laid far back along the
inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring GOLD PLUS turning for home to trail the field entering the lane, then shifted out in upper stretch, and surpassed
tired rivals. THISONEISFORYOU bumped with rivals on either side while being stacked up in the early stages, tracked the leaders from the two path around
the turn, and weakened. GOLD PLUS was jostled and crowded between horses when an outer foe forced him into an inner rival in the early stages, lacked
speed along the inside, and faded.

Footnotes
SHESABEAUTYDANCER set the pace, shook clear in midstretch, and held sway. COUNTRY LADY tracked along the inside, but checked in tight quarters
entering the turn, saved ground, tipped outside of the top pair to take aim in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the clear leader home, and proved
second best. DEAL ME A PENNY saved ground far back, and stayed on along the rail to gain show. CCED FOR STEPH lacked speed two wide, raced
between horses around the turn, and stayed on mildly. FUNKYLITTLESHACK pressed two wide, but weakened approaching midstretch. MY ROYAL
PRINCESS briefly unseated her rider approaching the gates, but was quickly gathered by her pony-person, bobbled a bit at the start, lagged behind, shifted
to the four path entering the lane, and improved between horses while hanging on her left lead. MACEE raced forwardly in the two path, but drifted out in
upper stretch before tiring. NON BINDING pursued from midpack in the three path, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally while hanging
on her left lead. CRYPTO BRAVE laid off of the pace in the four path, but faded in the seven path in upper stretch.
