OREGON COUNTY tracked the early pace outside SPRY CHARLIE to bid into the far turn, moved clear into the lane then held safe late as CASH
EXPRESS rallied. CASH EXPRESS saved ground back off the early pace, rallied through the far turn, angled out into the lane and closed well late to just
miss. SPRY CHARLIE moved to the front about the three path to make the pace to the far turn and weakened in the lane. NO LIMITATION was off the pace
four wide, was fanned wide as a rival drifted out late in the far turn and had no rally. MONTEREY PENINSULA was in reach of the pace three or four wide
then drifted out nearing the lane while tiring. HANDY BOY followed the pace racing about three wide then was steadied nearing the lane as a rival drifted out
and soon dropped back.

left. DONNA'S HOPE was not a threat. ROLLIN BLACKOUT was not a factor. BONNIE AND trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NORTH SIDE showed speed out from the rail while inside LOVER BOY and held that one at bay through the lane. LOVER BOY forced the pace outside the
winner and could not run that one down. THREE TIME CHARMER was three wide to get nearest the top pair but could not close the gap. SUBSCRIPTION
lacked a solid closing response four wide. SPORTY FLYER was not a factor. GETTINHOT'NHERE saved ground and weakened. GRAYDAR'S DREAM
reared at the break and trailed. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER lost his rider soon after the break.

Footnotes
COLD AS YOU dueled on the lead about four wide outside TRICKY MOM throughout and edged away through the lane. TRICKY MOM dueled on the lead
inside the winner while about the two or three path and could not match strides late. CHERISH THE DAY stalked the leaders three or four wide to make a
mild bid into the far turn, continued on but just missed the place. SUE HAPPY trailed to the far turn, swung widest into the lane and moved up. MONGOLIAN
DIAMOND saved ground and lacked a rally. ROSE OF EKITA follow3ed the pace four to five wide and weakened. HOT CAVIAR weakened three or four
wide. KNOCKON was always back.
