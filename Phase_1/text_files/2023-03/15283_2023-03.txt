Footnotes
BID FOR POWER set the early pace inside, faced pressure leaving the first turn and up the backstretch, shook clear nearing the seven-sixteenths, was put
to strong urging through upper stretch and just held. BILLIE G settled off the leading pair tracking from inside, switched outside those up the backstretch,
advanced three wide on the far turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch, gained steadily but slowly and missed the top prize while just saving the place.
DIXIELAND CANDY settled last but one racing off the inside, swung four wide into the stretch gaining mildly on the leaders, continued to advance steadily
through the lane but needed more just missing second. CAMCORDIA bobbled slightly at the break, moved forward outside the leader into the first turn,
applied pressure to that rival prompting the pace, was asked to keep up nearing the three-eighths but tired. WICKED CHOCOLATE was outpaced trailing
the field and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT SISTER got away alertly, was overtaken by an inside rival, dueled with that one going three deep through the turn and with a narrow lead
about three furlong from home, maintained that advantage under just moderate urging. SARA'S SAPPHIRE moved forward from the start to prompt the
pace inside a rival but off the rail, dueled with that one but a head in arrears through the stretch and was no match but second best. MISS CANEY chased
the leading pair, moved out from two to four wide on the turn losing ground and position but kept on in the lane to capture show honors while best of the
rest. TWO ANGELS tracked just off the leaders inside, moved out turning for home while in range but had no late kick. ANGEL WHISPER settled toward the
back, saved ground on the turn coming into upper stretch inside and ran on mildly. SCRAPPY PATCH switched out off the inside, was never near enough to
threaten. COZZOLANI stumbled at the start, raced wide from about three to five deep through the turn and was not a factor.

RED RIVER WITCH stalked the early leader then moved forward to press past the three-quarters, took a narrow lead outside the quarter pole, drew clear in
mid-stretch and held safe. CREES VALENTYME stalked from off the pace three to four wide, was put to some urging between runners entering the far turn,
kept on in the lane to be second best. SKY ECHO raced four to five wide on the turns, off the pace early and closer on the far turn, asked for run just past
the three-eighths, ran on evenly to secure show honors. GOSPEL FABULOUS was caught three to four wide on the first turn, moved clear and nearer the
rail to dictate terms heading up the backstretch, soon faced outside pressure from the eventual winner, yielded to that one in upper stretch and weakened.
MISS ARKANSAS tracked from inside, moved out and edged nearer the leaders racing in behind in the two to three path coming past the quarter pole,
lacked the needed late kick. SPLITSECONDECISION raced near the inside, was outpaced and not a factor.

TERAWATT was bumped at the start but still close up early stalking the pace, went four wide on the turn just off the leader, bid and took the lead coming to
the sixteenth pole, prevailed. RUNQUIETLY was a bit reluctant to load, broke a step slowly, raced mid-division off the pace two wide, bid inside nearing the
sixteenth pole but was only second best. IRA CHAMP vied between runners early then took command past the half, was clear turning for home, challenged
in upper- to mid-stretch and yielded late. HELLEPHENT was within range five wide on the turn and poised to challenge but lacked the needed late kick.
MAJOR GRIFFIN was bumped between runners at the start spotting the field a couple lengths, raced off the inside toward the rear, moved out six wide
turning for home and ran on willingly late. GREAT REALIZATION bumped the outer rival at the start, raced off the inside at the rear going four wide into the
turn, swung out eight deep for the drive and ran on willingly. PARABELLUM raced toward the back in the five to six path coming seven deep into upper
stretch, was never near enough to threaten. DEL MOON was urged at the break, briefly vied three wide, weakened. ELUSIVE FREUD was hard to load,
urged at the break, contended inside briefly then retreated. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK stalked the pace, advanced three to four wide outside on the turn, took command past the three-sixteenths, moved clear and
was geared down late. SHANNON C set the tempo racing off the rail, was challenged at the top of the stretch, proved no match but second best.
TOMMYHAWK was bumped lightly at the start, lacked early speed, moved out from two to four wide toward the rear on the turn and improved position in the
stretch. DAME PLATA had good position tracking from inside, needed more. BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY was ridden along early but outpaced. PRINCE RAMA
bobbled slightly into a rival at the start, chased from the two to three path, tired. TIN BADGE pressed three abreast early, dropped back and faded. TIMES

POKER PLAY stalked then took closer order to press three wide late up the backstretch, took a very narrow lead at the top of the stretch, dueled while being
put to further urging midway down the lane and responded to edge away late. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE got away alertly, set the pace from inside just off the
fence with pressure from an outside foe heading to the far turn, was further engaged and overtaken by that one turning for home, dueled but was no match
while second best. SMART CALL was under a hold into the first turn, switched off the rail about the six- and one-half, continued to be rated with a tight hold
in behind runners up the backstretch, put to urging on the far turn, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest. BOTTOMLESS settled at the rear
racing off the rail, came out further for the drive and passed tired rivals. RECKLESSNESS was forwardly-placed three to four wide, weakened. MR
OKLAHOMA CITY raced outside and wide toward the back, asked for more past the three-eighths, failed to menace. SERBIAN SAILOR was urged at the
break, chased briefly racing off the rail, steadily retreated. FRACTIONS AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND-TIMED. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING

Footnotes
REVIVAL tracked from inside, was held up briefly in behind rivals past the quarter pole, angled out for room at the top of the stretch, took aim and drove
past a sixteenth from home. SHELL SHOCKER attended the pace from inside, took a narrow lead late on the turn, was outkicked. BROTHER AARON
settled off the leaders racing wide, went five deep on the turn and put to stout urging at the quarter pole, ran along for show honors. MISTER WAYSIDE vied
inside a rival but off the fence going two to three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. HOT TICKET shifted in, advanced three wide and between
runners on the turn, was in tight quarters and altered in at the three-sixteenths then ran on. ONOMATOPOEIA raced off the pace, swung six wide, passed
tired rivals. SMOKING GUN was never a threat racing near the inside and off the pace. SWEET BAKER vied outside three to four wide for the lead, began
to weaken leaving the turn, steadied slightly at the top of the stretch when in tight and was empty. EURO SUPRISE raced off the inside chasing just off the
early leaders, steadily dropped back while moving out five wide turning for home, tired thereafter. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MINGUS stalked the pace two to three wide, took over outside the three-sixteenths, drew clear and was kept to the task. STOLEN GHOST advanced five
wide on the turn, ran on willingly for the place. PAPA BILL broke outwardly, stalked from outside just off the leaders going four wide on the turn, was
outfinished for second. SWEET ALEX shifted in, advanced between rivals two to three wide on the turn racing in behind just off the leaders, was within
striking distance but evened out in the stretch. MISTER TYRO moved forward after the start to set the pace inside rivals but just off the fence, was
overtaken by the top of the stretch and weakened. COMPUTATION chased in behind near the inside and weakened. CRAFTY SWORD was not a factor.
PUPPY POWER chased briefly three wide, dropped back and faded. MR. SMOKEY was in just a bit tight at the break, raced in the back half of the field off
the inside, failed to menace. BIRD TALK was forced out at the start, raced six wide through the turn off the pace, tired. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ROWDY RIVER stalked from outside going four then five wide on the turn, took aim on the leader, struck the front near the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
MIRANDEN got away alertly despite bobbling just slightly, set the pace racing off the rail while in command, was challenged through mid-stretch and second
best. BIG CITY BOY advanced outside four to six wide on the turn, gained show honors while no threat to the top pair. EARS TO ME was urged at the
break, chased the leaders racing off the inside, tipped out six wide turning into upper stretch and kept on to get better position at the wire. CRAZY LOVER
was within range of the leaders early and on the turn going three to four wide on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. EL BLAZE bobbled just slightly at
the break then was hard-urged to chase the leaders racing off the rail, weakened. COUNTRY BRAVE raced well back near the inside on the turn and failed
to menace. KYEMBEA saved some ground near the inside and was not a factor. HES BIG CHIEF was in just a hair tight at the start, failed to threaten while
racing off the inside. JUST OKIE was urged at the break, chased from inside, saved ground and weakened. GOSPEL DANDY was not a factor. RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
MOURVEDRE got away well, dictated terms racing a few paths off the inside, was well clear into mid-stretch and held safe with just waving of the crop.
MASTER RED tracked from inside, was no match but second best. CAMANCHE RIVER was urged from the break but outsprinted early, went five to six
wide on the turn, ran on for show honors. OCTAGON chased from the second group outside those runners three to four wide, needed more. STOLICH was
urged at the start but lacked early speed racing off the pace, went four wide on the turn, improved position in the stretch. CLEARLY A JET was kept wide
early, angled in three deep leaving the backstretch, ran on evenly. MACER THE RACER was urged at the start, chased from between runners two to three
wide, weakened. GUCCI BLING broke awkwardly and in a bit tight, fanned six wide, was never near enough to threaten. EASTER JIM chased from inside,
failed to rally. RED ACE chased two to three wide between runners, dropped back starting near the three-eighths and tired. BONES BRUIN refused to leave
the gates, walked off. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
