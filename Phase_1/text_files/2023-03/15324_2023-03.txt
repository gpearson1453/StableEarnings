Footnotes
ROYAL O'HAIGAIN was the fastest out of the gates, took advantage of her post position, raced at her pace, and drew off uncontested. SWEET VIDALIA
broke a step slow and was slow getting into stride, raced from the four path throughout, was in contention coming out of the turn, couldn't get close to the
leader but closed well and was second best today. LIL ADEAU broke tardy raced up along the rail, was able to pass rivals along the inside, and the faltered
in the lane. MYDEALOFTHEDAY was sent from the gates and settled into a stalking position from the two path, stalked the eventual winner through the
turn, was asked coming out of the turn, briefly responded but couldn't catch the leader, drifted out in the lane and tired. ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN settled
mid pack and raced from the outside, had company to the inside down the backside, advanced in the turn, was widest into the stretch and had no impact.
MISS CHARLIE GRAS raced mid pack from the four path while in between rivals, advanced through the turn from the outside, floated seven wide into the
lane and never fired.

Footnotes
LUCKY DEAL broke out and bumped a foe soon after the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, split foes while
commencing a gain in the four path turning for home, sustained a charge to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled to the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead.
DEBS PRAYER took a mild bump from an inner foe soon after the start, tracked along the inside, slipped through to produce a rail bid entering the lane, led
in upper stretch, shifted out to meet a pair of challengers at the furlong grounds, sparred leaving that juncture, but was outkicked before gamely holding
place. GRAEME'S DEAL prompted the pace inside of the leader early on, allowed that foe to clear nearing the backstretch, shifted to the three path and
outside of that foe entering it, stalked as the closest pursuer around the far turn, produced a bid for the lead along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds,
but shied from an inner rival in the process, dueled between horses leaving that station, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart before being staved off
by his inner rival for place. CAJUN ACES broke well but was quickly taken in hand to lay off of the pace, saved ground towards the rail around both turns,
and improved in midstretch without threatening the top trio. MYLIES STAR tracked in the four path, achieved a stalking position down the backstretch, but
yielded in the five path around the far turn. GUANAJUATO set the pace outside of a rival and in the three path around the first turn, cleared entering the
backstretch before moving down to the two path, showed the way unchallenged around the far turn, but was swallowed up by bidders on either side in upper
stretch. SHE'S TAKIN OVER lacked speed along the inside, failed to gain in the five to six paths around the far turn, and made little impact. OVERLY
SWEET backed out from a bit of narrow quarters between foes soon after the start, and trailed throughout.

MAJESTIC MANDATE vied early for the lead, backed off the pace a bit, shuffled further back while still racing along the rail, was cued at the three eighths
pole, slowly grinded away at the leaders, was barley in contention at the quarter pole, was kept on point, encouraged, closed in a steady fashion, was able
to pass the leader while being tucked in against the fence and stole the win. HOLY CITY took back early, let the field go and raced comfortably from the
back of the field in the four and five paths, was asked to engage at the three eighths pole, and gamely did so, closing in on the rest of the field with every
stride, was in contention at the quarter pole, angled out six wide in the lane, was mirroring strides with the horse racing along the rail from the far outside,
passed the early leaders in the furlong ground, but just missed for the win. MULTI PLATINUM vied for the lead from the rail, was joined by an outside foe
early on, raced in company throughout, battled in the stretch, couldn't shake the same foe he had been racing along the side of through the whole race,
came out and bumped this outer foe, and was beat by a horse to the inside and one on the outside, but held on for third place rewards. RAMMER JAMMER
challenged for the lead with an inner rival, stayed head to head with this rival for the entire race, was bumped late in the stretch, and passed late by an
inside rival as well as an outside rival. SPECIAL OPERATOR raced mid pack and in between rivals from the four and five path early, started to advance at
the half mile pole, close through the turn from the outside, was seven wide in the stretch but made no progress and had no impact. TAPIT TO THE LINE
race mid pack from the four path early, was encouraged to match strides with an outside rival, couldn't hold his ground against that rival, had to steady
briefly, continued to race on through the turn was three wide at the quarter pole but had no finish. BELLO CREEDO was off the early pace while racing five
wide, stayed on the outside while advancing past a few other rivals, was five wide at the quarter pole and was no threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, MULTI PLATINUM WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED FOURTH.

AUTUMNS STRONG MAN raced keenly between and behind foes down the backstretch, took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, inched closer to
be between horses turning for home fanned to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the top pair at the sixteenth pole, dueled in the late
stages, and forged an advantage late. GUTZY chased outside of the top pair while in the four path around the turn, sustained a grinding charge to bid
outside of the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole along with outer rival, dueled with that foe soon after, but got outfinished. HOLY BAYOU set the pace, sped
clear at the half mile pole, showed the way in the two path around the turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was confronted by a pair of
outer bidders while tiring entering the final sixteenth, and gave in. MR. CROMWELL broke slowly, trailed in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, surpassed tired foes in upper stretch, and sustained a mild rally to gain fourth at the wire. LIL WOADIE broke well but failed to sustain forward
positioning, laid towards the rear in the three to four paths around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane, chased mildly while hanging on his
left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, but failed to progress thereafter, and got caught at the wire for fourth. HARD FOUR broke
inwardly, tracked along the inside, was coaxed along to chase while saving ground around the turn, but made little impact. CUSTOM PRAYER stalked
outside of the clear leader around the turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane, and failed to change leads thereafter.

SLICK AND FAST set the pace while a bit off of the rail, shifted out to the three path while inching loose at the five furlong pole, showed the way while well
in hand around the far turn as an outer rival applied pressure, yet shook free of that one in upper stretch, shifted inwarly while greenly changing to his right
lead at the three sixteenths pole, and held sway. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM settled off of the pace two wide, altered course outwardly to the five path in upper
stretch, and stayed on in the final furlong to reach place late. CREEKSIDE bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, saved ground while tracking along
the inside, chased well while vying for place through midstretch, gained that position in the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by an outer rival.
MARVINS' POSSE took a bump to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, floated to the four
path at the five furlong pole, pressed in that path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased while holding place
through midstretch, but faltered between horses while drifting out in the final sixteenth. SONYA KNOWS BETTER bumped with an outer rival at the start,
trailed, improved between horses while in the three to paths entering the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, got herded to the eight path in
upper stretch, and lacked a rally in the outer part of the course. AMERICAN DOLLARS tracked outside of the top pair from the four to five paths, chased
while getting floated to the six path in upper stretch, and yielded. UP N GONE broke out and bumped a foe at the start, then saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail. CUSTOM CADILLAC lacked speed in the three path, failed to improve while hung in the five to six paths around the far turn, and was outrun
thereafter. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

NOT SO CLOSE broke on top was able to clear the field as he moved down to the rail, was allowed to set the pace uncontested, and got the easy win.
MYTOWN MYRULES followed the leader into the first turn from the outside, settled in hand while stalking three off the leader from the four path, at the half
mile pole started to run while remaining in the four and five path, was steadily encouraged through the turn to keep gaining ground, shifted out after the
quarter pole and was set down for the drive, where he continued to gain momentum, was able to pass one of the early leaders and secure second place
rewards. ZING was slow getting into stride while backing out of narrow quaters among foes soon after the start, raced from the four and five paths, trailed
the field for the first half mile, was in contention at the three eighths pole, was cued and responded, closed form the six and seven paths in the stretch,
hooked and battled with another rival through the last sixteenth of a mile, just missed third. FINE COTTON pulled strongly around the first turn to vie outside
of the leader entering the backstretch, but was taken back and rated off of the early leader, continued to stalk into the stretch, was asked but didn't fire.
JUDY'S WAY bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside while in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, but failed to
factor. ROMANCE NOVEL took brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, and failed to menace

Footnotes
BRITAIN'S KITTEN settled off of the pace while a bit off of the inside, inched closer to the leading trio around the far turn, produced a bid through a large
opening inside of them in upper stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held sway from an outer chaser thereafter. OMAHA RED set the
pace inside of a pressing rival while in the two path around the first turn, remained well in hand while showing the way in the three path around the far turn,
got headed by his outer counterpart entering the lane before being outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, fought back to reclaim place soon after, and
chased the leader home while keeping on well. PORTOS pressed the leader from the three to four paths around the turns, bid entering the lane, wrestled a
narrow advantage at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the early pace-setter for place coming
to midstretch, sparred with an outer rival for show through the final furlong, and prevailed. ROMAN CENTURIAN recovered after a bit of a flat-footed
beginning to stalk outside of the top pair and from the four path around the first turn, but failed to apply pressure while chasing in the five path around the far
turn, ranged up entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the top two approaching midstretch, dueled for show with an inner rival thereafter, but tired
late. AMERICAN HERO trailed in the four path, got outrun around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

GIRL NAMED CHARLIE bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, pursued from midpack two wide, inched closer while tracking in the four path around
the far turn, bid turning for home, sparred with an inner rival through midstretch, wrestled an advantage at the sixteenth pole, met a stern inner challenge
soon after, but gamely held to the wire. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) trailed in the two path, patiently bided time in the three path around the far turn,
came into the lane in the five path, chased behind the leader whilst between horses through midstretch, split foes at the sixteenth pole to bid for the lead
inside of GIRL NAME CHARLIE, dueled through the closing stages, but narrowly missed. CHOP CHOP was brushed and forced inwardly by an outer rival at
the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses down the backstretch, pursued from the three path and among rivals around the far
turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, but only offered a mild grind outside of rivals in the final furlong. HANG THE MOON bumped with an outer
rival at the start, saved ground in midpack, but was outmoved and relegated towards the rear of the field entering the far turn, shifted three wide in upper
stretch, chased before splitting foes in the final furlong, but flattened out late. CAMP AKEELA stalked three to two wide, pressed the leader from the three
path into the far turn before bidding along with an outer rival turning for home, led and gamely clung to an advantage from her outer counterpart through
midstretch, but faltered between foes in the final sixteenth. BLAME DAY broke inwardly and brushed a foe at the start, prompted the pace along the inside
before backing off to stalk entering the backstretch, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, set up shop two wide while aiming between horses in upper
stretch, but lacked a bid before getting outkicked. HAYUNEVANO bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace two wide, cleared an inner rival at the
five furlong pole as an outer foe applied pressure, met a pair of bids turning for home, yielded to them in upper stretch, and caved in hand at the furlong
grounds. BEYOND DOUBT bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, got hung in the five path around the far turn, and faded in
the seven path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE LIGHT broke half a beat slow, rushed forward to duel for the lead inside of a rival, prevailed in the long battle by shaking free at the furlong pole, and
inched away. TIM TAL dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the final furlong, and remained well
clear of show. RATE CONFIRMATION laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced up a rail seam around the turn, shifted outside of the leading pair
entering the lane after claiming show, yet only managed to chase them trough the lane while proving best of the rest. KISLOVODSK raced forwardly along
the inside, chased the top pair from the three path around the turn, but was floated four wide entering the lane, and tired. FOREVER COOL broke a step
slowly, trailed in the two path, improved inside of foes turning for home, but failed to menace thereafter. OVERANALYTICAL tracked in the four path and
made little impact. LUCKY SMILE broke a bit slowly before taking a bump from an outer rival at the start, recovered to be forward two wide and between
horses, but faded through the field around the turn. EMERGENCY RESPONSE brushed the gate while breaking outwardly, got hung in the five path around
the turn while towards the rear, and failed to factor.
