Footnotes
DR. FORMAN in the second flight while off the inside for five furlongs, shuffled back in traffic into the far turn, confidant handling when steering out five wide
turning for home, closed with good energy to win going away. TWITTY CITY off a step slow, back off the pace toward the inside, asked along far turn while
continuing to save ground, moved out, two path into lane, shifted out a bit more with a furlong remaining, up late to gain the nod for the place. OTIS OTIS
OTIS broke back, was used to move up to duel off the inside before a quarter, alternated up front in the run up the backstretch and into the final turn, shook
off the other speed to be clear into the lane, faltered late in proving no match for the winner late, nipped final stride for the place. HIGHER AUTHORITY in
mid pack and outside, moved closer four wide through the final turn, flattened out to finish up evenly in lacking a closing kick. LOOKIN HIGH four wide into
the first turn, lodged a middle move three wide to challenge in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. BAYOU SARGE broke
alertly, cleared to the inside, joined by OTIS OTIS OTIS before a quarter, dueled the middle half, gave way late in the final turn. NATE'S WAY finished early,
trailed home.

Footnotes
HARDSCRABBLE close from the start outside, advanced and challenged the leader from the outside midway on the turn, shook clear into the lane, enough
left to hold the runner up safe late. CHALECO back off the pace, raced four out to five when beginning to advance late in the turn, set down for the drive,
finished willingly to be getting to the winner late while outside that one. PEPPERONIKID broke a step slow, moved up to mid pack along the inside,
continued to save some ground turn, two path into the stretch, floated in by IMPOVERISHED in upper stretch, put in tight then bumped by that one with a
sixteenth to run then outfinished that same rival for the show. IMPOVERISHED firm in hand behind the pace along the inside early, continued to track turn,
three wide into the lane, came in upper stretch, dueled late outside for the show with PEPPERONIKID, lugged in and bumped that one in the closing strides,
no late punch. FINBARFUREY hesitated to be off slowly, void of speed, three wide into the lane, improved position while not a threat to the top four. HARD
LUCK HENRY broke with the field, raced forwardly and four wide for a half, weakened in the drive. BENJAMIN BUGSY hesitated to be off slowly, raced
behind the pace and off the inside, continued three wide into the stretch, lacked a significant closing response. HE'S RICH broke on top, showed the way up
the backstretch in the two path, continued to set the pace early in the turn, faltered when headed by the winner late in the bend. MY KINDA TETON broke
out, saved ground to no avail in lacking a response. PROBATION ROYALTY hesitated at the break, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND with the pace from the start in the two path, cleared to the rail early in the turn, clear into the lane, steadily drew out while under
pressure. PROUD FOOT settled off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, moved back out for the drive, could do little with the winner
the final furlong, clearly second best. CANDY CARAMEL in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, proved no match for the top two,
clear of the others while remaining well out in the strip. STAR POSE lacked speed, raced in the two path early in the turn, angled four wide for the drive,
improved position without posing a serious threat. MS HAYLEY off a step slow, trailed early, was five wide exiting the turn, picked off some tiring rivals after
the issue had been decided. SAMMIES SAMURAI broke on top, pulled along the inside behind the leaders, shuffled back along the rail three furlongs out,
went evenly through the drive. KANCANCUTIE with the pace outside the winner and between foes, prompted that one through the turn then weakened
down the lane. GRAYDAWN DAY away well, pressed the pace from the outside for a half and gave way. BACK SEAT BETTY off a step slow, remained
always back toward the inside.

Footnotes
UNSUNG MELODY away well, clear before a quarter, showed the way into the turn inside, shrugged off her closest pursuer turning for home, maintained a
daylight to the wire while being kept to task. INTO LOVE off step slow to be last away, moved up to mid pack, steadied in tight entering the turn, recovered
and advanced to race closest to the winner in the three path turning into the stretch, managed a minimal late gain on that one while lasting for the place.
SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL in the second flight just off the inside, steered out when straightened for home, roused, finished willingly to be getting to the
runner up. BARSTOOL BABE broke with the field, saved ground through the turn, finished up evenly down the lane while briefly in tight upper stretch. FLYIN
BESSIE void of speed in trailing early, four wide into the turn, angled in to be in the two path leaving, improved position. FEARLESS VIV broke back, made
little impact racing just off the inside. SHE'S A ROCKET moved up to press the winner for a half then began to give way. GOLD TICKET remained always
back. SWEET CONNECTION stopped early in the turn while four wide, fell far back, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
LANSDOWNE lacked speed toward the inside, two path into the stretch, angled out slightly for room, set down for the drive, closed with good resolve to be
up at the wire. PEACEFUL STREET closest to the leader off the inside, put a head in front midway on the turn, dueled through upper stretch, led late,
nipped at the wire, vanned off after pulling up. MEAN JAKEY forwardly placed just off the inside, split foes when moving to challenge exiting the turn, dueled
inside the runner up through upper stretch, weakened late, saved the show. GRAPNEL lacked early foot outside, three wide into the turn, angled four wide
exiting, displayed a mild amount of late interest to finish up best of the others. TITLE SHOT ducked out at the break to be off slowly, trailed for a half, swung
out five wide into the lane, improved position while not a serious threat. WESLEYAN forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch
drive. SISAWAY NOW broke back, raced back and between horses, made little impact through the lane. RED LABEL broke back, lagged while racing three
wide, steered five wide into the lane, improved upper stretch then flattened out. ATRAS raced in mid pack and three wide, crept slightly closer late in the
turn then lacked a further response to the wire. MUGSY MALONE behind the pace early in the three path, was finished before a half. PHILO BEDDOE
sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, stopped along the inside when headed by the winner in the turn.

Footnotes
MAJOR BLUE took command after the start, set all the pace in the two path, drifted out a bit with less than a furlong remaining, held sway late. SOUTHERN
SUNSET settled off the pace while racing just off the inside early, made a quick move into contention while two to three wide in the second bend, lugged in
when chasing the winner past midstretch causing KINGDOM to check up, was making some progress on the winner late. KINGDOM in the second flight
along the inside, continued within striking distance the middle half while saving ground still through the second turn, was going one paced when forced to
check up in midstretch when SOUTHERN SUNRISE lugged in, lost momentum but lasted for the third position. QUALITY CHIC squeezed at the break to be
away near the back, settled inside, moved a bit closer in the two path second turn, set down drive, minimal response while altering course late. TAHOE
RUN void of speed for five furlongs, came four wide out of the final turn, improved in upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong. TEJAS five wide
into the first turn when lacking speed, four to five wide in the second bend, improved slightly, no real threat. SIMOVIC three wide through the first turn when
off the pace, four wide through the second bend, continued one paced through the stretch. CLASSIC CUT near the back, improved while angling in through
the second turn, lacked a further response down the lane. EMPYREAL SHADOW last to leave, got out into the first turn, fell far back, two path through the
second bend, never involved. WOODY'S CHOICE pressed the winner early from the outside, stopped far turn, far back, distanced, jogged in. RUN POPPY
chased the winner up the backstretch from the outside, also stopped in the second turn, jogged in while distanced as well. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF KINGDOM AGAINST SOUTHERN SUNSET,
THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
ICARUS void of speed off the inside, began to advance second turn, tapped on the breaks late in the final turn, steered three wide for the drive, finished full
of run from between horses to kick down the leader. BARBER ROAD lacked speed past the wire the first time, early move to take command before a half,
clear into the lane, continued to hold a daylight advantage late, could not contain the winner. BACK RING LUCK prompted the pace while racing off the
inside, remained within striking distance second turn, lacked a winning response. TIGER MOON settled off the pace and the inside first turn, dropped to the
rail second turn, went evenly through the lane to also lack a closing response. THE SKIPPER TOO lacked early foot, came four wide out of the final turn,
improved slightly by picking off a couple of tiring rivals. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK went one paced while racing off the inside. CHILENO showed the way into
the first turn just off the inside, allowed the runner up the rail backstretch, pressed that one for the next three furlongs and began to give way. BEN DIESEL
in mid pack and outside, moved closer four wide in the second turn, faltered and continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
INTERLOCK EMPIRE off a step slow, raced well back for five furlongs, made a good gain while four wide through the second turn, took over into the lane,
kicked well clear. SEEKING UNITY in the second flight off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide in the second bend, briefly put a head in front
late in that bend, was replaced on the lead soon after by the winner and proved no match in the drive, clear for the place. GO CATS off a step slow, lagged
well back for over five furlongs, angled out four wide turning for home, turned in a solid late rally to annex the show and close the gap on the runner up.
NYQUICK second flight along the inside when sawed off into the first turn, fell back, unhurried inside, angled out to be four wide around traffic turning for
home, displayed some mild interest to improve upper stretch, outkicked late for the show. MISSIN HOLLYWOOD dueled up front off the inside, continued to
vie midway on the second turn, weakened. GAME KEEPER bothered into the first turn, settled in mid pack, lacked a rally. JUILLIARD within striking
distance for five furlongs, had little left for the drive. SEAS OF NORMANDY raced five wide into the first turn, continued outside and was three wide through
the second when moving closer, failed to sustain that advance through the lane. REELED IN dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way late in the final
turn. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL five wide into the first turn, raced forwardly onto the backstretch, began to give way while four wide second bend. DREAMBOAT

Footnotes
SECRET OATH last away, outrun early while toward the inside, moved out in the run up the backstretch, advanced into a striking position while five wide
into the stretch, challenged shortly after straightened for home, kicked strongly clear while well out in the strip, geared down late to win ridden out.
CLAIRIERE broke near the back, raced unhurried, continued to idle along when trailing second turn just off the inside, eased out a bit in some traffic when
straightened for home, called on for some run immediately thereafter, showed good late energy but was left with too much to do to deal with the winner, fully
extended to be up late for the place. INTERSTATEDAYDREAM in the second flight while along the inside, moved closer while continuing to save ground
into the far turn, got through an open rail inside the pacesetter in upper stretch, also was no match for the winner late, missed the place. HOT AND SULTRY
prompted the early pace while in the three path, moved to challenge in the second turn, put a head in front soon after, narrowly showed the way past the
furlong marker and proved stubborn until late when she lost a couple of positions. LE DA VIDA (CHI) back off the pace and the inside, was four wide in the
second group into the lane, lacked a closing punch. LOVELY RIDE broke very alertly, set a modest pace off the inside, continued to show the way into the
lane, faltered when headed approaching the furlong marker. HIDDEN CONNECTION in mid pack and three wide first turn, raced in the two path second
bend, lacked response. MOON SWAG within striking distance off the inside early, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, three to four wide turning
for home, had little left for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
WILLOW CREEK ROAD in the second flight while off the inside, moved quickly into contention with a three wide move late in the turn, dueled with the
runner up approaching the furlong grounds, kicked clear of that one under steady handling late. MIDNIGHT TAXES close from the start while between
horses up the backstretch, dueled turn off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong
marker then proved no match, well clear of the others. WHERE'S RANDY off a step slow, raced back and inside, blocked then steadied late in the turn while
continuing along the rail, moved out a bit and rallied for the show, no threat to the top pair. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO off slowly, moved up to mid pack in the two
path, continued off the inside turn, improved position down the stretch, not enough for the show. ALLO ENRY fell back after the start, two path into the
turn,steered out to be four wide into the lane, improved position while remaining well wide, no real threat. BETTYS CASH broke alertly, set or forced the
pace from along the inside for four furlongs, gave way in the drive. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE fell back after the start, raced four wide through the turn and
made little impact through the stretch. STREET COMMANDER off slow, also raced four wide through the bend, picked off a few tiring rivals while never a
threat. CAMPISI in the second flight while along the inside, backed up when the real running began at the head of the lane. VYING EDGE in mid pack and
between rivals early, moved toward the inside turn, had nothing for the drive. REUP failed to menace while racing three wide. MO CHOCTAW prompted the
issue early from the outside, gave way after three furlongs.
