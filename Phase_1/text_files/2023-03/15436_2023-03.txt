Footnotes
LAW ABIDING coaxed from the gate and went up to take command from inside, cleared outside a rival and showed the way up the backstretch, inched
away around the bend along the rail, padded the lead to midstretch and held safely under urging. THUNDERHEART bobbled a bit leaving the gate, chased
on the inside into the turn, moved off the rail and went two to three wide into the stretch, finished determinedly to gain second but could not reach the
winner. BEAUDACIOUS broke a step slow, advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn while outside a rival and was
outfinished for the place. LANSDOWNE (GB) sat off the pace, took the turn three to four wide and improved position. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME away
quickly from the gate, had speed outside LAW ABIDING then chased that rival early, saved ground from the rail through the bend and weakened in the
drive. PAPA TIGER bumped leaving the gate, tracked outside a rival then two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. PETRUCHIO saved ground at the
back and made no impact. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) bobbled and bumped inner rival at the start, trailed outside a rival to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SUNRISE took control early, felt some pressure from NEVER SWAY to the outside on the turn before moving clear again with a quarter mile
remaining, inched away in upper stretch, then held gamely under right-handed urging in the closing moments. SOUL SWEET broke well and raced up close
outside the leader early then chased outside a rival while brushing leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three wide, lost ground late on the turn,
finished gamely through the lane and was gaining on the winner but ran out of time. BIG BELL stalked four deep into the turn, paused midway around the
bend and angled down to the two path, found the rail in the stretch and rallied from inside to gain the show. NEVER SWAY bobbled leaving the gate, chased
on the inside then moved out and brushed lightly with SOUL SWEET leaving the backstretch, put in a mild bid two wide on the turn but could not sustain the
challenge approaching the quarter pole, kept on through the lane within striking distance but could not summon the needed late kick. DOUBLE FANTASY
settled early then inched closer to chase five deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a late bid. ROSES R BLUE was off slow in the
beginning, trailed three wide into the turn, angled to the rail on the bend to save ground and weakened in the drive.

the bend by JACK SIXPACK, moved back in to chase three wide, tipped out across the drifted, rallied from outside while drifting in late and got up on the
line. KINGS RIVER KNIGHT went up to duel for command inside FAST BUCK, vied with outside pair past the quarter pole, moved clear in upper stretch,
showed the way into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. INDIAN PEAK trailed early, traveled two to three wide around the bend, angled in and
looked to rally up the fence but was boxed in from upper to midstretch, tipped out and finished gamely between to miss. FAST BUCK was off alertly, dueled
outside KINGS RIVER KNIGHT, vied between rivals past the quarter pole, stayed on to upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. JACK

ahead nearing the quarter pole, put away inner rival then was challenged by BUSKER ALLIE, lost command outside the eighth pole, fought back while

into the backstretch while tugging the rider along under a hold, entered the far turn along the rail, tipped out to the three path and bid three deep into the
stretch, took over nearing the furlong grounds, dueled with LUCY L while drifting inward and was outkicked in the end. BACK ON THE STREET was
prominent early four deep into the clubhouse turn then dropped back some and moved into the three path, traveled two wide into the far turn then made
some progress while easing out to the four path, kept on through the lane and finished a clear third. PARCO vied two wide between rivals into the first turn
then cleared and moved inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged from outside on the far turn, lost command and chased along the rail into the
stretch and gave way. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN was fractious in the gate, vied for the lead from inside into the first turn then took a stalking position, went
two wide into the second bend, dropped back between runners and weakened.

MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH took control along the rail, felt pressure from outside on the far turn but remained confidently ridden through the bend, responded
when asked left-handed in upper stretch and drew off under right-handed encouragement. AMERICAN ADMIRAL broke a step slow, tracked along the
inside then two wide early, traveled inside a pair of rivals into the far turn, eased off the fence and came three wide into the drive, finished willingly and
bested the others. MCLAREN VALE bobbled leaving the gate, got put in a bit tight between rivals while three wide on the clubhouse turn, continued to
chase between up the backstretch, got moved out to the four path briefly before angling down to the rail on the far turn and kept on to gain the show.
ARMAGNAC showed speed three wide then chased from outside on the first turn, drew alongside the leader with three furlongs remaining, failed to keep up
in upper stretch and flattened in the lane. TAISHAN broke a step slow from outside, chased three deep or four wide early, raced outside a pair of rivals into
the second bend, got moved out to the five path then came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

PLEASE FOCUS got brushed lightly shortly after the start, went to the front early, showed the way along the inside under confident handling on the turn,
moved off the rail and padded the lead under a few taps of right-handed urging and remained clear to the wire. PROOF SHE ZIPS bobbled leaving the gate,
stalked on the inside through the turn, could not summon the needed rally but proved second best. THIRSTY PAPPY chased out of range off the rail, raced
outside a rival in the two path into the turn, spun four wide into the drive and finished evenly for the show. STAY IN THE GAME brushed inner rival at the
start, tracked two wide then moved to the rail for the turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a rally. UPWARD MOBILITY chased on the inside while
losing ground steadily on the backstretch, tipped two wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and could not threaten. TANGLEDUPINGREY raced up
close early outside the pacesetter, chased two to three wide on the bend and weakened. TOM AND JAZZY hopped at the start to come away last, angled in
trailing the field, got blocked and boxed in on the turn, remained boxed in through the stretch and never found room. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DADS ESTRELLA raced up close then rated in a stalking position near the inside, tipped outside rivals and spun three wide into the lane, rallied under
left-handed urging and drove past FILTHY FAST late. FILTHY FAST broke out and bumped rival twice, went up between rivals to take control, cleared into
the turn and moved inside, met the challenge from SWEET HELLO at the quarter pole, dueled through the lane, put away that rival in the final sixteenth but
was overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. SWEET HELLO stalked three deep into the turn, launched a bid from outside at the quarter pole,
dueled to the sixteenth pole and faltered. MISS JOANNIE sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, raced four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, exited
the bend five wide and put in a mild late bid to round out the superfecta. LUCKY VEGAS raced in mid-pack four wide into the turn, spun five wide into the
lane and churned on while failing to threaten. TENACIOUS LADY brushed the gate, settled off the pace, went three to four wide around the turn, found
traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, tipped out and improved placings. MAGIC CAPITAL was off slow from inside, went two wide into the turn, moved out in
the lane and improved position. MONGOLIAN POWER got bumped twice and lost path at the start, saved ground near the back and kept on through the
lane. HALF NELSON was away quickly in the beginning, raced up close inside the pacesetter then was in a bit tight into the turn, remained along the rail
then a bit off the fence into the drive, became rank in the stretch and weakened. CASINO ANNIE bobbled a bit at the start, chased out of range, went two
wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HENNY ON ICE forwardly placed in the early going, raced between rivals into the turn,
exited the bend two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BOSS LADY stalked on the inside then tipped two wide late on the turn, took aim at the leader and swept by in upper stretch, then powered away in the
furlong grounds. ISABEL LUDLOW stumbled and bumped inner rival, tracked outside rivals then moved into the two path, went between foes at the quarter
pole, rallied and got up for second. BAJAN BASHERT broke well then chased in range off the rail, moved to the inside, took a bad step at the five-sixteenths
pole, hugged the rail into the stretch and was along for the show. SONG OF SHADOWS vied inside a pair of rivals early then cleared past the half-mile pole,
showed the way through the turn on the inside, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to four in deep stretch. IDESSIA broke a step slow then lost
path shortly after the start, got blocked from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, remained inside into the stretch, tipped out only to find
traffic in the final sixteenth but kept on to improve position. STAY IN LINE pressed three deep early then chased the pacesetter leaving the backstretch,
rounded the bend three wide and lacked a bid. ANNIE'S HOPE got bumped leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack leaving the backstretch, traveled four deep
into the lane and could not rally. WHISKEY OUTLAW was off a bit slow in the beginning, sat off the pace saving ground through the turn and made no
impact. GENERAL WELFARE pressed the pace from between early, chased between rivals then two to three wide and faded. BETSY IS THE CODE
chased between early, three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CLASSY CANDY sat off the pace, raced between foes into
the turn, three wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and lacked further response. OUR MAGIC GIRL hit the gate and broke slow, eased on the turn,
pulled up in the stretch and walked off.
