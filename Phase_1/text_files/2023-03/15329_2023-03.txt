Footnotes
AMITY ROAD , four deep on the turn, bid for the lead outside LUV YA BYE BYE approaching the stretch, dueled with that one to mid stretch then drew out.
LUV YA BYE BYE showed speed in the three path between horses the opening quarter mile, battled inside the winner in the stretch and weakened late.
MOSES WATER bumped with SWIFT DANCER leaving the starting gate, was three wide on the turn, angled to the inner rail near the eighth pole and had a
slight rally. FANEUIL HALL bumped by SWIFT DANCER shortly after the start, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and
rallied mildly. HERE AND NOFURTHER broke slowly, swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. SWIFT DANCER bumped with MOSES
WATER at the start, bumped FANEUIL HALL soon after the break, showed speed in the two path between horses and tired. GLASTONBURY showed
speed along the inner rail to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BRZINA angled out three wide when advancing to the five eighths, tracked three wide into the turn, bid to engage the leader mid turn, spurted away heading
to the stretch, responded to left handed asked in upper stretch and drew out under a steady drive. MUSICAL CAT settled outside a rival, eased out and
moved up three wide heading to the lane, worked between rivals leaving the three sixteenths, dropped in and kept on willingly to be clear for the place.
WRITE THIS DOWN , off the pace three wide, made a solid middle move, came four wide with pursuit into the stretch then flattened out late.
PERFORMANCEANXIETY broke a step slow then was jostled, recovered and rated off the pace while saving ground, angled off the rail near mid stretch
and churned on. TOSS A COIN , four wide early, was hustled along leaving the far turn, lacked a punch and gave way. FASHIONATTA took over early and
set the pace towards the rail, was joined past the three eighths, sparred briefly then faltered heading to mid stretch. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY broke inward and
bumped soundly with PERFORMANCEANXIETY, corrected and prompted the pace two wide, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
MAJOR HOULIHAN , three wide around the turn chasing the pace, gained command outside HIDEWRIGHT AWAY approaching the eighth pole then drew
away. HAINT BLUE circled foes on the turn, moved to the four path at the head of the stretch, angled to the inner rail near the eighth pole, raced on her left
lead and rallied. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY took a three wide lead leaving the backstretch, remained off the rail there after and gave way the final furlong. IRISH
LACE , three to four wide on the turn, lacked a rally. TITIAN TYRANT , caught in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, failed to rally. BLONDE
SAMARITAN lacked speed and was not a factor. MUNNIS PRETTY showed speed for a half mile, stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN cleared early, set a rated pace towards the rail, responded to some solid left handed asks near mid stretch, kept on with good energy and
was steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TOP BOSS prompted the pace outside the winner, could not make inroads soon into the stretch but held
well for the place. SPOTTED BULL , fractious in the gate, broke a bit slowly, settled off the early pace, was asked to pick up the pace leaving the far turn,
advanced inside rivals past the three eighths, swung five wide for the drive and kept on grinding. MUCHACHO MACHO saved ground stalking the pace,
was under pressure past the five sixteenths and faded in the final furlong. THE CAIRO KID stalked outside a rival, shifted out under asking into the lane,
lacked a kick and gave way. INSIDE RISK , three to four wide, failed to menace. BOWIE TWO STEP , roughed at the break, raced well back leaving the far
turn, saved ground into the stretch and failed to recover. MARVIN bore out at the break bothering BOWIE TWO STEP, was corrected to chase three wide,
failed to go on leaving the far turn and tired.

SHE'LL MAKE WAVES broke alertly, disputed the pace outside NEED A MARKER and dug in tenaciously in the drive. BOSSYNESS lacked speed, saved
ground around the turn, remained along the inner in the stretch until swung outside near the sixteenth pole then closed gamely. NEED A MARKER bobbled
leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail disputed the pace and finished gamely. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY , well positioned in the two path around the
turn, swung to the four path in mid stretch and failed to rally. LOVELY LIZA raced forwardly in the three path between horses for the opening three furlongs
and weakened. GOSHEN , four deep on the turn, gave way.

ELDEST SON edged up to the inside of rivals nearing the five eighths and garnered a tracking spot, took closer order into the lane, eased out past the three
sixteenths then moved up to engage the leader soon after, wrested command a furlong out, kicked away under left handed asks, drifted in when going to his
left lead, ducked outward after switching over to his right lead in deep stretch and prevailed. IT'S VIPER , off the pace three wide and between rivals, was
under a ride mid turn, swung seven wide for the drive, straightened away and made a strong run to just miss. NO EASY DAYS stalked in the two path early
on, was caught between runners heading to the turn, remained between foes mid turn, shifted out for the drive and kept on with some interest.
COLLECTION DAY , four deep and in range, angled wider making progress into the stretch and continued with interest. LEONIDS stumbled at the break,
recovered and moved to command leaving the chute, prompted the pace outside B WEST around the turn, gave hard chase from upper stretch and gave
way grudgingly. B WEST came in at the break, corrected and moved up to the inside of LEONIDS to take over with five eighths to go, was nursed along
around the turn, came under a ride past the quarter pole, failed to resist the winner in mid stretch and faded. THATAWAY saved ground, moved up near mid
stretch then flattened out. SPLENDOR BEAUTY drifted in at the break, straightened and stalked four wide early, was under a hearty ride three wide nearing
the lane and weakened. SEVEN'S ELEVEN drifted out a bit at the break, stalked three wide between runners, shifted in for the drive and gave way. OMO
DADA , pinched back at the break, regrouped and pulled his way along, steadied between rivals nearing the far turn, angled five wide for the drive and came
up empty. GENERAL NOOZ drafted back soon after the start, lost ground while four deep heading to the turn, failed to go on soon after and faltered.

ASSUME NOTHING bumped with GO TO THE KINGDOM soon after the break, was behind horses around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch,
closed steadily outside horses and got up approaching the finish. BOX N BEN broke well and was clear early, remained along the rail throughout and gave
way grudgingly. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, had aim in mid stretch and flattened out. NEW YORK
PANTHER raced along the inner rail throughout and finished evenly. EL DE CHIREL , fidgety in the starting gate, hopped at the break, was under urging
down the backstretch, swung to the four path approaching the eighth pole for clear room, came up empty and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. GO TO THE
KINGDOM bumped with the winner at the start, failed to be a factor and drifted six wide leaving the turn. CATCHING STARS bore in leaving the starting
gate, chased the pace in the two path between horses around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MIT MAZEL , three deep with the early lead, moved clear heading to the turn and set a rated pace, spurted away after being set down in upper stretch,
drifted out despite right handed stickwork and held firm. CASHING BIG CHECKS had speed between foes then rated back off the leaders, edged up three
wide around the turn to take aim, failed to kick on with the winner in mid stretch, altered in and kept on willingly. RUNAWAY MONET saved ground, dropped
back some leaving the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and kept on with interest to nab the show. ACADIAN GIRL prompted the pace to the inside
of MIT MAZEL early on, rated back off that one leaving the five eighths, remained inside and edged back up to have aim past the three eighths, gave chase
leaving the quarter pole and faded through the final sixteenth. STAND BY YOU , off the pace, was under a ride four wide past mid turn and faltered.

CASH KID , patiently handled down the backstretch, was three wide on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside
horses and was up at the finish. NEVER CHANGE , bumped and placed in tight quarters by LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE leaving the starting gate, stalked the
pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, found room along the inner rail in the drive and just missed in a game effort. BRANCO MARIA , three
wide the first turn, raced three wide around the turn, was in the four path turning for home and rallied between the top pair. ONLY CHILD prompted the pace
outside LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE, gained a three wide lead in upper stretch and gave way late. BOOK OF DELANCEY raced along the inner rail on the far
turn and was not a factor. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , four wide entering the stretch, failed to be a factor. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE bumped NEVER CHANGE
then bobbled leaving the starting gate, made the early lead, set the pace along the rail, drifted off the rail in upper stretch and gave way.
