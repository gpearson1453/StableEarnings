Footnotes
KOSELIO closest to the leader while in the two path, closer far turn, challenged outside the leader entering the stretch, quickly took over, clear past the
furlong marker, kept to task to the wire and remained comfortably clear. CYBERTOWN forwardly placed, joined the winner in the second flight late
backstretch, lost contact with that one through the second turn, lugged in stretch, could do little with that same rival the final furlong, clearly second best.
STRICKLAND bothered to be off slowly, lacked speed, asked along far turn, steered out to be three wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to be clear of
the others, no threat to the top two. OUT OF ALCATRAZ fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag in the run up the backstretch, two path through the
second bend, improved while continuing toward the rail. MR WORKS in mid pack while outside, continued three wide through the second turn, one paced
down the lane in lacking a closing response. THINKINGNDRINKING settled off the pace along the inside, had little for the drive. POINT BLANK was finished
after a half. COLONEL BARTON sprinted clear into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, offered little resistance
to the winner in upper stretch, gave way when headed by that one.

Footnotes
PROUD VICTORIA in the second flight for a half three wide, asked from between horses into the lane, rallied and closed with good determination to prove
narrowly best. FIVE QUEENS in mid pack while outside, three wide into the turn, steered out four wide late in the turn, bid midstretch, outkicked late. TIGER
BAIT in the second flight inside the winner and between horses, in traffic turning for home, continued to be covered up in upper stretch, altered course to the
inside past the furlong marker and rallied for the show from between horses. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL void of speed, raced three wide out of the turn,
improved position while displaying some mild interest. TAPIT RIGHT back off the pace inside,. moved closer along the rail through the turn, flattened out in
the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. HISSY MISSY off a step slow, saved ground through the turn, improved up the rail. TWENTYTWENTYREDO
fell back to trail after the start, split foes turning for home, carried in by TIGER BAIT nearing the furlong marker, made little impact down the lane.
TAILORBESWIFT away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside gave way quickly the final furlong. WICKED STREET broke on top, dueled up
front off the inside, stopped the final furlong.

Footnotes
PLAUSIBLE DENILE stalked the leader while racing in the two path, advanced on that one in the two path exiting the turn, gained command, well clear
despite losing crop past the furlong marker, enough left to withstand a late bid from the runner up. RUNAWAY JACK in the second flight while racing three
wide, roused for the drive, closed willingly well out in the strip to be getting to the winner late. LARK'S MISCHIEF broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the
pace for a half, responded briefly when the winner came alongside entering the stretch then could not keep up. CAIRO BREEZE lacked early foot, three
wide into the drive, failed to muster a closing rally. VIGANO fell back to trail, shuffled back along the inside into the turn, remained back. TULSAN forwardly
placed early inside, steadied into the turn, fell back and did not recover.

Footnotes
HANKS broke on top, cleared into the first turn, set all the pace while in the two path, stretched out through the lane under token pressure to win ridden out.
BEYBLADER settled off the pace along the inside, chased the winner through the final turn and into the stretch, proved no match in the drive, clearly second
best. NAMESAKE moved up to pursue the winner into the first turn, continued that pursuit in the three path the middle half mile, failed to keep up with that
one or the runner up, saved the place. QUALITY RUN off a step slow, trailed early in the three path, continued outside, swung four wide when advancing
late in the second turn, improved position. GALACTIC EMPIRE four wide into the first turn, continued outside, one paced, lacked a closing kick. JIM AND
JIM saved ground to no avail. RISKY SITUATION in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. SUPER GEEK
tired after four furlongs. FIRST RATE finished early, far back.

Footnotes
UNBEARABLE dwelt at the start to spot the field a few lengths, moved up to race in mid pack into the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, dropped inside,
got through into the bid, kicked clear under steady handling. DANCIN N THEPULPIT in the second flight while off the inside, three wide into the lane, rallied
to be clear for the place. MAY DISCO void of speed for a half, three wide for the drive, set down, finished willingly through and outside of traffic to be up for
the show. LORI'S EYES forwardly placed early, shuffled back along the inside into the turn, lost position, continued to save ground, improved inside of
several rivals into the lane, caught late for the show. GREER CROSSING off a step slow, raced well back early, swung out to be six wide for the drive,
improved position down the middle of the strip. QUARANTINED broke alertly, chased the leader toward the inside for a half, began to weaken entering the
stretch. DR. WOODS MIRACLE off a step slow, fell further back to trail along the inside, continued to save ground turn, improved position through the lane
while passing mostly tiring rivals. FOXPASS settled in mid pack while three wide, came four wide for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a serious
late kick. ROSALIE'S DESTINY lacked speed toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive, remained back in failing to muster a response.
WONDERSTRIKE away in good order, cleared from the outside toward the rail, set the pace for just over a half, faltered when headed by the winner nearing
the furlong grounds. DIXIE GIRL TO in the main body outside, four to five wide through the turn, tired in the drive. ASEEL in mid pack early between horses,
moved a bit closer early in the turn, gave way entering the stretch and trailed home.

Footnotes
INTO DISCO in the second flight, pulled between horses up the backstretch, continued under a tight hold into the far turn, angled three wide into the lane,
challenged soon after, kicked clear. AWESOME ALLY VEE off the pace, moved closer from between horses late backstretch, in tight, checked up far turn,
regathered, came three wide for the drive, finished up willingly to be well clear for the place. CHURCH SERVICE settled off the early pace inside, saved
ground first turn, lodged an early bid along the rail late backstretch, vied into the lane, could not match the top two the final furlong, comfortably saved the
show. VOW broke on top, set the pace just off the inside, allowed CHURCH SERVICE the inside late backstretch, vied through the final bend, gradually
weakened through the stretch. AMENSET last to leave, four wide into the first turn, worked way through some traffic second bend, four wide again into the
stretch, improved position. TYRONA pressed the issue early while outside, three wide when still applying pressure into the far turn, had little left for the
stretch run. SHEZAPISTOL settled outside, angled out to be five wide turning for home, had little left. LITTLE DIXIE broke back, three wide early, moved
inside for the second turn, remained always back. ELUSIVE BELLE was finished after a half, stopped, jogged in.

Footnotes
STORMY PATTERN never far back while racing outside, continued to prompt the issue up front in the three path into the far turn, came four wide for the
drive, vied past the furlong marker, gained the advantage and had enough left to hold the runner up safe late. AMONGST FRIENDS void of early foot inside,
advanced in the far turn, moved out into the lane, shifted out a bit further for the drive, finished willingly while too late. MEGAN'S HONOR in the second flight
while racing just off the inside, angled out a bit when moving to challenge three wide and inside the winner turning for home, raced on equal terms past the
furlong marker then was outkicked by the top two in the final strides. MAGOO took command soon after the start, set a pressured and hot pace along the
inside, dueled far turn, continued to do battle into the lane then gradually weakened the final furlong. LONG CROW off step slow, lagged while saving
ground, continued inside into the stretch when beginning to advance, moved out a bit for room and finished up willingly to improve position. HOYA
PARANOYA pressed the quick pace from the outside, dueled into the far turn, caved in turning for home. BEER CHASER void of speed outside, three to
four wide second bend, improved into the lane then flattened out the final furlong. ALVAARO failed to menace while racing off the inside. RAYMOND in the
second flight while racing three wide, had nothing left for the stretch run. TAPIT'S SPIRIT was finished after a half.

Footnotes
DON'T FORGET sprinted early soon after the start, set a moderate pace toward the inside, drew out steadily through the lane while kept to pressure.
CHARTER OAK in the second flight while racing outside, came three wide for the drive, proved no match for the winner, game for the place while between
horses at the wire. JEDREK settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, outkicked for the place while remaining closest to
the inside of the second flight at the wire. COSTA TERRA void of speed while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, moderate outside interest, not
enough for the place. OUTLIER chased the winner while off the inside, continued pursuit into the lane, had little left, weakened from between horses.
TONKA WARRIOR broke back, raced three wide first turn, continued to race outside, lacked a closing kick when called on for the drive. CATDADDY off
slowly, trailed, was never a factor. FLATOUT WINNER settled just off the pace, tired through the stretch.
