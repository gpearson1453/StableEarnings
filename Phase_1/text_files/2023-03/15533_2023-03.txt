RENEGADE PRINCESS raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. MANDONA
broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with BOISTEROUSLY IRISH from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half but could not resist the
winner late. MICKEY DOBBS was away alertly then raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and
failed to offer a bid. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH disputed the pace with MANDONA while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
T BONES TRICK raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy.
ASTRONOMICAL broke sharply to duel for the lead with MR. WHO while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way late. MR.
WHO disputed the pace from the inside and gave way in the drive. STEAL HOME was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide to offer a bid nearing the
quarter and gave way through the final furlong. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed
rally. THIRTY SECONDS OUT showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, weakened and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
AMADMADWORLD dueled for the lead from between foes, dropped off HUNTER JUMPER into the lane, responded when asked and was up in the closing
yards. HUNTER JUMPER disputed the pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole but could not resist the
winner late. ALEX'S DREAM settled off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking position and failed to gain in the drive. IMPASSIONED CLAIM
pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. BUSTER BURNS raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. GABE'S MONSTER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CLASS COMPOUNDS was off slow and
lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
UPPER ROOM was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin with a furlong to run and was fully extended to hold MAD LUTHER safe late. MAD LUTHER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished with a steady rally. MOJAVE set a pressured pace, responded when challenged nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out
nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. PARLEY STREET was off slow and bumped, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and finished with
some late run. SIR DEPUTY was forwardly placed from off the rail, angled out in mid-stretch and gave way. REDACTION was off slow and bumped,
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. ROUSING RUBBLE showed brief speed and weakened. BIG ENDEAVOR
was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
THE GREEN CRUSADER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore inside the sixteenth marker
and drew clear. NEW EAGLE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good
late energy. PLAYOFF BOUND was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch and gave way. YOU'RE
THE CAUSE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. SENSEMAKER sprinted
clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final sixteenth. SILVERBULLITBADGER broke sharply to press the pace
while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
