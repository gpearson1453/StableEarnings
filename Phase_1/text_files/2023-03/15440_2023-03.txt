Footnotes
ALL AMERICAN JEWEL away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated and maintained her advantage under mild urging. VIVE EL MOMENTO never far
back, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole and finished second best. MISS HEART within striking distance from the start, offered a mild bid
three wide before six furlongs then was outfinished. NO SNIVELING rushed to contention between rivals after a quarter, chased the winner into the stretch
then came up empty. FLECK had good early speed along the inside then faded. PRINCESS MORO was no factor and finished on even terms with FLECK
at the wire. DESIGNATE chased the winner around the clubhouse turn then was through after a half.

CHIEF RANDEL away alertly, prompted the pace along the rail into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and drew off
under mild right handed urging. MUTINY broke well, set a pressured pace two wide for nearly a half then was no match for the winner while just hanging on
for second. IT'S YOUR CALL close up from the start along the inside, altered course five wide at the top of the stretch, had a mild late rally and just missed
getting up for second. VISUAL MISSION went evenly. LITTLE BLAKER broke sharply, stalked the pace two wide into the stretch and faded late. MISTER
MOBIL failed to menace. NICK CAN FIX trailed.

SACRED BEAUTY bumped at the start, prompted the pace three then four wide, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace and shook clear
through the stretch under strong handling. CAUSE OF LOVE battled for the lead along the inside into the far turn, angled out then was no match for the
winner while clear for second three wide. DATTTSAFANCYFOX was bumped between rivals and squeezed at the start, surged between horses to press the
pace after a quarter, kept on into the stretch along the inside and was outfinished. ESTILO ELEGANTE failed to menace. CHORIST well placed, failed to
respond. SCOOP THERE IT IS bumped at the start then failed to menace. QUEEN HIGH battled for the early lead two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
THE COACHMAN away alertly, battled for the early lead, inherited a daylight advantage before the half mile marker, set the balance of the pace and
widened at will through the stretch to win as much the best. WHEN IN ROME chased the winner and finished second best in the five path. JOYRIDE
avoided a foe in distress at the seven sixteenths marker then found his best stride late inside of rivals. THE EQUINEST stalked the pace in the five path into
the stretch, drifted out a bit then went evenly. CAJUN BAYOU was no threat. OLD FORTY FIVE failed to menace. BAYOU SHACK moved up in the four
path through the turn then came up empty. MANUKA BOBBY broke in front, matched strides for the early lead, suffered a catastrophic injury before the half
mile pole and was euthanized.

Footnotes
KERRI'S MIRACLE close up from the start, circled rivals rapidly four wide on the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under a hand ride.
LEMON MOUSSE sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch and gamely held on for second along the rail. BEAUTIFUL
LASS stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide midway on the turn then was outfinished. EXPRESS FASHION failed to menace. SEEKING THE
MONEY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the five path then weakened. TV TIZ GORGEOUS had good early speed along the inside then
faded. STARLITESLEW had brief speed. DANES LAST SONG was no factor. ANIMO STAR lost contact with her field soon after the start, was distanced
and walked off. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED
AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
