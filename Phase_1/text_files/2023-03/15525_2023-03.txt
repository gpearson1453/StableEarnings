THE METHOD settled well behind, quickly advanced wide on the final turn then pulled away under steady encouragement. LONG GRAY LINE lacked
speed, moved wide to contention then made a gradual gain. VITESSE saved ground throughout and finished willingly while no threat. OPEN LENGTHS
dropped far behind outside then moved extremely wide into the stretch. JACKS AMERICAN PIE vied three wide, took over after half a mile, widened then
stopped. RONIN WARRIOR settled in the clear behind the dueling leaders and proved empty in the stretch. MO READY dueled inside duo for half a mile
then gave way readily. KITTEN STREET vied between rivals early then stopped and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
COLD WALKER vied inside, faded briefly into the stretch then came again in the final furlong to gain the decision. PORSUPUESTO settled off the pace
inside, bid outside to the front in the stretch but was nailed. BIRD RULER trailed early then offered some late energy along the inside. LUCKY AS A SEVEN
stalked the pace three wide then weakened in the stretch. ENFORCER alternated for the advantage outside then yielded late. JAA MODE chased outside,
faded on the turn and was no factor. MAXIM MOMENT broke in a tangle behind his field then was always outrun. ONE MORE SCORE dropped back inside
and gave way readily.

Footnotes
DIDINGER stalked close up two or three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled, took over, drew clear and was kept to the task. PRAETORIAN GUARD
was off slowly, raced off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside and finished well for place honors.
DREAMING OF SMARTY set the pace in the two path, was pressed on the backside, dueled inside of the winner on the far turn, weakened and dug in to
hold third. BLUE ROYAL was reluctant to load, then fractious in the gate, broke inward bumping hard with BATTUTA D'ORO at the start, raced off the pace,
pulled in the early stages, moved up inside, chased two wide on the far turn, lacked a rally and was outfinished for third. IMPETUD tracked on the inside,
chased inside on the far turn and tired. BATTUTA D'ORO was bumped hard at the start and steadied, then raced off the pace and did not factor.
SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE stalked three wide, chased outside on the far turn and faded.

AMUSING MISCHIEF rushed to a clear lead inside, widened in the stretch, remained well clear and was geared down late. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE far
behind early, advanced inside with good late energy. VIRAL VIDEO pursued the winner inside early and continued gamely to the finish. WINGED FOOT
saved ground, angled out in the stretch, was in tight briefly in midstretch. BEYOND BEST prompted the pace four wide then flattened out in the stretch.
SUPREME BEING trailed wide to the stretch then narrowed the gap while no threat. THREEPETE raced in closest pursuit of the winner for half a mile and
weakened. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
PEAK OF CHIC chased on the inside, made a strong bid outside of AKEMI nearing the quarter pole, quickly took over, drew clear, dug in gamely and was
all out to hold on. SPANIKOPITA raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, briefly waited, angled out for a clear path in upper stretch, made a
strong late run outside and just missed on the wire. ET'S MOON MAIDEN raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the turn and rallied late on the
rail. CHRONOLOGY chased between rivals, rallied mildly between horses in the stretch and was outkicked. PONTIFFANY chased three wide, then four
wide on the turn and tired. SNOW FORECAST vied inside for the early lead, chased inside on the turn and faded. LA FAMILIA vied between rivals for the
early lead, then chased and gave way. AKEMI set the pace racing three wide early, shook free entering the turn, was no match for the winner, then gave
way in upper stretch. SARATOGA BEAUTY was outrun.

Footnotes
BEREN stalked the pace in hand, took over midway on the turn then drew away eagerly while ridden out. YODEL E. A. WHO lagged far behind, swung wide
advancing into the stretch and rallied for the place. PRINCE OF RAIN saved ground, angled out at the quarter pole then back in through the stretch and
finished willingly. HOPEFUL TREASURE saved ground close up then steadied tiring between rivals near the sixteenth pole. PRACTICAL COACH raced just
off the leaders outside then weakened in the stretch. DREAMS UNTOLD led in the opening quarter in the two path and inside then stopped on the turn. The
stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run with no change in the order of finish.
