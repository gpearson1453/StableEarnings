pace two wide between foes around the first turn, vied two wide between down the backstretch and around the far turn, put away the pace rivals leaving the
eighth pole but could not fend off the winner late. CHICA BOOM saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show.
SERENADE A KITTEN had her head turned at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail around the first turn, dueled inside of SANDPIPER
MEMORIES pat the eighth pole and was outfinished. SHES THE NORTH was fractious pre-race, checked repeatedly while rank and racing four wide
around the first turn, settled in midpack down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn, tipped further out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
rally. SHORT CIRCUIT prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the final furlong. MONEY FACTOR trailed inside around the first turn and three wide
around the far turn.

OUTPERFORM trailed from the three path around the first turn and was in the four path down the backstretch, was roused into the far turn and cued to
range up in the five path, bid from said position into the stretch, took the lead into final furlong, and was edging away from an inner rival late to win. TALLIS
tracked along the inside, was roused in the two path nearing the quarter pole and cued between foes in the three path at the top of the stretch, and ran on
for place. HONESTO hopped at the start, raced prominently under a hold from up close in the four path, was coaxed around the far turn and under a drive in
the six path while dropping back to last entering the lane, but kept on down the center in the lane to get up for show late. MR. BOUMA set the pace in the
two path around the first turn and inside of foes down the backstretch, was cued in the two path turning into the lane, but yielded entering the final furlong.
SWEEPING GIANT prompted the pacesetter while under a hold in the three path, bid around the far turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch.

DIVINE CONNECTION prompted the inner pacesetter in the three path into the turn, bid and took the lead in the two path midway around the turn, was
roused to open up into the stretch, and drew clear under confident handling. ALICE HARPER stalked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path rounding
the turn and urged left handed while going back out to the four path into the lane, and chased home the winner for place. TIZ BIZNESS tracked in the three
path, was cued right handed in the two path midway around the turn and was in the four path entering the stretch, tipped out passing the eighth pole and
kept on for show. KILLARGUE'S GIRL chased in the five path, was driven around the turn and in the six path at the top of the lane, but flattened in the final
furlong. MAGNA MASSA got bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace along the inside, but was short of room and stymied along the rail
midway around the turn and never threatened. MISS ARIA bumped an outer foe leaving the gate, was sent to set the pace in the two path and shifted to the
rail into the turn, but gaveway turning into the stretch.

ALLEY OOP JOHNNY stalked the pace two wide in the clear, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. SWASHBUCKLE set a fast pace along the rail,
was collared in upper stretch, angled out when the winner cleared and angled in leaving the eighth pole and stayed on gamely to hold the place. FLY THE
W settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. JAIS'S SOLITUDE raced well back two wide,
edged closer three wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. XY TIME chased the top two while saving ground and
was one-paced through the lane. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE broke awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and never
threatened. OUR COUNTRY saved ground well off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and made a mild belated gain. MAJOR WAGER failed to menace
while racing three wide. PARKLAND was outrun inside. CADET CORPS lacked speed while saving ground, went four wide around the far turn and
continued to trail.

Footnotes
DOMINICAN ICE broke out and bumped with an outer foe, stalked in the two path, was driven around the turn and tipped out to the six path entering the
stretch, rallied down the center, and was up for the win in closing strides. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR set the pace in the two path into the turn, was confidently
handled around the turn while being challenged by an outer foe, shrugged off that foe and was in the three path entering the lane, opened slightly under
light handling into the final furlong, was cued right handed when spotting a late charging outer rival nearing the final sixteenth and tipped out to meet that
challenger, but was too late and caught in final strides to finish with place. JRUE BREEZE was pinballed and pinched leaving the gate and hustled along off
the pace in the four path, was under right handed urging around the turn and in the seven path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. I FOUND IT
prompted the pace in the four path, bid from the three path around the turn and floated out to the five path into the lane, but faded into the final furlong.
QUINCY CAFE trailed along the inside, angled out around the turn and was in the eight path entering the stretch, but was no factor. CUPID'S DART was
nudged along while up close between foes in the three path but backed up rounding the turn, and was no threat. PACIFIC LEGEND bumped with an inner
foe multiple times at the start, tracked in the three path into the turn but was no menace.

Footnotes
PACHANGA LOCA hit the side of the gate at the start but was sent hard to set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the quarter pole, opened up
into the stretch, and drew clear. FLAG WOMAN broke out at the start, tracked in the four path, was in the five path around the turn, tipped out to the six path
into the stretch, and kept on for place. STURDY GIRL stalked in the four path into the turn, was coaxed to bid in the three path around the turn and urged
left handed from the four path into the lane, and evened out late for show. SOFIA D 'AMORE rated in the five path, was coaxed rounding the turn and
shifted inwards to the three path entering the stretch, but was no factor. TRIBUTE prompted the pace from the three path into the turn, was roused between
rivals around the turn, but faded from the five path in the stretch. BLETCHLEY GIRL had a slow start and trailed throughout from the four to six paths.

outside and was up in the final strides. BABY STEPS dueled two wide to deep stretch, edged ahead of the pace rivals but nailed by the winner.

three wide, bid near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked between foes late. SPEED SALSA was bumped just after the start, raced well back inside, angled
out in upper stretch, rallied through the lane, ran up on heels and checked in deep stretch. ADIOS BABE saved ground and failed to menace. MOANAS
