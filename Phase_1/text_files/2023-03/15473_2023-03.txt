Footnotes
CURLY ESA stalked the moderate early pace while between runners, raced two wide into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, chased PRACTICAL
BID to the furlong grounds, made a steady advance on that foe nearing the sixteenth-marker, reeled in the runner-up in the final strides and won the nod on
the wire to prevail. PRACTICAL BID raced close to the moderate early pace, stalked the moderate fractions to the quarter marker, came three wide into the
stretch, assumed command in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, came under pressure in deep stretch and was tagged on the
line for the win, while besting the rest. MEDAL ICE was a bit slow into stride early on, chased from the rail to the quarter marker, swung three deep into the
stretch and advanced nearing the furlong marker, could not muster a response in the final furlong and was clear for third in the end. DAREDEVIL
PRINCESS chased the moderate early pace from the inside, lost ground nearing the eighth pole and tired in the final stages. SILENT BULLET lunged at the
start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, shifted out inside of the furlong
marker and did not threaten. SINGLE MERIT hit the gate at the start then was shuffled back a bit and was off a step slowly, chased the moderate pace while
outside of rivals, raced four wide into the turn then came five wide into the drive and lacked a late response. STANFORD GRAD was fractious in the post
parade, broke alertly and set the pace to the turn, carved out moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final
stages.

Footnotes
DICK BEST broke in the air and was off slowly, rushed up in the early stages and was forwardly placed into the turn, raced outside of rivals to the quarter
marker, came four wide into the stretch, chased DR. FLASH DANCER to the furlong grounds, came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker and wore down
DR. FLASH DANCER in deep stretch to prove best. DR. FLASH DANCER broke alertly and assumed command in the early going, set a pressured pace to
the turn, shook free of the pressing rival along the turn and was well rated to the quarter marker, extended the lead to mid-stretch, came under pressure
from DICK BEST in deep stretch, was outfinished for the win in the final stages and was well clear for the place. TIZ A THRILL was unhurried in the early
going, raced three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, finished evenly in the drive and and was up for third in the final strides. TOM'S MOON
settled off of the moderate early pace, was well placed through the turn, raced two wide into the stretch, lacked a late really and was just edged for the
show. JUST WATCH ME NOW was prominent in the early going, pressed the moderate pace to the turn, lost ground on DR. FLASH DANCER nearing the
quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and faded. LOVE OF THE SPORT chased the moderate pace from the inside, dropped back leaving the turn
and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
UNWHIRLED was unhurried in the early stages, made a bit of headway along the backstretch run, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung
four wide for the drive, came within aim at mid-stretch, confronted BLUE BREEZE while on the left lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, battled with that
foe to deep stretch and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. BLUE BREEZE was prominent in the early going and attended to the modest
fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch and was set down for the
drive, was confronted by UNWHIRLED nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that bid to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest
for second. RELUCTANT was bumped at the start by ON VACATION and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, mounted
a three wide bid along the far turn, could not keep pace with the top pair in the drive, flattened out in the final furlong and held safely in the end for third.
FLIPLIT took back off of the modest early pace, made a steady advance through the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn, raced two wide to the
quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. ON VACATION chased the modest fractions through the backstretch run, saved
ground to the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch run. GOLD RUSH GAL broke alertly and dictated terms in the early going, set modest fractions
through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

MAGICAL LADY rated nicely off of the moderate early pace, advanced four wide on the turn, overtook TORREY'S GIRL nearing the eighth pole and
assumed command into the final furlong, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. LION'S LAIR checked in
traffic in the early going when TORREY'S GIRL ducked out, chased the moderate early pace to the turn, slipped to the inside nearing the quarter marker
while improving position, tipped two wide for the stretch run, finished well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely in the
end for second. BOLD DAUGHTER bobbled at the start then was crowded by MAGICAL LADY and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going, raced
two wide to the quarter marker, rallied inside of the furlong pole and was up in the final strides to secure third. GET'EM TIGER steadied in traffic leaving the
chute when TORREY'S GIRL ducked out, chased the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch,
weakened in the late stages and was just edged for third. TORREY'S GIRL broke alertly, ducked out sharply leaving the chute and caused chasing rivals to
check or steady while in pursuit, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by MAGICAL LADY nearing the furlong pole and faded in the
final stages. SPUN BEAUTIFUL raced close to the early pace, steadied behind TORREY'S GIRL when that rival ducked out leaving the chute, pressed the
pace to the turn, chased the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke alertly, cleared the field into the first turn and dictated terms in the early stages, was well handled through decent fractions into
the second turn, drew to a clear lead at the top of the lane, remained clear to mid-stretch, felt late pressure from oncoming rivals and dug in in the final
stages to prevail. STOIC LUNA was unhurried in the early going, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused three wide along the far turn,
swung four wide into the stretch drive, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and outfinished
STATEFOREST to secure the place. STATEFOREST tracked the decent early fractions, lost ground to the pacesetter along the backstretch run and into the
far turn, chased JACRODRA'S DEVIL to mid-stretch, was able to make a mild late bid in the final furlong but could not reel in the winner and was outfinished
for the place, while holding for the show. BOLD ARTICLE took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, was well placed into
the second turn, waited for racing room approaching the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch, was gaining in the final furlong and missed for third.
HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS rated off of the decent early fractions while not far back, raced two wide into the backstretch run, lost a bit ground approaching the
second turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed willingly in the drive, came in tight nearing the
sixteenth-marker, was boxed in in deep stretch and lacked a late response. LYINATTHEBAR tracked the decent early pace, lost ground to the pacesetter
along the backstretch run, was outrun along the second turn and tired in the stretch drive.

OTTER POP chased the early pace while not far back, raced three wide on the turn while within aim, swung four wide for the stretch drive, advanced
nearing the furlong marker, closed determinedly in deep stretch, overtook DRINKUP BUTTERCUP inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the
final stages to prevail. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP broke alertly, contested the early pace with several rivals then took command heading to the turn, opened to
a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, remained clear to mid-stretch while on the left lead, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and just held for
the place. MISS ACCELERATE settled off of the early pace, was roused three wide into the stretch, advanced nearing the furlong pole, bumped with
PRNCSS OF DEL MAR inside of the furlong marker, finished well in the late stages, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and just missed for the
place. PRNCSS OF DEL MAR disputed the early pace then took back to stalk heading to the turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in
upper stretch, was bumped inside of the eighth pole and lacked a late response. SUE GENEROUS was prominent in the early stages, contested the pace to
the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch. TIZ SO SPECIAL had no early speed and did not threaten. UNION STREET
CAT broke out then was shuffled back leaving the start and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
MY YAMMY LADY was allowed to settle in the early stages while never far back, gained a bit of ground approaching the far turn, was roused four wide
nearing the top of the lane, loomed in upper stretch and confronted VINTAGE nearing the furlong marker, disposed of that rival leaving the eighth pole, drew
away in deep stretch and was hand urged to the wire. IRISH SONG LEADER was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the second turn,
swung six wide for the drive, found her best stride late, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch and was up for the place in the final strides. BIG
GIFT was allowed to settle early on, raced three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed inside of the furlong marker while on the left
lead and was just edged for the place while securing the show in the final strides. VINTAGE broke alertly and assumed command in the early going, was
well rated through modest fractions to the far turn, set the pace from a two wide path to the quarter marker, drifted out in upper stretch and came three wide
into the drive, was quickly overtaken by MY YAMMY LADY in mid-stretch, faded in the final stages and was outfinished for the minor awards. MAJESTIC
OOPS raced close to the modest pace through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and weakened
in the final stages. JAZZY LOVE stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the far turn while two wide, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did
not produce a late rally. DUST MAKER was a bit keen in the early stages while forwardly placed, tracked the moderate fractions to the far turn, lost ground

Footnotes
CHARBONNEAU broke alertly and quickly seized the rail and the early lead, rated kindly while holding a pair of chasers at bay to the far turn, responded
well when challenged with three furlongs to run then held sway under intermittent urging. CONDORCAT shied from BIG STICK just after the break,
recovered and was able to get good position going position through the clubhouse turn, was close up early while racing three wide down the backstretch
and through the far turn, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole, came into the stretch on the outside of three horses chasing the leader and ran on
well to gain second. CALI CONQUEST broke out at the start then lagged near the rear of the field through the first half mile, got a bit closer on the turn but
had to wait for room, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch and rallied strongly to just get up for third. DOS VICIOS broke in and made light contact
with MONEY MUNCHER at the break, raced in the three to four wide path around the first turn and down the backstretch, angled to the rail before the far
turn, had clear run into the stretch and finished up well. ITS THIEVERY broke out at the start then got a clean run into the first turn, raced three wide and
well behind the leading trio down the backstretch, began a sustained run from the half mile pole through the far turn while still three to four wide, finished
with some energy but could not make up the needed ground. BIG STICK fractious in the gate, broke out a bit at the start, chased CHARBONNEAU to the far
turn, launched a bid passing the three furlong marker, was turned away in the stretch then tired and faded in the late stages. EFFECTIVE GIG ducked out
sharply after the start, managed to save ground on the inside of the trailing pack to the half mile marker, came under a hard ride with about three furlongs to
go but could not muster the needed response. MONEY MUNCHER pinched back at the start when horses on both sides took the path out of the gate, fell far
behind early, regained contact with the field on the far turn but could not improve position.
