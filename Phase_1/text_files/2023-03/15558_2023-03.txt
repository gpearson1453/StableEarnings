Footnotes
I'LLTAKECAREOFIT took the lead approaching the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was kept sharp through the
stretch. DR RENDEZVOUS broke briefly clear then gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and dueled through the stretch for second.
CHARITABLE WINDSOR pressured the early pace, raced off the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. J. WICK gave chase,
raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. MAKIN' GOLD chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then
flattened in the stretch. ROAD PUNCH chased, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. LAST OF BAD BOYS was never a factor.

Footnotes
KOBE'S GIRL rated a clear lead inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and held on while
flattening stride late. LOVE TO ZOOM became anxious in the gate then rated just off the pace in the three path, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly while gaining on the winner. IRISH SAMURAI became anxious in the gate and rounded
the first turn in the four path, gave chase into the backstretch, raced in the four path of the far turn and cleared third inside the sixteenth pole. MERGER OF
EQUALS was bumped leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far
turn in the three path and flattened in the lane. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
three path, eased out entering the stretch and passed rivals before flattening strid. PRETTY SPECTACULAR rated just off the pace and off the rail on the
first turn, picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER was bumped
outward and into Merger Of Equals leaving the gate, raced well off the pace and never factored. OJITOS BELLOS rounded the opening turn in the four path,
gave chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. MODELO RUBIA ducked out and made contact with
Shesahumblehustler leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but gave way into the far turn.

Footnotes
HONEYQUIST took the lead on the chute and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure passing the five sixteenths pole, raced near the
rail on the turn and held well under steady stretch handling. HOPPING HENRY chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path and dueled through the
stretch for second. REMYS SHOWTIME chased inside, angled to the five path approaching the top of the lane and was outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. SETTLEMENT DATE chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened late yards. DRINKWITHTHESTARS became
fractious in the gate and gave chase through the backstretch, raced close off the rail on the turn but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. JACKS SISTER JILL
was reluctant to load, gave chase through the backstretch and raced in range of the lead in the three path of the turn, but drifted into the lane and flattened
later yards. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. RIVER WARRIOR RVF chased, raced off
the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane.

LOKOYA ROAD saved ground off the pace, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and raced close two deep on the far turn, dug in determinedly and took
over later yards. LOST IN MANHATTAN rounded the first turn in the five path then settled in the three path, rallied to the lead at the seven sixteenths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely to late stretch but relented the final yards. EXCALIBUR saved ground, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MY CANDY BIZ settled off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced off the pace in the three and four paths, showed little response
through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the four path. DUNLUCE CAISSLE was not a factor. LADDIE LIAM rated the early pace off the rail,
was met and dueled leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BEYOND THE VICTORY rated close off the rail then faded
through the backstretch.

Footnotes
PATTI BLUE EYES chased through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took
the nod in the final strides. OUR GREAT NOTION set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep while between horses on the turn, dug in under
steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final strides. MEGEEZER chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, dug in to
take third later yards and was gaining on the top two. GALLANT CREED chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and finished well. POLISH THE
DIAMOND pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, then flattened inside the eighth pole. CANDY LOVES
HONEY gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenths. LUZIA chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in
the lane. LOCKDOWN VANNA gave chase but faded into the turn. GHOST OF ALCINA was not a factor. JUGSY broke a step slow and never factored.

Footnotes
BROAD IMAGINATION moved to the inside and was firmly rated to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole and dug in under steady
encouragement to keep the nod through later strides. CURB THAT TIGER raced well off the early pace about the three path, eased out leaving the first turn
and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, was carried out leaving the turn then lugged in past the sixteenth pole and
missed the nod in the final strides. JUBAY rated close in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and dueled close from that point, but checked off the inside flank of Curb That Tiger in late yards. FRANK THE
BULL saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final
sixteenth. CHARTERED COURSE settled in the two and three paths on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four and five paths, left the turn outside and showed little further. SHADE TREE CORNER saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. COOL DUDE saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. HARDIN dropped well back early on and saved ground. IRISH FIRE entered the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Broad Imagination for alleged
interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Jubay.
