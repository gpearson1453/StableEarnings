Footnotes
MENDELSSOHN JOY in the second flight while between horses, came three wide when moving to challenge into the stretch, shook clear when
straightened for home, extended that margin to the wire under steady handling. MOON OVER DUBAI also in the second group early, moved off the inside
and was roused in the two path for the drive, rallied late for the place, not a threat to the winner. PROPELLANT dueled up front in the two path for six
furlongs, vied between horses and inside the winner turning for home, could not keep up with that one in chasing past the furlong marker, weakened late to
lose the place. BORN ON FIRE one paced along the inside, continued in even fashion through the second bend, lacked a serious closing response.
SPARKIN away in good order, alternated up front closest to the inside, first to blink upper stretch, continued to give way. EIGHT STRAIGHT in mid pack
while racing outside, had little for the drive. DOUBLE STRIKE broke back and failed to menace. PERFECT THUNDER off a step slow, raced well back
throughout.

Footnotes
TILLIS with the lead pack outside, continued to vie while five wide into and through the turn, put a head in front nearing midstretch and drew clear under a
brisk right handed crop. BEND IN THE RIVER narrowly showed the way up the backstretch between horses, continued to hold a slight edge turn, could no
match the winner the final eighth, held sway for the place. SAHM TEQUILA with the pace well off the inside, contested the issue through the turn between
horses and inside the winner, in a bit tight upper stretch, also could not match strides with that same foe the final furlong, not enough for the place.
LESLIE'S GOLD with the pace after breaking on top. SHANGHAI'S DREAM off a step slow, tentatively ridden while bothered by a loose horse midway on
the turn, picked off a tiring rival down the stretch while never making an impact. BAKER'S MAN off a step slow, raced well back along the inside for three
furlongs, steered out sharply to the outside of a loose horse midway on the turn, lacked a rally in the drive. MR FROST flashed brief speed along the inside,
was finished early. ATRAS stumbled badly at the start, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
COSMO in the second flight while between horses up the backstretch, moved out a bit and was three wide turning for home, three wide midstretch, edged
clear under steady handling. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS void of early foot, came five wide when beginning to advance into the lane, widest lane, up late to gain
the nod for the place. AMERICAN XPERIMENT broke alertly, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch, headed early in the turn, regained the lead when
straightened for home, could not contain the winner late, nipped at the wire to lose the runner up spot. BRAWNDO last to leave, raced in the second flight
outside, came four wide for the drive, improved position while not a serious threat to the top three. HOYA PARANOYA vied up front three wide, weakened
through the stretch. RAYMOND behind the lead pack inside, continued to save ground turn, failed to muster a response through the stretch. MEGATAP
contested the pace while between foes for a half, backed up steadily through the lane.

Footnotes
TRIBAL SPIRIT broke back, moved closer while three wide turn, came in the two path for the drive, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker,
dueled to the wire, proved narrowly best in a game effort. SWEET NELLIE close from the start off the inside, contested the issue between horses through
the turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker as the winner was challenging, dueled inside that one to the wire, outkicked in the waning strides.
HER NAME WAS LOLA forwardly placed while along the inside early, fell back the middle quarter while continuing to save ground, set down for the drive,
late run to be up for the show, not a threat to the top pair. STAR OF TOMORROW vied early while outside, three wide into the turn, fell back late in the
bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. TIZ SWEET CANDY settled off the pace, asked along late in the turn, went one paced
through the lane to also finish up evenly. BEER CAN LADY set or forced the pace along the inside, continued to vie into the stretch closest to the inside,
caved in final furlong. OLD SCHOOL FLASH last away, trailed off the inside, three wide into the stretch, not a factor. MOMMA MULE four wide into the turn
when lacking speed, trailed home to also be outrun.

Footnotes
ATTA PARTY dueled up front off the inside in the run up the backstretch, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, shrugged off the other early speed when
straightened for home, engaged in a second duel soon after inside that rival, fully extended to prove narrowly best. LORD M in the second group behind the
two dueling leaders while in the two path, steered out three wide when moving to challenge entering the stretch, bid, dueled to the wire, missed. TRAFFIC
CONTROL away in good order, three wide into the turn, gradually dropped to the inside through the lane, no threat to the top two through the lane, clear of
the others. MR. COUGAR settled in mid pack along the inside, continued to save ground turn, evenly through the lane. KRUSIN ROCKET dueled up front
along the inside, continued on equal terms with the winner through the turn, could not keep up with that one through the lane, weakened. WARNING LABEL
within striking distance while three wide for a half, came up empty for the stretch drive. SUPER GEEK lacked speed toward the inside, made little impact
while continuing just off the inside. BRASKA broke back, lacked speed well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, two path exiting, failed to rally. TALE OF
TRUTH in mid pack off the inside, came three wide for the drive, had nothing left for the stretch run. MORNING DRIVE off slowly, remained always back.
BILLHILL tired while racing four wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
ALLEGE tracked the pace along the inside, continued to save ground within striking distance far turn, steered out three wide turning for home, challenged
on the outside approaching the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. DOUBLY BLESSED prompted the pace off the inside, ranged up to
challenge the leader in the two path second bend, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner inside the furlong marker then could not keep up, fully
extended to saved the place. THUNDERSHOOK lacked early speed, moved out and came four wide for the drive, finished up willingly to be getting to the
runner up late. OFFSHORE AFFAIR moved up to take control into the first turn, showed the way through that bend, moved to the rail and continued to set
the pace the middle half mile, weakened when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. LORD DRAGON went one paced throughout while racing
outside. TWO BY TWO last to leave, trailed much of the way, lacked a serious bid through the lane. EISENSTAEDT finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
SAQEEL settled off the pace while racing three wide, moved closer three wide into the lane, stretch duel, fully extended late to prove best. CHARTER OAK
closest to the leader for six furlongs, took over in the two path second turn, protracted stretch duel inside the winner, outkicked by that one late, clearly
second best. GREATHEART bothered at the start, three wide through the second turn, rallied to be clear for the show, not a threat to the top two.
CARNIVORE broke in, and steadied to be off slowly, dropped inside, saved ground most of the way, improved position. ATKINS went one paced off the
inside, moved out a bit for the drive, improved. GET THROUGH off a step slow, trailed for six furlongs, moved out four wide midway on the final turn, passed
a couple of tiring rivals. UNCLE BERLEY in the second in the early going, faded. TREATY sprinted clear to show the way early, continued to maintain
daylight in the run up the backstretch, headed late in the final turn by the top two and stopped.

Footnotes
EFFORTLESSLYELGANT forward placed while saving ground first turn, continued inside while within striking distance, eased out in the two path turning for
home, in tight, bumped past the furlong marker, hooked up with the runner up after quickly recovering, dueled to the wire, proved narrowly best in a game
effort. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA last to leave, unhurried off the inside, began to advance second turn, three to four wide turning into the stretch, challenged
on the outside with a furlong to run, drifted in to hel p tighten up a pair of inner rivals, dueled late, outfinished. KEY TO SUCCESS void of speed, saved
ground, two path into the lane, shifted out a bit further, late run to be in time for the show. STELLAR LILY away in good order, showed the way past the wire
the first time, continued to set the pace in the two path, traveled the rail through the second bend while still in front, drifted out to help tighten the winner up
midstretch, bumped with that one and began to weaken. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS broke on top, allowed the winner to go early, chased up the backstretch,
moved closer and challenged midway on the final turn, appeared to be tiring a bit when put in tight inside the furlong marker, continued to weaken. WATCH
THIS MUNNY in the second flight while off the inside, gave way in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
KANTEX with the pace from the start off the inside, bid in the two path midway on the turn, shook clear nearing the furlong grounds and drove well clear.
FLY LIKE THE WIND broke outward but alertly to tighten up a couple of outer foes, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, briefly raced on
equal terms with the winner late in the turn and into the lane, prove no match in the run to the wire, stayed clear for the second spot. MOCHA KISS broke in,
in mid pack while off the inside, dropped to the rail by late in the turn, rallied up the inside to be up for the show. WAR MUSIC off slow, remained back for a
half, encountered some traffic late in the turn, improved position with some belated energy. SUMMORYA forwardly placed while racing three wide and
between horses for a half, had little left for the drive. CHAI TEA in tight, pinched back to be off slowly, raced back while well off the inside, five wide into the
lane, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat. TAPIT RIGHT in tight at the start, raced well back off the pace and the inside, two path into the
lane, failed to respond when called on for the drive. CHOCTAW CHARLIE in mid pack and off the inside, also lacked a closing response. BLOW SUM
SMOKE made little impact while racing three wide. FIVE QUEENS within striking distance for a half, four out to five wide turn, tired in the drive. EARLY
DISMISSAL was always outrun while racing four wide. HAMAZING LACE forwardly placed while four wide up the backstretch, faded.
