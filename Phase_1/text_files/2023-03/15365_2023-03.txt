RED MOON pressed the pace of RAINBOW STEW while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off
through the lane as an eye-catching easy winner. RAINBOW STEW was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was no match for the
winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. LUTE'S DIAMOND chased the leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain on the winner late.
STAR FINALITY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GARBET showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and did not menace. SKEDADDLE'S LEGACY raced off the pacesetters early and weakened in the drive. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME

SQUARE FOOTAGE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing five-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down LOW DOSE in the
closing yards to be going away late. LOW DOSE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and yielded to the winner through the final
sixteenth. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. QUEENS
RANSOM chased the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain in the drive. YOUONLYLIVETWICE showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHOUT IT OUT was void of early speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and did not

KATAR was away in good order to duel for the lead with RESPECT THE UNION while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival before going a half, vied with
JUSTIN AZTECA into mid-stretch, opened a clear lead and held sway to the wire. ANOTHERFORBROOKS bobbled at the start, settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. JUSTIN AZTECA chased the leaders while
racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. IT'S TURBO showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the
turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. RESPECT THE UNION broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside with the winner and
weakened after going three furlongs. YANKEE HUMOR showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
EL MAESTRO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and was up in the closing yards. OLDER BROTHER was away in
good order to duel for the lead from off the rail with GOLD CRUSHER, bumped repeatedly with that rival nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave way
grudgingly to the winner late. YOU SPLIT TENS was never far back while racing along the inside, was in tight quarters through the final sixteenth and
finished willingly. GOLD CRUSHER broke sharply to dispute the pace with OLDER BROTHER while racing three-wide, bumped repeatedly with that foe
inside the three-sixteenths pole and gave way late. XTREME MAYHEM settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed closing response. SILVERBULLITBADGER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished evenly. GRAVES MILL ROAD was off slow, lagged, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE BUMPIING BETWEEN OLDER BROTHER AND GOLD CRUSHER INSIDE THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HORESES EXCHANGED BUMPS AND MADE NO CHANGE. THE RACE
WAS HAND TIMED. FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
WESTPHAL raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was up late. SMILING GOODBYE stumbled at
the start, recovered quickly to be reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run but could not
match strides with the winner late. RONAMO lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MACCHIATO D'ORO broke
sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin after the opening quarter and gave way through the final sixteenth. BRUIN MAGIC chased the pace
of MACCHIATO D'ORO from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. PURE ROCKET lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled in with a furlong to run and was not a factor. INGENIERO chased the leaders while racing five-wide weakened after going a half and was vanned off.
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

DIPLOMATICA sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. ALICESHOUSEOFHEART lagged early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy.
PRANCE lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was up for the show. INDY'S
STAR settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was forwardly placed from the inside,
angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. V BUCKS chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going
three-quarters. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME

Footnotes
IN THE VAULT settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reach the fore inside the furlong marker and quickly drew off. WILD ARCH
broke sharply then came out nearing the half, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, came in nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied but
could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the quarter, led and gave way in the drive. GOLDEN HALO lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. NO
PEOPLE settled off the leaders from the inside and finished evenly in the drive. MANDONA raced off the pacesetters early, steadied nearing the half-mile
marker, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PARTY DRESS was away in good order to set a pressured pace, steadied nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter. REALREALGOOD was off slow and lagged throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY
AND THE RIDER OF MANDONA LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST WILD ARCH CONCERING THE COMING IN AND IMPEDING HIS MOUNT AT
THE HALF-MILE MARKER CAUSING HIM TO STEADY, AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT WILD ARCH WAS
THE REASON AND DISQUALIFIED HER FROM SECOND AND PLACED HER SIXTH. THE RACED WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED
UPON REVIEW.
