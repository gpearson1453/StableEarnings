swung widest into stretch and on for the place spot. GAMBI raced rank from gate throwing her head, rallied wide into far turn and continued on for the
dough. TWELVE SHARP off rail trip to far turn, rallied with a bid into stretch but flattened out late in the drive. PRICELESS PICTURE chased pace to the
half, stayed to deep stretch but faltered late. DARTIGA saved ground early on but gave in readily at the half and stopped. CONNELMAURA sprinted away
quickly, collared at the half and stopped badly. CINNAMON DULCE had an awkward start, inside run to far turn while never a threat. BASEBALL PEGGE
outside trip while never a factor. RAG TOWN chased pace to the half, gave way readily from there.

ONE GIANT LEAP saved ground to turn, angled out wore down leader final strides. GRIMES inside speed dueled to turn, shook free into stretch, nailed late.
DRAMA CRITIC no speed from the gate, trailed to stretch, widest run for show. DON'T LET ME DOWN good break unhurried to turn never far back, leveled
off late. BOLD BLUE close up early on with no late response when needed. AMANWALKSINTOABAR unhurried early with a bid to quarter pole, but stopped
in the stretch run. MISLEAD was through early and backed up readily. PLATINUM GHOST had a slight bobble from the gate, quickly rushed to contend to
turn but came up empty in the stretch run.

half, rallied into far turn but only ran on for place spot while best of the rest. LEGERITY unhurried to the half commenced a solid run for show spot in the late
going. PASSO A FRENTE good position throughout with no response when needed in the final furlong. WICKED INTENT had an awkward start with no
speed throughout and only improved position from the far turn. YA BEAUTY (GB) never menaced throughout. KICK OUT THE JAMS raced along evenly to
the stretch, came up empty final furlong. FONSSAGRIVES chased pace to far turn, could not keep up and gave in readily. SAVE THE FLAG good position
while never far back to far turn and dropped back with little resistance. O'BABE loped along in front to the half, gave in readily to drop back. LILLY CHROME

LEAVE IT TO KITTEN had perfect position throughout, came wide with clear run into the stretch, accelerated in the final stages with a good effort in time. T
J MUNNINGS had good position, ran up at the half on even terms with leader, raced rank throwing head, settled down and gained the lead into the far turn,
dug in gamely through the final sixteenth but nailed in the final jumps. JUANITA'S EXPRESS saved ground to far turn, angled out into the stretch run to split
horses twice in the final furlong for the show spot in a gallant effort from the quarter pole to the wire. ENGLISH CLASSIC unhurried to far turn, swept up
widest to improve in the stretch while finishing on even terms at the wire. BLACKSMITH STRONG tried hard from outside to the stretch, grinded away in the
lane to finish on even terms at the wire. JIMMY DAN raced along evenly skimming the rail to far turn, between horses into the stretch run with traffic to
navigate while mildly in the late going. READY PURSUIT taken off rail quickly, while swinging widest for clear run past the quarter pole into the stretch with
nothing left when needed. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) raced evenly in good position between horses to far turn, angled in through the late stretch with no late
kick with strong urging but no response in the final furlong. PANORAMA TRUCK secured a perfect spot three wide to far turn with nothing left and faded
back while noticeably struggling in the late going while tiring. NOMADIC FIGHTER off rail trip throughout while fading back from far turn. ZIPPER ZAPPER
speed to the front, led to the half from inside and surrendered readily from there. RED MULE raced back between horses to far turn with nothing left.
