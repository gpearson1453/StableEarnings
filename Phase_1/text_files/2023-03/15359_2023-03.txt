NOT A TRACE set the pace racing a bit off the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely in the
stretch run and held on determinedly. LONDONDERRY raced two wide off the pace, chased between rivals on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch
and dug in gamely outside to the finish. SUGAR STREAK raced off the pace inside, was in tight on the rail lacking room entering the far turn, then rallied
inside and finished evenly late. JUST STAY HOME tracked on the inside, made a rail bid on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened. BRODY
SLAM raced three wide early, then pressed the pace racing close up outside, chased three or four wide on the far turn and tired. YOURINDENIAL raced
three wide early, continued three wide off the pace and did not factor.

ANGELOFCANTERBURY quickly took control, widened on the turn and remained clear throughout with only moderate urging. OLD HEAD in tight soon after
the start, rallied inside, angled out in the stretch and was easily second best. FLIGHT raced off the pace outside, moved extremely wide into the stretch
rallying. LADY SICARIA settled off the pace outside then flattened out in the stretch. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH raced within range inside then gave way
on the turn. ARROGANTE lacked speed and was never in contention. SIRENETTA moved very wide while far behind and always outrun. ROAD TO
DREAMS was urged off the pace wide opening in the quarter and stopped. BAY AND GOLD raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter to the stretch and
gave way.

ELUSIVE RYDER raced off the pace with an inside trip, waited for room on the rail entering the far turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dueled with
LULA'S ROADRUNNER through the stretch run and prevailed determinedly on the inside. LULA'S ROADRUNNER stalked two wide early, settled off the
leader, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with the winner passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside of that rival and battled on to the finish.
MANI PEDI raced two wide off the pace, moved to the inside, then angled out in the stretch and was along for the show spot. VALERIE FIRST opened up a
clear early lead, showed the way, dueled between rivals on the far turn and faded. CANOOCHEE raced off the pace and was outrun.

gradual late gain. VASARIANO saved ground within striking range then weakened in the stretch. SENIOR INVESTMENT chased off the leaders three wide
and lacked a solid rally. MIDNIGHT ACT dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

CELTIC TREASURE angled inside early, bid to the front near the top of the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging. EL HERMANO far behind early,
rallied strongly inside through the stretch to gain place. COBBLE ROAD engaged in a heated duel inside, resisted when challenged again and finished
gamely. KODAPENDENT lagged far behind, advanced wide into the stretch closing the gap. YES SIR COLONEL settled off the pace racing wide and
lacked a solid rally. GLORY SONG raced in closest pursuit of the dueling pacesetters then proved empty. THE KING CHEEK vied for the advantage outside
for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
GAVICHI stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, took over, edged away in upper stretch and then held well late under urging.
SMOOTH AS GLASS broke awkwardly and was steadied, then rushed up along the inside into contention, dueled inside on the turn and dug in gamely on
the rail in the final furlong. GIA'S FUEGO set the pace, dueled between rivals on the turn, could not go with the top pair, then continued willingly to the end.
KENAI COOL stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out and gained mildly outside. LET'S CELEBRATE steadied at the start, raced
off the pace and failed to threaten. J J LOVES BILLY raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. DIAL A LADY raced three wide off the pace and
faded.
