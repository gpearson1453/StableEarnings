the wire but missed in a head bobbing finish. COMEONTURNMELOOSE settled off the rail on the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and finished evenly to take third later yards. GOLDEN ARROW rated a slim lead off the rail, came under

Footnotes
DALLAS angled to the rail into the first turn and settled well off the pace, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and steadily progressed from that point,
rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and dug in to take over the final yards. KATALIMA rated close off the rail the first turn, took the lead at the
three eighths pole and kept the advantage off the rail through the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught flattening stride the final
yards. TIZBIT set the early pace inside, was met approaching the nine sixteenths pole and remained close from that point, challenged nearing the three
eighths and raced close near the rail on the far turn, but dropped back into the lane and flattened the final sixteenth. BOCA BIRDIE raced in the three path
the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly to pass rivals. TAPPING SOUTH
saved early ground, showed little response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. VICTORY ROYALE stalked
the pace two deep, took a brief lead at the nine sixteenths pole but was caught approaching the three eighths and faded on the far turn. CHANNEL SCENT
leapt from the gate and was checked at the rail off the heels of Dallas into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. The Stewards
reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Katalima for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Tizbit.

nearing the seven sixteenths pole and drew close in the three path of the far turn, came inside the drifting winner at the eighth pole and dueled through the

path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn, finished well to take third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up.

weakened inside the eighth pole. JUBA BABY settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and ran evenly in the lane. IHEARTRAINACOMN rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but faded nearing the far turn.
