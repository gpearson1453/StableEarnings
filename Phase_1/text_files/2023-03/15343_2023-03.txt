Footnotes
FIRINGTOTHEFRONT fired to the front, set the pace, raced from the two path around the course, was asked at the three sixteenth pole and responded with
a nice turn of foot was able to take first place honors easily. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR raced in hands just off the leader from the three path, was accompanied
by a rival to the outside for most of the race, was challenged by an inside foe racing up the rail in the turn but was put to task and out finished the rest.
SUMMERJUSTBET HER was off a step slow, raced behind the early leaders from the three and four path, rated patiently while waiting for room along the
fence, after the half was reading and waiting for the cue, at the five sixteenth pole the rail opened up and she was cued to go, she slipped up the fence was
rallying on equal ground with all but the leader, had the eventual winner in her sights but faltered late. MELODY ROSE was took back and rated off the pace
early, raced from the five path, was in contention after the half mile pole, was asked at the three eighths pole, responded well while she circled the field from
the five and six path, was on equal ground at the quarter pole, was strongly encouraged, struggled to switch leads ands tired. WHY BEHAVE raced one off
the leader from the five path, traveled in a set until the five sixteenth pole, was still in contention at the quarter pole but had no finish and made no impact.

Footnotes
DIANNA'S JET set the pace three wide before clearing inner rivals around the first turn, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, was confronted by
an outer rival approaching the far turn, shook free of her in upper stretch, sparred with that re-bidder in the final sixteenth, and lasted. VARSITY FLYGIRL
tracked in the two path and behind the leader trio into the first turn, shifted out to the four path before advancing entering the backstretch, moved to a
pressing position with eleven sixteenths to go, sustained pressure outside of the leader from the three path around the far turn, but failed to gain even terms
before not keeping pace with that foe in upper stretch, yet kept on to attempt a rebid in the final sixteenth, but hung. CAVE CREEK settled off of the pace in
the four path, inched closer to gain show turning for home, gradually progressed while shifting ground inwardly in the final furlong, attempted to take aim
inside of the top pair in the late stages, but did not have enough. FASTED raced forwardly two wide and between horses, came into the backstretch in the
three path, lost position between horses to trail the field at the half mile pole, then took the far turn two wide, and moved up. WHATS UP SWEETS raced at
the rear in the four to two paths around the first turn, improved between horses with nine sixteenths to go, but chased along the inside around the far turn,
and tired. BROKE FINANCING tracked along the inside, but weakened after a half mile.

launched a bid, split horses at the three eighths pole as she was gaining ground, angled out at the quarter pole to gain a clear path to the wire and was set
down for the drive where she was put to the task and kept on point as she raced gamely to the finish. DREWSILLA broke a step slow, was angled out into
the four path in the first turn, was gaining ground with every stride by the six furlong pole, continued to close and pas rivals from the outside until the quarter
pole, was first tot he quarter pole shifted down to the rail, was still gamely responding to urging, and closing well, looked like the winner but was caught late
by a foe to the outside and settled for second today. YOCKEY BETTERFLY was first into the first turn while being rank , was tough down the back side after
being briefly challenged by an outside foe, finally relaxed a bit at the half mile pole while showing the way along the rail, continued to lead through the turn
but was caught by the quarter pole and tired after that. CALLING raced into the first turn five wide, continued to race mid pack five wide two more furlongs,
but was gaining ground steadliy, worked her way into the second tier just off the leaders by the half mile pole had a rival to her outside and one right in front
of her, traveled through the second turn from the two path, was three wide in the upper stretch, was asked for a final drive but had no impact.
STRAWBERRY SUNDAE was strong going into the first turn, hooked another foe from the four path in the first turn, took back at the six furlong pole, raced
from the three and four path through out and had no late rally. STARSHIP NOLA raced mid pack from the three path early, was gaining and moved in
between foes on the backside while stile racing three wide, shifted our after the quarter and raced flat. QUEEN OF THE MOON was off a step slow, traveled
five wide while racing through the first turn and down the backside from far off the pace, was gaining ground through the second turn, was in contact with the
field at the quarter pole, lugged in down the lane and faltered. BAYOU BEAUTY was strong early, had trouble navigating the first turn from the rail, settled
down the back side mid pack while still racing along the rail, started to loose ground around the half mile pole, was angled out going into the second turn
while still losing ground and was eased in the stretch. BAYOU BEAUTY CANTERED ACROSS THE WIRE AND WALKED OFF.

Footnotes
BLUE CHEESE settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked in the three path around the far turn, fanned five wide in upper stretch, rallied under hands
and heels urging through midstretch, felt a right handed crop to quicken at the sixteenth pole, surged up to the leaders nearing the wire, and narrowly
prevailed while well handled. PACIFICISLANDTIME raced forwardly in the two path while rank behind the top pair around the first turn, settled into an inside
stalking position down the backstretch, altered course outside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole, produced a bid at the furlong grounds, led entering
the final sixteenth, got challenged by a bidder on either side approaching the wire, and got nailed while saving place. COSMIC TRAIN broke a touch
outwardly at the start, rated at the rear two wide, got floated to the five path down the backstretch before tucking to the two path while trailing at the half mile
pole, then rallied in that path through midstretch, raced behind the leaders in the final furlong, split them in the final sixteenth to produce a bid, but narrowly
came up short. VENN set the pace inside of a vying rival, shook free entering the lane, dug in while meeting PACIFICISLANDTIME's challenge at the
furlong grounds, but was headed at the sixteenth pole, and yielded late. WOODS N WATER tracked from midpack in the three to two paths, tipped four wide
in upper stretch, but only managed to chase between horses. DRILLING REPORT leaned out a bit at the start, vied for the lead outside of a rival while
remaining a path away from that foe, pressed around the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened between horses. MAGEEZ was
slow into stride, raced towards the rear along the inside, shifted out to the four path at the half mile pole, but was outrun around the far turn.

Footnotes
CAJUN NINJA set the pace, drew clear leaving the half mile pole, showed the way in hand in the two path around the turn, was roused in upper stretch,
responded well and added to his margin under a drive entering the final furlong, and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. COPPER MOON bumped the
gate while breaking multiple lengths slow, trailed early on, gained in the four path around the turn before fanning to the six path turning for home, and
sustained a rally to reel in place nearing the wire. DOLLY'S GUITAR was brushed and forced into crowded quarters by an outer rival soon after the start
causing him to check mildly, pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses into the turn, gained place turning for home, but failed to gain on
the clear leader in upper stretch, gave way while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong, and was caught in the closing stages. TAKEN IT tracked in
midpack while caught five wide around the turn, tucked to the four path nearing the lane, but lacked a bid while chasing in upper stretch, and yielded through
the final furlong. CUSTOM CANDY settled far back two wide, shied four wide turning for home, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and moved up.
MARDI GRAS ALARM broke slowly, trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide and between horses entering the lane, and improved without
menacing. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE pressed the leader from the three path briefly, failed to sustain pressure at the half mile pole, chased among foes while
gradually giving way around the turn, and weakened through the lane. MAEMAEMAY stalked along the inside, but weakened. VODKA SUNRISE saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. DECORATED LADY tracked in the four path, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

gamely. COUNTERSPY left the gate a tad behind, rushed into the first turn being four wide, matched and pressured the leader from the three path, had
others join on the lead to the outside, pushed ahead matching with the other early leader through the turn launched his bis at the quarter pole and was
driven and pushed, and kept to task and almost made it to the wire first but was caught late in deep stretch and had to settle for second. FIGHT FIERCELY

eighths pole and was given the cue, gained ground through the turn, was six wide entering the stretch, was kept on point but didn't have enough to catch the
first two horses and had to settle for third. SOFT PANTS was out and cleared the inside horses making it to the turn and on the rail first, took the lead was
joined quickly by horses on the outside, settled in hands while being pressured from the outside horses through out, still showed the way with company into
the stretch, was on the fence with the lead until the three sixteenth pole where was caught by an outside rival, relinquished the lead and stopped.

Footnotes
LURE'EM IN stalked three wide, ranged up nearing the lane, bid in upper stretch, drove clear leaving the furlong grounds, wandered outwardly soon after,
but was kept to task under a moderate hand ride through the final sixteenth. JADE D'AMORE set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer foe's
challenge leaving the quarter pole, proved no match passing the furlong grounds, and lasted for place. RAGTIME BELLE trailed while a bit off of the inside,
shifted three wide in upper stretch, rallied between horses to take aim on place in the closing stages, but came up short. LADY DYNAMO laid off of the pace
along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home before being floated five wide in upper stretch, chased to bid for show approaching the sixteenth pole,
but was outkicked by an inner bidder for that position soon after. MOST EMPRESSIVE tracked two wide and among foes around the turn, shifted four wide
in upper stretch, chased to gain show at the three sixteenths pole, but flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and yielded minor rewards to
rivals on either side entering the final sixteenth. CHARMONTE saved ground while tracking around the turn, but gave way. LYNNA broke multiple lengths
slow, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and lacked a rally. PARKER EVA pressed
outside of the leader, chased that foe between horses turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL UNLIMITED dueled for the lead two wide, cleared approaching the five sixteenths pole, maintained a large margin through midstretch while hanging
on his left lead, and lasted safely as an outer rival closed in late. INSPECTOR ED bumped an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, shifted four
wide in upper stretch, and offered a grinding rally to steadily close in on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough to reel him in.
CHECKULATER stalked three wide, bid for place turning for home, sparred between horses for that position in midstretch, but was outkicked at the
sixteenth pole, and saved show. HARD KINGS broke a step slow before taking a mild brush from an inner rival at the start, saved ground far back, gained in
upper stretch, altered three wide at the sixteenth pole while hanging on his left lead, and missed reaching show. FRIEND'S DO CARE dueled for the lead
along the inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, and tired in the final furlong. MINE YOUR BIZ lacked speed in the
four to five paths around the turn, came into the lane in the eight path, and moved up outside of foes. LORD HELP ME broke slowly, trailed in the four path,
and improved. IRON FORTUNE broke slowly as well, laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, but made little impact.
REECEMANIA was fractious in the gates, brushed an outer rival soon after the start, tracked in the three path, but weakened through the lane. AMANDAS
NEW MAN took a bump from an inner rival leaving the gates, raced keenly among foes early on, chased from midpack in the two path in to the turn, but
faded around the bend.
