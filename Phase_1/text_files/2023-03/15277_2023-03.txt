Footnotes
AIR JOCK was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the quarter, angled out into the lane, reached the fore inside the furlong
marker, opened a clear margin and held sway to the wire. BARON'S SONG was away in good order to chase the leader while racing four-wide, moved up to
offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, jumped tracks nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. CAPIAT lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the second turn and finished with good late energy. KNOCKOUT GUY chased the leaders while racing five-wide and lacked the needed closing
response. MY SWEET LORD was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. BURNIN VERNON showed no early
speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. CHARLIE'S MAN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled out further into the lane and did not menace. CARRIZO SPRINGS broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin
nearing the half and weakened after going six furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
