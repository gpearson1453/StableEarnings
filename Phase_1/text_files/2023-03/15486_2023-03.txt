Footnotes
CROSS BORDER opened clear to dictate terms toward the inside, dug in to meet the challenge leaving the final turn, was kept to task and gamely led
throughout. BE YOURSELF tracked off of the inside, came under a ride leaving the final bend, took dead aim off of the last jump but was unable to best the
determined winner. MISSION BRIEF was forwardly placed, hustled along in traffic, was within striking distance entering the stretch, but lacked the needed
late response. THOMOND PARK settled in hand, mounted a mild advance between rivals, but failed to seriously threaten. POINT OF GRACE failed to
make headway. WORLD OF FOOLS failed to respond. KING BUBBLE (IRE) made a middle move, loomed a danger on the backstretch, faltered leaving the
final turn, fell over jump eight but walked off.

Footnotes
HIGH MOUNTE (IRE) settled in hand, ranged up four wide into the final turn, poked his head in front entering the stretch, shook clear off of the next to last
jump and widened. ANTICIPATING stalked the pace outside, bid between horses leaving the final turn, kept on well but was unable to match strides with the
winner. HOOROO (IRE) was unhurried, ranged up in traffic, continued on willingly through the lane but settled for the minor award. YANKEE DOODLE BOY
was unhurried, came four wide and improved position. JUNONIA was forwardly placed toward the inside, but faltered leaving the final turn and faded.
CAPTAIN MIDDLETON (IRE) was hustled along in contention, but lacked a response when called upon. SENOR SEVILLE contended to the final turn and
dropped out. THREE O ONE opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the final turn, came up empty once headed, fell off of the last jump but walked
off.

SEISMIC WAVE stalked the pace toward the inside, got through to make his bid entering the stretch, came to level terms off of the last jump, came out
under lefthanded urging, bumped FINDING FREEDOM soundly, was straightened away and edged clear. FINDING FREEDOM opened clear to set the
pace, was collared nearing the final jump, was headed and bumped when the winner came out, was carried out nearing the wire and grudgingly gave in.
CARL TIMOTHY was allowed to settle, came up empty on the final turn and retreated. SUMMER ANTHEM showed little. GIRL DAD tracked three wide,
launched a bold bid entering the stretch, drew even nearing the last jump, fell off of the last jump but walked off. The jockey of FINDING FREEDOM lodged
an objection against SEISMIC WAVE for alleged interference inside the final jump, but following the Stewards review there was no change to the order of
finish.
