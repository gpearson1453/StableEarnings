rated between rivals early, shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn, came five wide into the lane but hung, held show award. HESASMOKIN was
rated along on the outside, five wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had a mild late rally but needed more, missed show award. ROCKIN

Footnotes
JUSTICE OR APPEAL set the early pace on the inside, drew clear leaving the turn and then held sway late to prove best, driving. DESI'S REWARD tracked
the early pace, was three wide on the turn and angled out when straightened off the turn, closed well but too late, second best. FOREVER FIFI was
reserved early, wide on the urn and came widest into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. OBER DARE stalked the winner and made a
three wide bid on the turn but could not sustain that bid, lost the show award. NANASQUAN was settled early, came four wide into the lane and had a
belated rally. LITTLEMISSKNOCKOUT passed the tiring rivals. TRAJEC HOLIDAY chased the early pace, four wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
MISS MIA LIA was settled back early, inside by the quarter pole and had no response. LITTLE MOOJI chased the early pace and weakened. WICKED RED
was off very slowly, then made a wide run and stopped on the turn.

marker and slowly edged clear to prove best, driving. COMMUNICATION FAIL chased the early pace on the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside, had
to steady nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to get by the tiring pacesetter, then made a inside bid leaving the turn but was outfinished. KNOCKDOWN KID
pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the quarter pole, then was headed by the furlong marker and was
outkicked. DANCIN IN DUBAI was allowed to settle early towards the inside, eased out on the turn and came five wide into the lane but had no late kick.
SCYNTZ chased the early pace four wide, five wide by the quarter pole and weakened. ABHAR set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. GYPSY

SUNSHINE JACK stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drew off in the lane to prove much the best, handily and wrapped up late. T
C GREELEY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, was headed nearing the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the winner while saving the
place award. ASK THE UMPIRE tracked the early pace towards the inside, got out a tad on the turn and came five wide into the lane, finished willingly to
miss the place award. SIR STEELE was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally. REIGNING
CHAMPION was settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. DEE BUG chased the pace four wide and weakened. FIFTH ELEMENT showed little.
