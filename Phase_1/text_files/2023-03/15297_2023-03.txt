Footnotes
FEEL THE LOVE was forced inward and into Miss Lauren early then saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms two deep
midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch ahead of RIVER REWARDS RVF in later yards. The latter took a quick lead and angled in at the
thirteen sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Aim's Jubilee approaching the quarter but was met midway on the far turn then outfinished in a game stretch duel.
MIDNIGHT BRASS broke out and made contact with Breadman's Rosebud and was forced in early, settled in the three path on the first turn, picked up the
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. MISS LAUREN was bumped off stride
while in tight at the rail early on then saved ground, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. BAYS CASTLE dropped back from early contention and rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD was bumped leaving the gate and saved ground.
AIM'S JUBILEE came in early then stalked two deep, challenged into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but dropped back approaching the quarter
pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the riders of Feel The Love and Midnight Brass
for alleged interference early on, lodged by the rider of Miss Lauren.

near the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel. AWESOME INCENTIVE raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn then eased out into the

FULL AHEAD rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and held on
well under steady stretch handling. SLOE GIN BIZ stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two
deep on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SECRET SANCTUARY rated close toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and held on for third. CRYPTIC CODE saved ground into the first turn, picked up the chase from the nine sixteenths
pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. WILLIAM'S CAUSE stalked four wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half
mile pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SPARKLING SHIRE was never a factor. BAL ROBINSON rounded the opening turn about the four path
then saved ground on the far turn.

CHARITABLE VISIT stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took over in the three path midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to
hold on. TRIPLE JEOPARDY rated the pace inside, was met approaching the half mile pole and gave chase through the backstretch, dug in leaving the turn
and recovered second inside the sixteenth pole. LOST IN MANHATTAN saved early ground close to the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. TAPPIN FOR GLORY settled off the rail on the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS settled in
the three and four paths early on, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly to mid-stretch before
flattening stride. DUNLUCE CAISSLE saved ground well off the pace then eased out leaving the second turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished well to pass rivals. NORTHERN RIDGE stalked the earlier pace off the rail, moved to the lead two deep
nearing the half mile pole, was pressured leaving the three eighths and gave up the lead at the rail midway on the turn. MINECRAFTER settled off the pace
in the three and four paths, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened. THE IRON BANK showed little
response. LIQUID LOUIE raced inside early, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn widest, ducked out mid-stretch then ducked
in later strides and lost his rider nearing the wire.

TIME TO CHOOSE settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily gained at the rail on the far turn, eased out
leaving the turn, dueled for the lead between horses mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. LOVETHEBAND settled just off the pace and off the rail on the
first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, was carried out leaving the turn but got up for second
in the final yards. JUST MURPHY stumbled and made contact with De's Castle leaving the gate, raced two deep on the first turn and bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out toward the head of the lane but was outfinished for second late yards. BROAD IMAGINATION
took over while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn,
was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and weakened in the lane. FUNKLE rounded the opening turn about the six path, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole but showed little response. CURB THAT TIGER raced well off the pace and off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. DE'S CASTLE was bumped lightly at the break, raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response. DON'T GET
CAUGHTUP was not a factor. CRUSH 'N RUN saved ground on the first turn and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
MR HOOVER took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of HOBE SOUND leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, drifted into the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to keep that one at bay. The latter stalked from the two and three paths, challenged
leaving the second turn and raced close off the rail on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and finished well at the outside poll of the winner. BRIGHT DAWN
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third mid-stretch. SANTO
settled in the three path off the pace, left the second turn outside and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in
the lane. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled in the three path the first turn then saved ground on the remaining two turns, picked up the chase leaving the half
mile pole and flattened in the lane. DR. FERBER raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. LET US
MAKE GOLD saved ground.

RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE rated close through the backstretch, bid and took over at the rail approaching the head of the lane, raced clear past the eighth pole
and was steadily handled down the lane. RED LIL SHIPMENT set a pressured early pace inside, was met and gave chase from the three eighths pole and
recovered the advantage nearing the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the turn, was caught while drifting into the lane but dug in through the stretch to hold
second. HOLY HIP broke a bit rank then gave chase outside, raced close in the five path of the turn and dueled through the stretch for third. FESSIN UP
gave chase through the backstretch, was eased outward on the turn, entered the stretch about the six path and ran evenly in the lane. PRINCESS MIA
ROSE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MY BEST GIRL dueled to even
terms toward the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. SUDDEN FLARE gave chase and
raced off the rail on the turn. MIDNIGHT PASS chased the early pace inside, appeared off stride in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and was kept in
check from that point, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn and improved her position. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS eased to the outside, gave
chase and rounded the turn about the seven path. NANNY'S MISSION gave chase inside and weakened at the rail on the turn.
