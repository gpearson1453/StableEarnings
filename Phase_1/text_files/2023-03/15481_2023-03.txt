Footnotes
BEHIND THE CURTAIN set a well handled pace from the start, drew away turning for home and was clearly much the best in the end. DELIRIUM chased
the early pace while two wide into the turn, made a bid to upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. GRAZEN IN THE PARK was unhurried
early then rallied on the turn, was starting a run then moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive, was making up ground but was no menace in the end.
BREW CREW was unhurried early and raced two wide on the turn, was blocked behind rivals at the top of the stretch then was no threat in the drive.
TENOR chased the early pace while three wide, was used up then gave way. UNCORKED HUMOR was inside on the turn and failed to menace. SACRED
SUNDAY chased the early pace while four wide into the turn, was used up then gave way.

HERN was in a steady drive to track the pace from the two path down the backstretch and into the second turn, then dug in gamely to edge clear in the
upper stretch and held on under a strong drive to succeed in the end. SONNEMAN was allowed to settle along the rail down the backstretch, then was
gamely gaining ground throughout the far turn to menace in the early stretch then continued to close well in the end but it was not enough. SPERLE was off
well to set the pace into the first turn, was in a long drive leaving the second turn then gave way in the late stretch. CHARLIECANDO raced in the middle of
the field along the rail then rallied throughout the second turn then continued to bid even throughout the stretch. OLIVER raced down the backstretch while
four wide then bid mildly on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly instead. VANGILDER had shoe fixed prior to race, then was unhurried
early then bid from the inside on the far turn into the stretch but it was too little too late. VIM AND VIGOR settled while two wide on the back stretch, then
made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. DISCO DANZING chased the pace from the inside leaving the first turn and heading into the backstretch,

Footnotes
SI QUERE was well reserved along the rail while tracking the pace down the backstretch, was steadily urging on the far turn to rally in the early stretch then
drew clear and was kept to task to the end. FLAT OUT FREDA was out six wide while heading into the backstretch, then was moving up on the second turn,
rallied gamely in the upper stretch and closed willingly for the place prize. GOLD MEMORIES broke outwardly at the start, then was in a steady drive while
three wide on the backstretch, menaced on the far turn but came up evenly in the lane. MADAME RUE set the pace heading into the first half, was in a long
drive, cleared the far turn but was used up in the upper stretch and weakened in the end. MORO NALA was allowed to settle while racing five wide down the
backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. BRADEE CASH chased the pace from the inside heading into the backstretch then
faded throughout the second half of the course and never fired in the end. LA VALEDORA was out run and no menace. TERRI N MARY trailed behind the
field throughout the course and was no factor.
