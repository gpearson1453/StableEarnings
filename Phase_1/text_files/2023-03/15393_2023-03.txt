Footnotes
UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked three wide, moved to even terms and dueled from the three eighths pole, took the nod toward the quarter, drew clear two deep
midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. TOP HAT TREASON rated close inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching
the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, was eased three wide into the lane, dueled clear in second mid-stretch and was gaining on the
winner. FORT FORTITUDE exchanged contact with Scotty Silver leaving the gate then closed to contention and stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and recovered third in later yards. BETTER BOOGIE rated the early pace inside, was met
and dueled from the three eighths pole, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. FINAL SAY settled in the three and
four paths on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. GAMING
JACK was carried out into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SCOTTY SILVER exchanged contact with Fort fortitude leaving
the gate, drifted into the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
TAPIT TO THE WIRE rated close inside, pulled to the front at the five sixteenths pole and raced clear past the quarter, dug in under steady handling and
just lasted. JAMMIN STILL rounded the first turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in to take
second in the final yards and was gaining on the winner. ONE MORE FACTOR rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked, picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. TWEET THIS bore out leaving the
gate then rated close off the rail, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn but flattened
in the lane. CHARITABLE SPENNY was forced outward and into Tommy Shelby leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, left the turn outside and passed rivals widest. CHROME FINISH steadied at
the start, raced in the four and five paths on the first turn, left the turn outside, raced in the six path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. MAKE WAY
showed little response through the backstretch. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was
met at the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn and weakened. AUTS REVOLUTION stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase into the
backstretch but faded approaching the far turn. TOMMY SHELBY was bumped off stride at the start, rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and

Footnotes
NO DENYING DENIS saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep into the lane and dug in determinedly to hold
off the later arrival of SNEAKY LYNK. The latter rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly at the outside girth of the winner. LOVE OF GRACE
became a bit anxious in the gate and raced with the early pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out
leaving the turn, altered course from the heels of rivals mid-stretch and finished well. SMOKIN LADY broke awkwardly then closed to the front at the three
quarter pole, moved to the rail midway on the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was met at the rail approaching
the eighth pole and weakened toward mid-stretch. CLOUD MOVER came in and made contact with Grey Flamingo leaving the gate, stalked in the three
path the first turn, challenged at the three eighths pole but dropped back into the far turn and weakened. AMELIA'S DREAM came out and made contact
with GREY FLAMINGO after the start then rated close at the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail
into the far turn. The latter was squeezed after the start, rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened into the far turn.
