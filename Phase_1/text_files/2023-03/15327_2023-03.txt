Footnotes
KINGFISH STEVENS was reluctant to load, steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace three wide, angled in to pass foes nearing the quarter pole,
angled back out in upper stretch, rallied while trying to lug in and was up late. IMPOSTER SYNDROME hit the starting gate, was hustled up inside to take
the lead nearing the first turn, set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging leaving the eighth pole, shifted
back in under right-handed pressure soon after and was caught late. RANSEUR tracked the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. SIR
GOOSA was steadied repeatedly while hard to handle around the first turn, raced three wide in range and lacked the needed rally. TAKEMETOTHEMOON
failed to menace while racing three wide. MUNTALIQ broke outwardly, raced three and four wide and never threatened. ROCK THE WEEKEND played no
factor while racing two and three wide. ROYAL FOX HILLS was outrun while racing two wide. SHEA ON THE LAM was up close three wide, had no
response and was eased in the lane. IL MALANDRINO was never involved while racing in the two and three paths. REDISUR raced four wide, was through
early and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
BULLOCK dueled for the lead in the four path, took a narrow advantage rounding the turn, was roused passing the quarter pole and cued from the five path
at the top of the stretch, stayed on through the stretch, drifted out after a left handed cue in the final sixteenth and bumped a late charging outer foe, and just
held on. CANADIANSWEETHEART had an awkward start, tracked in the three path, was roused midway around the turn and urged left handed from the
four path into the stretch, shifted out to the six path just past the eighth pole and rallied to the outside of the leader, but was bumped by the drifting leader
nearing the finish causing the rider to briefly lose his balance and finished with place. MUSICAL JOURNEY prompted the pace between foes in the three
path, was ridden between foes around the turn and bid from the two path at the top of the stretch, sustained that bid under right handed urging into the final
furlong, evened out late, but held on to show. FIND YOUR PASSION stalked in the four path, was driven in the five path around the turn and was in the six
path at the top of the lane, and stayed on mildly. ANGELIC GAL trailed in the four path into the turn, was coaxed in the five path approaching the quarter
pole and floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. LIVE LIKE LAURA was brushed by an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead in
the two path, but lost ground around the turn, yielded along the inside into the stretch, and was vanned off after the race. CONCEPTUS broke out and
brushed an outer foe, chased along the inside of rivals but was no menace. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD BY THE STEWARDS AND AN OBJECTION WAS
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RUNNER-UP, CANADIANSWEETHEART AGAINST THE WINNER BULLOCK FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH,
BULLOCK WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISQUALIFIED FOR DRIFTING OUT LATE AND BUMPING CANADIANSWEETHEART CAUSING THE RIDER TO
LOSE BALANCE AND COSTING AN OPPURTUNINTY FOR THE WIN.

Footnotes
BEANTOWN BABY brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was roused between foes in the three path around the turn and into the
stretch, rallied along the inside of rivals and drew past the outer leading rival in closing stages to win. CHROMEPLATED HEART got brushed by an outer
foe at the start, was prompted along in the four path, under a ride in the three path around the turn and tipped out around the five path into the stretch, ran
on and got up for place late. CROWDING OUT dueled in the two path, took command passing the quarter pole and was cued to open up from the four path
into the lane, stayed on and led into deep stretch, but shortened late and was caught on either side in the closing stages to finish with show. SMOOTH
PEBBLE brushed the gate then with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was along the rail around the turn and coaxed passing the quarter pole,
was in the four path at the top of the stretch, drifted out thru the stretch, and kept on. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY trailed in the two path, was under a drive
around the turn and cued left handed while floating out to the five path into the lane, but was no factor. ABUSE OF POWER broke out leaving the gate,
chased in the five path, was under a ride in the four path around the turn and angled outside of foes for the stretch, but was one paced. GREAT
ADVENTURE was nudged along in range from the three path, was cued from the two path into the lane, but did not threaten. FLIP MY ID dueled for the
lead along the inside, began to drop back nearing the quarter pole, and yielded from the three path in the stretch. SUITE MADAM BLUE broke in and
brushed an inner foe, was hustled along in the five path early and was no menace.

EMPIRESTRIKESFAST prompted the pace two wide, took the lead early on the far turn, lost the advantage to DREAMLIKE near the five-sixteenths pole,
regained command in upper stretch and edged ahead under a drive. DREAMLIKE stalked the pace three wide, took the lead outside of the winner nearing
the five-sixteenths pole but was outfinished by that foe in the lane. CYBER NINJA was off a bit slowly, raced off the pace four wide, made progress still four
wide around the far turn but was no match for the top two in the lane. MONEGASQUE bobbled at the start, raced three wide, lacked a closing bid and was
vanned off. WEYHILL ROAD was hard held in range in the two path and came up empty in the lane. INFINITE SERIES set the pace along the rail and
retreated around the far turn.

HEALS THE SOUL bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, prompted the pace in the three path, bid in the four path around the turn and took a narrow
lead into the lane, and inched away from an inner foe in the final furlong to win. CORDUROY ROAD raced wellback in the five path early, was under a ride
rounding the turn and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. URANIUM set the pace between foes in the two
path, was roused along the inside around the turn, lost the lead in the two path while under urging at the top of the lane, fought on inside of foes, yielded late
but held on to show. MILITARY DRILL bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was coaxed between foes in the four path turning into
the stretch, and finished evenly. MALIBU SECRET rated in the four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced. PRINCE
AMADEUS raced off the pace in the three path but was no factor around the five path in the stretch. KASIM stalked along the inside, was ridden in the three
path around the turn, but faded in the stretch. GUILDSMAN (FR) trailed in the three path early and never factored from the six path in the stretch.
INCITATUS pressed along the inside, was ridden in the three path around the turn, but gaveway into the lane. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT chased in the two path
but was no menace.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE stalked in the three path, was cued to range up in the four path around the turn, quickly took over under a mild hand ride and opened
from the four path into the stretch, and drew clear while wrapped up through the final furlong. R ADIOS JERSEY broke out at the start, tipped inwards
leaving the chute and brushed an inner foe early, prompted the pacesetter under a hold in the four path was ridden in the three path turning into the stretch,
tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and held place under heavy urging. DRIFAROS was brushed and checked early while leaving the chute,
chased in the five path, was roused passing the quarter pole and in the six path entering the lane, and kept on for show. COLORFUL MISCHIEF brushed
with an outer foe at the start, was behind in the three path early, and never factored from the five path in the stretch. DIAMOND WOW raced off the pace in
the two path early but never threatened. FIRE ON TIME brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path but gaveway into the stretch.
AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DRIFAROS, R ADIOS JERSEY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND
PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERING WITH DRIFAROS LEAVING THE CHUTE CAUSING HER TO HAVE TO CHECK AND COSTING A CHANCE OF
BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
STARSHIP RENEGADE tracked in the four path, was roused in the two path around the turn, shifted out passing the quarter pole and bid from the six path
into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, took a narrow lead passing the eighth pole and held gamely. GANGLY rated in the six path,
ranged up while under a ride around the turn, took over the lead from the five path into the stretch, drifted slightly out and bumped with an outer foe after a
left handed cue in upper stretch, lost the lead to that outer foe passing the eighth pole and tipped back inwards through the final furlong, dug in and fought
on but could not get back up to finish with place. ROD TWO ROD hopped and broke out at the start, trailed in the five path, was cued around the turn and
angled out to the eighth path into the stretch, stayed on down the center, and got up for show late. LUDINGTON chased in the six path, was driven between
foes in the five path around the turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch, and drifted out late. KING CAB set the pace in the three path, was roused
in the two path around the turn, but yielded from the four path in the stretch. OLD TOWN ROAD raced wellback along the inside, was cued in the two path
around the turn, but was no factor from the five path in the stretch. COVER ME UP stalked in the five path, was cued in the four path around the turn, but
gaveway while shifting inside entering the lane. UNIKEE raced up close under a hold in the two path, but backed up around the turn.

LITTLE JEWEL settled off the pace along the rail, got through inside in upper stretch, took the lead near the eighth pole and drove clear. TRAIN TO

cued midway around the turn and angled out to the center of the track at the top of the stretch, and ran on under steady urging down the center to get up for
place. RAISE THE RENT raced in midpack under a hold from the five path early, was under coaxing while circling inner foes and swung out to the nine path
into the lane, and stayed on for show. HANDSOME PRINCE tracked between foes in the three path, was patiently ridden around the turn and was roused
from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. COMMANDING GENERAL pressed the pace in the three path, was roused to bid approaching the
quarter pole and was in the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. BACKWOODS BOOGIE was hustled along off the pace in the
two path, driven between rivals around the turn and tipped out to the three path into the lane, shifted inwards passing the eighth pole and bumped into
EARTH along the rail just after, and was one paced. HIGH PRESS got fractious just before the gate opened which caused a very slow start, trailed from the
three path into the turn, fanned out to the center into the stretch, but was no factor. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the pace inside, was roused when
challenged by an outer foe nearing the quarter pole and was in the three path at the top of the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole. JOE PHILLIPS
prompted the pace in the four path but faded from the six path in the stretch. EARTH chased along the inside, was driven around the turn and cued right
handed inside of rivals in upper stretch, appeared to be fighting on before being bumped by an inward shifting BACKWOODS BOOGIE just past the eighth
pole, and had to check out of it. PRIDE AND PASSION raced wellback along the inside and was never a menace. THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY
FOR BOTH THE START OF THE RACE AND POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE EIGHTH POLE, NO CHANGES WERE MADE
REGARDING THE START OF THE RACE AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HIGH PRESS HAD A FAIR START, HOWEVER, BACKWOODS BOOGIE
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE TENTH FOR INTERFERING WITH EARTH JUST AFTER THE EIGHTH POLE, CAUSING SAID FOE TO STEADY AND
COSTING A CHANCE OF BETTER PLACING.
