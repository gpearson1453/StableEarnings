Footnotes
THORNISH settled along the inside down the backstretch, moved up to engage Tale of a Storm through the far turn and finished well to get up under all out
pressure while racing two to three wide. TALE OF A STORM showed good early foot from the outside to cross over, set the early lead, dug in along the rail
nearing the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort. LADDIE BOY dropped near the back of the pack early on, swung six wide into the upper stretch and
gained ground to improve position. HOLIDAY JOKE stalked the early pace and raced evenly with no closing run while racing two wide. RUBIGINOUS was
squeezed back at the break, raced off the pace, raced four wide near the eighth pole and had no late rally. PRAIRIE SQUALL was bumped at the break,
saved ground and never threatened. FINDING SILVER chased the pace along the inside and gave way. DANCE FOR RANSOM was hustled along early
and faded.

YAYASGOTMOREGAME rated along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out through the turn into the upper stretch to race five wide and finished well
to prove best under strong handling. JOEY'S VALENTINE was coaxed along to press between rivals and kept on willingly to the wire. KENHEDOIT showed
good early foot to the pace from the inside and gave way grudgingly late. FOR REEL was off a step slow, drafted off the early going, made an advance
through the far turn, raced five to six wide into the lane, surged late and finished strongly. PHLASH DRIVE stalked the pace from the outside of foes, made
good bid while racing four wide into the lane and faltered the final eighth of a mile. L B GOLD dropped back early, raced four to five wide in the lane and
lacked a rally. BARTENDERS MISTAKE was slow early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.

Footnotes
SARCASTIC TONE raced off the early pace, was blocked nearing the quarter pole, angled through the stretch run and surged late to get up under strong
handling. BROADWAY PETE stalked the pace, moved up three wide near the three sixteenths pole to challenge, led deep stretch and finished gamely to
the wire. FLY TO THE BANK showed good early speed along the inside and gave way grudgingly. RICKEY B chased the early pace, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and had not enough. STEPHEN'S ANSWER pressed outside of foe and weakened in the drive. GUINESSEY was off a step slow, raced
five wide into the first turn and never had a response. KID'S INHERITANCE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
MEDICINE TAIL showed good early foot to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. WILSON TO LOCKETT chased the pace
from the inside and finished willingly to the wire. HULEN was off slowly, raced mid pack early, raced inside into the upper stretch, shifted three wide and
finished gamely to the wire. SHWEET PERSUASION raced mid pack early, was five wide around the the second turn and made a late gain. CAVE HILL
dropped back early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. STAGE DOOR dropped back early, raced four wide at
the eighth pole and never threatened. CAPTAIN DON failed to respond. SAMS TIME was up close early while racing two wide and faded. JU JU GUY
showed little. SMART BATTLE failed to sustain a bid.
