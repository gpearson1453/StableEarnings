around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS raced at the back of the pack on
the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and improved position in the lane. THATS ALL SHEWROTE raced off
