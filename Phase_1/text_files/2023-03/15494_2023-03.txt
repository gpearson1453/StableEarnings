Footnotes
THUNDERIAN , unhurried down the backstretch while stalking the duel, was two wide around the turn and in the stretch until taken outside near the
sixteenth pole, closed determinedly and got up late. CHELONIAN disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, gained a short lead late and gave way
grudgingly. B WEST disputed the pace two wide, opened a clear lead near the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. UNCAPTURED STORM well off the
duel down the backstretch and around the turn, swung five deep near the quarter pole and passed tired rivals. ALVY saved ground on the turn and faltered.
INDYBOUND chased the pace, angled five wide turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
STARDUST ZIGGY edged up between rivals nearing the half mile marker, saw then dueling leaders get away a bit leaving the three eighths, picked things
up under a hustling ride two wide into the lane, continued progress to the inside of LORD UHTRED leaving the eighth pole, altered in with a sixteenth to go,
closed determinedly and just got up to the inside of DART. DART , four wide early, moved up three wide between foes into the turn and engaged the leader
from the outside, dueled around the turn, took control into the stretch, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the
winner. LORD UHTRED disputed the early pace two wide and to the inside of CAVALRY COMMAND, met another challenged when engaged by the winner
leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane, wandered outward near mid stretch and faded late. SIR SMOAK , five then four wide with progress into the turn,
gave chase four wide past the five sixteenths and came up empty. CAVALRY COMMAND had speed to briefly lead, was displaced by LORD UHTRED after
a furlong, attended the pace into the turn, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and weakened. DAREDAVITE saved ground, dropped further off the pace
mid turn, swung five wide and lacked a bid. RASCALLY REBEL stumbled a stride out causing his rider to lose his irons, dropped far back, regrouped a bit
around the turn, saved ground into the lane and had belated interest.

TENAX settled in the clear and off of a hotly contested pace, shifted five wide with momentum into the stretch, straightened away and closed nicely under
right handed asks, took over with a sixteenth remaining and drew out. CARMICHAELSPIONEER sped up to the inside of rivals to take a short lead, took
pressure into the turn, dueled from the three eighths to the quarter pole, shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner but
kept on willingly to be clearly second best. NOTION TO TAPIT saved ground and well off the pace, leaving the three eighths, angled three wide for the drive,
offered a mild rally and gained the show over a tired rival. JEBSTER , away alertly, prompted the pace outside the leader, applied more pressure leaving the
far turn, sparred to head of the lane, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. PRESSING CONCERN , perched three wide off the embattled
leaders, was under a ride mid turn, angled four wide into the lane and gave way. THRUSTER broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
PEPE AND HEYWOOD , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew clear under urging. JIMMY THE KID
, well placed three wide on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied nicely. MANOLETE lacked speed off the rail, steadied to avoid the fallen
horse approaching the quarter pole, worked between horses in the stretch and had a slight rally. BERNIE'S ON FIRE set a pressured pace along the inner
rail and weakened the final furlong. OUR HOISTED MAST lacked speed, was fanned wide entering the stretch and had a mild rally outside foes. TOM
TERRIFIC trailed to the turn, steadied to avoid the spill leaving the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and passed faders. BAPTIZE THE BOY hugged the
inner rail chasing the early pace then checked and altered course to avoid the spill approaching the quarter pole. MOJAC KAT , fractious in the starting gate,
was outrun and checked to avoid the spill. FORTH disputed the pace between horses and fell when sustaining an injury approaching the quarter pole. There
was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run around the turn but no action was taken.

AIR TOKEN drifted in at the break and bumped with SAVOY, corrected and edged up to stalk, took closer order two wide behind the leaders past the five
sixteenths, steadied briefly when in tight near the three sixteenths, regrouped, closed determinedly between rivals and got up under a drive.
ARISTOCRATIC sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by CHARGE TO VICTORY mid turn, battled inside rivals into the lane, drifted out
briefly near the three sixteenths, corrected and was headed soon after, battled back to regain a slim lead in deep stretch, fought gamely but wasn't quite
good enough. CHARGE TO VICTORY tracked two to three wide, moved up to engage ARISTOCRATIC near the five sixteenths, dueled and gained a short
advantage nearing the eighth pole, kept on willingly between horses but was nipped for second. BIGMANCAN , bumped at the break, quickly gained off the
rail and reached a stalking spot into the turn, circled four wide into the lane, chased outside rivals in mid stretch and hung a bit late. THE SICARII , four wide
early, was urged along three wide into the lane and had a belated run. REDEEM EDDIE flashed speed, dropped back inside, was steadied briefly into the
turn and failed to recover. NEVERFOLD , inside pursuing the pace, gave way. SAVOY , bumped and forced inward by the winner at the break, dropped off
the pace and never got involved.

SIX THE HARD WAY , well handled down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, moved to the three path turning for home, checked to avoid the
heels of MISS FUSSY PANTS near the eighth pole, altered course outside LIQUIDATOR in mid stretch, closed determinedly between horses and was up
near the finish. LIQUIDATOR , four wide chasing the pace around the turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD ,

SEVEN'S ELEVEN prompted the pace outside, moved to join HELDISH into the turn, dueled in hand from the three eighths, responded to rousing soon into
lane, spurted clear while on his left lead in mid stretch, widened with a sixteenth to go and held firm while kept to task. LOST WEEKEND , forwardly placed
and to the inside of a rival, was ridden along mid turn, swung out to be about five wide in upper stretch and closed steadily through the final furlong. R B'S
THE BOSS, reluctant to load, stalked the leaders three to four wide, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and churned on. HELDISH broke a step slow,
rushed up to the inside of rivals to take command after a furlong, cleared, was taken on leaving the far turn, dueled inside the winner to upper stretch, failed
to match strides in mid stretch, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI , hustled along off the inside, angled five wide
for the drive and mustered up a mild response. PRIDE OF PAYTON , off the pace, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a rally.

EXCELLORATOR prompted the pace outside AIN'D DA BEER COLD, drew alongside that one near the three eighths pole, dueled to mid stretch, edged
clear near the sixteenth pole, switched to his left lead and dug in to hold sway. ARMANDO R , up close to the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two
path between horses on the far turn, eased out turning for home, drifted wide in upper stretch and rallied gamely outside the winner. AIN'T DA BEER COLD
set a pressured pace along the rail for six furlongs, dueled with the winner to the eighth pole then faded. TREASURE TROVE , steadied behind a wall of
horses entering the backstretch, swung seven wide in upper stretch and had a late rally. WISH FOR PEACE , a forward factor in the three path between
horses mid way on the far turn, lacked the necessary late effort. BOBBY G hugged the inner rail around both turns and weakened in the stretch. TORCH OF
TRUTH , four wide both turns, was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOLDING COURT cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, was confronted by BAD TEMPER mid turn, was guided three wide while dueling into
the stretch, exchanged a solid bump leaving the quarter pole, kept on under pressure past the furlong grounds and dug in tenaciously to hold firm. BAD
TEMPER tracked from the outside, edged up to engage mid turn, was fanned four wide battling into the lane, bumped soon after, sparred on near even
terms leaving the eighth pole, continued gamely but kept at bay the final seventy yards. RATIONALMILLENNIAL stalked inside, shifted out giving hard
chase in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and finished evenly. RED WINE TIME hesitated at the break spotting the field a few lengths, was put a ride
soon after, gained four wide into the far turn, chased but lacked a serious finish. TORRE BRANCA , well placed in the clear, was pushed along mid turn and
gave way. CAMELIA ROD saved ground, failed to kick on around the turn and retreated. MARTHARITA steadied at the break, saved ground and dropped
back early.
