Footnotes
BACK BEAT lacked early foot, moved out, came four wide out the turn, moved out a bit further, rallied down the middle of the strip, late bid, best. CRYSTAL
CRESCENT prompted the pace while along the inside and in hand, advanced and challenged along the rail turn, took over, showed the way into the lane,
clear a furlong out, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. BOTANY within striking distance while off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn,
lacked a winning kick late. TALE OF TRUTH off a step slow, three wide into the turn, between foes into the stretch, also lacked a significant late punch.
NEW DICE void of speed, inside through the turn, improved while continuing toward the rail into the lane, mild late interest. WARNING LABEL forwardly
placed while racing outside, four wide exiting the turn, had little left for the run to the wire. DEPART in mid pack outside, four wide far turn, lacked a
response when called on for the drive. THE FIVE B'S hopped slightly at the start to break back, was used a bit to move up, briefly clear after a quarter, got
out a bit to be three wide into the stretch, stopped. DRIVER finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
OBVIOUSLY TOO broke alertly, dueled up front in the three path, disposed of the other speed to be clear upper stretch, drifted in under a right handed crop
past the furlong marker, switched sticks, drifted out under left handed pressure while clear with a sixteenth remaining, enough left to hold the next rival safe
in the waning strides. PROMISING SHOES broke in and a step slow, raced in the two path through the turn, steered out past the furlong marker, came out
further under a left handed crop as the winner was drifting out with half a furlong to run bothering HOLDING PATTERN a bit, was straightened and finished
willingly to be getting to OBVIOUSLY TOO in the late going. HOLDING PATTERN in mid pack and outside, raced four wide through the turn, was chasing
the top two when bothered slightly with a sixteenth to run, finished up evenly to be clear of the others. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN off a step slow, angled in a
bit to race in the two path through the turn, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. OJITOS away in good order, dueled up front just off the inside,
first to blink approaching the furlong grounds. ORBITAL STARR within striking distance in the early going along the inside, fell back through the turn, no
impact through the lane. ROCK CITY ROCKET restless in the gate then hesitated to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back and inside, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. AFRICAN WARRIOR forwardly placed while racing three wide, gave way in the drive. WHENTHEDOVESCRY
lacked speed outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, faded to trail home. FOLLOWIING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PROMISING SHOES AGAINST OBVIOUSLY TWO FOR INTERFERENCE,
THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BIOGENIC BABE closest to the leader while inside, moved out to be three wide by late in the turn, engaged the pacesetter from the outside upper stretch,
drew clear under pressure. STAY FABULOUS in the second flight early while between foes, also came three wide for the drive, rallied for the place.
COLLECTED GLORY came in at the start to bother TRUE EMOTION, raced back off the pace, three wide into the stretch, along for the show late. JUMPIN
JUDY sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch toward the inside, continued in the two path the turn when clear, faltered when headed by the
winner approaching the furlong marker, continued to weaken to lose a couple of more positions late. TRUE EMOTION off slow then was bothered, raced
back and never menaced off the inside. MOMMA MULE off a step slow, was never a threat. FREE WILL in mid pack early three wide, steadily faded.

Footnotes
YACHT ROCK (IRE) broke with the leaders, fell back from between rivals steadily for three furlongs, angled out five wide late in the final turn, set down,
collared leader past the furlong marker drove clear. UPTOWN HUSTLER broke alertly, cleared to the two path soon after, continued to hold a daylight
advantage into and through the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner when confronted by that one inside the furlong marker, proved no match late, fully
extended to save the place. MORNING DRIVE off slowly, lacked speed while saving ground through the turn, continued back into the stretch, found best
stride too late through traffic. SKYLINE off a step slow, lacked speed for a half, came four wide out of the turn, improved position, gaining for the place.
UNCLE RAY in the second flight while racing outside, four wide out of the turn, had little left for the stretch run. BRASKA off slow, continued to late for a half
off the inside, managed some late gain to improve position. GOLDEN LUNA in the second flight while between foes, gave way the final furlong to lose
several positions. FREER chased the runner up from the second flight and along the inside, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
DEPUTY CONNECT stalked the leader from off the inside, advanced and challenged outside that one, advanced and challenged midway on the second
bend, shook clear in upper stretch, enough left to withstand the runner up. ANDY CANT broke in, was straightened to race in mid pack while off the inside,
bit closer into the lane, switched out late, coming. MOUNT CRAIG settled well behind the pace along the inside, fell back to trail in traffic late in the final turn,
steered out, in tight in additional traffic with a furlong to run, brushed with BOLZY soon after, late interest to be closing the gap on the top two late. BOLZY in
tight at the start, raced in the second flight outside, remained on the outside in the three path into the lane, brushed with a furlong remaining, lacked a
significant closing kick. ATLANTIC DANCER last away to trail early while saving ground, moved out, came four wide out of the final turn, improved a bit in
upper stretch then flattened out. LIFE ON THE NILE forwardly placed along the inside, pulled onto backstretch. continued to save ground while saving
ground second turn, in some light traffic when beginning to tire with a furlong left. GOIN TO THE SHOW broke alertly, sprinted clear into the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch inside, gave way when headed by the winner late in the final turn. LAPINSKI UNION finished early, trailed home.

ROYAL SPA broke back, moved up in the second flight inside, waited with a half remaining under firm restraint, continued to save ground turn, jumped on
an opening along the rail when straightened for home, drove well clear. UNIFYING lacked speed while racing outside, three to four wide turn, rallied into the
stretch, challenged and put a head in front with a furlong remaining, could not match strides with the winner late, clearly second best. SECRET
STATEMENT behind the pace off the inside, shuffled back from between horses into the turn, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be along for the
show. PIONEER PARADE vied up front along the inside, put a head in front late in the final turn, showed the way into the lane, brushed with THUNDERS
ROCKNROLL past the furlong marker when headed by the runner up, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. THUNDERS ROCKNROLL off a step
slow, raced back off the pace, vied into the lane, lugged in a furlong out, brushed, faded. CRACKALACKING set or forced the pace off the inside, retreated.
EMPIRE OF MY OWN forwardly placed and three wide, finished early.

GO GO GO in the second flight inside, in traffic late in the turn, moved out to be three wide for the drive, outside bid midstretch, drove well clear. THE X
FACTOR hesitated at the break, lacked speed, asked along late in the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, rallied down the middle of the strip to be
clear for the place. TENZING bump break, set or forced the pace along the inside, brief raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch then could not
keep up or contain the runner up, saved the show. ROWDY DAISY bobbled then was bothered at the break, settled in mid pack and outside, got out and
was six wide by late in the turn, mild late interest to improve position slightly. LUNCH LADY with the early pace off the inside, gave way from between
horses upper stretch. QUALITY CHROME in the main body while racing just off the inside, went evenly through the lane. TRUEBLUEGIRL bumped at the
break, saved ground to no avail. LITTLEDABWILLDOO broke in, bumped, recovered to press the pace three wide, gave way in the drive. WILD BIZNESS
roughed at the break, remained always back. KOOTENAI FALLS bothered, off slow, trailed in remaining always back.

Footnotes
DEALING JUSTICE broke back, was outrun up the backstretch, steered out turning for home to bother a tiring TIZPLENTY exiting the turn, rallied from
between foes in midstretch and proved narrowly best in a determined effort. HEADLAND hopped at the start to break a couple of lengths behind the field,
trailed for a half, four wide turning, rallied outside the winner, gained the advantage late, nipped in the late going. AMERICAN LILY broke well, narrowly
showed the way in the run up the backstretch, garnered a slightly larger advantage when straightened for home, could not contain the top two. I'M THE
BOSS OF ME dueled up front in the three path for over a half, also weakened in the final furlong. SARAH HARPER fell back off the early pace after
breaking with the leaders, came four wide for the drive, lacked the necessary closing response. LASTCHANCEFORLOVE in the second flight while racing
off the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. TIZPLENTY back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, was appearing to tire when
bothered slightly by the winner turning for home, remained back. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TIZPLENTY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN WAS QUICKLY DISALLOWED.
