Footnotes
SAN MARCO CITY lagged back to the half, rallied with a run in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and prevailed at the wire. PRINCE OF ROSES
sharp speed from the gate, clear to quarter pole, battled in the final stages but lost the head bob in a game effort. CONNECT ME raced along evenly to the
stretch run, battled on gamely to wire for the show spot just missing the place award. DOMHNALL chased pace to quarter pole but gave way in the stretch
run. COUNT MY DREAMS good position to the half but could not keep up and wilted far back in the stretch run.

BAKERS BAY unhurried between horses to turn, angled out, clear ridden out. NOBALS sped to the front, stayed on to deep stretch no match late. NIGHT
TIME never far back, in a drive around the turn and stretch for show. FRIAR LAURENCE awkward from the gate, lagged back inside while evenly late.
THANKS MR. EIDSON close up to the stretch, faltered back in the final furlong. GALLANT GUY in contention to the turn, used up and faded back. RACE
DRIVER flashed brief speed, gave way readily from the turn.
