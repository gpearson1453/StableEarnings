Footnotes
DEJOHN took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced clear nearing the five sixteenths,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. STRINGFELLA stalked the winner two deep, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn and proved no match in the lane. PLAYBOY ROY settled inside
on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the turn and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the lane and ran evenly to deep stretch before
flattening stride. CHERRYS CROSS saved early ground racing well off the pace, eased outward and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
in the four path, left the turn outside and passed rivals. GORUN rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. LET'S GET PHYSICAL saved ground on the opening turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. A FAREWELL YODEL raced close to the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase into the backstretch but
faded toward the far turn. Due to weather and track conditions, the remainder of tonights card has been cancelled.
