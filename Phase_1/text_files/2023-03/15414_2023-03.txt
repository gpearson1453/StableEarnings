Footnotes
COMMERCE COMET broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path in the run up the backstretch, continued to alternate through the turn and into the stretch,
spirited drive to the wire, fully extended to prove narrowly best. PATTON'S WAR also away in good order, raced inside the winner throughout, held a narrow
advantage a furlong out, proved stubborn to the very end. MACHO VILLA last away, dropped to the inside before a quarter, moved up closer along the rail,
waited behind the top two into the turn, chased stretch while remaining inside, no match for that pair, well clear of the others. SOYBEAN MAN in the second
flight while three wide and between horses into the turn, fell back turning for home, battled back a bit to improve late, no real threat. INTO IT in the second
while widest, four wide turn, three wide into the lane, had little left for the drive. STORMIN ARMY within striking distance between foes, firm restraint into the
turn, also tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE ROCKER prompted the pace while racing three wide, set down for the drive, bid nearing midstretch, wore down rival, edged clear. MISS RITA broke
alertly, cleared in the two path the opening furlong, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when the winner challenged nearing the furlong
grounds, gave ground grudgingly to that one, held sway for the place. JERI DAWN in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, along for the
show with a mild late rally. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE within striking distance behind the leader, continued to show the way through the turn, lacked a closing
punch and was caught late for the show. GUEST IN MY HEART in the second flight three wide early, steered to the inside late in the turn, also was going
evenly in the late going in lacking a closing response. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN stumbled at the start, recovered and moved up closer along the inside,
steadied when in tight early in the turn, moved out in the two path for the drive and went evenly to the wire. SHE'S HAMAZING lacked speed while racing
three wide, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. MISS DUTTON off a step slow, remained always back. SWEETNESS TO stumbled badly at
the start, also was never involved.

Footnotes
MULBERRY STREET settled off the pace in mid pack off the inside, closer second turn, angled out to the three path when advancing on the two leaders
turning for home, outside bid, drew clear late. HANKS broke on top, alternated up front in the two path, between horses upper stretch, could not match the
winner late, proved determined for the place. PRIMER DIMER moved up to duel along the inside into the first turn, continued to duel the middle half, also
could not match the winner late, outkicked for the place. ZOFFA forwardly placed while racing in the three path, continued within striking distance final turn,
lacked a closing response. GENERATOR also in the second flight, raced in the two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, also found lacking in the
drive. EGOMANIAC lacked early speed inside, continued to save ground second turn, made little impact through the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY lacked
speed outside, four wide into the far turn, failed to rally. STUD PUPPY hopped at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SAND MOUNTAIN broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, responded when challenged turn, headed by the runner up in upper stretch, battled back closest to the
inside to prevail in game fashion. ESPIONAGE chased the winner early, moved up to join that one from the outside into the turn, dueled through the turn
and into the lane, briefly put a head in front when straightened for home, outkicked the final furlong. GREAT FACES mid pace and off the inside, continued
in the two path through the turn, chased that pair into the stretch, moved out a bit nearing midstretch, no match to the wire, held the show. CARL G last
away, three wide and in traffic into and through the turn, continued to be mired in congestion early stretch, split foes, improved a bit when clear. COST
BASIS lacked early foot well out in strip, traffic late backstretch, four to five wide three furlongs out, back to the four path into the lane, lacked a closing
response while remaining widest through the lane. MORNING SNOW forwardly placed along the inside, also came up empty for the stretch run. MAGIC
CASTLE in the second flight while racing three wide, retreated through the lane. OCELOT lacked speed outside, five wide into the stretch, failed to respond
when called on exiting the turn.

Footnotes
LEGENDARY GIFT away in good order, pressed the leader up the backstretch in the two path, dueled into the lane, shook off the other speed nearing the
furlong grounds and kicked clear. DISTORTED SECRETS behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the lane, shifted out for the
drive, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. KEWPIE DOLL broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, even terms
with the winner into the lane, could not keep up with that one to the wire, caught late for the place. TIME FOR GOLD pressed the issue up front while four
wide, continued outside, lacked a closing kick. BURNADEBT fell back to trail after the start, remained void of speed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals while never a threat. STYLIN N PROFILIN prompted the pace three wide, faltered in the drive. MARY ALICE tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
PINK ACE bothered slight just after breaking with the leaders, raced in the second flight between horses in the run up the backstretch, set down in the two
path for the drive, collared leader inside the furlong marker, drew clear and then held the runner up comfortably safe late. GREEK HEIRESS broke back,
raced back early and three wide, angled out to be four wide into the lane, rallied to finish well clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner in the
waning strides. JUMPIN JUDY broke on top, clear before a quarter, widened through the turn inside, continued hold a comfortable advantage into the lane,
caved late when headed by the winner with less than a furlong remaining, could not contain the runner up. COLLECTED GLORY in the second flight outside
the winner and three wide, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. MISCHIEVOUS ME last to leave, bothered early, trailed, improved position
while not a serious threat. PLUS POWER came in just after the start to bother MISCHIEVOUS ME, raced in mid pack in the two path, asked along late turn,
failed to rally. TAPICITA in the second flight along the inside, tired. DANKE FUER ALLES finished early to be always outrun.

FROSTED GRACE settled behind the pace along the, raced under stout restraint up the backstretch, advanced and challenged along the rail far turn,
dueled into the lane, proved best under steady handling. KUPUNA moved up to set the pace into the first turn inside, moved out in the two path for the run
up the backstretch, allowed the winner the inside far turn, dueled with that one into the lane, outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. SPA CITY in
the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the second bend, proved no match for the top two in the drive, determined for the show. MYSTIC
NIGHT last away, raced back off the pace inside, continued evenly while saving ground through the second bend, not enough for the show late. THOMAS
SHELBY prompted the runner up outside that one for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. BACKGROUND settled off the pace in the two path,
lacked a closing response. AIN'T LIFE GRAND back off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, also failed to mount a charge.

Footnotes
TEJANO TWIST fell back after the start, unhurried into the turn, angled out five wide late in the turn when looking for room, set down, accelerated when
asked in upper stretch, won going away while being kept to task with a left hand crop. MILES AHEAD forwardly placed and along the inside up the
backstretch, steadily fell back through the turn while continuing inside, shaken up late in the bend with a left handed crop, responded and came back for the
place, no threat to the winner. EDGE TO EDGE broke well, held inside position in the first flight early, dueled through the turn closest to but not on the
inside, proved no match for the winner late, outkicked late for the second spot. SPANKSTER settled off the pace toward the inside, in some traffic late in the
turn between foes, displayed a mild amount of late interest when clear. MORELLO off a step slow, raced well back, dropped inside turn, improved up the
inside to also improve position, never a serious threat. PIRATE RICK closest to the dueling leaders while racing in the four path for a half, weakened.
FLASH OF MISCHIEF lacked early foot outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, displayed a mild amount of late interest to pick off a rival or two,
never dangerous. COGBURN broke alertly, with the pace outside, dueled in the three path through the turn, faltered. BAYTOWN BEAR in the second flight
while racing off the inside, had nothing for the drive. EMPIRE OF GOLD outrun early, lodged a mild middle move four wide midway on the turn, gave way in
the drive.

Footnotes
LAST SAMURAI settled off the pace and the inside, four wide when beginning to advance in the four wide, raced the front while still in the four path into the
lane, wore down the early leader under steady handling. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke on top, set a modest pace along the inside, responded when the
winner challenged entering the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late, clearly second best. FORZA DI ORO closest to the early leader off
the inside, lost some position in the second turn, came three wide for the drive, came back to narrowly capture the show while not a threat to the top pair.
VITTORIO within striking distance along the inside early, moved out and raced closest to the runner up in the two path into the far turn, lurked through that
bend and into the lane, lacked a closing punch. TAWNY PORT off a step slow, void of speed for six furlongs, came four wide for the drive, improved position
while well out in the strip, not a serious threat. SILVER PROSPECTOR in mid pack while saving ground, continued inside into the final turn, waited in traffic
late in that bend, got through to improve through upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. RATED R SUPERSTAR in mid pack and off the inside,
had little left for the drive. NECKER ISLAND back off the pace, steadied in traffic late first turn, remained back in failing to rally. CALL ME FAST off a step
slow, also steadied in tight quarters in the back onto the backstretch, lacked response.

Footnotes
GOLD STRATEGY off the pace while racing three wide, advanced late in the turn, challenged on the outside inside the furlong marker, edged clear. NGALA
shuffled back at the break to be off slowly, raced back and well wide, came six wide for the drive, finished up willingly down the middle of the strip to annex
the place. RUNNINTHESTREETS in mid pack while racing off the inside, steered out to be four wide into the lane, prominent midstretch, lacked winning
punch. COUNT IT ALL JOY forwardly placed while racing three wide up the backstretch, advanced and challenged into the lane, narrowly showed the way
past the furlong marker but could not last. DELTA MOON lacked speed, bothered when three wide late in the turn, came four wide for the drive, improved
position without posing a serious threat. MAGNOLIA MAE dropped inside, saved ground turn when within striking distance, came up empty for the stretch
run. DIAMOND GRAND fell well back after the start, lagged for a half, angled four wide for the drive, passed tiring rivals. HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL hesitated
at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to mid pack inside, traffic, altered course late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch.
KOKOMO STARLET broke well, pressed in the run up the backstretch, put a head in front late in the turn, vied past past the furlong marker and gave way.
MELANIA T in mid pack and off the inside, tired in the drive. WILD ROSEY remained always back. MUSIC MISTRESS broke sharp, flashed good early
speed along the inside for a half, stopped while in traffic turning for home.
