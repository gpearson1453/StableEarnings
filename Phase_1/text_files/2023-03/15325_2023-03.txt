Footnotes
OGA BEAR showed good early foot from the inside to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. RUNNING JESSE stalked
the top pair, raced three to four wide around the far turn and got up for the place position late. POVERTY FLATS was void of early speed, moved up from
the outside in the stretch run and made a good late gain. MOONSHINE MAX was hustled along, raced two to three wide between rivals and had not
enough. LAST APPEAL chased the early leader while racing just off the inside and weakened in the drive. PICTURE ME CLASSY was hustled along from
the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
LION HEART LEGEND quick to begin to set the early pace and held well to be well clear under steady handling. THREE TIME CHARMER chased the early
leader and kept on while racing three wide deep in the lane. SUBSCRIPTION was coaxed along from the inside and kept willingly to the wire. GIANT
GAMBLE was hustled along, raced three wide through the far turn and had not enough. FLY FIRST CLASS raced mid pack early, was four to three wide in
the lane and raced evenly with no closing run. DAVE was bumped, shuffled back at the start, raced five wide around the far turn and never threatened. GEE
WHIZ WHO dropped back early, raced five to six wide in the lane and had no response. CHERUBIM raced near the inside and lacked a bid. CARPE
VICTORIAM was bumped, squeezed back at the break, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
VIRTUALLY raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, circled the field six wide into the upper stretch and finished strongly while
surging clear late. FABULOSITY showed good early foot to set the early pace and finished second best. RAINBOW DASH was unhurried early, moved up
four wide near the eighth pole, angled in through the stretch run and gained ground late. WUMPMUG stalked the pace along the inside and had no final
winning bid. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE chased the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the lane and raced evenly with no closing run. RETRO RITA
raced mid pack early, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch, was blocked deep stretch and had not enough. DOLLY DIMPLE was
forwardly placed to lay up close while racing three wide and weakened. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC raced mid pack early on, was near the inside into the
upper stretch and never threatened. MOONSHINE LILY failed to respond. SURELY A LEGEND raced far back and never threatened.
