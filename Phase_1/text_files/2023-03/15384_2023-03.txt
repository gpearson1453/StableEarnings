Footnotes
GRAB THE GOLD set the early pace on the inside, drifted out at the three sixteenths marker, then dug in gamely in the stretch and held on to prove best,
driving. RILEYS DUDE stalked the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and loomed boldly nearing the furlong marker but hung, missed.
DYNAMITE KARMA was allowed to settle early, made a inside move nearing the quarter pole and was gaining late. STRIKING MOON bobbled slightly at
the start, tracked the pace in between rivals at the half mile marker, two wide on the turn and weakened. CHRIS AND DAVE chased the pace four wide and
came six wide into the lane, shifted in and had no rally. ANNAMATED MOON stalked the early pace three wide, in between rivals on the turn, swung out five
wide leaving the turn and was empty. COLONEL MOORHEAD chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

on and crossed over to the inside on the backstretch to set the pace, but weakened by the quarter pole. OFF THE MEDS failed to menace. HIZAAM was

PEPE TONO was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the turn to move into contention, continued that move off the turn and edged clear in
the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. SCARY LARRY was rated early three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter
pole, gained a short lead nearing the furlong marker and then could not go with the winner late, held place award. TURNS was off slowly, advanced on the
inside, was boxed nearing the quarter pole, blocked off the turn and still blocked by the furlong marker, angled out by the sixteenth marker for racing room
and rallied to just miss the place award. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY set the early pace on the inside and opened up a big advantage, was headed by the
quarter pole and faded the final furlong. POCO CHARLIE was reserved early, inside on the far turn and never factored.
