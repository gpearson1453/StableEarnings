LEGEND'S SONG trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn, began a bid from the four path passing the quarter pole and gained ground
quickly to pull clear late. WICKED SAUCY led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and was caught in late
stretch after drifting mildly in the final furlong. GINGER SPARKLE raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and improved
position in the lane. ANGELIC STORM stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the four
path coming around the turn and faded in the stretch. TOOSWEETFORME raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, continued around the turn in the three path and showed no kick. TEA'S DREAM tracked the pace setter between horses up the backstretch, began to
drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and tired further from there.

Footnotes
WAR CROSS raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid coming around the far turn, was
fanned out to the five path entering the stretch and kicked clear in the final furlong. CUZ saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader between
horses up the backstretch, dueled from the four path coming around the far turn, swung wide into the stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased
that rival home. CANDY COVE led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled around the far bend, still in the two path,
and was outkicked in the stretch. ARIES REIGNS raced in the two path early, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the
far turn and tired from there. ODDS ON reared up tremendously at the break, trailed throughout and was declared a non starter. A STEWARDS INQUIRY
WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SIX, ODDS ON, DID NOT HAVE A FAIR BEGINNING AND WAS
DECLARED A NON STARTER.

PRALINE'S CAT saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend, drifted out in
upper stretch, coming into close contact with MASTER SERGEANT, veered in sharply from there to bump with THE SWAYZE EXPRESS near the sixteenth
pole and kicked clear late. CORE FACTOR raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
second turn from the four path, drifted in and bumped with THE SWAYZE EXPRESS in upper stretch and chased the winner home in the lane. THE
SWAYZE EXPRESS saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path,
bumped with CORE FACTOR and was forced in in upper stretch, gained ground, was bumped hard and took up sharply when PRALINE'S CAT veered into
his lane near the wire and kept on from there. MASTER SERGEANT saved ground around the first bend, tracked the leader between horses up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, raced in tight quarters with PRALINE'S CAT in upper stretch and kept on to the finish. EL
BUFFALO raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around
the second turn and finished evenly. DAD'S ON A ROLL saved ground early, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn
in the four path and never threatened. CHIEF BULLET raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground
around the far turn and made no bid. FOREVER SAUCY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the outside, navigated the far bend still in the three path and tired in the stretch. GO GO GREEN raced in the two path around the first bend, settled off
the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was empty in the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
