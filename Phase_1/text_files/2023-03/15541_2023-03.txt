Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE SAINT settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and was up in the closing yards. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was
away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. LILA'S
LUCKY LADY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside and finished with good late energy. METAROSE pressed the pace while racing three-wide
and gave way after going a half. MS SALLY was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. GOLD INCLUDED
showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. SILLY NOTION lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

NAPOLEONIC CODE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off as
the handiest of winners. GLENDALE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the
drive but clearly second best. JOHN'S KID lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. KNOCKOUT GUY
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. DIXON TUFF was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the
second turn and weakened. CHARLIE'S MAN showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

CASHANOVA was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin
soon after, widened and drew off as a handy winner. CIBERTRUCK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, was
no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to be second best. CLUB MESQUITE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn, reached a striking position and failed to gain in the drive. MOONLITE GRAHAM was off slow, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through
the second turn and finished evenly late. KALINE sprinted clear soon after the start and weakened after going a half. OUR DANDY'S BOY raced off the
pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MADIGAN SQUEEZE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane, drifted in late and held gamely. BOUNTY OF
GOLD settled off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and rallied late to gain the place. BIG BLUE NOTE broke sharply to press the pace
from the inside, was checked late and lost the place. BELLS AND WHISTLES was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. MISCHIEF MAMA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. MISS AGGIE BLING was never
far back, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. DODROPIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
TIMBERLAKE GAGE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE CHECKING OF BIG BLUE NOTE IN THE FINAL YARDS AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THEY CONCLUDED THAT
MADIGAN SQUEEZE HAD DRIFTED IN TO CAUSE THE CHECKING CAUSING BIG BLUE NOTE TO LOSE THE PLACE AND DISQUALIFIED MADIGAN
SQUEEZE FROM FIRST TO THIRD. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

INDY'S STAR was away in good order to duel for the lead with WAIT A SEC, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead soon after and
held sway to the wire. LOOKIN SO LUCKY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but
finished with a steady gain. IN THE RED lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. IF YOU
WANT IT lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. DIRT FLIRT raced off the pacesetters early, saved
ground through the turn and lacked the needed rally. WAIT A SEC disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. APART OF
MY CHARM showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
