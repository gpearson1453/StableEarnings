gamely outside of AVA K'S BOY, dueled with that rival to the wire and prevailed. AVA K'S BOY raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, bid between
rivals at the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong, dueled to the wire and just missed. BIG BROWN SHOES vied between rivals early, then
stalked the pace, bid on the turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. JOVIAL vied inside for the early lead, then took over to set the pace, dueled
on the turn and weakened. FULL CONTACT chased on the inside and tired. STRAWBERRY CONE vied outside for the early lead, then stalked outside,
chased on the turn and tired. RUTHENIAN raced off the pace inside and did not factor. WHERESTHEPASSION was steadied at the start, raced off the
pace, moved up three wide on the turn, then gave way.

HOOPLA set pressured pace in the two path, repelled rivals and stayed safe under steady handling. ICONIC LEGACY broke very slowly, rushed to
contention wide and continued gamely to the finish. ABUELO NUNO raced inside behind the dueling pacesetters then made a gradual late gain. RUFFY
prompted pace along the inside then weakened slightly in the stretch. DOCTOR DOOM saved ground early, moved outside on the turn and was no threat.
HOTPOT was fractious in the gate then lunged at the start losing best chance and chased wide.

Footnotes
NINTH OF APRIL set the pace on the inside, dueled with GOLDEN WILDCAT on the turn, responded when roused, pulled away and was kept to the task.
GOLDEN WILDCAT vied three wide early, then pressed the pace, bid on the turn, dueled outside of the winner, could not stay with that rival and remained
clear for the place spot. AMERICAN DAY vied two wide early, then stalked, chased two wide on the turn, lacked a bid and finished evenly. LT'S
JACKNTHEBOX stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. JUNGLHERLY LOVE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the
turn, steadied in tight at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. PRINCIPE was outrun.
