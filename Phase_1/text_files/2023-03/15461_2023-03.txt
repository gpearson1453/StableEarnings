Footnotes
RUSSIAN ALPHABET was bumped lightly just after the break but unhindered in making the lead, dueled inside a rival but racing just off the rail, edged clear
by the three-eighths, held sway with mild urging through the lane. LUKE ATTACK bumped lightly with a rival at the start, tracked the dueling leaders inside a
rival but off the fence, came out in upper stretch in range of the leader but could make no headway. GUST OF WIND was bumped into a rival while bobbling
and then was shuffled back just after the start, drifted out early, moved back nearer inside for the turn trailing the field, swung six wide into upper stretch and
finished well. WICKED SUPRISE was bumped into a rival after the start, pursued from inside off the leaders, saved ground but failed to rally. ROCKET MAN
ATTACK bumped with the outside rival then veered into the inside foe at the start, dueled outside the winner two to three wide for three furlongs, could not
kick on. LIGHTNING CASHES stalked the leading pair from outside a rival three to four wide, came up empty and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
IRONMAN RICHIE switched outside the leader heading up the backstretch and moved forward to press three wide heading into the turn, drifted out leaving
that bend, struck the lead outside the three-sixteenths pole, forged clear under urging. SUNDAY MISCHIEF was moderately coaxed forward from the start
to set the pace in the clear racing off the rail, faced pressure on the turn, was outkicked but second best. TEA AFTER BALLET angled in leaving the
backstretch, saved some ground near the rail through the turn, ran on evenly. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE broke a half-step slowly, was outpaced early and never
near enough to threaten. K T'S JILTED GROOM switched well off the inside chasing the leading pair in the four path into and on the turn, flattened out
thereafter.

FIRST SQUADRON set the pace in the clear, widened into the turn racing in the two path through that bend and drifting out a bit turning for home, held off a
late challenge by ARCH FLYER, who broke inwardly a bit, tracked from inside, saved ground and kept on in the lane to close the gap. PRANCIPANTS
raced last but one off the inside going in the three path on the turn, gained show honors inside LADY ATLANTIC, who pursued the eventual winner three
wide, could not kick on. NEXT TIME YOU WIN broke inwardly brushing a rival, chased from outside four to five wide, failed to rally. PRINCESS CONSUELA
was brushed and had to steady at the start, raced off the inside four to five wide on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE SIGNS switched outside the pacesetter early, advanced on that one two to three wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch,
edged clear and held under steady handling. CHICKS FOR FREE angled in early racing off the pace, advanced inside rivals but just off the rail late on the
turn, kept on in the stretch to get up for second late over CRANKSHAFT, who moved clear and shifted in to set the pace inside, could not kick on with the
winner and lost place late. TIME HEIST was in tight and altered outside rivals early, raced toward the rear off the rail and improved position in the stretch.
TWO COOKIE RULE raced off the pace in the four to five path through the turn and was never near enough to threaten. NYOMAN chased from outside four
to five wide, weakened in the stretch, lost the rider during the gallop out but was quickly caught and walked off. MOVE ON OVER chased the pace in the
three to four path and inside a rival, weakened.

SOVIET STANDARD got away alertly and moved clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, was given right-handed encouragement in mid-stretch then
lugged out near the sixteenth pole under left-handed use of the crop, just lasted. BEEASY stalked from outside three to four wide, steadied and was forced
out near the sixteenth pole, was gaining willingly late. TIZWOW was under hold late up the backstretch pursuing the pace, failed to rally. DASTARDLY
DEEDS broke a step slowly and lacked early speed, failed to rally while racing off the inside. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BEEASY
AGAINST SOVIET STANDARD ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SECOND BEHIND THE FORMER.

JUST A WONDER moved forward soon after the start to press from outside three to four wide, dueled in upper stretch, edged clear coming to the sixteenth
pole and just lasted from STOPSHOPPINGAMY, who shifted in early after being in just slightly tight quarters, saved ground inside on the turn, angled out
about the eighth pole for room, was gaining fast but too late. LIPLINER set a pressured pace racing just off the rail, was overtaken in upper- to mid-stretch,
drifted in a tiny bit late and held show honors. ISABELLACANNETELLA chased from inside steadied slightly entering the turn, lost ground on the leader
through the stretch and was in just a bit tight late. WAY TOO SMARTE was off the pace racing three to five wide through the turn coming into the stretch six
deep and needed more. MY MORNING GAL was quite hard to the load, raced toward the back going two to four wide on the turn, failed to menace.
GHAALEB'S DOMAIN switched out and chased from the three to four path just off the leading trio through the turn, came up empty for the stretch.
FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF ISABELLACANNETELLA AGAINST LIPLINER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
BUCK MOON bobbled at the break but recovered quickly enough, moved forward to press the pacesetter three wide, began to edge clear in upper- to
mid-stretch, drifted to the rail in mid-stretch while clear and drew off under moderate urging. DREAM KEEPER set a pressured pace inside a rival but just off
the rail, was no match for the one but held the place. BANDIT SWANSON was unhurried early shifting in to the two to three path, advanced inside runners
up the backstretch, moved out late on the far turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, ran on but missed second. W W CRAZY angled in early, saved ground
on the first turn, switched off the inside for the run up the backstretch in pursuit of the leading pair three to four deep, needed more. ANDREW THE GIANT
raced off the pace about four wide, failed to menace. SEMINOLE BEACH pursued the leaders three to four wide, dropped back and faded. LAVENDER
EARL raced in the three path into the first turn, moved in a bit up the backstretch, was never able to threaten.

Footnotes
PERFUMER settled off the leaders, began to pick it up three to four wide on the turn, was gaining through the stretch and got up late. STAN THE
CAMERAMAN set a pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, edged clear in upper stretch but was caught late. CHIEF MYSTIQUE stalked the leading
pair well back and racing about in the three path, edged closer leaving the turn but had no rally in the drive. SUPER CITRO pressed the pace two to three
wide, steadily weakened in the stretch. C F V NOBODYCARES bumped with the outside rival at the start, switched well off the inside traveling in the three to
five path through the turn and was not able to menace. KING ZION was never able to threaten while racing off the inside. MICHAEL GEORGE bumped with
the inside rival at the start a couple times, was outpaced early, swung nine wide into upper stretch and was never a threat. LOOKING SALTY was fractious
in the gate, hopped and hit the gate at the start, shifted in to chase from inside, tired.
