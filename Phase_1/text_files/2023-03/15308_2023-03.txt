GENES FEATHER was quick to begin to set all the pace and held well to be well clear under a steady hand ride. TOMMY TSUNAMI chased the early
leader, raced two deep and was no match for the winner. BER MIS BOY was coaxed along from the inside and moved up to improve position while
continuing to race from the inside. DANUBE was coaxed along from the outside and weakened a bit late. WHISKEYSPENT dropped back early, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and had no response. R DEJA VOO was void of early speed, saved ground and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
R ONE WINE was off slowly, raced off the early pace, made a strong bid from the inside nearing the three eighths pole, shifted out to race three deep and
finished well to prove best under strong handling. TAPIT'S LADY settled off the early going, made a four wide bid near the three sixteenths pole and finished
willingly to the wire. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK showed good early foot from the inside and weakened in the drive. DONNA'S HOPE dropped back early,
raced along the inside into the upper stretch and was even late with no closing run. UNPLUCKED GEM chased the early pace and faded while racing three
wide. KNOCKON was hustled along and weakened. KULTHUM was up close, pulled up and had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
CHIVE UP was bumped soundly at the start, showed good early foot to set the pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear under a steady hand ride.
BOLD LEGEND broke in, bumped with rival at the start, stalked the pace from the inside, angled four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best.
SHEZA SAVAGE was bumped, in tight at the break, raced off the early going, advanced through the far turn and made a good late rally while racing five
wide. GUAPA CHICA settled off the early going, moved up from the inside into the upper stretch and flattened out with no final bid. OUR PETUNIA pressed
the pace from the outside of foe and weakened. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO was void of early speed, raced along the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and lacked a bid. AUNT IRENE chased the pace while racing three wide and faded. OVER EXPOSED mid pack early on and failed to respond.
