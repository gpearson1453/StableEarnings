Footnotes
WARMAN ROAD was hustled from the gate then steered out, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, responded well
when set down into upper stretch and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride to the wire. RIDE UP was hustled from the start, chased the pace on
the outside then in three path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. GLOBAL
IMAGE broke awkwardly and was off slow, raced off the pace under urging, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. SWAY'SINMYDNA broke a
half-step slow, was ridden along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
GANDY DANCING tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the four path at the five-sixteenths, took a short lead at the quarter-pole, fought
outside of two opponents into the final sixteenth, battled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. VICTORY BUILT was
hustled to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, was asked in the two path while challenged on the turn, battled inside of two foes under a
drive in the stretch, fought with the winner in the final forty yards and just missed while clear for the place. BRONX BOMBER chased the pace, moved out
near the nine-sixteenths, raced in the three path on the turn, made a bid between foes in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, fought between horses under a
drive into the final sixteenth then weakened while able to hold the show. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY climbed some while ridden along off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. UNO was guided out
early then angled to the far outside, raced under strong urging, went five wide around the turn and lacked the needed response. DOUBLE SHOT was urged
along at the rear, raced in the three path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, angled out near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor while
gaining late ground.

Footnotes
NAKED AND FAMOUS was hustled to the front then sped clear, extended the advantage while inside to the two path around the turn, responded well when
asked into upper stretch, was put to one pop of a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole,
drifted out late and remained clear under steady urging. BREW PUB was hustled from the start, established a good position just off the pace, dropped back
late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and just earned the place while no match for the winner.
TURNSANDCONDITIONS dropped back to the rear of the field, moved in at the five-eighths, was urged two then three wide around the turn, spun four wide
into the stretch and improved to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. JOEY LOOSE LIPS tracked the pace on the outside, was urged in
the three path around the turn and lacked the needed kick then just missed the trifecta. COUSIN ANDREW settled on the outside, was urged four wide
around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CUT THE CORD dropped back early, was urged three to four wide around the turn,
turned into the stretch in the three path, was guided out significantly nearing the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ADERO settled on the outside of a foe, was roused in the three path on the turn, gained on the tiring leader coming to the quarter-pole, rallied to the front at
the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. WINNING CONNECTION was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path
around the turn, remained on his inside lead in the drive and narrowly earned the place. ARREBATO settled on the inside of a foe, was urged in the two
path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
MAMA'S GOLD brushed the outside of the gate at the start, angled in fast while going to the front, drew off to a sizable advantage, traveled around the turn
in the two path, shortened stride late on that bend, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and weakened then lost the trifecta late. EMPIRE RIDE
bumped with rivals on both sides late in the chute, clipped heels near the eleven-sixteenths then moved out, dropped from the three path to the two path
early on the turn and failed to threaten. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER settled on the outside, bumped with a foe late in the chute, had that rival clip his heels near
the eleven-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SOUNDS SPOOKY was urged early,
bumped with a rival late in the chute, moved from the two path to the rail early on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, spun five wide into the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
AFTER FIVE settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, made a bid on the outside near the three-sixteenths,
gained the advantage inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. DOCTOR LOVE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down
the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, gained a short lead at the three-sixteenths, led into the final furlong, was headed by the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. BRUNATE was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path around the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CAN'T BEAT ME was urged along off the pace, went three wide
around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CATCHING CUPID was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn and
was no factor. JOKEMEISTER went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, traveled around the turn in the two path, lost the lead in upper
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BIG BEAN CHRISTINE chased the pace down the backstretch, went three then four wide around turn, pursued the runner-up into the final furlong, gained
the lead into the final sixteenth, fought with that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. TRY IT AGAIN was hustled to the front,
contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop in upper
stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop shortly thereafter, fought on gamely after losing the lead to the winner at the
sixteenth-pole and just missed while clear for the place. BELLA PRINCIPESSA was bumped early and forced in then crowded along the rail, moved out
while off the pace, was urged three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CHARLEY
RUDE was hustled from the gate then came in and bumped with a foe early, pressed the pace on the inside of a duo, vied along the rail on the turn and
tired. CUPIDS GIRL was last to commence then hard ridden off the pace, chased four then five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and
came up empty. GAME THEORY was urged along on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn, dropped to four then three wide late on that bend and
failed to respond. J D ADVANTAGE was a bit fractious in the gate then hustled, contested the pace loosely between foes, was urged in the two path on the
turn and faded.

marker, closed well to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MAJORITY PARTNER went to the front, set the
pace under pressure, inched clear in the three path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then came a bit further out, drifted in some around the
furlong marker, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed by the winner, fought to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. PATIENT
CAPITAL pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, floated six wide into the stretch, made a bid outside the leader near the
three-sixteenths, fought with that foe into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. LUNI SIMA was urged along on the outside, went around the
turn in the two path, swung seven wide into the stretch, pursued the leader while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper
lead near the sixteenth-pole and also weakened then missed the show. RESERVE CURRENCY was urged at the rear, went two to three wide around the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and gained late but failed to threaten. SIX PERCENT chased the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the
backstretch, went five wide on the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and came up empty. SHIPSATIONAL was urged along towards the rear, traveled
four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
