Footnotes
CHERUBIC FACTOR unhurried in the beginning, raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, gained around the bend while easing out and loomed three
wide into the stretch, took over with a furlong remaining and maintained a short lead over DONCIC to the wire. DONCIC raced up close three deep early, bid
two wide with a quarter mile left to run, took over entering the stretch, lost command a furlong out but stayed on gamely to the wire. INCH sat off the pace,
got blocked entering the first turn, moved out around the bend and three to four wide into the stretch, moved out a bit further in the lane and gained the
show. LAW ABIDING brushed leaving the gate, went up to set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared briefly on the turn before being challenged by
DONCIC, lost the lead nearing the stretch and gave way. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) chased between then angled down to the inside, hugged the rail
through the bend, tipped out in the stretch and lacked a rally. STORMY SAMURAI brushed with LAW ABIDING at the start, pressed the pace between
rivals, chased the leader two wide around the turn and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
LEMON DROP SHOT stalked the speed off the rail, advanced outside rivals then drew alongside the leader approaching the quarter pole, took over in
upper stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth. VINNY THE COIN set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared with three furlongs remaining, was soon
challenged again approaching the quarter pole, gave up the lead in upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the late stages but was clearly second
best. MY AMIGO showed early speed three deep up the backstretch, lost touch with the leader early on the turn, moved into the two path then chased four
wide into the drive and flattened. MY DAD IS THIRSTY was off slow and broke in, chased at the back while rank under coaxing, traveled along the rail into
the turn, came three wide into the drive and failed to make an impact. EXTRA INNINGS showed early speed speed rivals, chased the leader in the two path
entering the turn, moved over to the rail to save ground but weakened in the stretch run.

NAUVOO took control inside a pair of rivals early from a bit off the rail, led two wide into the far turn, kicked clear around the bend, then widened under
urging through the lane to win easy. CARELESS KITTEN bobbled a bit at the start, settled next the fence early, moved out on the backstretch, went four
wide into the far turn, angled to the rail around the bend and bested the rest. DIVINE FEMININE was forwardly placed between rivals into the first turn then
chased two to three wide into the backstretch, guided out in the middle stages, entered the far turn four wide, exited three wide and got outkicked for the
place. BIG SWEDE raced up close three deep, flanked the leader up the backstretch, lost ground three then two wide on the far turn and weakened down
the lane. ALGERIA (IRE) sat off the pace in the two path outside a rival early, lagged behind into the far turn, saved ground at the back to the stretch and
had little left for the drive.

IN COLOR was tossing her head around in the gate then hopped and stumbled when the gates opened, stalked the top trio from outside leaving the
backstretch, launched a bid four deep and took over at the quarter pole, cleared three wide into the stretch and drew off under right then left hand urging.
IRRESISTIBLE FORCE dueled for command outside a rival early, led briefly between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole but relinquished the lead shortly after,
chased along the rail into the drive and churned on to regain the place from TENNESSEE MOON in the furlong grounds. TENNESSEE MOON bobbled
leaving the gate, pressed the pace outside a dueling pair, vied three deep around the bend between rivals, chased the winner two wide into the drive and
flattened to third. OUR KENTUCKY ROSE was fractious in the starting gate and had to be backed out and reloaded, broke slow and dropped back early,
trailed on the inside then tipped out into the stretch and failed to menace. PAID IN GOLD fractious in the gate, dueled inside IRRESISTIBLE FORCE early,
held a short lead over outside rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, lost command and stayed on to the quarter pole, then started to lose ground into the stretch
and gave way.

Footnotes
MOTOWN MUSIC forwardly placed from inside early, moved out and chased two wide on the far turn, drew alongside ROYAL ACT midstretch, got floated
out and brushed by that rival while dueling and edged by late. ROYAL ACT was off a bit slow to begin, stalked four wide around the clubhouse turn, drew
alongside the top pair up the backstretch, took over at the three-eighths pole then cleared BOLD ENDEAVOR and steered inside late on the far turn,
challenged by MOTOWN MUSIC past the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging to brush that rival, fought through deep stretch and yielded
grudgingly. ZIMBA WARRIOR unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, went around weakening rival and moved out to three path on the far turn, kept
on through the lane and was along for the show. BOLD ENDEAVOR raced up close outside the leader early, challenged for command up the backstretch,
took over at the seven-sixteenths pole, was overtaken by ROYAL act at the three-eighths pole, moved to the rail on the far turn, chased into the lane and
weakened. BALADI was off slow in the beginning, reserved two to three wide early outside a rival, tugged into and early on the backstretch, chased three
deep then two wide on the far turn and weakened. IMPOSSIBLE TASK led in the two path into the first turn then moved inside, dueled with BOLD
ENDEAVOR up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and faded.

FINALLY HERE broke a step slow, went up to press in hand on the inside, took over then cleared around the bend and remained clear through the lane
under a drive. KANDEREL stumbled badly and bumped with outer rival, waited two then three wide around the turn at the back, angled out into the clear at
the top of the stretch, surged late but could not get to the winner. SAFFA'S DAY stalked the top pair into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, finished
willingly through the final furlong but got edged for second. HARIBOUX (GB) bobbled and brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, moved closer outside
rivals up the backstretch, took the turn four wide and could not summon the needed late kick in the the furlong grounds. BARSABAS raced near the back off
the rail, chased between rivals trying to move closer but got boxed in near the seven-sixteenths pole, found a clear path briefly before lacked room behind II
CAPITANO from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, moved out and bumped that rival with a furlong remaining could not rally. NO HANG CHARLIE
broke inward, taken back and rated near the inside, moved closer into the turn, chased along the rail to the stretch and lacked further response. IL
CAPITANO broke outward then went up to set the pace outside a rival early, dueled from outside early on the turn, could not keep up with inner rival midway
around the bend, got put in a bit tight at the top of the stretch, bumped at the eighth pole and faded down the lane. HAND-TIMED.

ADARE MANOR dueled for the lead from inside into the first turn then moved ahead to take control, showed the way to the far turn, met the challenge from
BIG SWITCH on the far turn, dueled two wide into the stretch, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth and held gamely to the wire. BIG SWITCH
stalked in the two path early, challenged ADARE MANOR from outside near the three-eighths pole, dueled three wide into the lane, kept the pressure on
through the drive but could not find the needed late punch to get by. SHARED FUTURE stalked the pace from inside, tipped three wide around the far turn,
lost the whip in upper stretch and kept on for a clear third. GANADORA dueled three wide into the first turn then chased from outside into the backstretch,
rounded the far turn two wide then along the rail and weakened. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) unhurried in the early going and moved inside, steered out on the
far turn and chased three deep at the quarter pole and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
CAROLE LOMBARD shifted in leaving the gate then steadied between shortly after, tucked inside entering the first turn then moved into the two path, tipped
four wide on the far turn then challenged three wide into the lane, took over at the three-sixteenths pole and held GOLDEN AGAIN at bay through the
furlong grounds. GOLDEN AGAIN took hold briefly to avoid a shuffle early along the inside, steadied off heels on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch,
got blocked briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, moved inside that rival then tipped out and bumped into the stretch, bid between at the top of the lane and
finished gamely inside the winner to the wire. BIG HOPES was off slow then lost path at the start, pulled along the inside early, angled out on the far turn,
drifted inward in the lane and gained the show. GOLDEN TEMPER showed early speed then pressed from inside, move up to duel at the halfway point, led
into the far turn, fought inside a pair of rivals through the far turn, lost command entering the stretch and weakened. LIKE NO OTHER bumped with outside
rival at the start, chased outside a rival then became rank on the first turn, went up outside the top pair in the middle stages, vied three deep on the far turn,
got bumped entering the stretch and weakened. POINT AND SHOOT bumped with LIKE NO OTHER at the start, raced outside a rival at the back, angled to
the rail on the far turn and went through a tight spot while bumping with rival, and failed to menace in the drive. STORM D'ORO showed speed while pulling
to the front, set the pace outside rival then dueled at the halfway point, vied between foes on the far turn, started to weaken with a quarter mile remaining,
got bumped into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.
