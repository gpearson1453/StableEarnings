Footnotes
SASSY EINSTEIN raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the final jump.
LADY CREATIVE sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch and just failed to last.
TALKINGNONSTOP chased the leaders while racing three-wide and finished with good late energy to also just miss. SKY HIGH VERONIKA was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. GIROLAMO LUCY was off a step slow and lagged throughout. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
SPIRE broke sharply then raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn, reached the fore in the closing yards and was going away
late. DIAMOND BLITZ sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out into the stretch, was no match for the winner late but
finished well to save the place. HELLO HANDSOME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and finished willingly. STALKING SHADOW was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a
belated bid. PASSED BY PAUL raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. BLUE AZUL chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the second
turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
WILLY THE COBBLER tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off with complete authority. LOLLY
EXPRESS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady
rally. PERFECT COME BACK lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished with some late run. DR. TROUTMAN sprinted clear at
once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. SHOTGUN RIDER raced four-wide through the first turn, showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PALACE PRINCE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
AKASI broke sharply to duel for the lead with BETTY'S BAR while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half and held sway to the wire.
MARGOT'S GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished willingly to be
second best. TRULY A MESS lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and was up for the show. CAMDEN
HIGH settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. EM'S WINAHOLIC showed brief
speed, was unsaddled soon after the wire and vanned off. BETTY'S BAR disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. TRINNI SUNSET
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON
REVIEW.

Footnotes
MOOGIE SON settled off the leaders from off the rail, angled inside with a furlong to run, vied and proved best through a stiff drive. TEMPTED MISSION set
a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by GUEST CHECK in mid-stretch, vied with that rival, was taken on by the winner soon after
but could not hold that foe safe. GUEST CHECK broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage TEMPTED MISSION in
mid-stretch, vied with that foe and gave way in the drive. LITTLE RED RIFLE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out
further into the lane and failed to gain late. TODAY MATTERS lagged early, raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. LIGHTNING
STAR was forwardly placed early, raced from off the rail and gradually weakened. FAST GALLITO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened
after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

FLASH FLOOD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. BIG CYN
was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, gained command nearing the three-sixteenths pole but could not match strides with the winner through
the final furlong. DEL MAR FLASH settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late.
TWITTERATI raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. PIRATES CROSS was off
slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not threaten. BRITE TAN lacked early speed,
raced seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RED PANTY NIGHT was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide with
THATSALOTOFBLING, vied with that rival for a half and weakened. THATSALOTOFBLING broke sharply to vie for the lead with RED PANTY NIGHT from
the inside and weakened after a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW, QUARTER-MILE FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LIVING VICARIOUSLY was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied
with SINGANDCRYINDUBAI through a vigorous drive and narrowly prevailed. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI broke sharply to duel for the lead from off the rail
with UNCLE FLOYD, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied and just missed in a game effort. ECHO ALPHA SIX
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. DYF was forwardly placed from the
inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. UNCLE FLOYD dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
DON'TTEASETHETIGER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. W. WHITEHOUSE lacked early foot,
saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. HERBIE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn
and weakened. JAKE THE GREAT was off slow, pulled up and vanned off. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
