Footnotes
CHIC SAMARAI was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, moved four-wide through
the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. KIRA FEVER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn,
split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and rallied late to gain the place. HIGH GUNNER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the three-eighths pole, gained a brief lead and gave way through the final furlong. SAVONA broke sharply to set a pressured pace, responded when
challenged nearing the three-eighths pole but HIGH GUNNER, vied with that foe and gave way through the final furlong. CASIA was off a step slow, showed
no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MY MOONDANCER settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn
and failed to rally. FUSAICHIS BEST YET was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
