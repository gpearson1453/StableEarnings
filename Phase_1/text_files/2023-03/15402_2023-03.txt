Footnotes
WATER FIGHT chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. ONE
TOUGH DAME tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the four path coming around the bend, was
outkicked in the stretch and chased the winner home through the final furlong. REBEL CONSORT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early,
launched a bid while saving ground around the turn and finished evenly, no match for the top two. REASONABLY LOVELY hopped up and bumped with the
horse tooo her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and improved position
mildly in the stretch. NOBLE ATTITUDE veered out and brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the four and five path and never threatened. BEAST BUNNY bumped with the horse to her inside at the start,
recovered to led the way from the rail up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the three path around the turn and tired further in the stretch.
ITRIEDSELLINGHER bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a
factor.

winner. KENYA SUN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and finished evenly.
RAPIDAMENTE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no
kick. JLO CAN DANCE raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the turn and was
empty from there. TEE UP raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening stages, came around the bend in the four path and faded in
the stretch. DONYA'S MAGIC hit the gate leaving it, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired in

CATCH ON EMOTIONAL led the way throughout, raced in the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane, never threatened. BELIEVE AMERICA
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and improved position in the stretch. LITTLE
BIG hit the gate and stumbled at the start, recovered to track the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was
outkicked in the stretch. BIG ROWDY DAN chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and
weakened in the lane. DOC CARSON raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. MISS INEZ
trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROAD MINISTER hit the gate and was slow into stride, trailed the field early, began to move up on the outside headed into the turn, raced in the three path
around the bend and kicked clear in the lane. CRUISING DEREK bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, recovered to chase the leader up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and could not go with the winner in the lane, chasing that rival to the wire. BARAK dueled between horses
through the early going, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to the finish. ALL ABOUT LUCKY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, tracked the
pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and kept on in the stretch. SMART DRESSER dueled between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. VIDA FINA dueled on the outside
up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and faded in the stretch. NOT A PRAYER bumped with the horse to his inside at
the start, recovered to duel on the rail up the backstretch, gave way from the two path coming around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and tired
from there.

Footnotes
CHINA BEACH saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail
coming around the second turn and dueled to the wire to just get the win. SHIMMERING LEROID raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and dueled in the stretch to narrowly miss. BARAHIN led the field from the two path around the first
turn, opened up racing up the backstretch, continued to lead the way while saving ground around the far turn, dug in in upper stretch and was caught late.
SIMMS bumped with the horse to his outside and steadied at the break, raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, came
around the far bend in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. BATTLE CREEK bumped with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in
the three path and improved position in the lane. IN HONOR OF ARTIE was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the five path around the first bend,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the four path coming around the second bend and improved position mildly in the
stretch. KING OF CHAOS trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second turn
and never threatened. SUMMER PALACE saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path
and showed no kick. EIGHT WEEKS LONG raced in the four path around the fist turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
continued around the far bend in the two path and was empty in the lane. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid.
