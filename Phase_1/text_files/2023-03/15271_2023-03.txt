Footnotes
BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) saved ground stalking behind the leader, tipped out to launch a bid between rivals approaching the quarter pole, gained the
advantage leaving the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held safely under a drive. WARRENS CANDY GIRL settled inside, waited on the far turn before
swinging out into the stretch, closed determinedly but could not reach the winner. GOLD FOR KITTEN stalked outside a rival in the two path, moved out to
challenge four then three deep on the far turn, failed to kick on with BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) in upper stretch and flattened to third. DENIM IN GOLD
broke out and brushed rival, stepped to the front and moved inside, set the pace inside CLASSICAL ROMANCE, moved clear from that rival on the far turn
but was soon challenged by a pair of contenders with a quarter mile remaining, gave up the lead late on the turn and weakened down the lane.
FOUNDER'S DAY settled outside a rival in the two path, chased three deep at the quarter pole and could not rally when called upon. CLASSICAL
ROMANCE got brushed from inside leaving the gate, went up to race up close outside the leader, dropped back between foes on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LEFT HAND MAN raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, applied pressure leaving the backstretch, took over exiting the bend, moved clear in
upper stretch and held AUSTONIAN at bay. AUSTONIAN brushed the gate to come away a step slow, chased from outside then alongside the top pair into
the turn, asked three wide nearing the stretch, took aim at LEFT HAND MAN in the drive but lacked the needed final kick while clearly second best.
MONTANA stalked the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit in the drive and kept on to earn the show honors. MAGIC
ACCOUNT was away quickly to clear from the gate and establish the front, gained company leaving the backstretch, held a short lead through the turn then
relinquished command entering the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BE PUNCTUAL was off slow in the beginning, trailed early on then went
outside a rival three wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and proved no menace. FORDY G broke a step slow, chased two wide through the turn
and weakened.

Footnotes
FAIZA bumped leaving the gate, chased four wide then went up to engage the leader around the clubhouse turn, lost touch and chased up the backstretch,
drew alongside again at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled four then three wide and inched ahead leaving the far turn, put away BLESSED TOUCH in
midstretch, then drew away from AND TELL ME NOLIES late. AND TELL ME NOLIES broke well then took a stalking position in the two path, moved out
leaving the first turn, traveled two wide into the second bend, angled outside the top pair and was asked four wide entering the stretch, took aim at FAIZA in
the final furlong but was no match in end. BLESSED TOUCH bumped with outer rival at the start, sped to the front and led along the three path then two
wide on the first turn, dueled with FAIZA into the backstretch, cleared that rival in the middle stages, challenged again by that rival at the seven-sixteenths
pole, dueled three then two around the bend and lost the lead past the quarter pole, fought back in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. JUSTIQUE
got bumped on both sides in the beginning, was reserved four then three wide early, raced out wide up the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the four path,
angled inward in the lane and failed to threaten. PRIDE OF THE NILE was a bit fractious in the gate, hit the gate and broke inward to come away last, trailed
on the inside into the first turn then checked behind ANT TELL ME NOLIES midway around the bend, saved ground through the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MOONLITE IN HEAVEN pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn while inching ahead, put away BLURSDAY entering the stretch while
meeting a pair of challengers from outside, responded well by moving clear from those rivals in upper stretch and drew off under right and left handed
urging. SUGAR SUGAR got brushed from outside at the start then took a stalking position along the rail, tipped out on the far turn and bid three deep
nearing the lane, took aim at the winner in upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong and stayed on to hold the place. HOT ROD MAMA got
bumped and squeezed back at the start, trailed on the inside then angled out around rivals on the clubhouse turn, rallied three wide then four deep into the
stretch, chased on the left-lead through the lane then flattened while finally changing leads late. BLURSDAY set the pace on the inside under pressure,
dueled around the far turn, lost touch into the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. SUPERCENTS broke in and bumped HOT ROD MAMA, tracked
two wide then moved to the rail early, saved ground through the second bend and failed to menace. LADY DERBY tracked in the three path early, lost
ground two to three wide on the far turn and weakened. COMPTONS HOUSE broke a step slow, settled three then two wide outside a rival, rounded the far
turn three then four wide and tired.

cleared BRICKYARD RIDE with a furlong remaining and drew away. ANARCHIST chased two wide outside a rival into the turn, drifted out a bit from left
handed urging in the drive and got up for second. BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear early, showed the way along the inside around the turn, challenged by the

moved out further and edged RESPECT THE CODE for a minor award. RESPECT THE CODE threw his head and bobbled leaving the gate, settled outside
a rival, raced two wide on the turn, steered out in the drive and could not threaten. SUMTER chased along the inside into the turn, saved ground to the
stretch and weakened. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) hesitated and came away slow, trailed on the inside into the turn, came three wide into the stretch,

Footnotes
CLIQUISH stumbled a bit leaving the gate and dropped back, was on the move passing a trio of rivals and rapidly gaining on the leader through the turn,
took over at the top of the stretch, cleared easily and widened through the final furlong under light hand urging. ANYBODY'S CHOICE sped clear from inside
and opened up on the backstretch, traveled along the rail around the turn but held a diminishing lead approaching the quarter pole, offered no resistance to
the winner at the top of the lane but stayed on to best the rest. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE stalked three deep early, chased three outside a rival on the turn,
churned on through the lane and secured the show. IN COLOR stalked between rivals early, rounded the bend in the two path and weakened. CON SEAL
AND KERRY stalked inside a pair of rivals early, chased two to three wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and weakened. HALF NELSON stumbled
leaving the gate, raced off the pace then trailed into the turn, moved out around the bend and raced five wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JOHANNES broke a step slow, chased on the inside off the pace, tipped out into the stretch, lost his path and was forced to steady in upper stretch,
straightened out and took aim at the top pair in midstretch, rallied between those rivals at the sixteenth pole and surged to win clear. WIZARD OF
WESTWOOD was off slow and bobbled leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then angled to the inside for the turn, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths
pole to bother rivals, launched a bid outside HELLADIC past the eighth pole, fought three deep into the final sixteenth and got outkicked. HELLADIC sped to
the front, showed the way along the rail through the turn, lugged out crossing the dirt, continued clear in upper stretch, met the challenge from WIZARD OF
WESTWOOD past the eighth pole, led into deep stretch and got outfinished by the top pair. MI HERMANO RAMON got shuffled between rivals early,
traveled two then three wide on the turn, came out crossing over the dirt, was forced to check near the three-sixteenths pole, moved inward and looked to
rally but found traffic again at the sixteenth pole, then kept on when gaining a clear path to round out the superfecta. HAWKER stalked three deep into the
turn, got bumped and forced out crossing over the dirt and could not rally in the furlong grounds. SHARP AZA TACK chased off the pace, steadied into the
turn, angled out over the dirt, altered out to avoid trouble at the top of the lane, kept trying late but never threatened. KINGDOM HEART was off slow to
begin, rushed up inside the leader then chased two wide into the turn, got forced out by the pacesetter crossing the dirt, then weakened in the lane.
GOLDEN SOMBRERO was off slow in the beginning, gained four then five deep on the turn, got bumped and forced out crossing the dirt and weakened.
MALIBU COAST stalked between rivals then steadied when boxed in near the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch then was forced to check at the
three-sixteenths pole and also weakened.

Footnotes
HANDSOME GARY tracked two wide into the turn, angled to the rail and saved ground to the stretch, rallied up the fence and dug in to get up late. LET'S
REJOYCE sped clear and controlled the pace up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside through the turn, challenged late on the bend, moved
out in upper stretch, drifted out in midstretch, led into the final sixteenth and was edged by the winner. ITALIANO stalked three deep up the backstretch,
took aim four wide into the stretch, rallied widest in the drive and finished a game third. OCTOPUS chased outside a rival and was tugging along early, went
two to three wide on the turn, rallied in the furlong grounds and fought between foes in deep stretch but got outkicked in the end. LIAR LIAR raced up close
from outside early, chased two wide around the bend then drew alongside leader late on the turn, got crowded between rivals in midstretch and was ridden
out late. MIGHTY MATT was off a bit slow in the beginning, traveled near the back early on, rounded the bend four then five wide, had the rider lose the
whip with a sixteenth to go and failed to rally. SANTA CRUISER dropped back early, angled in for the turn, went two to three wide into the drive, moved out
in the lane and was not a factor. VICENTE'S SHADOW was off slow in the beginning, trailed into the turn on the inside, drifted out around the bend and
stretch and made no impact. TIZLIGHTNING chased along the inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
NOBLE REFLECTION bumped outer rival leaving the gate, showed speed outside rivals then cleared, crossed over up the backstretch, showed the way
from the rail through the turn, remained unchallenged into deep stretch and stayed clear under a drive. DOITFORANDREW (GB) showed early speed while
drifting out slightly over the dirt then chased the leader up the backstretch, moved off the rail around the turn and took aim two wide into the drive, steered
out further in the lane while closest in pursuit into the final furlong, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner and saved the place.
FORGIVING SPIRIT broke a step slow then had his path taken and checked back, climbed briefly crossing the dirt, started to pull up the backstretch, went
two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, then unleashed a rally but was too late.
LOVESICK BLUES got crowded between rivals early, tracked four deep into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, bumped with VIRAT in the final
sixteenth and finished willingly to the line. VIRAT chased three deep into the turn, rounded the bend three then two wide, stayed within striking distance
through the lane, bumped with LOVESICK BLUES late and lacked a bid. REDLINE bumped leaving the gate, dropped back off the pace, angled in on the
backstretch, got blocked near the quarter pole and failed to threaten late. KATONAH stumbled at the start, sat off the pace, went three then four wide on the
turn, bumped with rival in upper stretch and could not rally. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) broke a step slow, tugged the rider into range early, found traffic at
the five-sixteenths pole, moved out in upper stretch and failed to menace. DANCE SOME MO raced up close between early then had his path taken by the
leader and had to take hold, chased two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and faded.
