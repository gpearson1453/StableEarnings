Footnotes
URAGANO coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for
home and shouldered the leaning outwards DUDLEY DICKERSON straightened away, took over command outside a pair near the eighth pole, and then got
shown the crop to the left side while battling through to the finish to not get in on his main rival when gamely prevailing by a neck on the wire. DUDLEY
DICKERSON chased just off the inside in range of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home leaning outwards in
URAGANO and was bumped straightened away as that rival switched leads, dug in between foes briefly, then fought on to the finish but was ultimately
bested at the end. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide, got set down taking the inside route into
upper stretch under growing threat from a pair, got collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. MYLES bobbled at the break, raced
forwardly placed vying early on then chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
tired. WONKER WARRIOR six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled in to spin two to three wide for home and tired.

BREADMAN brushed with foes at the start, raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run,
vied in the three path around the far turn, took the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong
then edged clear under strong handling. REGALITY broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat on
the final turn, lost the lead to the winner passing the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in the two path into upper stretch, fought into the final furlong then
was outfinished while well clear for the place. HANG TIGHT went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was
urged in the two path for most of the far turn then dropped closer to the rail, shifted three wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the show while no match
for the top two. RIA'S ANGEL brushed the hindquarters of a foe while off a step slow then dropped back in tight quarters, traveled two to three wide around
the opening bend, was urged at the rear down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, was driven between rivals in upper stretch and just
missed the show. EXXTOP rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back near the five-eighths, moved from the four path to the
two path around the final turn and had nothing left. JAY'STALKER brushed with a foe at the break then was hustled, raced in the three path around the first
turn, was urged along while chasing the leader down the backstretch, came up empty in the four path on the final turn and retreated. STRONG LIGHT broke
a half-step slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear under some urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
SISTER LINDA broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advancing to take
command swinging three wide at the quarter pole, edged away under a drive kept to task, then was reported to have bled. PATTY CAKES chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out two paths nearing the eighth pole and offered up a
mild kick to be along clear of the rest for the place honors. RACING COLORS broke out at the start bumping RHUBARB MARTINI, raced seven paths off
the inside detaches at the tail of the field early on, tucked three wide and advanced under light coaxing half a mile from home, continued three wide through
the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. RAFFINITY dueled three then two wide with RHUBARB
MARTINI to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths shaking off that rival confronted outside by the eventual winner, yielded the front and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. SIMPLE SUGAR chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
five wide for home and tired. RHUBARB MARTINI got bumped at the start by RACING COLORS, who broke outwards, came under coaxing and dueled
from the two path with RAFFINITY to her outside, tucked inside into the turn and was shaken off while coaxed along midway, faded and swung two to three
wide at the head of the stretch, then gave way through to the finish.

EMPTY TOMB was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of a foe then set the pace under pressure, vied in the three path for most of the turn,
dropped to the two path while asked late on that bend, responded well when put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging.
GULFSTREAM WAY showed speed on the outside then pressed the pace, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the
final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. TWO THIRTY FIVE settled just off the pace, moved out outside the five-eighths then tracked on
the outside, was given his cue at the seven-sixteenths, chased in the five path around the turn and weakened while clear for the show. PIT BOSS angled
out near the seven-eighths, settled at the rear on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was urged two to three wide around the turn and failed to
respond. FAMISHED bobbled at the start but broke with the field, settled just off the pace, dropped back under urging while inside on the turn and

HAPPY FARM coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, advanced on the leader midway on the turn to engage in head to
head combat, came under coaxing near the quarter pole taking over narrow command at that station before being headed once more straightened away,
took back the front narrowly while between rivals a furlong out, dug in gamely to shake off the former leader while rebuffing the challenger outside to the
wire. SHERIFF BIANCO five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on outside to threaten for it all through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish. SCOCCIATORE
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under challenge midway and
dueled through the latter portion of the bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, continued to knock heads through to the eighth pole, then got
steadily shaken off in the late stages while clear for the show honors. KING ANGELO coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and stayed on
one paced to the end. A C EXPRESSWAY chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered no
response. IN DREAMS five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and tired. HIGH OAK bobbled at the start, came under coaxing and chased four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn,
went five wide at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
REUNION TOUR brushed with a rival at the start, moved in while settling off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, rallied under the crop
into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead coming to the furlong marker then drew away under steady urging. MR. BUSTA pressed the pace down the
backstretch, vied in the three path for most of the turn, took the lead late on that bend, shook clear into the stretch then came under the crop, lost the lead to
the winner approaching the furlong marker and proved no match while able to hold the place. GO GET THE BAG brushed with a foe at the start then was
hustled, chased the pace on the outside, went four then five wide around the turn and weakened while clear for the show. GENTLEMAN BURGLAR was
hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage late on that bend and tired.
STELLWAGEN BANKER bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out into the
stretch and failed to respond. CAMPBELITO was last to commence, raced near the back under urging, traveled around the turn in the three path, spun five
wide into the stretch and showed little. IRON HORIZON pressed the pace between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the
five-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and faded. TIZA BROWN dropped back under urging, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide
into the stretch and was no factor.
