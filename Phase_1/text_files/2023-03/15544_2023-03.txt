Footnotes
TOTAL BLISS tracked in the five path, shifted into the three path and swept to the lead under a drive around the far turn, was headed by an outer foe
passing the quarter pole and floated out to the six path into the lane, dug in thru the lane, brushed with the outer challenging foe near the sixteenth pole, but
held on to win. GREY PRINCESS bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, moved up under rousing around the far turn and bid
passing the quarter pole, was floated out to the eight path into the stretch, ran on but drifted in thru the final furlong, brushed an inner foe late, and hung for
place. GIRLY THE BUTCHER bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the five path and was under a ride into the far turn, ranged up nearing the
quarter pole and was in the five path at the top of the stretch, tipped inwards thru the stretch, and kept on for show. MORGAN'S BLUFF broke out and
bumped an outer foe, travelled off the pace in the two path, was receiving right handed cues around the far turn and was in the five path at the top of the
lane, but was no factor. CAPPY got bumped on both sides at the start, raced in midpack around the two path, was asked for more into the far turn, but was
empty around the four path turning into the stretch. KISS UPON A STAR set the pace in the two path rounding the first turn and tipped out to the four path
into the backstretch, was under coaxing in the two path passing the three eighths marker, but abruptly gaveway. BLUEBERRY QUEEN bumped with an
outer foe at the start, was steadied along the inside midway around the first turn, stalked around the three path down the backside but was done after a half.

Footnotes
BARRELL CRAFT bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid for the lead early around the far turn, took narrow lead
passing the quarter pole and remained in the three path entering the lane, and kept on under steady encouragement to hold sway. DONTKISSDAMINISTER
brushed the outer part of the gate leaving, rated in the four path, was cued midway around the far turn, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, and ran
on for place. GLENHOLME tracked in the four path, ranged up to bid under rousing around the far turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, and
stayed on for show. TAKEMETOTHEMOON raced in range under a hold between foes in the two path but had to steady midway down the backstretch,
tipped out to the three path and waited for room rounding the far turn, was roused between foes approaching the quarter pole, tipped in to the two path and
bumped an inner foe entering the stretch, and evened out. DOC BALLARD bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, was put under a
ride into the far turn, but lost ground and did not factor from around the five path in the stretch. PIDIN set the pace around the two path, was coaxed around
the far turn, but gaveway and was bumped at the top of the lane. ROYAL FOX HILLS was steadied into the first turn and always trailed around the two to
four paths.

REDDINGTON raced in range four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. BIG
DADDY DAVE raced up close inside, angled two wide near the quarter pole, bid between foes in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. SONG
RUNNER stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near five-sixteenths pole and tired in the lane. AGARRAMESIPUEDES was outrun inside. FLOKI'S
FLIGHT set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
GUARANTEED SPECK stalked in the four path, ranged up under drive around the far turn and was cued right handed from the seven path into the stretch,
ran on while tipping in to take the lead in the final sixteenth, and held off a late closing outer rival. MO VANISHING rated in the four path, was under right
handed urging around the far turn and tipped out to the six path at the top of the stretch, rallied under left handed urging in the final furlong for place.
BROKEN SPUR set the pace inside of foes, was roused into the far turn and challenged by an outer foe approaching the quarter pole, floated out to the four
path under a heavy drive into the stretch, lost the lead nearing the sixteenth pole, but dug in to hold show. DARK VECTOR prompted the pace in the three
path, bid into the far turn and was cued right handed from the six path turning into the stretch, stayed on between foes thru the stretch, but was outfinished
to miss minor rewards. LUNA WARRIOR tracked in the three path, was cued from the two path midway around the far turn and under a drive entering the
lane, but flattened out in the final furlong. EL ORO (FR) was held up in midpack around the five path, roused in the four path around the far turn, but never
threatened. DELTA DELTA lugged in at the start, raced wellback around the four path and could never get involved. ACAMAR trailed throughout around the
two to four paths.

MAN ON THE MOON sped to the front, set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. ANOTHER DUKE saved ground off the pace, angled
out in upper stretch and was gaining on the winner late. THENORTHREMEMBERS raced off the pace five wide and was along for the show. AEQUOR
chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. OLD TOWN ROAD failed to menace while racing four wide. VALID EXCHANGE played no factor while
racing four wide. POUND GREEN raced in range three wide between foes and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
STUCK IN MALIBU settled off the pace in the four path, ranged up under light rousing from the five path around the far turn and bid nearing the quarter
pole, swept to the lead while tipping in in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. CHARLESTON WAY rated in the three path, tipped out to the five
path under coaxing around the far turn, was in the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. INSCRUTABLE was in the five path around the
first turn but settled in range while shifting into the three path down the backside, was ridden around the far turn and tipped out to the four path entering the
lane, and kept on for show. MOONTAP trailed in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn and under left handed urging while floating out to the five path
entering the lane, and stayed on between foes. BEACH READY set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the far turn, but
yielded around the two path nearing the eighth pole. OUR FLAG FLYING stalked in the four path, bid under rousing midway around the far turn, was in the
five path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. QUEEN ROCKET travelled up close while under a hold around the three path but gaveway turning into the
lane. MY FIRST DATE tracked along the inside but backed up rounding the far turn.
