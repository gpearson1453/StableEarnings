Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT vied along the inside of a rival around the first turn, allowed that foe to clear of in order to shift outside of him with eleven
sixteenths to go, stalked before applying pressure into the far turn, bid and forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, and drove clear at the furlong
grounds. LATE SEPTEMBER tracked three wide, inched closer to the top pair while under strong urging in the four path turning for home, took aim on the
new leader in upper stretch, wrestled place in midstretch, and chased the clear leader home well through the final furlong. CALIBRACHOA KID tugged
forward to set the pace outside of a rival around the first turn, inched forward to a clear margin entering the backstretch, showed the way in the two path into
the far turn as that foe re-applied outside pressure, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole, yielded while losing place in midstretch, and displayed
blood from his mouth suggesting having bit his tongue. I DON'T VENMO settled off of the pace the pace in the two path, raced between horses around the
far turn, altered course outwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. KAJUN KARMA raced forwardly two wide and between horses, chased the
leading trio turning for home, and lacked a bid. MANGUM was void of speed in the early stages, trailed along the inside around both turns, and moved up
between horses in upper stretch. MOR BIG LEE was keen racing behind foes approaching the first turn, floated to the five path entering that bend while well
off of the pace, then took the far turn in the four path, and made little impact. BENOIT tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened with three
furlongs to go.

Footnotes
KING'S GLORY set the pace inside of an outer pressing foe around the turn, shook free of that one entering the lane, maintained a clear margin through
midstretch, and was put to wraps while holding sway entering the final sixteenth. CASTLEWARDEN gained to track the leading pair from a few lengths off
while outside of a rival into the turn, but bumped and shied from that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, sustained a grinding rally after shifting three
wide in upper stretch, gained place at the furlong grounds with multiple lengths to find on the clear leader, but flopped back to his left lead and lugged
inwardly approaching the sixteenth pole, and failed to threaten late. BILLY JACK tracked along the inside, was joined in pursuit by an outer
CASTLEWARDEN nearing the turn, but shied while bumping with that rival approaching the five sixteenths pole causing a hard steady, recovered nearing
the lane, altered course four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole. HARBOUR BRIDGE broke a step slow, took the turn in the
three path while off of the pace, and stayed on mildly. COACHES MEETING broke inwardly at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
NOBLE REALITY (FR) pressed the eventual winner from the outside around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and faltered in the final
furlong. BILLY BOB ROCKET lacked speed two wide and between horses early on, and never got involved. RIVER RAFT broke outwardly while off slow,
trailed in the four path around the turn, fanned wider entering the lane before his rider lost his crop in upper stretch, and showed little. FOLLOWING A
RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF BILLY JACK AGAINST CASTLEWARDEN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE FIVE SIXTEENTHS POLE; AS
WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT; CASTLEWARDEN WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
STAR MOMENT left the gates well, took the lead, attended the pace from the rail , was never challenged, drew off. ALPINE MIST was slow getting into
stride, raced along the rail smartly saving ground this trip, sat four off of the leader for the first three and half furlongs, started advancing after the half, was
encouraged starting in the upper stretch and responded with a persistent drive that wore down the rest of the rivals and she was able to claim second place
honors. LOUISIANA LIBERTY was slow getting started, was three wide racing through the first turn, was allowed to find her stride and was unhurried until
the half mile pole, was slightly encouraged to pick up her pace ,after the half, responded well and was cued at the three eighths pole, gamely circled the field
and was in position at the quarter pole, was encouraged and raced through the stretch , was able to finish third. FREE DROP MADDY stalked the pace
three wide, was within striking distance and poised while racing down the backside, was asked at the three eights pole and responded with a run, but the
leader was able to keep the same distance between herself and FREE DROP MADDY, struggled down the lane and as the distance increased she
eventually stopped. GUITAR WOMAN was sent out of the gates, took the first turn three wide and win between horses, raced three and four wide through
out, was in between horses for the first half of a mile, was asked at the half mile pole and ended up matching strides with the same for who was on her
outside the whole race, was pressure through the turn and tired after the quarter pole. OLIVIA G was five wide through the first turn, chased the early
leaders past the six furlong pole, finally settled along the outside of the set of horses that were just off the leader, asked after the half and matched strides
with an inner for, they battled through the second turn and OLIVIA G tired by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BIG CHOPPER tracked along the inside under a snug hold, saved ground around the turn, produced a rail bid passing the furlong pole, forged an
advantage inside the final sixteenth, and desperately lasted to the wire from a quickly on-charging rival. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE broke slowly, raced off of the
pace in the three path, came under a firm hold between horses into the turn before fanning to the five path to be outside of the main group approaching the
five sixteenths pole, spun in to the lane in the six path, delayed a lead change until the furlong grounds, but surged outside of rivals after changing over,
offered a late bid in hopes of reeling in the leader at the wire, but narrowly came up short. BERTIE'S GALAXY took a bump from an outer rival at the start,
prompted the pace outside of the leader, pressed in the three path around the turn got floated to the four path entering the lane, wrestled an advantage
approaching the furlong grounds, but shifted inwardly and into his inner counterpart's path at the furlong grounds, got headed by a rail bidder in the final
sixteenth, and yielded between horses late. BRON AND BROW rated off of the pace in the two path, and chased willingly through the lane while not
menacing. RELENTLESS DANCER stalked behind the top pair and from the three path, shifted to the five path to take aim outside of them entering the
lane, but lacked a bid. YANKEE SEVEN set the pace inside of a pressing rival while remaining a bit off of the rail around the turn, resisted that foe's bid
while spinning into the lane in the three path, but got headed approaching the final furlong, steadied when his outer counterpart shifted into him soon after,
and faltered between horses in the late stages. FIESTY FIST bumped an inner rival at the start, chased the top pair from the four path, and gave way
entering the lane. X CLOWN bobbled before being bumped by rivals on both sides and checking out of crowded quarters at the start, trailed along the
inside, then greenly refused to change leads through the lane, and got outrun. VODKA GIMLET was urged along to chase from midpack while hung in the
six path into the turn, and tired. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF YANKEE SEVEN AGAINST BERTIE'S GALAXY FOR INTERFERENCE IN
MIDSTRETCH; AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT, BERTIE'S GALAXY WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
MERLAZZA tracked the top pair from the four path, loomed a danger while ranging up around the far turn, bid entering the lane, drew off under light coaxing
in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead leaving the furlong grounds, and won with more to give. STELLAR LADY broke through the starting gates
before they sprung, but was quickly reloaded without further incident stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane, altered course four wide nearing the
furlong grounds, and rallied to gain place late. BRU NA BOINNE bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader while remaining a path
away from her, pressed approaching the far turn, but required urging to sustain pressure between horses as an outer bidder menaced turning for home,
proved no match for that one entering the lane, gained place passing the three sixteenths pole, but was reeled in by an outer rival for that position in the final
sixteenth. NOMADIC PRIDE broke slowly, saved ground far back, and stayed on between horses in the final furlong. HUNTLEIGH pursued from midpack in
the two path, floated three wide in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. SWEET ALYSSA was antsy in the starting gate when an inner rival broke through it,
lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the backstretch, then floated to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. PASTA
SALAD RHONDA broke slowly, trailed, and got outrun. MISS TAPPY TONE raced at the rear in the two to four paths around the turns, and never got
involved. SAENZ bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, got headed entering the lane, and stopped through the final furlong.

ERVADEAN broke a step slow while nudging an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader, pressed in the three path around the turn, bid entering
the lane drove clear at the three sixteenths pole, and held off an outer bidder to the wire in the closing stages. TWIN MISCHIEF was off a beat slow while
exchanging mild contact with an inner foe, settled off of the pace along the inside, progressed slowly in the three path in upper stretch, tipped to the four
path at the furlong grounds for clear sailing, and offered a good late kick, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. PERFECT WISH tracked along the
inside while well positioned, but awaited racing room behind the pace setter entering the lane, slipped through along the rail at the three sixteenths pole,
chased the clear leader while getting outkicked for place in the final furlong, yet held show late. K'ANTHEIA broke slowly, trailed along the inside into the
turn, advanced inside of foes in upper stretch, shifted to the four path in midstretch, and sustained a charge in the final furlong to miss reaching show.
SWEET SHILD O MINE tracked behind the top flight from the three path, bumped an outer rival while splitting foes in the four path at the five sixteenths
pole, took aim outside of the new leader in upper stretch, but flattened out nearing the furlong grounds, and tired. CONCEPTUALIZE tracked four to five
wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, chased through upper stretch, and yielded. SANDRA D laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path in
upper stretch, and failed to menace. PRINCESS POM POM made little impact from the two path. ANGORA DEB broke outwardly while off slow, lacked
speed in the four path, and failed to factor. MASTER SOM set the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer presser entering the lane, and caved
between horses at the three sixteenths pole. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW got outrun in the three path. GOLDEN VIEW chased outside of the top pair, but was
bumped four wide by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
NEW BEAT set the pace in the two path, drew clear of an outer presser passing the three furlong pole, drifted out while hanging on her left lead through
upper stretch, straightened while changing over at the furlong grounds, and ran on to seal the deal. RAGGITY SAND laid off of the pace along the inside,
tugged between horses to midpack entering the backstretch, chased along the inside around the far turn, sustained stride to gain place from an outer rival at
the three sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten the clear leader in the final furlong before fending off an outer rival to hold place late. DIALHERUP tracked
from midpack in the five path, was urged along in the four path around the far turn before fanning to the six path entering the lane, stayed on to vie for minor
rewards in midstretch, shifted in passing the furlong grounds before producing a bid for place nearing the wire, but was fended off. CORSINI raced at the
rear three wide, advanced around the far turn, then stayed on while one paced through the final furlong. SUPER LUXE tracked along the inside, but
checked when put to tight rail quarters by DARE TO WISH passing the seven furlong pole, saved ground into the far turn, but was shuffled back behind that
tiring rival approaching the final five sixteenths, the offered rally in upper stretch, split foes three wide in the final furlong, and gained a minor share.
FREEDOM FOR ALL lacked speed two wide and between horses, advanced along with an outer rival around the far turn, and leveled off. MYSTICAL FIRE
stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that one at the three furlong pole, chased between horses in upper
stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. ORIGAMI GIRL broke in at the start, trailed along the inside, shifted out in midstretch, and stayed on. SWEET
CHABLIS tracked the top pair from the four path, inched closer under urging turning for home before fanning to the five path entering the lane, and
weakened in upper stretch. BELLA PALOMA laid off of the pace while hung five to six wide, and tired. GRACEFUL UNION was rank between horses
entering the first turn, settled two to three wide while among foes, but faded. DARE TO WISH raced forwardly in the two path, checked after achieving inside
stalking position around the first turn, then wilted around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
DIDIA (ARG) bumped with an inner rival at the start, then took brushes from rivals on both sides in the early stages, laid off of the pace in the three path,
fanned four wide in upper stretch, rallied with a clear ADVENTURING to catch in midstretch, ranged up to bid entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear.
ADVENTURING stalked two wide, pressed around the far turn, bid entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer bidder at the
sixteenth pole, and got bested. NEW YEAR'S EVE trailed in the two to three paths around the turns, shifted five wide in upper stretch with many lengths to
find, and offered a good belated kick to close in on the top pair late. SHE CAN'T SING tracked in midpack two wide, took aim on the new leader three wide
in upper stretch, but failed to progress before getting outkicked for minor rewards by an outer rival in midstretch, and yielded. GATHER AS YOU GO
bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer rival around the far turn, got headed by that one entering
the lane, and faded. RUSSIAN MAFIA laid unhurried three to two wide, and made little impact. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) tracked along the inside, chased
in upper stretch, and faded. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. NEW BOSS tracked three wide, but weakened in the four
path turning for home. TROBAIRITZ steadied out of crowded quarters between horses in the opening stages, laid off of the pace two wide, saved ground
around the far turn, but tired in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
WEST WILL POWER stalked outside of the leader, pressed down the backstretch, bid at the three furlong pole, led at the five sixteenths marker, then drew
off in upper stretch, and pulled away with good energy. ART COLLECTOR tracked along the inside, was pocketed while awaiting racing room just behind
the leading pair an din the two path around the far turn, emerged from between horses to bid for place in the three path entering the lane after, the leader
kicked clear, battled for place inside of MR WIRELESS coming to midstretch, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and fended off his outer
counterpart for that position. MR. WIRELESS laid off of the pace two wide, inched closer four wide and outside of the top flight around the far turn, fanned
five wide entering the lane, sustained a bid for place outside of ART COLLECTOR in upper stretch, sparred with that foe through the final furlong, but was
kept at bay. RATTLE N ROLL broke half a beat slow, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path entering the far turn, fanned five
wide entering the lane, and moved up. HAPPY AMERICAN trailed two wide, but lacked a rally through a wide rail seam in upper stretch, and failed to
menace. PIONEER OF MEDINA tracked three wide, but yielded four wide and between horses entering the lane. TREASURY set the pace along the inside,
but was headed by an outer presser with five sixteenths to go, caved in upper stretch, and was protected and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SPOOKY CHANNEL settled off of the pace two wide, bided time in the three path turning for home, fanned six wide entering the lane, offered a good kick to
rally outside of foes through midstretch, ranged up to the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead late. RISING EMPIRE set the pace
along the inside, inched clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer on-charging rival at the sixteenth pole, and gave way grudgingly. GENTLE
SOUL bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, saved ground off of the pace, but lacked room to slip inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, altered
course outside of that one at the three sixteenths pole, but got outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, and kept on to hold show. ANOTHER MYSTERY
laid off of the pace three to four wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, but was outkicked for minor placings in midstretch, kept on, but was fended off for
show late. ENGLISH TAVERN bumped with an inner rival early on, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn before swinging to the
seven path entering the lane, and moved up outside of rivals. RISK MANAGER stalked outside of the pace setter, chased that one while being floated to the
four path around the far turn, and weakened between horses in midstretch. TIZ THE BOMB tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but gave
way with a half mile remaining. NATIVE THUNDER tracked from midpack three wide, pursued from between horses around the far turn, and faded. ATONE
stalked along the inside, pressed the leader from the three path whilst between horses and under urging around the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid in
upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
SOUTHLAWN rated at the rear along the inside, tracked from the two path down the backstretch, pocketed herself just behind the top pair around the far
turn, altered course outside of the newly leading PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS at the three sixteenths pole, offered a rally to drive past that foe at the sixteenth
pole, and drew clear. PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS bobbled briefly while subtly losing balance at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path, loomed a
danger while ranging up to a leading HOOSIER PHILLY around the far turn, gained an advantage at the quarter pole, drove clear in upper stretch, but
succumbed to an outer foe's charge at the sixteenth pole, and remained clear of show. THE ALYS LOOK laid off of the pace in the four path, but failed to
respond to coaxing in the four to five paths around the far turn, yet sustained stride while one paced through the lane to secure show. HOOSIER PHILLY
prompted the pace two wide, gained an advantage approaching the three furlong pole, met a bid from an outer challenger turning for home, got headed by
that one at the quarter pole, offered little resistance in upper stretch, and weakened. CHRISTIAN D'ORO set the pace along the inside, but was headed by
an outer foe into the far turn, weakened turning for home, was eased in midstretch, pulled up and was dismounted in the final sixteenth, then received a
precautionary cooling bath from her handlers before walking off.

Footnotes
KINGSBARNS set a comfortable and lightly pressured pace along the inside, remained in hand as an outer foe vied around the far turn, responded readily
once set down entering the lane, quickly drew off in upper stretch, and ran well through the wire. DISARM tracked from midpack along the inside, saved
ground while awaiting racing room around the far turn, sustained a rail rally to gain place at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. JACE'S ROAD
popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, was backed out and reloaded after a veterinarian exam, pressed the eventual winner from the outside,
vied around the far turn, but proved no match for that one entering the lane, gave way, and lost placed to an inner rival at the eighth pole. SHOPPER'S
REVENGE stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, but vacated the rail entering the lane to vie for minor places, got outkicked for
show by an inner bidder in upper stretch, chased thereafter, and held fourth. SUN THUNDER laid off of the pace in the two path, bided time behind traffic
around the far turn, then improved inside of foes in upper stretch. INSTANT COFFEE rated off of the pace along the inside, was driven for gain in the five to
six paths and outside of foes around the far turn, inched closer turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch without reaching contention. TAPIT'S
CONQUEST laid off of the pace three wide, was coaxed along among foes turning for home, altered course outside of traffic approaching midstretch, but
lacked a bid. CAGLIOSTRO broke through the gate pre-raced, but was reloaded without further incident, tracked three wide, stalked from within striking
range around the far turn, but yielded in the four path and between horses in upper stretch. BASELINE BEATER broke awkwardly, trailed around both turns,
and made little impact. DENINGTON laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer to track four wide around the far turn, but spun into the lane in the five
path, and tired between horses in midstretch. CURLY JACK broke a step slow, lacked speed two wide, fanned from the five path to the eight path in upper
stretch, and failed to factor. SINGLE RULER tracked two wide and between horses, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MACHO BEANIE stalked the run-away leader two wide, closed in to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. AZTEC GEM sped clear, maintained a wide
margin around the turn, but offered little resistance to MACHO BEANIE's bid at the furlong grounds, and was second best. GOT ME A CHRYSLER pursued
from midpack two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to narrowly gain show at the wire. COLT'S BRIM chased along the inside, and
sustained stride to just miss show. REDDINGANDLEE laid off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide in midstretch, and stayed on to miss reaching show.
JOSIE'S PRIORITY tracked three wide, but gave way while hanging on his left lead through the lane, and lost show to rivals on either side late. ZINGING
BAYOU lacked speed along the inside, and moved up between horses. CITY OF LOVE broke out and bumped a foe at the start, then never threatened.
STEAUXLIT never got involved from the inside. OURPERFECTPRINCE laid off of the pace in the five to six paths around the turn, and tired. IRON MOON
broke slowly while bumping the gate, and got outrun. MALAKI EMPIRE broke slowly while being bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace
four wide, and weakened.

Footnotes
AVAILABLE STAR tracked in midpack in the two path, rallied between horses to bid inside of the leader at the furlong pole, and edged ahead late. LAURI'S
WISH set the pace along the inside, held sway in the three path in upper stretch, met an inner challenge passing the furlong pole, and was bested. WISE
ANCHOR pursued from midpack in the three path, lacked room to split foes in the five path entering the lane, altered out to the seven path in upper stretch,
and stayed on willingly to reach show. G'WILDCAT stalked the leader from the three path, then chased in the four path and between horses through the
lane. TAMBOURINE STAR trailed three wide, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied. BINDING AGREEMENT tracked in the four path, floated
to the six path entering the lane, chased through midstretch, but tired late. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN lacked speed two wide, shifted out approaching
midstretch, but encountered traffic troubles through the final sixteenth. COACH KENNY saved ground far back, but to no avail. HAIL STATE stalked along
the inside, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before fading. HOORAY AUSTIN raced far back while hung in the five to six path, spun into the
lane in the nine path, and was outrun. GEORGE ALLEN had his head turned left when the gates sprung causing him to break multiple lengths slow, laid off
of the pace four wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
SPLITTING ACES tracked from midpack two wide, saved ground along the inside around the turn, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and rallied
to reel in the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole. R T'S CAJUN LADY sped clear in the two path into the turn, but weakened while hanging on his left lead in
midstretch, and was caught entering the final sixteenth. LIGHTENING MO chased in the three path, closed in on the tiring leader along with an outer rival in
the final furlong, but was outkicked by that foe while flattening out. VISIONISTA was void of speed while hung six wide around the turn, fanned to the nine
path entering the lane, yet offered a strong belated rally. KISSTER broke slowly and lagged behind around the turn, shifted out to the eight path in
midstretch, and offered a late kick. CERTIFIED GEM lacked speed two wide, altered outwardly and across a foe's heels in midstretch, but lacked a bid.
CALCITE laid off of the pace in the five path, and failed to menace in the eight path through the lane. SWEET ALEXIS raced far back three wide, shifted in
at the furlong grounds, but steadied hard multiple times while stymied behind a stopping rival in the final furlong. CHUCHI broke slowly, saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail while hanging on his left lead through the lane. CUSTOM COMEDY prompted the pace along the inside of the leader, chased that
foe from the three path around the turn, and weakened. STARSNMOTION chased from midpack in the four path, but stopped.
