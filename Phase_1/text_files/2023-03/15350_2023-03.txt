Footnotes
LAMUTANAATTY broke on top, cleared before a quarter, expanded that advantage through the turn and into upper stretch, continued to hold a comfortable
advantage to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY last to leave, steadied when in tight along the rail with four
furlongs remaining, fell back, moved out, four wide into the stretch as his rider was losing his whip, rallied widest drive to be clear for the runner up spot and
closing the gap on the winner late. OTTOMAN EMPIRE forwardly placed along the inside, fell back through the turn while continuing to save ground,
regained the third spot with a steady run through the lane. SCHMOOZE off the pace while racing outside, improved four wide through the turn, flattened out
in the drive. SMOOTH SCAT in the second flight while in the two path and between horses, had little left for the drive. SALTA chased the winner up the
backstretch on the outside of the second flight, faded.

Footnotes
LIL BRO COOP settled off the pace and the inside, advanced on the tiring leader far turn, three wide bid, clear into the lane, drew off, driving. MAGNIFICUS
lacked early foot, steered out three wide when beginning to advance second turn, long drive for the place spot, gained the nod, no threat to the winner.
STAND PROUD off step slow, void of any early speed, began to advance far turn, floated out four wide by the MAGNIFICUS turning into the stretch, dueled
with that one to the finish, missed place. CHROME RUN back off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, narrowly gained the show.
MAJESTIC FLAG closest to the leader, challenged along the rail as the winner was also making a bid midway on the second turn, could not match that one
into the stretch when beginning to fade, continued to back up. RANSAM PAYNTER broke on top, soon sprinted clear, set some lively fractions up the
backstretch, stopped when headed on the second turn, distanced stretch, jogged accross. ASSET BASIS fell back after a quarter, fell further and further
back, also distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in as well.

Footnotes
FAST LANE unhurried early in the second flight inside, steered out to be four wide into the stretch, challenged soon after while widest of the lead pack,
drove well clear under a right handed crop. PIKACHU void of early foot, came three wide out of the turn, rallied to be clear for the place, not a match for the
winner. THE STEELMAN rank at the break to begin slowly, continued to lag into and through the turn, roused, found best stride too late while improving
through traffic. FALCONITE broke on top, fell back off the early leaders, dropped inside through the turn, had little left for the stretch drive. HACKER
pressed the issue up the backstretch in the three path, dueled turn, between foes into the stretch and weakened. CADILLAC COWBOY away in good order,
raced forwardly and outside for a half, also faltered in the drive. HEART HEADED ARKY moved up inside after the start to set or force the pace in the two
path and closest to the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
MARK THE MOOSE unhurried early while along the inside, continued to save ground early turn, swung out five wide turning for home, displayed good
energy down the middle of the strip, late bid, edging away. MY NOAH lacked early foot, came three wide out of the turn, also rallied late to be up for the
place. MIRI A COINCIDENCE in the second flight while racing off the inside, closer three wide late in the turn, took over approaching midstretch, could not
contain the top two. GOLDEN LUNA bump break, quickly recovered to press the pace from the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, bid upper
stretch, weakened in the run to the wire. LORD M broke out, bumped GOLDEN LUNA, was righted to show the way along the inside, continued to hold the
advantage through the turn, weakened drive. MORNING DRIVE off a step slow, raced back and was never a threat. TALK TO TOKEY in the second flight
along the inside, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
KRUSIN ROCKET close from the start, vied four wide into the turn, cleared to the two path by midway on the bend, showed the way into the lane, shrugged
off nearest pursuer to extend that advantage into the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up. HOWL YEAH lacked early foot off the inside, four
to five wide midway on the turn, fanned seven wide into the lane, set down, finished willingly to be getting to the winner. PERIPATETIC off a step slow,
raced well back for a half, angled out sharply to be eight wide into the stretch, rallied to gain the show while remaining widest. COLONEL BARTON
forwardly placed off the inside, steadied in traffic with nine sixteenths to run, recovered and prompted the winner through the turn and into the lane,
weakened the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. LOUD BOY back off the pace and the inside, four to five wide and between horses turning for home,
when improving a bit, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. RIDGEPOINT ROAD bothered and was rank just after the start, in some traffic with a
half to run, moved out and was five to six wide through the turn, no closing kick. FULL BUCK MOON off a step slow, raced well back for a half, three wide
and behind horses into the stretch, improved position late while out in the strip. FLASHY BOY GOES broke in, was straightened, raced within striking
distance just off the inside, two path through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. WORK ALL DAY off the pace inside, encountered some traffic into
the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. DIESEL FUEL in the second flight outside, four wide turn, tired through the stretch. SACRAMENT pushed
in by FLASHY BOY GOES just after the start bothering RIDGEPOINT ROAD, set the early pace along the inside, gave way turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
CONSPIRACY FACT forwardly placed along the inside first turn, continued to race within striking distance up the backstretch and into the second turn,
boxed in throughout that bend while coming off the inside a bit, knifed toward the inside to hit a seam when straightened for home, under clever handling,
challenged along the rail past the furlong marker and drew clear. RED RUN in the second flight well off the inside, three wide up the backstretch, closer four
wide midway on the final bend, vied into the lane, could not match the winner late, clear for the place. RECKER POINT off a step slow, saved ground when
back, closer while continuing toward the inside through the second bend, behind the winner upper stretch, lacked a winning response while gaining the nod
for the show at the wire. JOLLY TOMMY pressed the early leader from the two path, dueled into the far turn, put a head in front soon after, continued to hold
a slight advantage through upper stretch then weakened when headed by the winner outside that one just inside the furlong grounds. ICE BLAST settled off
the pace and the inside, three wide out of the final turn, lacked a significant closing response. TEXAS RED HOT fell back to trail after the start, two path,
improved position in the drive while never dangerous. NOTARY lacked early foot, moved out to be five wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. OUT
RUN'M in mid pack, came four wide for the drive, tired. SLIM MAN broke alertly, showed the way through the first turn, dueled into the far turn, stopped
when headed midway on that bend.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER stalked the early pace outside, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, put a head in front nearing the furlong marker and
edged clear under firm handling. JACKMAN narrowly set the pace along the inside, vied into the lane while still closest to the rail, could not match the
winner late, proved determined for the place while between foes at the wire after allowing ULTIMATE the inside late. DARK TIMBER pressed the runner up
from the outside, remained closest to that one through the turn, vied between horses past the furlong pole, outkicked for the second spot late. ULTIMATE
broke back, saved ground into and through the turn, in traffic late in the bend, continued inside, mild rail bid late, not enough for the place. COLD AS HELL
in the second flight while racing along the inside, had little for the drive. CHIEF RON in mid pack early, fell back turn to trail into the lane, failed to menace.
AMERICAN PURE last away, four wide through the turn, also failed to threaten. STAGE LEFT was never a threat while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN HOTTIE settled off the pace well off the inside, advanced in the three path to challenge second turn, vied on the outside past the furlong marker,
edged clear late under firm handling. QUEENS UP broke on top, set a moderate pace toward the inside, responded when confronted late in the second
bend, long drive, gave ground grudging to the winner while closest to the inside of the first flight, gained the nod for the second spot at the wire. LISETTE
unhurried off the inside, two path through the second turn, shifted out a bit and made a late push to finish willingly and narrowly miss the place. COASTAL
CHARM closest to the runner up off the inside, continued to apply pressure to that one up the backstretch, challenged and vied between the top two out of
the final turn and past the furlong marker, came up flat in the late going. BOW BOW GIRL last to leave, continued to trail, was never involved. ICE ORCHID
within striking distance along the inside, continued to maintain contact with the leader midway up the backstretch, gave way readily soon after, fell well back,
was eased up through the stretch to jog in.

Footnotes
AXTON dwelt at the break to spot the field several lengths, continued far back for a half in the two path, dropped to the rail for the drive, roared up te inside
to be up at the wire in an inspired effort. MANTA REY back off the pace and the inside, steered out when beginning to advance midway on the turn, four
wide into the lane, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, led late, nipped at the wire. CYCLONE off slowly, raced back and along the inside,
came four wide for the drive, late run mid track, not enough in the final strides while still finishing up willingly. LUNDBERG closest to the runaway pacesetter,
collared that one at the furlong marker, could not contain the first three to the wire. KUPP away in good order, sprinted clear early through a quick opening
quarter, continued to show the way by diminishing daylight into the lane, caved in the final furlong. HASKELLED settled off the pace along the inside, saved
ground to no avail as he came up empty for the drive. CROSSING in the second flight while between foes, also found lacking for the stretch run.
SWAGGISH in the main body while three wide, tired through the stretch.
