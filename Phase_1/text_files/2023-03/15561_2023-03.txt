Footnotes
WORDS OF WISDOM forwardly placed into the first turn, rank, steered out into the two path midway on the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, disposed of
the other speed when straightened for home, briefly clear, just inside the furlong grounds, enough left to last. QUICK TO BLAME forwardly placed off the
inside, carried out three wide midway on the first turn by the rank winner, chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch, remained in the three path through
the second turn when moving a bit closer, continued to make slow progress on the winner past the furlong marker, challenged outside that one late, missed.
SMOOTH SCAT away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, fell back off the winner nearing midstretch, weakened the final furlong,
comfortably saved the show. JACKS FIRE BALLS lacked speed along the inside through the first turn, moved out in the two path around a tiring foe second
turn, went evenly through the lane. FETCHS BRAHM settled off the pace in the two path early, dropped inside second turn, tired. QUALITY RUN off a step
slow, fell further back while remaining sluggish, never close.

Footnotes
DREAM STREAK prompted the pace off the inside, advanced on the leader in the two path, took over, clear into the stretch, narrowly gained the nod at the
wire. XYLOPHONE void of speed, four wide advance through the final turn, made a late run on the outside of the winner late, narrowly missed the nod.
HOPING FOR A RING mid pack while racing off the inside, asked along second turn, two path into the lane, mild rally, no threat to the top two the final
furlong. CARELESS HEIRESS four wide into the first turn, three wide exiting when within striking distance, continued three wide through the second bend,
lacked a closing kick. EMERALD PRINCESS broke outward but alertly, cleared to the inside into the first turn, continued to set the pace toward the inside up
the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner late in the final bend then began to falter into the stretch. SIMONA'S CHOICE broke with the field,
lacked early foot, in traffic toward the inside first turn, traffic onto backstretch, pulled backstretch, lacked a closing response. BECKY'S TATTOO forwardly
placed while saving ground, began to fall back before a half while continuing inside, no menace. CLOSE TO ME broke back, not involved while racing four
wide through the second bend. A GIRL LIKE ME off a step slow, was never a factor.

Footnotes
HELLORHIGHWATER never far back, moved off the inside, three wide advance to take over late in the final turn, came four wide for the drive, drew clear,
held the runner up comfortably safe late while outside that one. TIGER MOON settled off the pace while along the inside, mid pack while continuing to save
ground second turn, improved rail, clearly second best. CITY LEGEND within striking distance while outside, four wide onto the backstretch, continued well
out in the strip while within striking distance, four wide again through the second bend, lacked a closing kick to prove no match for the top two. GREAT
FACES sprinted clear after an alert break, set the pace while racing in the two path, weakened when replaced on the lead by the winner late in the final turn.
WHAT A COUNTRY fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the first turn, three wide through the second, improved position slightly while never a
serious threat. CELERITY void of speed in trailing before a half, failed to menace. JINGLE off a step slow, mid pack while just off the inside, was finished
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
QUEENIES WAY dueled up front along the inside, continued to alternate into the lane, gained a larger advantage then crept clear inside the furlong
grounds, just lasted to gain the nod. BAYSHORE FOXES closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, raced three wide into the lane, roused, late push to
challenge at the wire, missed the nod. BAD OUTLOOK in the second flight racing inside, continued toward the rail into the stretch, could do little with the top
two late, finished up best of the rest. ESSENTIAL BELLA dueled up front off the inside, steadily weakened the final furlong to lose a couple of positions.
MARTIQUE MISS in the main body while racing outside, four wide through the turn, managed some mild late interest to finish on equal terms with
ESSENTIAL BELLA for the fourth spot. ALITA broke back, lacked speed, encountered traffic when beginning to advance late in the turn, continued to pick
off a couple more rivals in upper stretch then flattened out a bit. GRAYDAWN DAY in mid pack while out in the strip, four wide entering the stretch, failed to
muster a rally. BACK SEAT BETTY broke back, void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve, no real threat. GO GO GO in mid pack while
racing in the two path, tired through the stretch. SWEETNESS TO made little impact while racing four wide. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE last away, trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
STORM APPROACHING with the pace along the inside after an alert break,, edged away past the furlong marker then held the runner up safe late. RUN
POPPY within striking distance while racing outside, four wide through the turn, came five wide for the drive to lose considerable ground to the winner,
closer nearing midstretch then did not have enough in the late going, clearly second best. SIX WHIPS broke out and back, moved up steadily, moved out a
bit into the turn, continued to gain, while angling out four wide into the lane, brief challenge between horses with a furlong to run, flattened out a bit late.
CHICAGO'S GRAY with the pace while racing three wide, continued to contest the issue into and through upper stretch, weakened the final furlong.
EXPLOSIVE PRIDE vied up front while between horses, weakened through the stretch. SCOTT CITY broke out, void of early foot inside, continued back in
the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. RACING IN MY HEART off slowly, bothered, remained back throughout in
failing to make an impact. PROCHARGER in mid pack and along the inside, began to tire after a half. PROPELLANT stopped before a half, eased under
wire, bled.

Footnotes
KABOOM BABY prompted the pace three wide up the backstrech and into the turn, four wide exiting the turn to lose some ground to the leader, collared
that one just inside the furlong marker, kicked well clear under steady handling. CONNIE K dueled up front closest to the inside, edged away to be briefly
clear approaching midstretch, drifted in as the winner was nearing soon after then could not match that one to the wire, remained well clear of the others.
SULWE lacked early foot in trailing early, two path into the turn, worked way out to the four path into the stretch, rallied mildly to be along for the show late,
not a threat to the top pair. RUN FEARLESS lacked speed near the back of the pack, two path turn, went evenly through the lane, not enough for the show.
HEATED ARGUMENT broke alertly, dueled up front outside the runner up, gave way from between rivals entering the stretch. LADY ASTRID in the second
flight outside, four wide into the turn, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. RICHNESS was finished after a half along the inside.
MY DAMS ATITUDE lacked speed, three to four wide through the turn, remained back.

Footnotes
GUNNING fell back to be outrun into the turn, moved off the inside, steered out further to be four wide into the lane, closed with good energy in remaining
widest to win going away. ADALINE JULIA in the second group outside, three wide through the turn, rallied to finish up willingly and be up for the place late.
AMERICAN LILY broke alertly, with the pace while widest of the first flight into the turn, disposed of the other speed to be clear in upper stretch, extended
that advantage past the furlong marker, faltered, salvaged the show late. SUMMER SHOES broke back, raced in mid pack along the inside, mild late
interest to be coming late for the show. LET'S BE CLEAR broke back, lacked speed, skimmed rail into the lane, moved out in traffic midstretch, dropped
back to the rail and finished up evenly. JETS A GINNIN with the pace while between horses for a half, gave way. SUE ELLEN MISHKIN broke in air, well
back, failed to menace. CANADA'S CUSTOMS away in good order, raced with the pace for four furlongs along the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
WICKED HALO settled outside early in the second flight, advanced three then four wide to challenge turning for home, fell back off the runner up while
drifting out then back in, rebid with less than a furlong remaining, wore than same rival down under firm handling. MATAREYA behind the early pace toward
the inside, dropped to the rail and slipped through the dueling leaders late in the turn along the inside, gainied the advantage into the lane, slightly larger
lead past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. I'M THE BOSS OF ME broke out slightly, was straightened to duel up front closest to
the inside through some blistering fractions, allowed the runner up the rail late in the turn, proved no match for that one or the winner through the stretch.
PRETTY BIRDIE broke in good order, alternated up front through those quick fractions, three path turn, in a bit tight when giving way into the lane,
continued to stop and finished well back.

Footnotes
NINJA WARRIOR close from the start while four wide into the first turn, continued forward and outside, vied three wide through the second turn, shook clear
late in that bend, maintained daylight past the furlong marker then had enough left late to hold off the runner up. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE in the second
flight outside, came three wide for the drive, set down, steadily getting to the winner late. RAM in mid pack off the inside, in traffic into the far turn, continued
to race in traffic through the remainder of that bend, staged a mild rally when clear for the drive. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke on top, narrowly set the early
pace, dueled the middle half, gave way from between horses late in the final turn. WOLFE COUNTY dueled up front along the inside, also weakened when
turning for home. JEDREK void of early foot, remained well back for six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. STELLAR TAP
stumbled at the start, raced back, four to five wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. SONO GRATO hesitated at the break, remained back throughout
and was never a factor. JOLLY TOMMY in the second flight outside, four wide first turn, again second, tired.
