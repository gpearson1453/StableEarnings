Footnotes
GOT MOJO was urged at the break, obtained a clear lead then was put to rating tactics dictating the pace racing just off the rail, faced pressure up the
backstretch, drifted out leaving the far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, dug in under left-handed urging and regained command by mid-stretch to
inch away late. JACKS SPRING BREAK broke a half-step slowly then was encouraged forward but caught outside four to five wide on the first turn, pursued
from outside into the far turn mounting a bid turning for home, obtained a narrow lead briefly in upper stretch but was outfinished while clear of the rest.
KWIK stalked from between runners then edged closer to press two to three wide up the backstretch, was encouraged along three furlongs out while losing
ground, altered inside the leaders about the five-sixteenths, ran on evenly in the stretch. WAVERUNNER settled off the pace racing just off the inside, came
out wider turning for home, failed to menace. TOAH pressed the pace from between runners three to four wide up the backstretch and far turn, weakened
thereafter. LIMBO'S PROMISE tracked from inside saving ground, failed to rally.

HONEY CREEK settled just off the pace, advanced outside a rival pursuing the leader heading up the backstretch, drew even about the five-sixteenths
racing about three wide, took a narrow lead by the top of the stretch, dueled till nearing the sixteenth pole then edged clear under steady urging. CAT TALE
BREEZE moved clear to dictate terms racing off the fence, was engaged midway on the turn, dueled gamely till late stretch then yielded grudgingly.
GOTOTHEWINDOW chased the early pace, steadily weakened. GOSPEL FLOW raced off the pace, was placed in tight quarters by the riderless horse
near the three-eighths, failed to rally. PREACH IT GIRL veered in at the break, lost the rider, walked off.

Footnotes
KODALINE broke a bit awkwardly spotting the field a bit over a length then settled at the rear while shifting in, made a rapid advance inside midway up the
backstretch to contend for the lead at the half, dueled through the turn and was put to a drive about the quarter, drifted about a bit in the stretch and edged
clear under stout urging. TREASURE COAST raced just off the leading pair three wide through the first turn, took closer order leaving the first turn and was
carried out by a drifting rival, moved back in and regained position to vie for the lead outside three deep through the far turn, proved no match for the winner
but held the place over GRANDSONSAM, who tucked in at the rear racing outside the eventual winner, advanced in tandem with that one nearing the half to
vie for the lead from between runners, lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished for second. STAPLETON SONG moved forward inside to contest the
early lead around the first turn, was steadily getting out heading up the backstretch, moved back nearer inside into the first turn, failed to rally. BARN
SHARK was urged forward at the break, dueled around the first turn, was carried out heading up the backstretch, angled in and moved back forward from
between runners to vie for the lead three wide late up the backstretch, began to weaken entering the far turn and was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
DISTORTED FLASH pressed from inside, bid near the quarter pole, was clear in upper stretch, managed to hold on and share the victory. DICEY settled off
the pace, switched out four wide about the quarter pole and put to urging with aim on the leaders, gained steadily in the stretch to share the victory. LACEY
BOSS settled at the rear unhurriedly, came out for the stretch run, ran on to get show honors while no threat to the top pair. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH
attended the pace from between runners, had no extra for the drive. MISS MELODY forced the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, weakened
for the drive. LYNN'S FOLLY broke in the air, chased from outside racing in the four to five path and asked to keep up three furlongs from home, came up
empty. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

HEADY MOVES attended the pace just off the early leader, vied between runners on the turn, edged clear in upper stretch, held sway under steady urging.
CANDY'S A DANDY attended the pace from outside, bid three to four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but held the place. GYPSY ROSE
raced toward the rear early, advanced between runners late up the backstretch, came into upper stretch five wide, gained steadily inside a rival and got the
nod for show over that one. MISSWISH settled toward the rear, fanned six wide into the stretch, was outfinished for show. LISA G was urged forward at the
break, forced the pace inside, steadily weakened in the stretch. SMART OKIE broke a half step slowly, came out in upper stretch and ran on. TOM'S GIRL
chased while racing off the inside, failed to rally. GOSPEL FAITH was floated seven wide into the stretch, made no bids. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. ADDED FRACTIONS AND CHANGED FINAL TIME UPON REVIEW.

LA PARADISO JORDAN pressed from inside, moved clear in upper stretch under urging, held safe. HANNAH FO FANNAH got away well then eased back
off the leading pair to stalk three wide, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but was no match while second best. GOSPEL EXPRESSION was coaxed at
the start, forced the pace from outside the eventual winner, weakened in the stretch, just held show honors. MS. MORENA bumped with a rival at the start,
bobbled early and lost the left iron, regained it later up the backstretch racing well off the inside, ran on but missed show honors. TOSH bumped at the start,
was outpaced, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED AND
FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ROCKPORT KAT stalked two wide early, took closer order to apply pressure up the backstretch, took the lead at the three-eighths, was overtaken at the top
of the stretch, dueled from inside the new leader, dug in under steady handling and was resurgent to edge away late. WIN FOR FUN stalked from outside
travelling three wide, advanced late on the far turn taking a narrow lead about the quarter pole, was a little further in front at the top of the stretch, dueled but
was outfinished. MORHAWK settled at the rear shifting nearer the inside, trailed into the stretch, rallied from between runners to get up for show honors.
LASTCALLFORALCOHOL hopped at the start, pursued mid-pack inside a foe but off the fence in the two to three path, lost show honors. MAYFAIR
HEIGHTS pursued from outside three to four wide off the leading trio, was never near enough to threaten. FROSTED PRAYER fought the rider's restraint
while keenly setting the pace, was pressured into the far turn, gave way.

Footnotes
WHIP attended the early pace, continued to pursue three to four wide, took command by the top of the stretch, moved clear and held sway while being kept
to the task. TRISTANS JOURNEY settled off the pace, angled six wide leaving the turn, took aim, could not reach the winner but was second best.
SELLING SHORT showed brief early speed outside, dropped back while pursuing the leaders, floated seven wide into the stretch, kept on in the lane to get
up for show honors over ORNERY AS HELL, who tracked from inside, began to shift out early on the turn while rapidly advancing willingly, was four wide at
the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch looming a threat five deep but evened out and lost show late. FROGGY steadied after the start, raced at the
rear, saved ground and ran on mildly. EL CHIHUAS moved forward between runners to force the pace two to three wide, weakened. MR L B J vied inside
early, dropped back and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. ADDED FRACTIONS AND CHANGED FINAL TIME UPON
REVIEW.

Footnotes
LINGERING PROMISE got away alertly despite breaking outwardly, ceded the early lead, switched outside that rival to stalk, went two to three wide into the
turn, moved clear into upper stretch and held safe. TIFFANY TWIST tracked from inside, shifted out three wide coming to the quarter pole, closed the gap
on the leader but was only second best. CADI DEVILLE settled toward the rear, raced two to three wide on the turn, engaged a rival in mid-stretch and won
the battle for show while closing willingly. EUTYCHIA moved near the inside on the turn racing mid-pack, had the rail in the stretch gaining mildly but was
outfinished for show. SUPERBLEA was forced out at the start, shifted in racing at the back, saved ground on the turn and improved position. FROSTY
BREW moved clear to set the pace, drifted out in the stretch while weakening and came up empty. SWEET TEA RED was in tight at the start, moved
forward pursuing the leaders five wide, failed to rally. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY switched out early racing at the rear, went three to five wide on the turn, failed
to menace. PAYDIEM pursued mid-pack going four wide on the turn, steadied on heels near the sixteenth pole. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE
WAS HAND-TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
