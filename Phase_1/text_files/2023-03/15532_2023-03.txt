Footnotes
TRIPP A MATIC tacked the early pace, advanced five wide through the second turn and surged clear for the win. MT. TAYLOR pressed the early pace,
went four wide into the second turn, kept on, was no match late and finished second best. KENTUCKY PEERLESS was allowed to settle early, raced three
wide into the second turn, angled out and finished evenly late. PASAMONTE MAN was outrun early, went eight wide out of the second turn and offered no
late rally. HEREDITARY raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the second turn and never fired. PIRATE JUNCTION set a pressured early pace from off
the rail and faded. LOOKING FOR BULL was unhurried early, raced seven wide through the second turn and was never a factor. MISS RULES was void of
speed, raced nine wide through the second turn and was never a threat.
