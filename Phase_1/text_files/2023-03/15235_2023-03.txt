the outside, second best. BLUEBERRY MASH was allowed to settle along the inside, made a inside bid nearing the quarter pole but needed more in the

Footnotes
DOCTOR ABBIE sent to the lead to set the early pace while racing off the inside, drew out on the turn and in the three path, then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best, driving. WARRIOR'S RANSOM was settled early, made a decisive middle move two wide to track the winner by the half mile marker,
then shifted out to be four wide on the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. ROWSIE EXPRESS chased the pace three
wide and shifted in by the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. AFRICAN ANGEL was well placed early on the inside, shifted out and was four wide by
the quarter pole, weakened. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO chased the pace on the inside and tired. DIVISIBILITY stalked the early pace then was through
after a half mile.

Footnotes
I SEE THE STARS pressed the pace between rivals, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, drew clear leaving the turn and then remained
clear to the wire to prove best, driving. KEEPING THE PEACE chased the early pace, two wide on the turn and between rivals by the quarter pole, swung
out four wide and finished well. LONGTAIL pressed the early pace and vied for command between rivals at the quarter pole and faded, held show award.
BERHANU set the pressured pace early on the inside, then vied for command on the inside by the quarter pole, faded, missed show award. COAST TO
COAST tracked the pace from the inside and saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed winning bid. FUTILE was reserved on the inside then had a
belated rally. BIG BAD BUD lacked a rally. KIKKERLAND prompted the pace five wide and weakened. SCREEN STAR was settled and raced wide on the
turn and was not a threat. AGAINST THE ODDS checked nearing the five eighths marker and dropped back, then weakened.

SALTY HEIR set the pace on the inside while clear, drew out on the turn and then drew off in the lane to prove much the best, ridden out. MR. REDOLFO
was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn but was no match to the winner while clearly second best. ENANO broke outwardly at the start,
showed no speed and failed to menace. SMOOZER stalked the pace three wide and stopped and was eased in the lane, walked off.
