Footnotes
RANCHO RED was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position while outside of rivals on the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, came
within aim of GRIFFITH PARK in mid-stretch, made a steady gain on that rival inside of the furlong marker, drew to even terms at the sixteenth-marker and
wore down the runner-up in the final stages to prevail. GRIFFITH PARK contested the early pace with several rivals then assumed command heading to the
turn, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, kept to task in the drive while staying clear to the furlong pole, was confronted nearing the
sixteenth-marker by RANCHO RED, met that bid to deep stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final stages and bested the rest.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS was away a bit slowly in the early going and was unhurried to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide into
the stretch, closed in the final furlong and was up for the show in the final strides. REALLY EASY contested the moderate early pace, chased GRIFFITH
PARK along the turn, lost position approaching mid-stretch, faded in the late stages and was just edged for the show. FINE SOFT MORNING disputed the
early pace then took back to stalk the moderate fractions, raced three wide along the turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and weakened in the late
stages. LET GEORGE DO IT contested the early pace then took back to chase into the turn while between rivals, chased from the rail to the quarter marker,
dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the final furlong.

MATCHLESS stalked the moderate early fractions, advanced while two wide on the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds, responded to steady urging in the final furlong, confronted SHE'S SO FANCY nearing the sixteenth-marker, matched strides with that rival to deep
stretch and bested the game runner-up on the wire to prevail. SHE'S SO FANCY broke alertly, pressed the moderate early pace while on a hold, dueled
with DANZIGS STAR STORM to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong pole, was confronted by
MATCHLESS nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that bid to the finish and was gamely bested for the win, while holding safely for the place. DANZIGS STAR
STORM was sent to contest the early pace, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, battled with SHE'S SO FANCY to mid-stretch, lost the lead to that
rival nearing the furlong grounds, stayed on in deep stretch but was outfinished by the top pair and held safely for third. LOVE LOST chased the moderate
early pace from the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

TAMANTARI stalked the decent early fractions while outside of rivals, lost ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the
stretch, re-rallied in mid-stretch, battled with CANDY'S CLONE to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed over the game runner-up in a blanket finish.
CANDY'S CLONE was prominent in the early stages, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, battled
gamely in deep stretch while running on the left lead, was outfinished in the final strides for the win by TAMANTARI and just held for the place. OLIVIA'S
CHOICE (IRE) hopped at the start and was off slowly, chased the decent early fractions, raced two wide into the turn then was roused three wide into the
stretch, came within aim at mid-stretch, was gaining in the late stages and just missed for the win and place, while well clear for the show. TAMARA MINE
stalked the decent early pace from the inside, came in tight approaching the turn, took up at the three-furlong marker, dropped back and was unable to
muster a late response. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA was hard to load, showed early speed and set a pressured pace to the turn, set decent fractions to the
quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

SONOMA DREAMING broke alertly and assumed command in the early going, was well handled through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, shook
free from BLACKENED in upper stretch and kept to task in the late stages to prevail. BLACKENED tracked the moderate early pace, advanced to press
SONOMA DREAMING to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, could not make headway on SONOMA DREAMING in the drive and held well in
the final stages to be second best. A ROUSING BABE chased the moderate early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, came in tight and was boxed in
nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, lacked a late response and was clear in the end for the show.
CONQUEST ROCKS raced just off of the early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. MARY WALKER chased the
moderate early pace, advanced while outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NORTHERN JEWEL rated off of the moderate early pace, inched closer while between rivals on the backstretch run, loomed three wide nearing the quarter
marker, came four wide into the stretch, assumed command nearing the furlong grounds and kicked clear in the late stages. LIBERTY WOLF broke in at the
start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, closed willingly in the drive,
was not able to reel in the winner in the late stages and ran on to be best of the rest. START THEM UP stalked the moderate early fractions from the rail,
tipped two wide for the stretch run, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, was not able to keep pace with the top two in the late stages and just held for the show
in the final strides. MIQUEAS chased the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the second turn, came six wide into the stretch,
lost ground nearing the furlong pole, ran evenly in the final stages and was outfinished for the show. LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO showed early speed and
was prominent into the first turn, raced close to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker,
took command in upper stretch, was overtaken by NORTHERN JEWEL nearing mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. UPDRAFT broke alertly and was
sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper
stretch, chased to the eighth pole and gave way in the final stages. WOLF'S LIFE was allowed to settle while not far back, came in a bit tight entering the
second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION broke alertly and settled off of the fast early pace, was well placed into the turn, advanced while three wide nearing the quarter
marker, assumed command leaving the turn, took a narrow advantage to mid-stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth to be much the best. IDAHO
ONCE contested the fast early pace then took back to track the speed into the turn, stalked PIPER'S CAUSEWAY through solid fractions to the quarter
marker, could not match strides with CLOVISCONNECTION leaving the turn, chased the winner to mid-stretch and just held on for second at the end. TALK
ABOUT AUTISM rated off of the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, raced four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, did not
offer the needed late response and just missed for the place, while well clear for the show. KING ADROCK chased the fast pace from the inside and lacked
a late response. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY was hustled to show early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, was
overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
HALLELUJAH BABY bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, took back to track the pace in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run,
was well positioned into the far turn, came within aim while two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased I'M GONNA SHINE to mid-stretch, reeled in that
rival in deep stretch and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. I'M GONNA SHINE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled
while carving moderate fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead in upper stretch and drew clear nearing the furlong pole, held safely to the
sixteenth-marker, felt pressure from HALLELUJAH BABY in deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest. THE RIVER
MANGITA took back to race in the second flight in the early stages, raced two wide into the second turn, was steered five wide into the stretch, was gaining
inside of the furlong marker and was clear for third at the end. SPORTS FOR WOMEN broke through the gate prior to the start, was forwardly placed into
the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run and into the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.
DADDY'S MOM tracked the moderate early pace from a three wide position, was well placed into the far turn, lost position nearing the top of the lane and
gave way in the final furlong. ZARAGOZA was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the second turn, swung six wide for the stretch drive and
did not threaten. LOOKOUT PASS was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, lost contact heading into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
RIO KING unhurried early and content to trail the field through the early stages, was still last going into the far turn, was asked for more run with three
furlongs to go and responded with sweeping move around the field, came into the stretch five-wide and ran away from the rest under a brisk hand ride while
on the wrong lead. SECRET CLUB was not asked for speed from the gate, was caught three wide into the first turn, bid four wide in the sprint for the wire,
could not keep pace with RIO KING in deep stretch and won the nod for second in the final strides. BIG FLAME held up near the rear of the field while
saving ground, moved up into contention going into the far turn, was stuck behind horses for the whole of the turn and into the stretch, got some room near
the eighth pole, finished evenly in deep stretch and was just edged for the place, while holding for show. ACCLIDER was content to track LIL MIRACLE
MAN from a length or two behind to the far turn, moved to challenge from the five-sixteenths pole, may have gained a brief lead at the top of the stretch, ran
on well but was outfinished in the final yards for a minor award. GALLANT WARREN held up in mid-pack through the first half-mile, pulled closer to the
leaders down the backstretch, bid for the lead with three furlongs to run, was between horses in the sprint for home but was outfinished in the late stages.
OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) away well then forced to check sharply when LIL MIRACLE MAN took the path passing the five-sixteenths pole, regained his stride
and relaxed nicely in a tracking position while saving ground, checked again going into the far turn while boxed in on the rail, had to wait for racing room
while full of run through the turn, held position while still behind horses to mid-stretch then checked again when ACCLIDER came over in the final yards. LIL
MIRACLE MAN came away from the gate intent on getting the early lead, crowded OTTAWA FIRE near the rail passing the three-sixteenths pole for the first
time, was allowed to set leisurely fractions while leading a parade of horses to the far turn, quickened when the race turned into a sprint past the
five-sixteenths pole, held on to mid-stretch then weakened in the last furlong.
