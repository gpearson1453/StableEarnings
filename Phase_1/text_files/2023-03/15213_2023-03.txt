DIAMOND was reserved early, three wide on the turn, swung out five wide and rallied well for the palce award. PAL CAL chased the pace and was four
wide on the turn and lacked the needed bid, bested rest. DRONE SWARM lost irons into the first turn, recovered around the half mile marker, then passed
the tiring rivals. BANANAS ON FIRE stalked the pace and then prompted the pace three wide and tired. ROLLING PALISADES set a pressured pace on the
inside and then gave way on the turn. TOMASCO pressed the early pace on the inside and then stopped.

SHOW SOME SKIN was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, continued to make a bid on the inside and drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best, driving. SUSIKIN was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, raced in the two path and was headed leaving the furlong marker
and could not go with the winner late, second best. STORMY SPELL tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but
flattened out in the final furlong. HILL VALLEY tracked the early pace and was three to four wide on the turn and weakened. LIMONATA was fractious in the
