Footnotes
SORPRESO four then three wide just off the duel up front, advanced on those foes coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four then three wide
into upper stretch taking over command, went clear under a drive to prevail. BOYS CODE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. WEST STAR chased just off
the inside until tipped out three to four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled back inwards to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, took to
the rail straightened away and improved position to procure the show honors. REUNION TOUR dueled three then two wide with STEERAGE to his inside,
took over sole command inside the three-eighths marker and slipped away briefly before being confronted by the top one, swung three wide into upper
stretch and was displaced from command, weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. M. C. DOUBLE R broke out at the start under coaxing
and bumped VOLCKER RULES, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. SOMAMA BEACH
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and tired. STEERAGE dueled from the two path down the backstretch with REUNION TOUR to his outside, tucked inside through the turn and was
headed midway, faded under coaxing through the latter portion of the bend before taking the inside route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.
VOLCKER RULES bumped at the start by M. C. DOUBLE R, who broke outwards, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung
five wide for home and made no impact. TIZA BROWN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole,
tipped three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND BLUES coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away to
the finish kept to task. OUR SON JAKE five paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn
advancing to take command at the three-eighths, widened away through the latter portion of the turn and got set down spinning just off the inside for home,
dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish to safely preserve the place honors. CHEEKY TICO chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild kick. FRENCHBORO chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered no rally. GHOSTLYPRINCE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand from the three path, tucked inside into the turn and yielded the front at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and
faltered.

Footnotes
RUN DEVIL remained prominently placed after out-breaking the competition by a narrow advantage, was patiently ridden attending the second place
finisher, two to three wide, inched up to draw on near even terms during the last few jumps leading up to the quarter pole, settled in at the head of the lane
and had the pilot go to work, fought its way to a clear lead with a sixteenth to go then drew off smartly. GAME THEORY was in no need of encouragement
moving to the top after the field had been sent off and running, showed the way,near the inside route, shadowed by the ultimate winner, felt that rival all the
more as the three-quarters was being completed, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, kept pace with the near leader for a little while longer, held well
enough afterwards to save second. DUCKPHAT rode the rail, came under a drive in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, angled three wide into
the lane, proved no match for the top twosome. REIGNING CHICK took up position in the two path prior to arriving at the end of the backstretch, was
midway on the turn when put to a drive, moved out five wide for the stretch run, becoming the widest of all, failed to muster the needed response. SAVE
GRACE three wide onto the turn, was four wide exiting it, came up empty. DIAMOND COLLECTOR along the outside, chased the pace towards the two
path, shifted over to the inside route at the top of the lane, had no offering.

Footnotes
CLOVER STREET away to the front, dueled from the two path with ICHIBAN to her inside, shook off that rival near the quarter pole confronted by DREAM
ON CARA, got set down spinning just off the inside for home before taking to the rail straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. DREAM ON
CARA three wide off the duel, came under coaxing at the three-eighths advancing on the top pair, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. MY ANGEL chased three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position. KRYSTALHEIR chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and weakened.
ICHIBAN dueled inside of CLOVER STREET coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch shaken off and
weakened in the stretch. NORTHWAY broke in at the start brushing BANDULU QUEEN, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. GOOD ACCELEBRATE chased along the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, made no impact. BELLA SONADORA six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. BANDULU QUEEN
bumped at the start by NORTHWAY breaking inwards, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn, swung
four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

THE REVENGER broke in at the start placing foes in tight and causing half the pressure that pinched out SCOTTY, vied from the five path down the
backstretch early on before easing off a bit, tucked to the two path into the turn coming again between rivals to vie for command through the bend under
coxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive loosely between rivals, got directed in two paths inside the eighth pole and
was brushed by VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD coming out slightly near the sixteenth marker clinging to the front, came in bumping that rival in the final strides
and gamely got the bob on the wire. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD vied inside down the backstretch before briefly establishing sole command four furlongs from
home, remained inside through the turn vying inside a pair once more through that bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug n under a drive
heads apart for command, came out and brushed the aforementioned foe near the sixteenth marker, battled on gamely then got bumped in the final jumps
and missed on the line. SWIFT TAP vied outside a pair seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. EXXTOP chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on one paced to the finish. FOREVER WICKED chased three
wide until tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild bid. KUMAR hustled from
the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, weakened. MARCO ISLAND chased along the inside under a
ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, offered no response. ICY STORM chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths and made no impact. CRYPTO CASH chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, made no
impact, then got pulled after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. SCOTTY got pinched between foes at the start, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch and then along the inside through the turn and into upper stretch and made no impact. AMERICAN LINCOLN chased two to three wide down
the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, continued three to four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
LIFETIME OF CHANCE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with ART OF COURAGE to his inside, took over command five-sixteenths from
home and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then forged clear under a drive to prevail. Z DANCER coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside,
got out nearing the three-eighths to the four path and was corrected by the rider, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
running on to be along safe for the place honors in a good first outing. RUNANDSCORE broke in at the start bumping ART OF COURAGE into WHO ME,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while keeping on to procure the show honors. I'M JUST chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled
six wide into upper stretch, improved position for the last major share. OCTOBER BLISS five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
into the turn, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and got directed inwards by the rider forcing MUDVILLE NINE to check sharply off his heels in the
two path at that station, spun two to three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. TUNNEL VISION four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened. ART OF COURAGE got bumped at the start by RUNANDSCORE and in turn bumped
WHO ME, dueled inside of LIFTIME OF CHANCE, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside
route into upper stretch and faltered. MUDVILLE NINE chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and was
forced to check sharply off the heels of OCTOBER BLISS when that foe came in and impeded him at the three-eighths, lost all momentum as a result and
was guided quietly along while tiring to the end. ZEALOUS LEGACY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, and gave way. WHO ME got bumped at the start by ART OF COURAGE due to pressure from RUNANDSCORE breaking inwards,
chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out two then three wide briefly under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths before being placed to a
protective hold, got guided further outside cantering eight wide into upper stretch eased up, then got pulled up in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker
and was subsequently vanned off.
