Footnotes
KEEPONROCKINMEBABY Blitzed to lead, grew advantage throughout, confidently. PIRATE MISCHIEF Tracked between rivals opening stages, fully
commenced move around the three-sixteenths pole, split a rival and the rail at the eighth pole, picked up well to best the rest. GEBO Stalked outside rivals
in a line of three, carried widest on the turn, willingly late. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY Chased loose leader between two foes, let inner rival clear and moved to the
rail at the quarter pole, mildly progressed through the lane. WEST COAST ANDY Pursued along the rail in a line of three, advanced clear of two opponents
around the quarter pole, drifted out a path on the bend which allowed for PIRATE MISCHIEF to get through, faded in the final hundred yards. DUKE CITY
KITTY Forced off the pace along the two path, never factored. BELLA VINO Settled well off the pace while travelling in the inner paths, never threatened.
WE WANT ANOTHER Missed the break and showed very little, always detached from the rest of the field.

Footnotes
SONGOFTHEDESERT Dueled from the outside with NIP NAP and maintained position through the backstretch run, drew off from rival just inside the
quarter pole, fully took off inside the three-sixteenths and punched through the line cozily. NIP NAP Dueled with inner rival from the blocks, put away by that
foe just inside the quarter pole, ran evenly through the stretch, a clear second best. MY FUNNY GAL Tracked between horses early stages, cleared to the
rail at the quarter pole, progressed well on the bend and picked up down the lane for minor awards. BLUE GESSAMI Settled three wide up the backside,
moved up at the three-sixteenths pole three wide, mildly gained through the stretch. YOU NEVER CALL Pursued three wide opening stages, called upon at
the quarter pole, drifted off the rail, began to fade at the three-sixteenths, nothing left. TIZ TENACIOUS Shuffled out at the start and was always far off.
ZENMAGIC Broke in stride but shot the backside gap soon after and dislodged the rider, walked off. IZANAMI Veered in sharply right after the start clearing
the rail but losing the rider, walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS HELD INTO THE ACTIONS OF #1 IZANAMI AND #2 ZENMAGIC SHORTLY AFTER
THE START. NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
CROSS EXAMINE Tracked between rivals in the second flight around the first turn, commenced bid in same path at the five-sixteenths, fully opened up
stride at the quarter pole while travelling four wide, loomed boldly to take command inside the eighth pole, came home well on the wrong lead.
BAKERSFIELD BABE Broke best and set off for the lead, left an opening inside for the run up the backside in which SHORT JOURNEY moved through to
adjoin at the three-eighths, maintained a narrow lead up to the eighth pole when overtaken by the eventual winner who she was simply no match for.
SHORT JOURNEY Dove to the rail in the short run to the first turn, progressed to join the leader and duel at the three-eighths pole, stayed in the fray up
until the eighth pole where from there was outfinished by top duo. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA Pressed the lead three wide throughout, overhauled by closers at
the three-sixteenths pole, finished evenly through the lane. SHACKEY'S LOVE Settled along the rail in the second flight on the first turn, dropped back as
soon as they hit the backside, did not go on when the rest of the field did and was not asked for much in the run home. WITCHES DANCE Set up shop just
off the pace but then became short of room and checked into the first turn, was detached from that point on and only passed on tiring rival. DYNAMIC
WOMAN Travelled three wide off the pace, never progressed, tired through the lane.

NORTHERN QUEST Stalked between in the second flight heading into the first turn, sifted through traffic up to the backside, challenged at the
five-sixteenths pole in a three wide bid, made a narrow lead inside the eighth pole, just kept finding. BREXTON Stalked three wide, moved up at the
three-eighths pole, made the lead at the three-sixteenths while traveling in the three path, overhauled at the eighth pole, flattened out down the stretch.
TELLER Traveled in the top flight in the two path, cleared to lead at the half mile pole and opened up a distinct advantage that was held till the quarter pole,
after being overtaken fought courageously but could not find more. FLY BUDDY FLY Stalked along the rail, kept to task at the five-sixteenths inside of rivals,
no match for the top three. AUTISM SAVANT In the rear in the four path on both turns, only progressed beyond tiring foes. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST Led
by the stands the first time but was overtaken at the half mile pole and gradually backed out from that point on. TROPHY CHEST Settled inside well off the
pace and never improved or factored.
