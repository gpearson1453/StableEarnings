TWO ANGELS stalked from outside going four wide into the turn, asked for run by the quarter pole, struck the lead by mid-stretch and was kept busy to the
wire. COZZOLANI was coaxed forward inside but outpaced early, chased from along the rail, put to urging leaving the turn, made a bid in mid-stretch but
was outfinished. SCRAPPY PATCH was urged at the break but lacking early speed, swung six wide into the stretch, kept on to get up for show. SHAWK'S
LIL AVA pursued the pace three to four wide, moved out five deep at the top of the stretch, was outfinished for show honors. SHE'S A PLAYER set the pace
racing off the rail, moved clear leaving the backstretch, faltered in upper stretch and faded. BONANZA GRADE pressed the pace between runners three
deep, dropped back two to three wide between runners on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
HEADEDTOTHESTARS set the pace racing just off the rail in the clear, was engaged by an outside foe up the backstretch, was overtaken narrowly midway
on the turn, dueled inside that rival retaking the lead by mid-stretch, held that rival and just lasted from a fast-closing other foe. HUNTER'S LEGACY was
coaxed forward after the start in pursuit of the leader, moved up outside that one to press from the half-mile marker, bid at the five-sixteenths taking a
narrow lead, dueled outside into upper stretch, lost the lead to the dueling partner at that juncture and was outkicked but kept on to just save the place. J
B'S LEGACY settled tracking inside just off the leaders, came out three deep in the stretch for room, surged too late and missed while finishing best of all.
CATALE STORM stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. RONALD DALE got away alertly, stalked from inside another rival going
three wide into the turn, moved out five wide at the top of the stretch, was not a late threat. CHARING CROSS lacked early speed racing near inside, came
out six wide for the drive, failed to menace. OUR CORNERSTONE was fractious in the gate, lacked early speed, swung six wide, made no bids.

Footnotes
CON SUERTE was very reluctant to load, raced unhurriedly at the rear dropping a ways back of the leaders, steadily advanced coming out a bit to pass a
rival on the far turn then back nearer the rail, rallied inside and edged clear. FREE SPIRITED engaged outside a rival dueling two wide, dispatched that rival
but was then joined by an outside foe dueling while just off the rail into and on the far turn, lugged out about the eighth pole, was overtaken but second best.
WITSEC was within range racing mostly three wide, lost some ground on the far turn, moved out five wide coming into upper stretch, kicked on to get up for
show honors. LISA G stalked from outside, engaged the leader three to four wide to force the issue coming to the half, could not keep up with that one into
upper stretch and was forced out near the furlong marker, lacked the needed late kick. RED RIVER WITCH stalked just off the leaders going three to five
wide throughout and failed to rally. MISS CANEY dueled briefly inside, dropped back and faded.

MUSTANGMAGNA dueled outside a rival two to three wide early, dispatched that rival then was engaged by an outside foe dueling inside that one briefly,
edged clear and held sway under steady handling. MY GOLDEN PRIZE settled off the pace, fanned six wide into upper stretch, ran on to get up for second.
MAREBELL stalked the leaders going four to five wide, was outfinished for place. PICAFLOR was encouraged forward from the start, dueled inside,
dropped back heading to the turn, kept on in the stretch. GOTOTHEWINDOW raced near the inside last but one into the turn, failed to menace. PREACH IT
GIRL pressed the leading pair from outside three to four wide, engaged the leader in a brief duel on the turn, came up empty for the drive. SURE WASN'T
ME broke a step slowly and was outpaced.

CADI DEVILLE dueled inside a rival early, edged clear leaving the backstretch racing in the two path on the far turn, held rivals at bay under moderate but
steady urging. TIFFANY TWIST stalked from outside mostly four to five wide, kept on in the stretch and won the battle for place. SMOKIN' OKIE angled in
early, saved ground through the first turn and the far turn advancing inside foes in upper stretch but coming off the fence, kept on but missed second.
BRODIE BABY was urged at the break, pressed the pace three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. EUTYCHIA settled off the pace two to three wide,
came out for the drive, failed to menace. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY raced at the rear three to four wide, failed to menace. JUST ROSIE dueled briefly two to
three wide outside the eventual winner, steadily weakened.

WINEMIXER pressed outside early, went three wide on the turn taking a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, was clear in upper stretch but outkicked.
GOSPEL EXPRESSION stalked from outside going five wide through the turn, drifted seven to eight wide into upper stretch, was best of the rest. O S U
BUDKE set a pressured pace, edged just clear racing in the two path, was overtaken past the five-sixteenths, steadily weakened. HANNAH FO FANNAH
pressed from inside, dropped back, came out for the stretch run, failed to rally. LITTLE RIVER JEWEL was off a bit slowly and awkwardly then steadied
slightly after the start, raced at the rear inside, went evenly and made no bid. KAVACHI tracked in behind the leaders, came out five wide for the stretch run,
had no rally.

BROTHER AARON settled at the rear, fanned five wide leaving the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch engaging the leader, took over by the furlong marker
and held that inside rival while being taken. HUNTER QUICK moved forward with mild encouragement to take the lead after the opening furlong, was clear
outside the three-eighths racing in the two path, overtaken in mid-stretch but kept on gamely to be second best. MAGIC CARPET stalked off the leaders
mid-pack racing four to six wide, ran along for show. SECRET BLARNEY pressed three wide, weakened. SPANISH HOMBRE broke a bit slowly, moved up
inside, failed to menace. EXCITING pressed outside four wide, weakened. TARUCA was not a factor racing off the inside.

ROWDY RIVER was pressured early then moved clear up the backstretch setting the pace inside, drew off in the stretch while being kept to the task and
held safe. BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY tucked in moving from three to two wide on the first turn to track in behind the leaders inside foes in the second flight but
just off the rail, gained the place inside of. KODALINE , who pressed the winner early racing two to three wide, dropped back into the far turn but kept on in
the stretch to secure show honors. FRIGERATOR was caught seven then six wide on the first turn, advanced outside foes up the backstretch to stalk,
moved nearer to just off the flank of the leader three wide midway on the far turn, could not sustain the effort. LEGIONARY moved in from six to five wide on
the first turn, moved in a bit further racing off the leaders up the backstretch and dropping back into the far turn, moved five wide nearing the quarter pole,
failed to rally but improved position. BRIGGSEY stalked three to four wide racing between rivals in the second flight up the backstretch, weakened.
CHEROKEE LEGACY raced four to five wide on the turns and faded in the stretch. MORHAWK broke awkwardly and slowly and was outpaced.

Footnotes
ROCKPORT KAT tucked in behind the leaders in the three to four path rating off those, was in just a bit tight on heels early up the backstretch, made a swift
move four wide between rivals past the five-sixteenths to bid coming to the quarter pole, was in command by the top of the stretch, drove clear and held
safe. JACKS SPRING BREAK tracked inside just off the leaders to the top of the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, kicked on well to share the place with
KWIK, who stalked in the two to three path early, moved out to advance four wide between runners early on the far turn, switched outside the leader in
upper stretch, ran on to share second. NEEDABETTERJOCK set the pace racing just off the rail facing early pressure from an outside rival, was overtaken
by the top of the stretch, kept on till mid-stretch then yielded. CHOCOLATEICECREAM got away slowly, shifted in racing in the two to three path toward the
rear early, came out for the drive and improved position. TOAH was caught five wide on the first turn forwardly-positioned, was within range six wide on the
far turn but had no late kick. WILLY SPECIAL CATS was a tad rank heading into the first turn, shifted in to race near the inside, failed to menace. WIN FOR
FUN was fractious in the gate, raced up close four to five wide, faded. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS pressed three wide, faltered and faded. WAVERUNNER failed
to threaten while racing several paths off the inside. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE.
FRACTION ADDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
GYPSY ROSE settled off the pace, saved ground mid-pack on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch striking the lead about seventy yards from home and
edged away. STORMY BISONETTE moved clear and shifted in, set the pace in the two path, faced pressure from outside foes into and on the turn, was
clear in upper stretch but outkicked while second best. CANDY'S A DANDY stalked from outside going four wide into the turn and in range of the leader,
loomed a threat but ran on evenly and lacked the needed late kick while keeping on well enough to capture show honors. SURE SHOT SHELLY moved
forward outside the leader to press that one three wide into the turn, contended between foes on the turn, was outkicked in the lane. SMART OKIE raced off
the pace near but just off the rail, ran evenly and made no bid while improving position. GOSPEL MOLLY pursued from outside mid-pack, was asked for
more while five wide coming to the quarter pole and within striking distance but evened out. MISSWISH was ridden along racing off the inside, failed to
menace. TOM'S GIRL moved off the rail, was never near enough to threaten. ALWAYS BE DANCIN was well back early, swung five wide into upper stretch
and was not a factor.
