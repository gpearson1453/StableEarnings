Footnotes
LOUISIANIMAL rushed to the front while well handled, stayed clear in the stretch run and stayed on to prevail at the wire under stout handling.
UNCAPTURED DREAM pressed winner to the turn, backed off into stretch and rerallied while coming on too late. SAMURAI ISLAND unhurried to the turn,
rallied into the stretch for show spot. PAST IMPERATIVE but tardy from the gate, raced along evenly with no late response when needed. EL MUZN never
far back to the turn but could not keep up and faded back in the late going. SOUTHPOINT never a factor throughout. MORNING MOTIVATION good
position just off leaders to the turn but gave way willingly.

Footnotes
FERRYBOAT speed to the front, well handled throughout, lasted to wire. ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED inside run to far turn, good position with a late surge
too late. JIMMY DAN saved ground throughout, rallied in the stretch for show spot. COMMAND CENTRAL raced a wide trip throughout while coming on too
late outside for the show spot. T J MUNNINGS pressed pace between horses to far turn, no gain in the stretch. BLACKSMITH STRONG close up with a
wide trip, weakened from the far turn and stretch. ENGLISH CLASSIC tracked leaders to far turn, could not go on and faded back. MISTER MAN no speed
to far turn, checked and steadied in the upper stretch. EYE BLACK tried to keep up to far turn, could not go on and faltered back. AVIANO awkward from the
gate, never menaced throughout. Z U AT THE RACES through early, dropped back readily. JUANITA'S EXPRESS failed to menace throughout.
