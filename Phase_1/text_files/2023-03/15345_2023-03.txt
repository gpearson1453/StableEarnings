Footnotes
SYNNIN AND WINNIN tracked the quick early fractions, lost ground while three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong
marker, made a late surge in deep stretch and tagged the runner-up in the final strides for the win. GOOD FOCUS chased the solid early pace, raced two
wide on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, assumed command nearing the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, was all
out to hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while just saving the place. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was
allowed to settle, gained ground while outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed with a rush in
deep stretch and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for the show. POLLO D'ORO was forwardly placed early on, raced close to the
solid pace heading to the turn then pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, chased GOOD FOCUS to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
CARSON'S LEGACY lacked speed in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker and did not factor. DAD BOD broke alertly and showed good
early speed, carved out solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and tired.

Footnotes
FEELING FLUSH was hustled to establish the early lead, set the pace while well handled to the far turn, came under a bit of pressure nearing the quarter
marker, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch and pulled away in the final sixteenth to prove best. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY broke out at the start and was off a
step slowly, was allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, made a three wide move to come within aim on the second turn, was no match for the
winner in the stretch run and stayed on well late to be best of the rest. ADAM'S CREED was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the second
turn and came four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed late response and passed tired rivals to secure the show.
CREATING MEMORIES chased the moderate fractions from the inside, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the stretch
and gave way. ON VACATION was unhurried in the early going, raced three wide into the far turn, swung widest into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.
MANY MARKETS stalked the moderate early pace, raced two wide between runners into the second turn, could not keep pace in the stretch run and tired.

LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF broke a bit awkwardly and was away a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the turn, circled five
wide into the stretch, made a sustained rally through the lane, confronted MR. MASON inside of the sixteenth-marker and outfinished that rival to prevail in
the final strides. MR. MASON was allowed to settle, gained ground while three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, continued to make
headway nearing mid-stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in deep stretch by LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF and bested the
rest. ROBIE broke alertly, took back off of the quick early fractions and remained on a hold heading into the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker,
advanced nearing mid-stretch, could not match strides with the top pair in the late stages and held safely in the end for the show. ALMANERA (IRE)
contested the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced close to the quick fractions while three wide on the turn, assumed command nearing the furlong
marker, Roman lost his crop inside of the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. OH GREAT (IRE) showed good early speed and set pressured
fractions to the turn, contested the pace while two wide between runners on the turn, lost position nearing mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
WINTER FALCON rushed up in the early stages, disputed the solid pace from an inside path along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the
drive.

CUT ACROSS SHORTY was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, advanced to pressure the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, battled for the lead with SMART KITTEN to mid-stretch, wore that foe down inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in
the final stages to prevail. LORD OF LIGHT was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position while two wide
into the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong pole, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was up
in the final strides for the place. MICKEY GOLDMILL was allowed to settle while never far back, maintained a two wide path to the second turn, raced three
wide into the stretch, made a mild late gain but was outfinished in deep stretch and was just edged for the place. SMART KITTEN was asked to show early
speed and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure heading to the far turn, held foes at bay to
the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages. LOKI OF ASGARD bumped with SNAKE ISLAND at the start, chased the moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker and weakened in the drive. CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked
the pace while outside of rivals into the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and tired. SNAKE ISLAND bumped with LOKI OF ASGARD at the
start and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed and did not factor.

EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, confronted LUCK IS GOLDEN
nearing the quarter marker, was floated out a path in upper stretch when that rival drifted out, re-rallied in mid-stretch, overtook LUCK IS GOLDEN nearing
the sixteenth-marker and drove clear in the final stages. LUCK IS GOLDEN was sent to establish the early lead, dueled with TIZONA along the first turn
then assumed command along the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the far turn, was confronted by EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER nearing the quarter
marker, drifted out a path in upper stretch and carried out EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER, was overtaken by that rival inside of the furlong marker and bested the
rest in the final sixteenth. DEALERS HAND broke through the gate prior to the race, was allowed to settle in the early stages, tracked the decent pace to the
far turn, was carried out a bit in upper stretch while advancing and raced four wide into the stretch run, could not impact the top pair in the late stages and
was clear in the end for third. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, improved position while two wide on the far turn, made a mild late
rally but was unable to threaten in the drive. TIZONA was prominent into the first turn, dueled with LUCK IS GOLDEN for early pace duties then took back to
stalk that foe through decent fractions to the far turn, could not keep pace in the stretch and faded in the late stages. SYNC was allowed to settle, saved
ground to the far turn and did not factor.

ALWAYS SEEKING was forwardly placed in the early going then took back off of the fast early pace, lost ground while in a bit tight on the turn, re-rallied in
upper stretch, made a two bid in mid-stretch and split foes inside of the furlong marker, responded to steady urging in deep stretch and showed a good late
kick to prevail. CAROLINA MIA broke alertly and was prominent in the early going, lost the early lead to TOM'S REGRET and pressed that rival through fast
fractions to the quarter marker, took a narrow lead nearing mid-stretch, could not match strides in deep stretch with ALWAYS SEEKING and held well in the
late stages to secure the place. TOM'S REGRET broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, rushed up to dispute the early pace, assumed command
and set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by CAROLINA MIA nearing the furlong pole, tired in the late stages and just held for the
show. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to chased the pace while outside of rivals into the turn, raced
four wide into the bend, came three wide into the stretch run, lost ground nearing the furlong marker, finished evenly in the late stages and just missed for
the show. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL chased the fast early pace from the inside, mounted a rail rally in mid-stretch but could not sustain that run in deep stretch
and weakened. LUXURY LINER chased the fast early pace, came in tight entering the turn and was shuffled back mid-way through the bend, raced four
wide into the stretch run and offered mild late gain but was unable to threaten in deep stretch.

Footnotes
WELLSWORT (IRE) took up slightly on the run into the first turn, was allowed to settle while racing in the second flight, maintained position while saving
ground to the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive, loomed nearing mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker, kept to task in deep
stretch, was fully extended in the late stages and held in a drive to prevail. WALKING BOSS lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to
settle in the early running, saved ground into the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch run, gained ground approaching the furlong marker, rallied in
deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was up in the final strides to secure the place. MORE POWER TO HIM was unhurried in the
early stages, raced two wide into the second turn, loomed in upper stretch, angled out inside of the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch and just
missed for the place, while getting up in time to secure the show. SUNNY SPOT chased the moderate early pace, saved ground to the second turn, was
angled three wide nearing the top of the lane, vied for the lead in upper stretch and took a narrow lead to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace in deep
stretch and just missed for the minor awards. SPEED GRAZY settled in the second flight early on, was well placed through the backstretch run, raced two
wide along the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, gained ground nearing mid-stretch but could not sustain that run and finished evenly in the
final furlong. MY SUNSHINE was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate early pace then advanced to contest the pace to the quarter pole,
vied for the lead to mid-stretch and tired in the late stages. AGENT ZERO was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate fractions through
the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, lugged out midway through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and did not have a late impact.
THEYREMINISCEOVERU showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early stages, was confronted by MY SUNSHINE along the backstretch run
and dueled with that rival through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
TALBOT BAY bumped with ELEVADO at the start then ducked in while leaving the chute and was away a bit slowly, tracked the quick early pace from the
second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled four wide for the stretch run, made a mild bid into mid-stretch, responded to steady urging and
closed well in deep stretch, caught LUCKY LAD inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. LUCKY LAD was hustled to
establish the early lead, showed good speed heading to the turn and opened a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead into mid-stretch, felt
pressure from TALBOT BAY nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold that one off in the final stages and bested the rest. BLAZING JAMIE was
unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the turn, swung widest and came five wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, was
not able to impact the top two in deep stretch and was clear for third in the end. WICKLOW HILLS stalked the fast early pace into the turn, ran in pursuit of
LUCKY LAD to the quarter marker, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. COUNT ASHER chased the fast early
pace, raced three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was outrun nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. TOLONISITO
came under an early hold, raced in traffic into the turn, was shuffled back leaving the three-quarters marker, raced three wide into the stretch and lacked a
late response. DANCE COMPANY hesitated at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not
threaten. ELEVADO bumped with TALBOT BAY at the start but was away in good order, chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost position nearing the
quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
RACHEL'S COACH broke alertly and quickly took command of the early pace, rated nicely thorough reasonable fractions, responded when asked at the
three sixteenths pole, easily held off a challenge from CAPTIVATING BOY despite racing on the wrong lead to the furlong pole, straightened out for the final
run and won clear. CAPTIVATING BOY came away from the gate in good order and chased the pacesetting RACHEL'S COACH to the turn, got to the flank
of that rival at the top of the stretch, was unable to respond when that rival quickened away but finished up well in a good effort. IRISH ROYALTY close up
early while saving ground down the backstretch, swung three wide into the stretch in a bid for the lead, got close but was unable to make up any ground on
the top two yet ran on well under heavy pressure to hold third. COUSIN RICHIE was hard to place from the break, changed paths several times down the
backstretch, settled to the outside then shifted in to the three path going into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, took the path of MOMO'S KIDDO at
the three-sixteenths pole then ran evenly in the late stages while running on the left lead. TOP OF MY GAME devoid of early speed, was given a reminder
to keep up a furlong in, came under a ride from the seven-sixteenths pole and finished one-paced to the wire. MOMO'S KIDDO got off to a good start and
raced in mid-pack down the backstretch, made a mid-race move on the turn to get within striking distance of the leaders near the quarter pole, had to steady
off the heels of the erratic COUSIN RICHIE in the stretch and was unable regain any momentum. APLOMBADO stumbled slightly out of the gate and
spotted the field a head start, moved over to the rail for the run to the turn, came under a ride from the three eighths pole but was unable to make an impact
while passing one late. BIG STICK away well then raced well off the pace through the early going, saved ground through the turn while making a mild move
then did not have anything to offer in the stretch and faded.
