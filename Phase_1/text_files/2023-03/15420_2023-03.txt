Footnotes
IKO IKO raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the second turn and
drew off in the stretch, geared down at the wire. RED TIARA led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two
path around the far turn and kept on in the stretch while proving to be no match for the winner. KEENE ON JENNY saved ground around the first turn,
tracked the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked in the lane. MOON CAVE was blocked leaving the gate,
trailed the field on the rail through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second turn and made no bid. SWEET MELADY veered in
and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn and was empty from there. BAILOUT KELA raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack, navigated the far bend from the two and three path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SIR AGGRAVATOR dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and dug in the lane, battling to the wire
to just hold the win. ALMASHRIQ was pinched back leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the
three path coming around the bend and dueled to the finish to just miss. CREATIVE CLOUD had his head turned at the start and broke slowly, trailed the
field through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in the lane. CATCHING FISH veered in and
bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, dueled from the rail up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and faded
in the stretch. CAMPTOWN RACES brushed with the horse to his outside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the three path, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE was bumped by the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. THE RIDER OF HORSE TWO, RATTLESNAKE RIDGE,
FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE ONE, CATCHING FISH, CITING INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES
WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
IT'S FATE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch on the outside, began a bid from the two path coming around
the second bend and drew off in the stretch. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, began a bid in upper stretch and improved position in the lane. CHUCKY saved ground early,
tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, floated out to the five path coming around the second bend and gained ground in the final furlong.
LAUDERDALE raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the far
turn and weakened in the lane. EXAMINER raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far
bend from the two path and never threatened. TIZ TRIUMPHANT dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, gave way while racing in
the four path around the second turn and tired further in the stretch. ZONIC trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and
was never a factor.

held that margin to the wire. SILVER GLEN raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid coming around the turn,
entered the stretch from the five path and gained ground late. DIA DE SOL chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the two path and kept on in the lane. ARETE'S CHALICE trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the four path and improved
position in the stretch. TRULY A DREAM raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the two path and showed no kick. BARBARA led the field on the
