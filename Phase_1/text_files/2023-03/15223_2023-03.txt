Footnotes
FACTOTUM was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best under left handed
crop urging. INSTANT CHAOS was allowed to settle and was four wide on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the turn to move into contention, but
could not gain on the winner late, second best. INNUENDO was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn but lacked the needed stretch
winning bid. MR BOLDACIOUS was off a step slow, moved up to stalk the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. LONG TOM
was reserved early, four wide on the turn and had no rally. JUMP FREE tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. BOSSY CAT stalked the pace three
wide, two wide on the turn and tired. JACK GAVE BACK was settled back early, then was eased after the half mile marker, walked off.

SLINGSHOT BOY was rated along the inside early, eased out on the turn and came three wide into the lane and made a bid and drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best, driving. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was bumped at the start, reserved on the inside, angled out by the furlong marker and finished
willingly for the place award. DON'T QUESTION ME was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show but needed more.
TAKING WHAT'S MINE prompted the early pace, made a bid on the turn to duel for command but weakened the final furlong. DR GREENTHUMB set the
pace on the inside, then dueled for command by the quarter pole and weakened.
