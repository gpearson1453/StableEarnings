Footnotes
MYSTERY MO broke with the field, raced in the second flight outside, four wide through the turn, advanced and challenged into the stretch, wore down
leader, drw. SQUARE DEAL with the pace while racing three wide, dueled late in the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, second duel when the
winner came alongside soon after, could not match that foe late, remained clear of the others. BLACK STORM in the second group three wide and inside
the winner, failed to advance with that one out of the turn, dropped in a bit to the two path entering the stretch, mild rally to be along for the show, no threat
to the top two. GINSBURNED vied up front while between horses, dueled late in the turn inside the runner up, began to weaken when entering the stretch,
continued to fade. TIZHOTNDUSTY with the early pace along the inside, held a narrow advantage into the turn, began to give way soon after.

Footnotes
KITIARA off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight toward the inside, dropped all the way to the rail turning for home, rail bid a furlong out,
proved best in a determined effort. ICONIC BONNET forwardly placed outside, three wide bid entering the stretch, vied, lost whip approaching the furlong
marker, outkicked in the late going. LORI'S EYES broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued hold the advantage through the turn
and into upper stretch, allowed the winner the inside approaching the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly between the top two at the wire. TIZ A
STRATEGY in the second group while racing outside, four wide into the stretch to lose ground to the top three, roused for the drive, slowly closing the gap
while widest of the first flight at the wire. BROOKE'S ALL IN pressed the issue in the two path and between foes for a half, weakened through the stretch.
MAY DISCO in the second bunch while four wide through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. RELENTLESS ROCKET off a step slow, remained
always back while racing five wide through the bend. KOOTENAI FALLS off slowly, trailed well back throughout.

Footnotes
TOO PRETTY broke alertly, cleared in the two path first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, dropped to the inside, midway through the second turn, not
threatened through the lane while being kept to task with a steady right handed crop. HISSY MISSY within striking distance just off the inside, moved a
closer to chase the winner through the second turn, could do little with that one through the lane, held sway for the place, vanned off after crossing the wire.
COURTNEY FAY back off the pace three wide, made a mild advance into the lane, finished up best of the rest. MY DAMS ATITUDE off a step slow, raced
back off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, steered three wide into the stretch, improved slightly while not a serious threat. HOT
SPRINGS BLING forwardly placed along the inside, pulled onto the backstretch, continued within striking distance far turn, came up empty for the stretch
run. C. C. HARBOR hesitated at the break, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. NAVAGATIONALBEACON in the second flight early, stopped far
turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
KING OTTOMAN off the early pace, in some traffic in waiting briefly onto the backstretch, moved out to be four wide when beginning to advance second
turn, three wide bid turning for home, drove well clear. CAWKAB in mid pack and racing outside, moved closer second turn, challenged between foes and
inside the winner turning into the stretch, proved no match for that one to the wire, edged clear for the plac.e. TEN GAUGE settled off the pace along the
inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, brief wait along the rail late in the turn, moved out, rallied for the show, slowly getting to the runner up late.
BUCKTOWN last away, shuffled back when attempting to move off the inside midway on the first turn, continued back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. ROCKING ROCKET chased the early leader, took over after a quarter, drew out to a long lead, faltered when headed
turning for home. C. J'S STORM early pace, relinquished the advantage after a quarter, chased the middle half, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
NAMESAKE broke back, outrun for a half, advanced on the lead pack three wide second turn, bid, showed the way into the lane briefly headed, battled back
to prove best. MYSTIFIER void of early foot, advanced behind the winner second turn, came four wide and outside that one into the stretch, briefly put a
head in front nearing the furlong marker, late duel, outkicked in the late going, far clear of the others. QUALITY RUN broke a step slow, raced back,
continued well back the middle half, made a mild, belated rally to finish best of the rest, no threat to the top two. KOSELIO vied up front while between rivals
through a rather lively opening set of fractions, faltered in the second turn. DEPART settled behind the lead pack just off the inside, came three wide when
overtaking tiring rivals into the lane, failed to produce a late rally. SKYLINE set or forced the pace four three furlongs in the three path for the most part,
backed up. PITTSBURGH contested the pace closest to the inside, stopped into the far turn, finished well back.

PAPA ROCKET outrun in the early going while in the two path up the backstretch, angled out four wide when moving to challenge turning for home, outside
bid when straightened for home, edged clear late under steady handling. SHIP IT RED dueled up front in the two path in the run up the backstretch and into
the turn, vied into the lane while between horses, dueled past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, remained clear for the second
spot. JERRY'S EIGHTY behind the pace off the inside, two path into the lane in traffic, split foes into the stretch, two path to the wire, mild rally to earn the
show, no real threat to the top two. CITY RAGE behind the pace outside, four wide through most of the turn when moving closer, three wide into the lane,
dropped inside, outkicked for the show while finishing up along the inside. COLONEL KLINK back off the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, traffic
late in the bend, moved out for the drive, lacked a significant closing response. BEST OF GREELEY away in good order, set pace off the rail up the
backstretch and into the turn, dropped down to the rail late in the bend and gave way soon after. MEET JOE four wide trip into and through the turn, was
finished before a half.

Footnotes
EXPONENTIAL STAR a bit slow to settle into the first turn when closest to the leader, continued to chase that one up the backstretch, advanced and took
over turning for home, clear to the wire under steady handling. UNSTABLE PRINCESS void of early foot, continued well back far turn, asked soon after,
roused into the lane when four wide finished willingly to be clear for the place, slowly closing the gap on the winner at the wire. MAGIC BUBBLES settled off
the pace, advanced four wide midway on the second turn, flattened out in the final furlong, clear of the others. NO GUILT away in good order, settled off the
pace, three wide when moving closer in the second turn, closest to the winner past the furlong, flattened out in the late run to the wire to lose a couple of
positions. MAGICAL SONG saved ground behind the pace, continued along the inside into the far turn, two path into the lane, continued one paced through
the stretch. D'ORO STREET broke on top, sprinted well clear, set a modest pace toward the inside, tight restraint, little left when confronted late in the final
turn. A LITTLE GOOD NEWS lacked speed, raced three wide, failed to muster a rally. DOGTOWN DIVA fell back to trail after the start, remained always
back to be outrun.

Footnotes
TRAVERSE allowed the pace to go early, in the second flight three wide when moving closer into the far turn, took over turning for home, quickly clear,
strongly to win ridden out. BUTTERBEAN void of any speed for five furlongs, began to move three wide second turn, continued a willingly rally through the
short stretch run to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. LIL KINGS PRINCESS forwardly placed inside, advanced and challenged along the rail
into the far turn, was thwarted and fell back, moved out three wide into the stretch, closest to the winner late, caught in the final strides for the place.
SPEEDOMETER broke on top, showed the way into the first turn off the inside, pulled against firm restraint and appeared unsettled in the run up the
backstretch, turned back a bid from LIL KINGS PRINCESS far turn while allowing that one the inside, briefly responded when challenged by the winner soon
after, proved no match for that one entering the stretch, faltered late. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE off a step slow, raced in the two path well off the pace, continued
in that position through the second turn, lacked a closing kick. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME raced back off the pace in the three path, had little for the drive to trail
in.

Footnotes
SKELLY with the pace from the start, between horses into the turn, disposed of the other speed turning for home, kicked well clear through the lane under
steady handling. DOCTOR OSCAR broke alertly, with the pace inside the winner, proved no match for that one through the lane, remained clear for the
second spot. ALBIZU lacked early foot off the inside, worked way to the rail through the turn, rallied up the inside to narrowly gain the show. MRS. BEANS in
the second flight toward the inside, in traffic down toward the inside late in the turn, clear for the drive, set down, outkicked for the show late. LIFE IS HARD
in mid pack while off the inside, three wide through the turn, improved position a bit, also did not have enough for the show late. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY
bobbled slightly at the break to be back early, moved up to mid pack, three to four wide late in the turn, went evenly through the lane. RAM fell back to trail
after the start, three wide into the lane when improving, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. RUGGS in the second flight while racing off the inside, four
wide into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. VULCAN prompted the pace while three wide for a half, gave way in the drive. EXXEL bobbled to be off
slowly, saved ground and remained always back. GHOSTLORE was never a factor. WHELEN SPRINGS in mid pack well off the inside, four to five wide
turn, backed up.
