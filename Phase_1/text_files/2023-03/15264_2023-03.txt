Footnotes
EMPIRE ATTRACTION rated in the three path, tipped out to the five path and loomed up around the far turn, bid while floating out to the nine path into the
lane, swept past inner foes in upper stretch, and drew clear while drifting in through the final furlong. PLAYERO tracked in the three path, was coaxed to
range up into the far turn, bid from the five path into the stretch, was outrun by the outer eventual winner but ran on to secure place. EMBER was in the two
path around the first turn and unhurried from the three path into the backstretch, was roused into the far turn and tipped outwards to be in the seven path at
the top of the stretch, and kept on while shifting inwards through the stretch for show. MO VANISHING raced wellback along the inside of rivals, angled out
to the eight path turning into the stretch, passed tired rivals, but was no factor. DUNKLE stalked along the inside around the first turn and was in the two
path down the backstretch, was driven along the inside around the far turn and tipped out to the two path into the lane, but flattened. SHA TIN raced off the
pace along the inside and never threatened. TACTICAL FORCE trailed in the two path early, was urged in the four path at the top of the stretch, but was no
factor. CONSTITUTIONALSONG was rank in the four path around the first turn and up close in the three path into the backstretch, tipped out to the seven
path into the stretch, and faded. JOE IRISH set the pace inside but yielded at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
HEXAGON dueled two wide throughout and inched ahead late. CATATUMBO LIGHTNIN stalked the pace from the rail, got through in upper stretch, took a
narrow lead not long after, dueled inside of the winner and was outfinished. NATURAL VIBES was up close two wide, dropped back under a drive entering
the turn, picked up the bit again nearing the quarter pole, angled four wide near that marker, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. GREAT
KOSTAS broke a bit awkwardly, stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. FASTFORFUN chased the pace three wide,
floated five wide near the quarter pole and had no response. ZACH AND JILL hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact. ADIOS YOUR
HONOR dueled inside of the winner for five furlongs, drifted two wide near the quarter pole and came up empty. GREEN GOBLIN played no factor while
racing two wide.

Footnotes
BULLET ON TAP stalked along the inside, tipped out and ranged up in the three path around the turn, bid while still in hand passing the quarter pole and
took the lead while floating out to the five path into the stretch, was cued and drew clear under steady urging through the final furlong. SHE'S OUTTA HERE
dueled for the lead in the three path into the turn, took command in the two path passing the three eighths pole, was challenged by the outer eventual
winner nearing the quarter pole and urged left handed from the three path into the stretch, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, and chased home the
winner for place. RANSOMS REWARD was prompted along in the five path into the turn, was under a drive in the four path around the turn, tipped out to
the seven path in upper stretch, and finished evenly under left handed urging for show. SHES A GIFT rated in the three path, shifted to the rail and was
ridden around the turn, was urged from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. PEARLINTHEROUGH chased in the four path, received a right handed
cue in the five path passing the three eighths pole, but was no factor from the seven path in the stretch. ROUGH ENOUGH dueled for the lead in the two
path, was roused along the inside around the turn, but yielded from the four path in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY SWEET AFFAIR stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and burst clear. OOLONG HAI (IRE) set the pace inside,
drifted out in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held the place. CHLOE'S TOY chased the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane, lacked
the needed rally but stayed on for the show. MS. CLEMENTE steadied early, raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. STOLEN
FUTURE saved ground and failed to menace. FACTOR THAT pressed the pace two wide and weakened through the lane. MENDED WE STAND bumped
with TINKATWO not long after the start, raced four wide and lacked a rally. STARSHIP AGENDA was outrun inside. GEORGE'S VICE chased the pace two
wide and faded in the lane. TINKATWO was bumped early, raced three wide in midpack and had no response. GOLDEN HAVEN hesitated at the start,
trailed while racing in the three path, swung out in upper stretch but lugged in through the lane.

Footnotes
YOUR INHERITANCE tracked in the five path, was roused around the turn and ranged up to bid from the seven path into the stretch, took the lead passing
the eighth pole, and drew clear under left handed urging. ELUSIVE MOLLY raced off the pace in the four path, was roused while shifting in to the two path
around the turn, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, and ran on under left handed encouragement to nail the outer pacesetter for place on the wire.
SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace in the three path, was cued just past the three eighths pole and urged left handed when challenged by a pair of outer foes
while floating out to the five path into the lane, was passed by the outer eventual winner nearing the eighth pole, and evened out late to be caught by an
inner foe to finish with show. PERFECT PROVISION prompted the pace in the four path, was roused to bid while being floated out to the six path entering
the stretch, but was one paced. HEIRESSINDY chased along the inside but flattened from the four path in the stretch. FORBIDDEN DREAM raced wellback
along the inside early and was never a menace.

Footnotes
BRAVO KITTEN pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. PEACE SEEKER steadied midway around the first
turn, angled out soon after, raced well back two wide, went three wide around the far turn, shifted furthest out in upper stretch and rallied for the place.
SIEMPRE ELEGANTE bumped with TRUANCY at the start, raced well back two wide for nine furlongs then finished well between foes to gain the show
late. TRUANCY bumped at the start, was firmly rated three wide around the first turn, went two wide in midpack around the next two turns and lacked the
needed rally. WATCH IT set the pace along the inside, was collared near the quarter pole, drifted in the stretch and tired. LAVISH HABITS was outrun
inside. ELLE EST FORTE tracked the pace in the clear inside and came up empty in the lane. BREAKER OF CHAINS saved ground and failed to menace.
AMBITIEUSE saved ground in range and had no response.

Footnotes
VALIANT MISS broke out and bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, tipped out to the three path into the turn and was challenged
by an outer foe passing the three eighths pole, repelled that foe and floated out to the five path into the lane, opened up into the final furlong, and held sway.
SHOW ME LOVE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, rated along the inside, tipped out to the five path and was coaxed around the turn, was in the
seven path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. BROADWAY CHARM got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three
path and was cued into the turn, shifted to the rail turning into the stretch, and kept on under steady urging for show. SONGTELLER tracked in the three
path, tipped into the rail and was nudged along the turn, was driven from the four path into the stretch, and was one paced. SONG AND TAP raced wellback
in the three path, was in the four path around the turn and urged from the five path into the stretch, but never threatened. QUICKSTYLE chased along the
inside, was cued from the two path into the turn, but was no factor from the three path in the stretch. BLAZINGLY hit the side of the gate, prompted the pace
in the four path, was roused to bid passing the three eighths pole, but was repelled while being floated out to the six path into the lane, and faded. LADY
BOURBON raced off the pace in the four path early but was no menace.

Footnotes
NERVES OF STEEL saved ground in range, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, kicked in between foes and drew clear.
TIZ ROMANTIC stalked the pace two wide, pressed two wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch, was unable to repel the winner but stayed on
for the place. DOCTOR RON settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch but was
one-paced through the lane. RUNAWAY HARRY set the pace along the rail and weakened through the final furlong. QUIET OUT EAST raced off the pace
two wide, circled four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL saved ground in range, chased two wide
around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND was outrun inside. ARTEMUS BRIDGE played no factor while racing two and three
wide. GOOCH GO BRAGH made little impact while racing two wide. REGAL SPEAKER was off slowly, raced four wide in midpack and had little left for the
drive.

WINNING FACTOR brushed with an outer foe early, was unhurried inside of rivals, roused from the two path into the far turn and moved up between while
angling out to the nine path into the lane, rallied down the center and was up in the final sixteenth for the win. DAZZLING TRUTHS raced up close in the five
path, was under a ride while tipping into the three path around the far turn, took aim at the leader while tipping out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on
but was outrun by an outer foe to finish with place. PERFECT CUT raced prominently in the four path, was prompted to bid and took the lead while shifting
to the two path around the far turn, was under a drive while floating out to the four path into the stretch, and kept on but was caught by a pair of outer foes in
the final furlong to show. VELOCE tracked between rivals in the three path, was under coaxing in the two path into the far turn, angled out to the seven path
into the stretch, and stayed on. SUMMER SHANDEE was reserved in the two path early, under a ride between foes while shifting outward and was in the
eight path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. BURNING MAN trailed around the first turn and was steadied in the four path into the backstretch, was
steadied again while in the three path midway around the far turn and shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and mildly improved. KING THEO
stalked along the inside, was under urging from the rail around the far turn and tipped out to the five path into the stretch, but flattened.
PLEASECALLMEBACK raced wellback along the inside, tipped out to the six path while under a drive into the stretch, and was no factor. HROTHGAR set
the pace in the two path, was ridden along the rail while losing the lead around the far turn, and yielded from the three path in the final furlong. HEAT OF
THE NIGHT brushed between foes early, raced in range under a hold from the four path, was hustled around the far turn and angled out to the six path but
was pinched at the top of the stretch, and never threatened. REBELDE brushed with an inner foe into the first turn, rated in the six path but never menaced
from the nine path in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOWE STREET settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, swept to the front in upper stretch and drew off under a
drive. PATOU ROAD raced in range two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner but kept on well to be clearly second best.
MEYER raced off the pace four wide and ran on to gain the show. DRIPPING GOLD failed to menace while racing three wide. SO HIGH (GB) stalked the
pace inside early, remained up close three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole and
tired in the lane. PARATUS played no factor while racing two wide. HASHTAG NO WONDER was outrun inside. EXPERIENCED chased the pace two wide
and came up empty in the lane. GRAND JOURNEY pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared and angled in approaching the clubhouse turn,
led inside to the five-sixteenths marker and retreated. SWING LOW hit the starting gate, saved ground and never threatened. TRENDING led inside early,
chased inside down the backstretch and faltered around the far turn. WHAT SAY THEE saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
QUEEN PICASSO (GB) raced prominently up close while under a hold around the three path down the backstretch, bid from the two path around the far
turn and was floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, sustained that bid through the lane and edged past the inner pacesetter late under steady
encouragement to get the win. SOVIET EXCESS set the pace inside, was roused when challenged by an outer foe rounding the far turn and tipped out to
the three path into the stretch, dug in under steady urging through the stretch, but was edged out late to finish with place. HIGHLAND GRACE stalked in the
three path, was ridden around the far turn and shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for show. UTILIZATION RATE (FR) settled in midfield
around the three path, was coaxed from the four path around the far turn and tipped out to the seven path entering the lane, and mildly improved. SUN BEE
tracked inside, was roused into the far turn and was in the two path at the top of the stretch, tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and evened
out. PRET A TOUCHER got bumped between foes leaving the gate, was held up in midpack from the two path, was driven along the inside around the far
turn and urged left handed from the three path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. STRAND OF GOLD raced off the pace in the two path, was
ridden along the rail around the far turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch, but failed to bid. LADY BEE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed
in the two path into the far turn and was no factor down the center in the stretch. GRANDINE was unhurried in the four path early but failed to threaten.
KING'S SECRET (GB) veered outward and bumped an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was cued in the two path around the far turn, but did no
respond. WRITTENINTHESTARS raced from wellback around the five path but never menaced.
