Footnotes
SPIRIT OF POWER tracked in the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, was cued to range up in the three path
around the far turn, floated out to the eight path while taking aim entering the lane, swept past a pair of inner foes into the final furlong, and held off a late
charging outer foe to win. GIRLY THE BUTCHER traveled along the inside of rivals around the first turn and was unhurried from the two path entering the
backstretch, was under coaxing around the far turn and tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, angled further out under left handed urging into
the final furlong, and ran on for place. RAMADHAAN (IRE) prompted the pace in the two path around the first turn and from the three path into the
backstretch, was roused to bid from the two path into the far turn and was under a drive from the four path entering the lane, kept on and took a brief lead
passing the eighth pole, but was quickly caught by the outer eventual winner, and by another outer foe late to finish with show. HOT BOTTOM GIRL set the
pace along the inside, was coaxed around the far turn and in the two path at the top of the stretch, but yielded entering the final furlong. RIA FORMOSA was
in the two path around the first turn and rated in the four path down the backside, was urged from the six path turning into the stretch, but was no factor.
STARSHIP BABE stalked in the two path down the backstretch, was ridden around the far turn, but faded entering the lane. POMONA'S BULLET trailed in
the five path down the backstretch, was driven in the four path around the far turn, but was no menace.

safe. SOUPER LEGACY bobbled at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, was headed near the five-sixteenths marker and fought on inside
to save the place. CUPID'S DUDE was up close inside, tipped out near the quarter pole and finished evenly for the show. T VILLE tracked the pace three
wide around the first turn, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch and weakened. EL SEGUNDO chased

Footnotes
SCRAMBLE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide down the backstretch, continued to gain three wide around the far
turn, seized command in upper stretch, quickly cleared and held clear under a drive. OPERATION TORCH rated off the pace inside while a bit keen around
the first turn, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole and finished well to be clearly second best.
GANADO raced two wide in midpack early, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled four wide nearing the head of the lane, was lugging in through
the stretch and ran on for the show. ONE FAST DREAM stalked the pace in the two path, took the lead early on the far turn, led to upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. EQUAL PROTECTION saved ground in range, advanced two wide around the far turn, angled back in leaving the quarter pole,
steadied and angled out near the eighth pole and lacked a rally. COVET was bumped after the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened.
MUTAAWID raced off the pace two and three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. JEBY was outrun inside. GHOST COAST set the
pace along the rail and was through after a half. EXUDE came out and bumped a foe after the start, saved ground off the pace and played no further factor.
CARLIN CLAN disputed the pace in the three path around the first turn, cleared and angled in down the backstretch and gave way near the three-eighths
marker. EXPECT MORE hesitated at the start, was never involved and was eased in the lane.

DIGNIFIED prompted the pace in the six path before shifting inwards to the four path into the turn, was roused midway around the turn and took aim from
the five path into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole and took the lead under right handed urging inside the final furlong, and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. DOMINEERING raced off the pace in the two path, was driven along the inside turning into the stretch, tipped out passing the eighth pole, and ran
on for place. GHOSTLY NIGHT set the pace in the three path and tipped in the two path into the turn, was under right handed urging entering the lane, got
caught by winner just past the eighth pole, and yielded in the final sixteenth to show. RAIN chased from the four path into the turn, tipped out and was in the
six path turning into the stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. AWESOME APEAL stalked in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn
and floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and was one paced. KENTUCKY PRIDE trailed in the six path early, shifted in to the three path around the
turn, but never threatened from the six path in the stretch. MABEE LUCKYNWILD pressed in the five path into the turn, but gaveway in the two path turning
into the lane.

FELINE was bumped near the half-mile pole, raced off the pace three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. CINDYLOUWHO
raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. SHE'S STORMY pressed the pace in the three path, was in tight when the pacesetter drifted out
turning for home and faded. QUEEN OF LIGHT set the pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home and tired. GAMBLE'S ORB chased the pace two
wide and lacked the needed rally. PLAISANTE (FR) bumped a foe near the half-mile pole, saved ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch and was not
urged while lacking a perfectly clear path. MRS WHISTLER broke outwardly and bumped the winner at the start then trailed outside.

switched back to the left lead in deep stretch, continued on gamely and was up on the wire. ANY PORT saved ground off the pace, angled out leaving the
sixteenth pole, bid between foes, took the lead in deep stretch and was nailed. MIA CAMILA raced in range inside, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between
foes, shied out when ANY PORT angled out near the sixteenth pole, bumped TAMARINDO into the winner, fought on between and just missed.
TAMARINDO settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes then was bumped between foes in deep stretch.
JUDGE JUDITH set the pace along the rail around the first turn and in the two path around the far turn, led until deep stretch and was swallowed up late.
MY SUNNY VALENTINE had her head turned and lunged at the start, raced well back two and three wide and rallied belatedly. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN
pressed the pace two and three wide and faded through the stretch. PRETTYKEEN chased the pace three and four wide, was bumped in upper stretch and
faded. YES I'M SPITEFUL was outrun while racing two and three wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND

Footnotes
SINFILTRE traveled in the two path around the first turn and was prominent in the four into the backstretch, was roused to bid in the three path into the far
turn, took command passing the quarter pole and was cued from the four path into the lane, drew clear through the lane, and was wrapped up late. RED
HOT AND BLUE bumped with an inner foe at the start, was unhurried along the inside turning into the backstretch, was under coaxing approaching the far
turn, tipped out around the far turn and was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for place. FRIENDSHIP ROAD bumped with an outer foe
at the start, raced along the inside around the first turn and stalked from the two path down the backstretch, was under a drive along the rail around the far
turn and into the lane, and stayed on for show. ARROBLUE got bumped by an inner foe leaving the gate, trailed in the two path around the first turn and
was in the four path down the backstretch, was cued from the five path around the far turn and was floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished
evenly while passing tired rivals. BALLROOM EYES broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, was in the three path around the first turn and rated in
the five path down the backstretch, was urged right handed around the far turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane, but was no factor. NEVER
BEEN WRONG settled up close in the three path around the first turn and was in the five path down the backstretch, was prompted from the three path into
the far turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. MYSTICAL JOURNEY set the pace inside around the first turn and was in the three path under
rousing down the backstretch, lost the whip along the inside midway around the far turn, and yielded in the three path in the stretch. CAPPY raced between
foes in the two path around the first turn and tracked in the four path down the backstretch, was asked between foes into the far turn but did not respond,
was eased home, and walked off.
