Footnotes
RANDOMIZED displayed good speed, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, responded well when shaken up into upper stretch, drew off
under a solid-hand ride until outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. GIFTED was coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace on the
outside then in the two path around the turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the crop and proved no match for
the winner while well clear for the place. AVANT brushed with a foe leaving the chute, settled off the pace, was urged three wide around the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths and came up empty while best of the rest. DOLCE SERA was sent hard from the start then urged
along on the inside, saved ground around the turn and had nothing left. ACCEL ROSE broke in at the start, brushed with an opponent leaving the chute,
settled off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path and capitulated. KATIE'S CHECKRIDE was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
AERON WARRIOR broke out at the start forcing STRANGE FRUIT to be taken in hand, raced just off the inside in aim of the front before advancing to vie
between foes for command, emerged with sole command midway on the turn and steadily shook away, swung three wide for home, went clear under a drive
kept to task. BABI DREAMS three wide in range of the front, advanced to vie outside a pair into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to safely secure the place honors in a good first effort. STRANGE
FRUIT broke a half a beat slow and was forced to be taken in hand off the heels of AERON WARRIOR as that rival broke outwards, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. MY INNER VOICE chased just off the
inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. NORTHERN BALLET broke in at the start under
coaxing, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing half a mile out, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and tired. SUPER PRINCESS coaxed from the gate, crossed to show the way in hand along the inside before vying inside a pair, got shaken off
midway on the turn while coaxed along, faded, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CURBSTONE was caught in the five path around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the nine-sixteenths, was given his cue in the
three to four path around the far turn, took the lead near the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong, extended the advantage under urging into
the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. COMPLETE AGENDA went around the first turn in the three path, was urged along at the
rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path under strong urging, angled out in upper stretch and finished with late energy to garner the place. EXIT
RIGHT was hustled from the gate, set a joint pace on the inside, dropped back under urging with three furlongs to run, kept on in pursuit of the winner and
just missed the place while able to get the show. MONTAUK POINT broke very fast and went straight to the front, moved out early, rounded the first turn in
the four path, set a joint pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened. MAGIA NERA was last away then hustled before taken under some restraint, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well
placed down the backstretch, came under strong encouragement around the half-mile pole, went two then three wide on the final turn and failed to respond.

dug in under a drive rallying to get up in the last jumps to the finish. OK HONEY coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide advancing on the front
with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch taking over command, dug in under threat from a flanking pair and was caught in the final
strides to the wire. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from INDIAN BELLA to the outside, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to preserve the show honors
clear of the rest. KEEN DANCER chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GAGLIANO chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. INDIAN BELLA prompted the pace from the outside four then three wide, came

Footnotes
SWIFTY DEVIL showed speed from the inside post, was taken in hand when LITTLE LUCA angled down near him around the five-eighths then was rated
just off the pace, tugged at the bit under snug restraint, drafted inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, rallied inside in upper stretch, closed
well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. CAMM' DUKE settled off the pace, moved up near the nine-sixteenths
then made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, fought while remaining on his
inside until near the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while clear for the place. PAROS bumped lightly with a foe after the break, settled on the outside,
moved up near the nine-sixteenths, engaged the leaders in the four path on the turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, led while remaining on his inside
lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead after losing the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show.
PLAYINGWITHMATCHES was coaxed along off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, dropped back four wide around the turn and lacked the
needed response. LITTLE LUCA brushed the inside of the gate at the start, angled in quickly while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
was asked in the two path while under threat on the turn, lost the advantage near the three-sixteenths and gave way. BAD WATER broke in then bumped
with a foe, was coaxed along inside of rivals, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, moved to the five
path later on that bend and came up empty. DEE'S SPEEDSTRE broke in then made light contact with a foe early, settled off the pace, dropped from the
five path to the three path around the turn and failed to respond. SOUNDS SPOOKY bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up early, moved out
then settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn and was no factor.

CUPIDS GIRL five then four wide in pursuit, advanced from the three-eighths to issue a bid through the latter portion of the turn into contention swinging
four to five wide into upper stretch, took over command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive. VODKATINI dueled from the four path early
on with CADENCIA to her inside, shook off that rival and tucked to the two path into the turn only to be engaged once more to knock heads briefly three
furlongs out when placed to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch shaken off by the top pair, proved no match for the winner while running on to
secure the place honors. BELLA PRINCIPESSA traded a bump with CADENCIA and was coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. TRUE EMPRESS coaxed from the gate, chased two
to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. WISHING ON A STAR
coaxed from the gate, raced briefly forwardly placed, grew a bit rank when CADENCIA crossed over directly in front and was taken hold off heels by the
rider six furlongs from home conceding immediately about two lengths of ground, continued tossing her head facing kickback now until settling a bit better
with five furlongs to go, came under coaxing remaining inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
CADENCIA traded a bump at the start with BELLA PRINCIPESSA, crossed to the inside forcing WISHING ON A STAR to be taken in hand off her heels,
then tipped to the two path to duel with VODKATINI, got shaken off by that rival and tipped to the three path half a mile from home before advancing once
more on that rival now from the outside to duel briefly again three furlongs from home, took over command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in yielding the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened to the finish. CAPTIVATING CARA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. GAME THEORY hustled from the start,
chased three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide for home, tired.

Footnotes
KERNESS went straight to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the five-sixteenths,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole and held under strong
urging. DR. KRAFT was urged along near the back, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide nearing the three-eighths, dropped to the three
path under a strong drive at the quarter-pole then drifted in coming to the three-sixteenths, gained in the final furlong and finished with good energy to just
get the place. MIGHTY ATLAS was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, moved in then was urged along at the rear, saved ground around the turn,
came out into the two path in upper stretch and finished well to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. VICTORY MONEY tracked the pace
on the outside, chased four then three wide around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth then weakened and was caught for the
trifecta. AMERICAN GRANT broke out then was hustled, raced outside under urging, angled in at the nine-sixteenths, saved ground early on the turn then
shifted three wide at the three-eighths, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole and
capitulated. NINETEEN OYSTERS brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch then fell to the
rear, went four then five wide around the turn and failed to respond. HOT ROD LINCOLN brushed with an opponent at the start, moved out early then was
well placed just off the pace, dropped back while moving from the three path to the two path around the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
WARRIOR RICHARD chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, took to the rail straightened away and rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling inside the runner up taking narrow
command a sixteenth out, then gamely fended off that rival to prevail on the wire. PROVEN HOPE five then four wide in pursuit, took over command set
down swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole, dueled inside that station getting displaced narrowly from command
a sixteenth out, fought on game to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. STEADY PROGRESS chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along clear for the show honors. OLD POINT five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late going. GHOSTSTRYDER chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered no
response. WEALLLIKEDHIM coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. ETERNAL GLORY broke out at the start, chased four wide until tucked to the
two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. DISTURBED hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into
upper stretch and made no impact.
