Footnotes
LOTSA LOU Rushed up to duel inside of rival through backside, outpaced by SHISH KABOB into the bend, rebid at the eighth pole while still inside of foe,
kept finding to overtake at the sixteenth and hold sway. SHISH KABOB Dueled outside of rival through backside before moving to clear advantage into the
turn, passed down the lane at the sixteenth pole, tried but could not find more. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA Stalked in the four path up the backside while being
pressed upon by the rider all the way, finished up well in latter stages. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY Stayed in touch with leaders on the rail, outpaced on the turn,
always outrun by better. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE Lagged in behind the field early, commenced outside the quarter pole and circled four wide for a bid,
ended up in the eight path into the stretch and moved only beyond fading foes. DUKE CITY KITTY Settled on the rail in behind up the backside, checked out
of spot between rival and the rail into the turn, re-engaged when swung to the three path inside the quarter pole, came with a very mild bid but had nothing
left. MISS MY MAMMA Moved in the two path while in the rear and never improved position. MAGIC HUSSAR Travelled three wide up the backstretch,
never threatened when the running got going, moved to the rail for the stretch, still found little.

Footnotes
TELLER Tracked well off the lead along the rail, commenced move when switched to the three path outside the quarter pole, got fully cranked at the
three-sixteenths pole, made the lead inside the eighth in the three path, drew off powerfully. BAD KARMA Sent and moved up the two path first time by,
cleared to the rail into the first turn at the half mile pole, opened up a hefty advantage up the backside that was maintained to the three-sixteenths, was
overtaken just inside the eighth by a steamrolling foe, had nothing left late. EMPEROR'S CHOICE Set up inside in the move by the grandstand while in
touch of leader, conceded to foe and traveled a distant second up the backstretch, prompted by rider to move at the quarter pole and loomed with a chance
two wide at the eighth pole, emptied out in the run through the stretch. OUTLAW BY NATURE Had no speed early and was well detached through the
preliminary running, moved up in the three path at the quarter pole and progressed well but simply had too much to do and just missed out on show honors.
TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE Moved far off the pace in two path, was through at the five-sixteenths pole and was eased down to and through the wire.

GENERAL THAYER Commenced in a fierce battle up the backstretch, moved to a narrow advantage around the turn, drifted a few paths off line into the
stretch, tussled in a remaining line of three down the lane, outlasted all for victory. FIGHT ME Pressed early three wide and moved to duel into the turn,
loomed boldly three wide at the eighth pole, grinded after the lead down the lane but was held at bay by the eventual winner. BRON AND THE BROW
Dueled between runners up the backstretch, maintained in battle through the turn and to the eighth pole, fought lane, had no more late. SWITCH BACK
Settled along the rail in behind the top trio, maintained position on the turn and never gained in the heat of the running. NUMMY NUM Stalked right off the
leaders in the four path, stayed in same lane around the turn, never menaced. BUMPY CUP Brushed the outside of the gate hard out of the blocks then shot
sharply towards the inside on the rail, lagged behind rest after the tumultuous beginning, swung to the six path for the turn, never gained.

NORTH DAWN Cleared from outer draw to lead on the rail, maintained position through the turn before drifting to the three path at the eighth pole, repelled
inside challenger down the lane and held sway. TOTHEMOONANDBACK Advanced from a slightly delayed break on the rail from the three-eighths to the
quarter pole, continually gained on the inside of a rival through the stretch but was just outmatched by the winner. MULLIGAN Traveled off the rail in the
second flight, dove to the rail on the turn, never menaced. SUE ETTAS GHOST Settled in rear, ran evenly on the turn despite being asked, showed mild late
gain between rivals with a split run in the dying yards. SCAT ATTACK Broke on top but was outfooted by quicker outer rivals, continued to pursue inside,
swung for clean air to the three path at the quarter pole, no match for field, tired lane.

IMA CARPE DIEM Flashed from the rail and led to the backside, left an opening on the rail for LILY PAD LAKE to come and duel at the seven-sixteenths,
dueled between rivals from there to the turn, battled lane outside of a rival, roused to lead in the final stages. LILY PAD LAKE Missed the break, moved up
at will to tuck in behind leaders into the first turn, advanced inside of an opening left by leading rival and picked up a three-horse duel to the eighth pole,
fought with remaining rival through the lane inside and just missed at the line. MY MAN BIGGIE Broke to his face and lost many lengths on the field, forced
to run well off the pace in the opening stages, split first pair of rivals outside the three-eighths pole while advancing well, moved between more rivals at the
three-sixteenths, swung to the four path into the lane, flew home but had too much to do. HADLEES HONOR Joined the leader two wide into the first turn,
moved a path out up the backside and vied three wide up the backstretch, remained in the fray to the eighth pole, gave way through the lane. JOHN'S KID
Traveled in the four path into the first turn, maintained until being asked at the three-eighths to advance but never improved. SANTIAGO'S CAT Stalked four
wide into the first turn juts off the leaders, let them progress up the backstretch and was content to track them, moved to the rail at the three-sixteenths to
make a run but had nothing for the stretch. SUGAR SHANE Moved well of the rail into the first turn and remained the widest traveler throughout, never
progressed.
