Footnotes
POETIC UNION raced in the middle of the pack entering the backstretch, was steadily gaining ground from the three path to vie for the lead throughout the
far turn, kicked clear of the inner rivals then drew off in the stretch under a confident show of the crop to prevail in the end. WATCH OUT NOW set the pace
heading into the first turn and onto the backstretch, then vied for the lead throughout the far turn but was outkicked by an outside rival and was second best
in the end. DR Z'S ELSA stalked the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the back stretch, then vied for the lead on the far turn, but was out bid
and flattened out in the stretch. FABULOUS TALE settled along the inside on the backstretch to bid on the far turn and was no threat. CLASSICALLY
WICKED settled in the two path into the backstretch, then faded heading into the last furlongs and was no menace.

up just in time for the win. HAPPY IN HEELS lead the way down the backstretch and into the turn, was in a hard drive down the lane but was caught by an
outside rival and was second best. WILD EXPRESS was in a steady drive while two wide into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch to close willingly in
the stretch but it was not enough. GRACIE'S KITTEN raced about four wide, then was bumped by an inner rival entering the turn, re rallied then closed well
in the stretch but it was not enough. SKY ROCKER was unhurried early, then bumped rival about the five sixteenths pole, rebid on the turn but came up
empty in the stretch. CHARMING LEAH chased the pace while three wide, bid while four wide on the turn then flattened out in the end. WITT'S GRIS was
unhurried early then bid three wide on the turn and was no threat. IRISH WRIT chased the pace along the inside, then slowly faded throughout the turn and
