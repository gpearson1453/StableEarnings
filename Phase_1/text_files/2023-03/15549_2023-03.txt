Footnotes
NEWS BOX broke with the field, was outrun early off the inside, three wide through the turn, switched out for room approaching the furlong grounds, late
bid, going away. BEND IN THE RIVER closest to the leader up the backstretch, asked along and came three wide for the drive, continued to chase past the
furlong marker, could not match the winner late, held sway 2nd. WESLEYAN broke alertly, cleared to the inside soon after, continued to hold a daylight
advantage into and through upper stretch, faltered late when confronted by the top two. TRAPPE VALLEY broke back, lacked speed inside, made an
advance along the inside through the turn, flattened out a bit the final furlong. J'S LITTLE MAN forwardly placed, raced three to four wide through the turn,
weakened in the drive. RYE HUMOR off slowly, remained always back in failing to threaten. MR FROST in mid pack early toward the inside, began a steady
retreat before a half.

Footnotes
SHE BE SHEEHAN angled in after start, prompted the leader while off the inside, continued to be the closest pursuer up the backstretch two off the rail,
advanced and took over late in the final turn, long drive, dug in late to hold off the runner up. REAUX BINA bothered slightly when the winner angled in past
the wire the first time, settled in the second flight inside, steered out three wide for the drive, challenged outside the winner the final furlong, extended drive,
denied. TIZ A STRATEGY lacked early foot out in the strip, moved closer three to four wide through the final turn, failed to sustain that advance the final
furlong to prove o match for the top pair. DR. WOODS MIRACLE settled off the pace just off the inside, two path second turn, displayed a modest amount of
late interest to improve position slightly. PAT'S GAL floated in by the winner past the wire the first time, cleared that one in the first turn, set the pace along
the inside, began to weaken when headed by that same foe late in the first turn. DRIVING in the second flight while racing three wide through both turns,
tired. FOXPASS last to leave never menaced.

Footnotes
THORN CROWN broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to show the way into the lane in the two path, headed soon after,
battled back the final furlong to prevail in game fashion. STREET PAINTER never far back three wide, closer three wide turning for home, put a head in front
past the furlong marker, outkicked to the wire. HONEYCAMP hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued to race back while saving
ground through the turn, improved by rallying through traffic, in time for the show, not a threat to the top three. SWEET HOLINESS bumped at the start
when DIAMONDS FOREVER broke to the inside, raced in mid pack while in the two path through the turn, improved a bit in the late while not a serious
threat. SHESTHEBIGGAME forwardly placed along the inside, began to tire after three furlongs. MRS. MACOMBER lacked speed, dropped inside for the
turn, lacked a closing response through the lane. LUNCH LADY pressed the winner from the outside for a half, gave way in the drive. FANCY HILL in mid
pack early outside, got out a bit to be four wide early in the turn, also failed to muster a rally. DIAMONDS R FOREVER broke in, bumped SWEET
HOLINESS, steadied and then was finished early.

Footnotes
ELEGANCE N TONIC broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn inside, continued to set a pressured pace the middle half mile, shrugged off the runner
up when straightened for home, and kicked well clear. ELI'S GIRL moved out a bit to press the winner in the two path through the first turn, continued to
press up the backstretch and into the far turn, closest with a quarter remaining, could not match that one through the lane, clearly second best. LADY
ENVOY lost footing at the break to be away slowly, continued to lack speed into the far turn, staged a mild rally in the two path to be up for the show. ABBY
THE BULL DAWG broke out, raced one paced off the rail, came four wide for the drive, set down, closest to the top pair with a furlong to run, outkicked for
the show late. SWEET DYNASTY squeezed back at the break, lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. AIN'TNOSWEETIE
within striking distance while along the inside, tired in the drive. DIAL DISH three wide and in mid pack, weakened after six furlongs. FLAG TO FLAG fell
back to trail immediately after the start, sluggish, fell further back, jogged in.

Footnotes
HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL close from the start after an alert break, vied three wide into and through the far turn, drew well clear under steady handling. OLD
SCHOOL FLASH pressed early, vied up front while between foes up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not match strides with the winner through
the lane, remained clear for the place. ELMO'S SECRET lacked early foot, raced two to three wide through the final turn, staged a mild rally to gain the
show. SWEET TRUFFLES settled in the second flight while racing off the inside, two path through the second bend, lacked a closing kick. ALTAR GIRL
washy moved up to set the pace along the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage up the backstretch, began to weaken far turn, continued to fade
through the lane. I GUESS NOT restless in the gate, broke back, behind the first group while saving ground first turn, shuffled back with five furlongs to run,
continued to save ground and went evenly through the stretch. MAY DISCO off a step slow, trailed early, was never a threat. BLUE COWGIRL moved
closer before a half outside, four wide through the second turn while still within striking distance far turn, backed up through the stretch. WILD BIZNESS
broke back, fell back to trail before a half and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LADY COMMANDER allowed the pace to go early while saving ground, continued along the inside through the second turn, challenged up the rail with less
than a furlong remaining, proved best under firm handling. GHOSTLY GIRL stalked the leaders from off the inside, three wide when moving on that pair late
in the final turn, came four wide for the drive, showed the way past the furlong marker, allowed the winner the inside soon after and was outkicked to the
wire. I FEEL THE NEED off a step slow, void of speed in trailing for five furlongs, swung out five wide when beginning to advance turning for home, showed
some belated interest to the up late for the show. WATERWORKS stumbled and broke in, recovered and pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled on
the outside the middle half, weakened through the stretch. POUT took control after the start, showed the way through the first turn in the two path, dueled
through the second along the inside, faltered in the drive. RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA settled off the pace and just off the inside, had little for the drive.
SANTANGELO bothered start, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ECHO AGAIN forwardly placed early toward the inside, moved out a bit in the run into the second turn, advanced and took over three wide turning for home,
clear upper stretch, slight drift, held runner up safe late. EL TOMATE void of early foot in trailing first turn, launched an early move before a half toward the
inside, angled three wide behind the winner turning for home, drifted out the final furlong while slowly closing the gap on the winner late, well clear of the
others. WESTERN GHENT closest to the leader after angling in late in the first turn, chased, bid between horses and inside the winner turning for home,
could not keep up with that one nor contain the runner up, saved the show late. B MINOR in the second flight while racing off the inside, remained within
striking distance while being floated out four wide by the runner up turning for home, lacked a closing punch. GIROOVIN settled in mid pack early off the rail,
crept closer then raced in traffic outside the runner up with a half mile to run, went evenly to the wire when clear. TYLER'S TRIBE took control soon after the
start, gout out slightly in the first turn to be three wide, pace up the backstretch, faltered when confronted late in the final turn. MAYFIELD STRONG
stumbled at the start, remained always back.

Footnotes
ALLO ENRY away in good order, stalked the leader into the turn, maintained contact with that one into the stretch, roused between foes past the furlong
marker, collared the leader a furlong out, quickly clear. CAMPISI broke well, cleared to the inside, showed the way into and through the turn, maintained a
clear advantage upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. MR. COUGAR in the second flight off the inside, three wide and
between foes through the turn, staged a bit of a late run to willingly gain the show. VYING EDGE pinballed break, recovered to race in the second group
while widest, closer four down to three wide through the turn, prominent upper stretch, flattened out the final furlong to lose the show. SUPER GEEK void of
early foot, came in the two path into the lane, improved a bit upper stretch, flattened out in the late going. WARNING LABEL saved ground when behind the
pace, came up empty through the stretch to finish up evenly. TRAFFIC CONTROL in mid pack in the early going toward the inside, angled four wide turning
for home, also failed to mount a closing response. RISKY SITUATION fell back to trail after the start, trailed most of the way and was never a factor.
GOODNIGHT ARCHIE bumped start, gave way in the drive.
