Footnotes
JUST NORTH , four wide the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, bid for the lead outside CHERU
at the head of the stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. CHERU showed speed inside horses, hugged the inner rail on the far turn, dug in through the
stretch and was best of the others. HAINT BLUE circled the far turn three wide and passed tired horses. BROOKLYN GIRL lacked speed, raced along the
inner rail on the far turn and failed to be a factor. CONNIE'S DANCE showed speed along the inner rail and tired after six furlongs. DETERMINED STELLA ,
rank while three wide on the first turn, moved up outside CHERU down the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROCKET prompted the pace between rivals heading to the half mile marker, moved to near even terms while in hand mid turn, vied to the
quarter pole, responded when shaken up and kicked clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling and held firm. ADDY'S LADDY T N T ,
away alertly, tracked the leaders three wide, edged up under a drive past mid stretch, shifted out some and came back gamely. GILLIGAN , urged along
outside a rival, raced three wide in upper stretch, altered out for a clear run in mid stretch and churned on to grab the show. CALL ME MAESTRO , off
slowly when bearing out at the break, corrected and quickly gained four wide leaving the far turn, ranged up to loom into the lane, gave hard chase from the
three sixteenths then flattened out late. SUTTON VALLEY sped to the early lead inside rivals, met the winner's bid leaving the far turn, sparred to the head
of the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then succumbed. BOWIE TWO STEP saved ground with pursuit and failed to generate a rally. DIMMI QUANDO found
himself far back after a quarter mile and failed to make an impact.

CHARGE TOO saved ground around the turn battling with the winner, finished gamely and was well clear of the others. CARVELLIAN QUEST , a forward
factor in the two path around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and retreated through the lane. CLASSIC LEGEND , three deep chasing the pace
around the turn, weakened through the stretch. MONEY ROOM hugged the inner rail around the turn and was never a factor. WOODLINE , along the inner
rail chasing the early pace, gave way leaving the turn. TWICE GOLD was outrun. RUSH TO CANDY , outside horses into the turn, faltered and was eased.

CLASSIC LYNNE rated forwardly, edged up then dropped in to secure the rail leaving the far turn, bid in hand to the inside of rivals mid turn, opened up
after being nudged on in upper stretch then was geared down through the final sixteenth. POET IN MY HEART prompted from the outside, moved to
engage the leader leaving the far turn, was carried seven wide soon after, was kept well wide by CONDUCTANCE into the turn, straightened away and
continued on willingly to save the place. LOOKIN SPUNKY saved ground with pursuit, stayed inside through the drive and churned on. CONDUCTANCE
sped clear early, drifted six wide carrying out POET IN MY HEART near the three eighths, corrected and contested between foes, came five for the drive
and faded. YAZZERA (PER) broke a step slow, rushed between rivals soon after and gained a stalking spot, was urged two wide outside the winner while
chasing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and tired.

SPOTTED BULL advanced four deep leaving the turn, was floated out turning for home, sprinted clear near the eighth pole, drifted in approaching the
sixteenth pole and edged away. FREE SQUARE showed speed in the two path, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, battled inside the winner through the
stretch and was second best. NO MORE TALK raced in the two path inside horses on the turn, was taken to the inner rail entering the stretch and flattened
out. BACKATYA disputed the pace in the three path around the turn, drifted out turning for home and weakened the final furlong. PELOTA lacked speed,
swung to the five path entering the stretch and passed tired horses. UNCOMMON VALOR was outrun. FLAMING EAST showed some early foot along the
inner rail and gave way in the stretch. BEYOND THE VICTORY was outrun.

Footnotes
LADNEEDSAHANDLER quickly went clear, was nicely rating setting the pace about two wide, moved away a bit mid turn, kept on under solid handling past
mid stretch and held firm. MANOLITO , forwardly placed soon after the break while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, gained three wide into the
stretch and held well to preserve the place. MAGIC MULE , two wide early, dropped in and edged up past the five sixteenths, shifted out and closed
steadily. SPONSORED , three to four wide, gave hard chase into the lane but failed to muster up a solid run. PIT STOP MAN , hustled up between rivals
soon after break, dropped in to prompt the pace, saw the winner get away mid turn, stayed inside to chase into the stretch, lacked punch past the furlong
grounds and faded. WHIZWIT drifted in at the break and brushed with a rival, settled at the back, worked outward for the drive and finished well. ASKIN
FOR A BASKIN broke a step slow then steadied when put in tight soon after, raced well back into the turn, angled five wide for the drive and failed to
menace. PHRA PHROM , off the pace, angled four wide and lacked a bid. HE'S ORIENTATE gave early chase and weakened.

AWESOME VIEW circled the turn three wide while in a striking position, drifted four deep entering the stretch, secured command in upper stretch and was
kept to her business in the drive. IZZYBELLA , wide around the turn, drifted five wide entering the stretch and rallied outside foes. DANCER'S MELODY
sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and faded late. GOLD TIME VIXEN , outside
DANCER'S MELODY on the turn, chased that one to upper stretch and wekened. CONGRESS HALL , outrun, swung to the four path turning for home.
RED QUEEN , along the inner rail most of the trip, was not a factor. LITTLE MS SCARLET , a brief factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, gave
way on the turn.

Footnotes
SILVER CURRENCY bobbled at the break, quickly recovered and edged up between rivals to take over leaving the chute, rated kindly just off the inside,
kicked away after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling leaving the furlong ground and held firm. ITALIAN DRESSING , firmly
rated while saving ground and not too far back, angled out nearing the three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch, advanced past rivals to be the closest
pursuer headed to mid stretch and continued on willingly to be clear of the rest. GLOWSITY prompted the pace while saving ground, stayed close under
asking past the three eighths, shifted out in upper stretch, lacked a punch past the eighth pole and faded. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE rated close up between
foes leaving the five eighths, was under asking past the three eighths, angled in giving futile chase past the quarter pole then faded. VIKING QUEEN , three
wide stalking the pace, was pushed along outside foes past the three eighths, raced between runners in upper stretch and gave way. CHARMING WAY
broke outward and was in tight to be away last, regrouped and moved up off the rail into the turn, pursued four wide outside horses nearing the lane,
steadied when in tight near the three sixteenths, altered out and faded.
