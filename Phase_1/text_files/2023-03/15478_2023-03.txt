Footnotes
ALPHA WHISKEY broke out to bother TAP THAT DEAL, was straightened and contested the pace up the backstretch and into the turn closest to the inside,
shook clear in upper stretch, held the runner up save late under steady handling. BOURBON ON FIRE behind the pace inside, steered out to be four then
five wide into the stretch, rallied through upper stretch to be closest to the winner a furlong out, could do no more with that one, fully extended to preserve
the place. CONTRABANDISTA broke back, raced back off the pace in the two path, continued toward the inside drive, finished up willingly to be closing the
gap on the runner up. EL GEMAR set or forced the pace while between horses, weakened in the drive. TAP THAT DIAL bothered at the break, steered
three wide when being asked into the lane, went evenly through the stretch. GUIDED ARROW vied up front three to four wide through the turn, backed up
through the lane.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SWING last away, lacked speed, began to advance far turn, came four wide for the drive, challenged on the outside when straightened for
home, proved best of firm handling. SPACE ODESSEY in the second flight, steered out three wide first turn, 2nd flight backstretch, three into lane, led
between foes midstretch, outkicked late. LUCK OF THE DRAW dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate into the far turn, gave ground
grudgingly to the top two in the drive, comfortably saved the show. MAJOR KONG void of speed, four out to five wide turning for home outside the winner,
could not match that one in the run to the wire. COOL RUNNINGS restless in the gate, in the second flight along the inside, had nothing for the drive.
CATHOLIC GUILT dueled up front off the inside while rank through the first turn, gave way in the second turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
EMERALD PRINCESS broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, given a bit of a breather through the turn, extended that
advantage in upper stretch, not seriously threatened to the wire under steady pressure. SHOW ME GRACE closest to the winner to that one's outside,
moved slightly closer turn, was put to the task for the drive, could do little with the winner to the wire, fully extended to hold the place. CHASING SHADOWS
off a step slow, moved up in the second flight, steered out a bit to be three wide for the drive, getting to the runner up late, not a threat to the winner.
DORITA'S HEART back off the pace well out in the strip, four to five wide turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest. FIRST EMPRESS fell back to trail
inside, saved ground to no avail. LA MORENA in the second flight early, staged a steady retreat while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
AL'S ROMEO behind the pace off the inside, closer three wide into the turn, continued a steady advance through the bend, took over turning for home, drew
off steadily while kept to pressure. DANCIN ROCKET away in good order from the outside, vied early up the backstretch outside, dueled turn in the two
path, showed the way late in the turn, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, fully extended to narrowly last for the place. LOUD BOY behind
the pace toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive, rapidly getting to the runner up late. FINBARFUREY off a step slow, fell further back,
continued to lag through the turn, steered out for the drive, finished up willingly to also be getting to the runner up late. OTHER TIMES broke inward and
back lightly bumping SACRAMENT, came five wide out of the turn when still back, lugged in past the furlong marker, finished up evenly after being
straightened. MO DOWN broke on top, drifted out when contesting the pace up the backstretch putting SACRAMENT in tight with over a half mile to run,
dueled into and through much of the turn inside the runner up, gave way in the drive. SACRAMENT bumped lightly at the break, raced in the second flight,
moved a bit closer then was put in tight and checked midway up the backstretch, fell back in the turn and continued to fade through the lane.

Footnotes
MI CRESCENDO moved closer late in the run up the backstretch, cut off early i the turn, steadied, fell back, dropped inside, advanced into the lane, took
over from along the inside, nearing midstretch, clear, held runner up safe late. TAP ME A TEXT broke out and back, began to move early in the turn, swung
out to be five wide into the stretch, closed some ground on the winner down the middle of the strip. TWENTYTWENTYREDO broke back, void of speed
toward the inside for a half, found best stride too late in improving through traffic. MORNING TWILIGHT back off the pace inside, continued to save ground
turn, improved position, not enough for the show. PUT A BOW ON IT within striking distance in the second flight while three wide into and through the turn,
came up empty for the stretch run. FOREVER HOME chased the leader from off the inside for a half, had little left for the stretch run. TROPINKA in the
second flight while racing along the inside, two path into the stretch, fell back and failed to menace. DERBY DAY LASSIE broke alertly, sprinted well clear
early, showed the way into and through the turn, gave way when headed entering the stretch. WARM BEAUTY off a step slow, trailed most of the way in
showing little. SILENT SCARLET in mid pack while off the inside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER moved up to race in the second group while racing outside, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, put a head in front past
the furlong marker, longd driving, edging clear late under a firm right handed crop. JOE FRAZIER moved up closer early along the inside, covered up in
traffic into and through much of the turn, dove to the inside to hit a hole along the rail in upper stretch, inside bid soon after, outkicked by the winner late,
determined for the place. COLD AS HELL pressed the leader while off the inside, closer late in the turn, bid past the furlong marker while between the top
two, could not hang with that pair late while narrowly hold the show. STAGE LEFT in a bit tight at the start, lacked speed, came four wide for the drive,
displayed a bit of late interest to miss the show. DARK TIMBER broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set the pace
turn, held a narrow advantage nearing midstretch, faltered late when headed. BEER CHASER broke back, trailed most of the way and made little impact.
DEFLATER raced in mid pack early, moved to the inside turn, faded through the lane.
