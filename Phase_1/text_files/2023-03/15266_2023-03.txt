Footnotes
BACKSTREET AFFAIR sped to the early lead, was slightly off the inner rail around the turn, met challenge in mid stretch and dug in tenaciously. CLASSIC
LYNNE , three wide around the turn, bid for the lead outside the winner in mid stretch, failed to get by and was much the best of the others. CAMELIA ROD ,
four deep on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. HOV LANE , in the two path around the turn, chased the
pace to the stretch then weakened. MERGER OF EQUALS , a bit rank at the break, was no factor and passed a pair of tired horses. CONDUCTANCE
hugged the inner rail, was in hand in narrow quarters entering the turn and gage way through the stretch. FLAT OUT COOL angled to the three path in
upper stretch and faltered.

DIALING DIXIE sped to the early lead and handled outside pressure, dueled inside a pair of rivals past the three eighths, was scrubbed upon heading to the
quarter pole and regained command, spurted clear two wide in upper stretch, kept on under right handed asks with a sixteenth remaining and proved
resolute to the wire. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , off the early skirmish, dropped in leaving the far turn, cut the corner with momentum into the lane, advanced
to the inside of rival leaving mid stretch and finished gamely. BERNIE'S ON FIRE prompted the pace outside, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled on
near even terms approaching the quarter pole, was floated six wide into the lane, straightened and came back a bit with pursuit past the eighth pole but
flattened out late. MOJAC KAT , well placed early, chased the leaders while three wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. SPRING THE BEAST was
sent up between runners soon after the break, moved to near even terms battling pace the three eighths, drifted out bothering BERNIE'S ON FIRE entering
the lane, corrected and gave way. CONFUSION BABY BOY lagged back, was under asking three wide into the stretch but failed to respond.

PIT STOP MAN prompted the early pace outside LADNEEDSAHANDLER, engaged that one approaching the stretch, dueled through the lane and
determinedly prevailed. LADNEEDSAHANDLER showed speed along the inner rail , dueled through the stretch and just missed in a sharp effort. FREE
SQUARE lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, was floated four deep in upper stretch and failed to be a menace. MONTAUK DADDY , near the inner
rail chasing the pace around the turn, swung out in upper stretch and gave way. MR. MOX raced in the two path on the turn, was floated out a bit in upper
stretch and steadied in close quarters in mid stretch.

Footnotes
GABRIEL'S WING , scrubbed along inside rivals giving hard chase of the embattled leaders, moved up to be the closest pursuer mid turn, angled four wide
into the lane, moved up under a drive, joined LORD UHTRED from his outside with a sixteenth to go, dueled, switched over to his left lead late and edged
ahead. LORD UHTRED dueled outside under rating, carried that scrum into the lane, spurted clear after being set down past the three sixteenths, dug in
when confronted, switched to his left lead with about a sixteenth remaining and fought valiantly to the wire. RASCALLY REBEL , well back of a contested
pace, saved ground under coaxing into the turn, advanced inside rivals mid turn, angled three wide and closed steadily. SMOOTH RICO was hard sent to
the lead, was joined by LORD UHTRED after a furlong, sparred to upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong. BORUFF , three wide between
rivals, steadied nearing the turn, angled out and was put to pressure, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. FREDDYNESS stumbled at the
break, raced four deep pursuing heading to the turn, dropped in a bit to chase outside rival, failed to kick on nearing the lane and tired. SCOOTSCOOT
showed speed then drafted back between foes to chase, shifted in around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
LADY JEAN rated kindly well out in the track and within range of a contested pace, edged up about four wide leaving the far turn, shifted five wide for the
drive, closed in under left handed asks and took over nearing the eighth, pole, drifted in while dueling outside BEHIND THE COUCH through the final
sixteenth and held firm. BEHIND THE COUCH moved to a slim lead between rivals early, took to rating emerged in a duel to the inside of ICY REPLY
leaving the three eighths, was guided out a bit into the lane, dug in when joined in mid stretch, dueled gamely from there and was herded in late.
FUNNYBET settled off the contested pace, angled four wide for the drive and closed steadily. MISS CASEY broke a step slow, recovered and moved up
after a furlong to be close, shifted in for the drive, moved up in mid stretch then flattened out late. ICY REPLY , three deep with the pace, dueled outside
BEHIND THE COUCH from the three eighths, was floated out a bit entering the lane, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. MINER'S GEM was hard
sent from the inside to join the pace fray, eased back off the leading pair leaving the far turn, swung out past the three sixteenths, wandered outward and
gave way. LUCKY LIZZIE saved ground around the turn, faltered and was reported by the stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
GRASS CUTTER cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being set down two wide in upper stretch, wandered outward, was
corrected with right handed asks past the sixteenth pole and held sway. GOLD DIGGING BROAD , urged along chasing the winner, came three to four wide
for the drive, shifted in through the final sixteenth and finished gamely. ARROGATES DREAM saved ground, edged up a bit nearing the far turn, angled out
with pursuit into the stretch and faded. BUTTERMILK GIRLZ passed tiring rivals. ALWAYS FORWARD dropped back. SNOOZE BUTTON , three wide
stalking the pace, faltered leaving the far turn, was taken wider nearing the lane and was eased late.
