Footnotes
PARTY FOUL showed speed leaving the break and established the early advantage, set decent fractions to the turn, extended the lead heading to the
quarter marker, drew off nearing the furlong pole, was given a few reminders in deep stretch and remained clear to the wire as much the best. HOOP
DREAM established a ground saving position in the early stages, chased from the inside to the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the stretch
run but stayed on well in the final stages to be second best. DRUMADOON stalked the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals on the turn, came three wide
into the stretch, lost ground nearing the eighth pole, lacked a response in the final furlong and just held for the show. TOM'S MOON took back in the early
stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch run, finished evenly in the lane and just missed for the show. JUST WATCH
ME NOW forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the decent fractions while between rivals on the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, lost position
heading to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
BLAZE OF DREAMS chased the moderate early pace while in hand, advanced three wide on the turn, came within aim of the top pair nearing the furlong
marker, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear under steady late urging. THISMUSTBETHEPLACE stumbled at the start and crowded
BARHOPSKY, recovered in the first few strides and dueled with MYSTIC TBILISI through moderate early fractions, battled to the inside of that rival to the
quarter marker, took a narrow lead to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the late stages and held for place. MYSTIC TBILISI engaged
with THISMUSTBETHEPLACE in the early stages and dueled through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, continued to battle with that foe to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace with BLAZE OF DREAMS in the late stages and was outfinished for the place while well clear for the show. BARHOPSKY
was crowded then took up at the start, lacked early speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE DIVA broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, was well rated through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the
lead nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, held sway through the final sixteenth, was injured during the gallop out and was vanned
off. MY YAMMY LADY took back in the early stages, saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide for the drive, was not able to impact the winner in the
final stages but offered a mild late rally and was second best. JAZZY LOVE allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch
run, was well positioned into the far turn while saving ground, could not keep pace with the top two in the stretch run and just held for show in the final
stages. DUST MAKER tracked the moderate fractions, raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.
BIG GIFT was away in good order then steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, was unhurried through the early stages, raced three then five wide
into the stretch, angled in nearing the furlong pole and lacked a late response. PRANCIN N THE PARK asked to be forwardly placed in the early stages,
stalked the moderate fractions to the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SHERILINDA forwardly placed in the early stages, attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, chased INDIAN DANCER to the quarter
marker, continued that pursuit of the pacesetter to mid-stretch, responded to firm urging inside of the furlong marker and wore down INDIAN DANCER in the
final sixteenth to prevail. INDIAN DANCER sent after a good beginning, was well handled through moderate early fractions, held SHERILINDA at bay to
mid-stretch, was confronted by that rival inside of the furlong marker, stubbornly met that bid to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while just
holding for the place. CLASS CODE never far back in the early stages, tracked the moderate fractions to the far turn, saved ground to the top of the stretch,
encountered traffic in mid-stretch, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker, offered a late rally but could not reel in the top pair and held for the show.
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide into the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, angled to
the two path on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and found her best stride late. KITTYHAWK LASS was a bit fractious in the gate then was off a step
slowly, rushed up in the early stages and chased the moderate fractions to the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong and
lacked a final response. NORTHERN ROSE unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the far turn and did not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
JERRY JEFF WALKER forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the quick fractions while closest to the loose pacesetter, chased NAUVOO to the quarter
marker, steadily reeled in that foe nearing mid-stretch, took command and was green in the late stages but kept to task to hold safely for the win. CALI
CONQUEST was well placed in the early stages, settled in the second flight while not far back through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the drive,
ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished NAUVOO to secure the place.
NAUVOO showed early speed leaving the break and sped to a clear lead along the first turn, set fast fractions through the backstretch run, maintained a
clear lead into upper stretch, came under pressure from JERRY JEFF WALKER nearing the furlong marker, could not hold that rival off but stayed in range
to deep stretch and was outfinished for the place, while clear in the end for the show. PROSPECT OF RAIN shuffled at the start and was off a bit slowly,
rated off of the solid early pace, raced three wide into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a mild late gain but lacked the needed late response.
DOS VICIOS unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
CITY GLITTER broke in at the start, crowded then bumped ENSLEYS DREAM and was off a step slowly, was hustled to the early lead and set quick
opening fractions, was asked to conserve speed on the turn, drifted out a bit into the stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong marker and kept to task in the
final sixteenth to prove best. MAGICAL LADY was allowed to settle off of the fast early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch
while still in aim, was able to make a mild gain on CITY GLITTER in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and outfinished BOLD DAUGHTER to secure
the place. BOLD DAUGHTER took back in the early stages, tracked the pace while two wide on the turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, angled
four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final furlong and was up in the final strides to earn the show. LION'S LAIR away in good
order, assumed command in the early stages then chased CITY GLITTER to the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, advanced in upper stretch, did
not sustain that rally in the late stages and was outfinished for the show in the final strides. TORREY'S GIRL chased the solid early pace, advanced on the
turn while two wide between rivals, lost position in upper stretch and gave way. ENSLEYS DREAM crowded then bumped at the start by CITY GLITTER
and was off slowly, trailed to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY LOTTIE allowed to settle in the early stages, was well placed into the far turn, came in a bit tight nearing the quarter marker while two wide,
angled four wide into the stretch, floated out VINTAGE in upper stretch, chased the top pair to mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the eighth pole, took
command inside of the sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final stages. BOURBON GLAZE unhurried in the early going, improved position along the
backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, made a steady gain through the final furlong, could not keep pace with
the winner in deep stretch and outfinished SMILING LADY to secure the place. SMILING LADY showed early speed and assumed command along the first
turn, was well handled through the backstretch run and into the far turn while carving decent fractions, pulled to a clear lead in mid-stretch, was all out in
deep stretch, could not hold off the quickly oncoming winner in the final stages and weakened late to lose the place, while well clear in the end for the show.
BLACK ZABAT broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, ceded the early lead to SMILINGLY LADY and tracked that pacesetter through decent
early fractions, came three wide into the stretch run, dropped back nearing the furlong pole and came up empty in the late stages. VINTAGE chased the
decent fractions from the second flight, came within aim while three wide on the far turn, was floated five wide in upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong
marker and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
CHARBONNEAU came away well from the outside and moved up quickly to share in the early pace, dueled for the lead while always traveling comfortably,
took over at the top of the stretch and went unchallenged to the wire. WILD BILLY D came out of the gate a little awkwardly and lost some ground getting
straightened out, was pressured to catch up with the field down the backstretch, made steady forward progress through the turn while three wide, raced
greenly down the stretch but was still able to get up for second. ALTITUDE one of the first into stride, backed off the pace duel and was content to track the
early leaders, stayed three wide around the turn, bid for the lead near the quarter pole, ran on well but was unable to collar the winner and was passed late
for the place. PRACTICAL BID took up slightly when TIGER HEAT came in after the break, settled mid-pack, was patiently ridden while saving ground, got
behind horses on the turn, awaited room in the stretch, rallied when clear but was much too late. START THEM UP crowded at the start then was slow into
stride in the early stages, switched to the outside down the backstretch, remained three wide into the turn, made a sweeping move to get into contention
near the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. TIGER HEAT broke in a bit at the start, bothering PRACTICAL BID, rushed up to gain a share of the
lead and dueled to the inside of CHARBONNEAU through comfortable fractions to the quarter pole, then tired in the stretch.
