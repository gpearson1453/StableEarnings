and checked hard early, recovered nicely to come on for a good third place finish. VELOCIMO chased winner to deep stretch could not keep up, weakened
late. EL MUZN no hurry early on, raced back to turn while mildly in the stretch. THE MOTTO broke sharp, good position to deep stretch, faltered late going.
