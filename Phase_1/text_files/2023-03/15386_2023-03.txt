Footnotes
CURRENT CLIMATE sharp speed to the front while in hand throughout, cleared in the stretch while under wraps to the wire in handy fashion. YOUR SO
SILLEA pinched back start, rallied wide into stretch while no match for runaway winner, bested rest. MY KENTUCKY GIRL pinched back at the start,
unhurried to turn, ran widest in the stretch for show spot. RICHIES GREAT GIRL never far back to turn, rallied into stretch to improve late. HABOBANERO
had a tardy start, rushed outside to chase top pair but faltered late stretch. MADRILENA (ARG) raced along evenly with no response when needed.
BOUDOIR BURLESQUE good position from inside to the turn but gave way readily in the stretch. MADEMOISELLE NOVA never menaced throughout.
LAUGH AND PLAY tried to keep up outside to stretch but emptied out in the final furlong. MS TEMPTATION never factored throughout. MIMAJOON chased
winner to stretch to no avail and faltered in the late going.
