Footnotes
TWO GUNS Let outer rival clear and switched to the two path to vie for the lead between, moved to narrow lead at three-eighths, dueled from that point on
with DRAW THE FOUL inside of rival, shook him off at the eighth pole, drew clear holding to the wire. SPEEDING STYLE Cleared off rivals to the rail,
backed out from three way battle at the five-sixteenths, jumped back on the bridle at the eighth pole, re-rallied up the inside, second best. DRAW THE FOUL
Settled three wide vying for the lead into first turn, narrowly made lead but then assumed duel at the three-eighths pole, continued to battle to the eighth pole
where he was fended off, emptied latter stages. ROCKED Stalked right in behind leaders in two path, let top trio get away up backstretch, moved up at the
seven-sixteenths pole in the three path, shifted further out turn, minor late foot, never a serious threat. MORE HONOR Trailed clearly early, commenced a
mild move at the quarter pole, passed one tiring foe, had nothing left late. TRACK BOUND Tracked in the second flight in the pocket, called upon at the
quarter pole, dropped back steadily.

Footnotes
A GEM IS A GEM Settled two wide for the run to the first turn, pursued outside, moved to the two path for the stretch, continually gained through the stretch,
surged in final stages to win in shadow of the wire. ROYAL JESTER Three wide into first turn, cleared two inner foes to lead at the seven-sixteenths, moved
to the rail, ran steadily through the lane trying to fend off lone foe, nipped on wire. FULL DRAW Touch slow from the break, moved three wide on turns,
gained steadily on second bend, came home on the wrong lead down the stretch, just got up to finish up the minors. EMPEROR'S CHOICE Stalked in the
two path into the first turn, swung out to the five path in move up the backstretch, moved back inside to the two path while progressing on turn, moved to rail
for lane, evenly down stretch. IZANAMI Lagged, never fired. NIGHTHAWK SPECIAL Ridden to maintain rail on the lead into the first turn, maintained before
dropping back at the three-eighths pole and fading consistently to the wire. KATZUMOTO Taken back into the third flight between rivals into first, never
contended.
