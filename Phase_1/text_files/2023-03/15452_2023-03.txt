Footnotes
CAPRIDREY rated between foes in the three path, was roused midway around the turn, was cued left handed while tipping out to the six path at the top of
the lane, bid for the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew past an inner foe in the final sixteenth to win. LITTLE BELITA set the pace in the four path, was
headed by an inner foe passing the half and was challenged by that foe while in the three path rounding the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter pole
and retook an advantage while tipping back out to the four path into the stretch, and kept on but was caught by a closing outer rival passing the sixteenth
pole to finish with place. KATIESDREAMGIRL trailed in the two path, was ridden around the turn and floated out to the six path into the stretch, and was one
paced to get up for show. BULLET ON TAP pressed the pace inside of an outer foe from the three path, took a narrow brief lead passing the half and vied
while shifting to the rail around the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter and was urged right handed in the two path at the top of the lane, but yielded
passing the eighth pole. BEAUTIFUL STAR chased in the five path, was cued right handed midway around the turn, but was no menace from the seven
path in the stretch.

Footnotes
MUNDO MIX set an open pace in the three path, shifted to the two path rounding the turn and was roused nearing the quarter pole, extended the lead while
in the two path and was cued left handed at the top of the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong, but held clear. DREAM OF BLESSINGS trailed in the four
path, was coaxed from the three path midway around the turn, and ran on along the inside of foes thru the lane to get up for place. MR. CELLULAR
travelled wellback in the six path early, was under a ride around the turn and in the seven path entering the stretch, tipped inwards under right handed cues
thru the stretch, and kept on for show. CAPTURE MI stalked in the four path, was roused around the turn and urged right handed from the five path at the
top of the lane, but evened out passing the eighth pole. NATURE BOY had his head turned and started slowly, rated around the seven path, moved up from
the six path around the turn, but flattened from out in the eight path in the stretch. KRYPTON chased in the six path, was under urging in the five path
rounding the turn, and did not threaten. ASTRAL WEEKS tracked in the five path, was asked for more run midway around the turn, but was empty entering
the stretch.

Footnotes
BAILADOR set a rated pace inside and held firm under a drive. NANTASKET BEACH steadied entering the first turn, prompted the pace two wide, had aim
outside of the winner in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead in the midstretch and just lasted for the place. STREET VENDOR saved ground off the
pace, angled three wide in upper stretch and rallied in tight quarters between foes. HASHTAG NO WONDER raced off the pace three wide, edged closer
four deep around the far turn but could make a slight stretch gain. SMART STRIKER settled off the early pace while racing two wide, swung six wide in
upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. EXPERIENCED was firmly rated inside, lacked an ideal path in upper stretch and faded through the final
sixteenth. AIRMAN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD tracked the pace three wide, could not keep pace near the
quarter pole, was eased and cantered across the finish line.

Footnotes
SEQUIN LADY was sent to set the pace in the two path, opened slightly passing the quarter pole and was cued right handed while floating to the five path at
the top of the lane, continued to inch away into the final furlong, and held sway. SOLAIR brushed with an inner foe at the start, was unhurried in the three
path early, tipped out to the five path and was circling inner foes passing the quarter pole, was coaxed from the six path into the lane, and chased home the
winner for place. HEIR TO THE ROAR had a hesitant start and brushed with an outer foe, rated along the inside but was steadied into the turn, was under
light rousing in the three path around the turn, shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. LA COSTA prompted the pace in the four
path, was under coaxing in the three path around the turn, went back out to the four path at the top of the lane, but evened out. MEET THE BEAUTY stalked
in the two path, shifted inside and was roused midway around the turn, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but was one paced. LITTLE RED
BUTTON tracked in the five path, was cued in the four path passing the quarter pole and floated out to the seven path into the stretch, but was outrun.

Footnotes
COSMIC SPECULATION set the pace in the two path around the first turn and from the three path down the backstretch, was cued right handed in the two
path passing the quarter pole and opened up around the three path into the stretch, began to shorten stride passing the sixteenth pole, but held on under
left handed encouragement late. ELUSIVE EMPIRE tracked in the four path, was under coaxing into the far turn and ridden along while floating out to the six
path into the lane, and ran on under left handed urging for place. PEOPLE FORCE travelled in the three path around the first turn and stalked in the four
path down the backside, was under rousing in the three path around the far turn and cued left handed into the stretch, but evened out late to finish with
show. MAX SWAGGER chased in the three path, was under right handed urging along the inside around the far turn, tipped out to the four path entering the
stretch, but flattened out. MISTER ABARRIO broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the five path down the backstretch, was
ridden around the far turn and swung out to the seven path into the lane, but failed to bid. LOOKINASSAH raced off the pace around the two path, was cued
right handed in the three path around the far turn, but was no factor from the five path in the stretch. THE KHOZAN ONE bumped with an inner foe leaving
the gate, rated in the three path, shifted to the rail and was under a drive around the far turn, but never threatened from around the three path in the stretch.
TRIPLE START got bumped between foes at the start and always trailed.
