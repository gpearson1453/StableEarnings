Footnotes
SYSTEMIC CHANGE rounded most of the first turn in the two path then moved to the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid under urging
leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path around the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly
prevailed. KAON lost his footing slightly at the start but broke with the field, brushed with a rival into the first turn, dropped from the four path to the two path
around that bend, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat while two path to the inside on the far turn, lost the advantage to the
winner into upper stretch, fought gamely inside of that foe to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. CORTON CHARLEMAGNE was hustled
from the gate, dropped back while crowded and taken up against the rail early on the first turn, saved ground through that bend, was coaxed along towards
the front, chased while moving from the rail to the four path around the final turn, chased the leading duo into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the
show. ALTERNATE REALITY was taken in hand while in tight against the rail early, moved out into the first turn, went two to three wide around that bend,
was urged along on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, moved out some in upper stretch, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and
failed to threaten. CHESS SPECTACULAR bumped with a rival at the start, brushed with another foe into the first turn, dropped from the five path to the
three path early on that bend, fell back awkwardly while disliking the kickback when the pacesetter crossed in front later on that bend then moved to the four
path, was coaxed down the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path and came up empty. RAPPER ZAPPER bumped with an opponent at
the start, dropped in entering the first turn, went three to four wide around most of that bend then moved to the two path, was coaxed at the rear, saved
ground on the far turn and showed little.

Footnotes
CENTRAL PRIDE was bumped at the start, went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while asked on the turn, shook
clear in upper stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and drew off under a strong hand-ride. EIGHT AND SAND bumped
with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and
proved no match while able to hold the place. I CAN SEE THAT bumped twice with a rival after the start then dropped back, went around the turn in the
three path and just missed the place while clear for the show. QUACKENBUSH was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, went around the
turn in the two path and came up empty. RHUM PRESSURE was reluctant to load, bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, pressed then chased
the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. FORWARD CAST broke in and bumped
with a foe, came out and bumped twice with another opponent shortly thereafter, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground around the turn,
angled out in upper stretch, dropped in late and was no factor. THIRTY OYSTERS was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
IMPROPER was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, took one awkward stride leaving the backstretch, advanced through a rail
opening to take the lead with three furlongs to run, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew off under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole then
was eased up while much the best. LEGAL CATCH climbed near the five-eighths, was ridden along on the outside, went four then five wide around the turn,
came six wide into upper stretch and earned the place while no threat to the winner. CLOUD MUSIC bumped hard with a rival at the start, chased the pace
on the outside, dropped back two to three wide around the turn and weakened while clear for the show. MO THAN LUCK contested the pace on the outside,
vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and tired. FATHER OF LIES bumped hard with
a foe at the start, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path around the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and capitulated.
WEALLLIKEDHIM was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, raced off the pace under urging while climbing intermittently, saved ground around
the turn and failed to respond. POOR AND POLITE was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path and trailed.

Footnotes
NECROMANCER settled on the inside, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three then four wide nearing the five-sixteenths then moved to five wide,
rallied six wide into the stretch, closed well while remaining on his inside lead to get the advantage coming to the eighth-pole, swapped to the proper lead
near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. BUILT TO LAST pressed the pace between horses, vied in the three path around the turn,
fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE was hustled to the front, showed the
way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch and weakened while able to hold the show.
JESTER'S SONG was sent hard from the start, established a good position just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, shifted five wide into
the stretch, pursued the leaders in the drive and lacked the needed kick. UPPER LEVEL was restless in the gate then bumped hard at the start, pressed the
pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn and tired. VOLKERT was urged along off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn and
came up empty. MAURITIUS bobbled just after the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three then two wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch
and failed to respond. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY bumped hard with an opponent at the start, raced at the rear while urged along on the outside, went five wide
on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO pressed the pace between foes, chased two then three wide around the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive in the stretch, was guided
in closer to that foe while gaining late and just got up under strong urging to narrowly prevail. ALPINE QUEEN moved up on the outside to stalk the pace,
took the lead late on the backstretch, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths, dropped from the three path to the two path around the turn, came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while hanging desperately to an advantage at the sixteenth-pole and was denied on the
wire but clear for the place. ROYAL MEGHAN settled off the pace, was urged while saving ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SHASTA STAR was urged along off the pace, went two then
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TRIPLE P leaned out and brushed the gate while last to commence, settled on the
outside, was urged four wide around the turn and was no factor. CHLOE ROSE set the pace under pressure, lost the lead late on the backstretch, dropped
back inside around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
SIMPLY settled off the pace, moved in near the three-quarter pole, was urged along in the two path around the turn, came out while rallying into upper
stretch, closed strongly to get a short lead at the eighth-pole, fought with the runner-up while inside that foe in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under
strong urging. MASON MANIA settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, rallied five wide into the
stretch, closed well to make a bid at the eighth-pole, battled outside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. GOLDEN
CODE showed early speed on the inside of a foe, moved out entering the main-track then stalked on the outside, made a bid outside of the leader at the
five-eighths, took a short lead near the half-mile pole, vied in the two path around the turn, was headed in the three path into the stretch, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and weakened but held for a share of the show. SAFALOW'S MISSION moved out early, raced up close to the pace, made a bid
late on the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired but also
shared the show. SON OF AN EX showed no speed, raced well back in the field, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. FOREVER WICKED lacked early speed, went five to six wide around the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.
DATESFREEDOM settled of the pace, was urged four then five wide around the turn and failed to respond. MAJESTIC TIGER was forwardly placed on the
outside, came under urging in the four path around the turn and had nothing left. BOBBY BO angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, lost the lead near the half-mile pole, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SUPER QUALITY went straight to the front, opened up a sizable advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was let out some late on that bend, had
the rider remain motionless in the saddle during the stretch drive and won handily. VIVE BIEN broke a half-step slow, was urged along while well behind the
winner, saved ground on the turn and earned the place. STAR ATTITUDE was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn and
missed the place while clear for the show. RAW COURAGE was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, settled off the pace, moved from the two
path to the five path under urging around the turn and failed to threaten. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the
turn and failed to threaten. MISBEHAVED was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced on the outside under urging, moved in leaving the
backstretch, went three then two wide around the turn and was no factor. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE was coaxed along off the pace, dropped well behind while
inside early on the turn, floated out to the five path late on that bend and faltered. THE COBBLER stumbled badly at the start and unseated the rider.
