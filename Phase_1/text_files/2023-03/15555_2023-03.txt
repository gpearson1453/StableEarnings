Footnotes
SHAQ'S MY DADDY was crowded between rivals racing onto the main track and settled back, rallied four and five wide through the turn into the lane and
closed with a good late run to rally clear. BUG ZAPPER broke sharply and dueled on the lead between rivals through the turn into the stretch but could not
handle the winner's late run. JACKIE MOON dueled three deep outside rivals and had little left for the drive. FIFTY TWO PICKUP drifted in coming onto the
main track to put the winner in a bit tight, dueled inside rivals to upper stretch, weakened then suffered an injury pulling up and was vanned off. HALO'S
LADDIE angled four wide into the lane but had no rally. REAL CRAFTY PIE trailed.

continued on to gain the place. SEGOVIANA was four wide in the turn, moved up in the lane and gained the show late. FASHION FACT steadied between
rivals into the turn then lacked a rally three wide. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL chased the winner three wide and weakened. MILLI STARR was not a factor four to

Footnotes
CELTICS WILDCAT was just off the early leaders, angled out nearing the lane and rallied five wide then closed with a good late run. READY TO GET
LOUD prompted the pace three to four wide outside a pair of rivals, continued willingly through the lane but was caught on the wire while just up second.
RACHIE RACH was on the lead inside rivals while off the rail, held well but was outfinished late. LOTS OF GOLD bumped with a rival at the start, contested
the early lead between rivals and weakened. I CINC EYE LUV U was bumped and shuffled back at the break, saved ground and had no rally. RABBIT
TWENTY TWO was not a factor three wide.

AMBASSADOR MIKE stalked the early leaders out from the rail, moved three wide to challenge through the far turn, dueled outside R VOO'S TABOO
through the lane and was narrowly up. R VOO'S TABOO dueled on the early lead inside LEVEL, was challenged by the winner into the lane, dug in and just
failed to hold that one safe. LEVEL rushed up three wide to join R VOO'S TABOO on the lead, dueled outside that one to the far turn and came up empty
nearing the lane. RING TAILED TOOTER failed to mount a rally three to four wide. CORTE was not a threat. DOMERGOO leaned into the side of the gate
and came away last then trailed.

Footnotes
JUDGE'S BRIBE challenged three wide to bid and move clear going to the far turn then held through the lane under steady handling. LITTLE
BITOTHUNDER was four and five wide through the first turn, moved nearest the winner into the far turn then could not close the gap through the lane. SING
CHARMER SING moved up inside and gained the show through the lane while no threat to the top pair. B T'S BAD BOY showed the most speed to gain a
clear lead about the two or three path but was headed nearing the far turn and weakened. PAISANO JIM failed to mount a bid three to four wide. J TRAIN
was caught in tight between rivals nearing the far turn and dropped back then weakened from four wide into the lane. PETE AND REPETE trailed.

Footnotes
NASTY EXAGGERATOR showed speed outside FALCON HEAVY to dispute the early lead, settled back through the second turn to stalk, rallied four wide
in the final turn to bid into the lane and edged away late. FAKE SOLUTION stalked off the rail, bid between rivals through the second turn then could not
handle the winner into the lane. FALCON HEAVY was on the early lead out from the rail, contended through the far turn but came up empty in the drive.
HOLIDAY JOKE stalked the pace three and four wide but weakened nearing the lane. PODEROSO EQUS moved up two to three wide while not a threat.
YHA YHA saved ground and weakened. TOMBI failed to mount a bid three to four wide. RUN FOR MATTY was always back, gave way and was eased
under the wire.
