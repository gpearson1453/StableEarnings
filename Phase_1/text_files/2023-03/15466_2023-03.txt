JUMPMASTER was well rated early, made a four wide sweep on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn and
remained clear to prove best under a confident hand ride. STRIKING MOON was off slowly, made a inside move on the turn and finished willingly but could
not get to the winner while clearly second best, good effort. SPIKES SHIRL vied for the lead on the inside and then shifted out to engage with the winner but
faded the final furlong, held show award. FEDERAL CASE vied for the lead in between rivals, dropped back leaving the turn and shifted out and weakened.
FIELDER pressed the pace four to three wide and was in between rivals leaving the five sixteenths and stopped.

JUMP FOR THE WIN stalked the early pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then edged clear by the sixteenth marker
and then held off ORASHI late to prove best, driving. ORASHI was rated along early, made a three wide move on the turn to loom boldly, then came four
wide into the lane and was slowly gaining late. KAZ MUNNINGS set a pressured pace on the inside and then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn,
then faded late after a long drive. SKIMBLE SHANKS tracked the pace on the inside, then was two wide on the turn while being ridden along but lacked the
needed stretch bid. COMBATING failed to menace. RISEN SAVIOR pressed the pace two wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BARISTA VIXEN stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid when ready on the turn to draw clear, then drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to
prove much the best. CUENCA sent to the front to set a fast pace early, headed on the turn, then dug in gamely to hold on to the place award. CAR LADY
was void of early speed, advanced on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and had a belated rally to just miss the place award. EARLY FROST
tracked the pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn and weakened. PSYCHE chased the pace and advanced two wide on the backstretch and then
weakened. TERPEYE was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had no rally. FAVORITE DOLL was settled early, inside on the backstretch and
tired.

ROCKIN COWBOY prompted the pace two wide, made a three wide bid off the turn and after a long drive edged clear late to prove best under a drive.
WOLFINBARGER set the pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the drive but could not hold off the winner late, second best. TRUE GOLD tracked the pace
on the inside, fell back on the turn and then finished willingly late to best the rest. FUTILE was reserved early, advanced on the turn and angled out five wide
leaving the turn and had a belated rally on the outside. AGAINST THE ODDS chased the pace three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole and
weakened. E T'S CANDY MAN hesitated at the start, then seemed to dislike the footing and was far back early and then was eased, walked off.
