and drew even, dueled until late stretch and was outfinished late. RAGTIME DOLLY had good position on the inside, had to steady in late stretch because
of the loose horse and went evenly. GO STELLAIRE allowed to settle, failed to menace. PRESCIENCE stumbled badly at the start and lost her rider and

INDY CARR had good position early, rallied on the far turn and gained the lead, drew off in the stretch under steady handling. DANES HEART set the pace
until the far turn, could not match strides late with the winner but held place. NOSEY POWER raced mid pack early, angled in stretch, finished willingly and
was best of the rest. TRANSPIRED raced close up until the stretch, then weakened. BIG TIME FLIRT contended for three quarters, then gave way. MY
TICKET hopped at the start, raced mid pack, lugged in stretch causing MUSIC GEM to check, then went evenly. MUSIC GEM was unhurried early, checked
in the stretch on the rail and was no menace. PEDAL TO DA KETTLE was outrun. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and after viewing the tape
disqualified MY TICKET and placed him seventh
