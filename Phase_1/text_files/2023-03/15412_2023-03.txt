Footnotes
RESTLESS RAMBLER vied three wide in a contested pace, continued wide on the turn, dueled with rival in the lane and proved best to edge away late.
POTENTE ALBA vied between rivals in a contested pace, continued pressing the issue on the turn, dueled with outside rival in the lane and came up short
in a game effort. EPIC DRAMA stalked pace early on the backstretch, ran up on heels entering the turn, settled back down early on the turn, altered in upper
stretch and rallied to get up for third. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA vied for lead in between rivals on the backstretch, went to rail entering the turn, failed to keep
up late in the turn, and kept on in the lane to hold fourth. COJO stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered turn
widest and lacked a rally. MALAKAI MOXIE asked for speed and pressed pace along the inside, failed to adequately hold the rail and shuffled back entering
the turn, waited for room behind weakening rival, angled in upper stretch and flattened when asked. ABOVE THE LAW off slow and lost path at the start,
settled off the pace along the rail and never threatened.
