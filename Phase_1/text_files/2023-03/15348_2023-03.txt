the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung outside near the eighth pole and closed nicely. BILLYKUS stumbled then bumped with RASCALLY
REBEL leaving the starting gate, steadied behind horses entering the turn, moved to the three path leaving the bend, advanced to mid stretch then
weakened. IMAGINE A CURE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn drifted in approaching the eighth pole and weakened. DREAMS DELIVERED ,
foiur wide on the turn, gave way approaching the stretch. BARB'S PRIDE chased the pace to the stretch, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
MUSICMANSANDY rated kindly three wide while stalking the early pace, bid three deep in hand leaving the far turn, vied outside foes under confident
handling heading to the quarter pole, responded when roused in upper stretch and spurted clear, kept on under some right handed asks leaving mid stretch
and widened while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. ICE CUBE BABY rated between rivals into the turn, angled four wide with some momentum into
the stretch, straightened and kept on grinding to nab the place. MYSTIC SEAPORT prompted the pace two wide outside LADY SERENITY, gained a slim
lead between runners leaving the far turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of the winner entering the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded late. COAL
MINE was rated back from between runners soon after the break, lost ground four to five wide pursuing the leaders but came up empty. MAJESTY'S
FREEDOM saved ground while in range early, was lightly shuffled back nearing the three eighths, regrouped and remained inside but failed to make any
headway. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES , between rivals early, raced three deep exiting the far turn, was under pressure past the five sixteenths but lacked a
response. LADY SERENITY sped to the early lead, secured the rail, was joined nearing the three furlong pole, sparred to mid turn, shifted out once unable
to keep pace and weakened.

HOLY DELITE , forced out by TIPSY TOURIST leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail around the turn and
pulled away through the stretch with something in reserve. DESPITE THE GIN shuffled back leaving the starting gate, checked in tight quarters leaving the
backstretch, steadied lacking room entering the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. COFFEE BEAN raced forwardly in the two path on
the turn and finished willingly inside rivals. M'LADY THATCHER stumbled leaving the starting gate, was three deep mid way on the turn, angled to the inner
rail approaching the eighth pole and passed tired horses. TIPSY TOURIST bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace three wide around the turn
and gave way. HELLO JAMROCK rushed up along the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung outside at the head of the stretch and weakened while on her
left lead. BOSSTONIAN , outrun, was eased late.

Footnotes
MY JUBA sped clear soon after the break, was joined from her inside heading to the half mile marker, sparred around the turn while under some rating,
secured command nearing mid stretch and drew clear under a drive. DULCE KIARA advanced to the inside of the winner and got locked up in a pace battle,
carried that scrum past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. VOLNAY , perched three wide off the dueling leaders, was under pressure
from the head of the lane but lacked a serious finish. FLAVA'S DREAM pulled her way forward while saving ground early on, came under a solid ride mid
turn, swung out but lacked a rally. DIVINE FASHION broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and raced off the pace while four wide, remained well
wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MISS CASEY broke a step slow then was bumped and stumbled, edged up between runners past the five
eighths to stalk, chased three wide mid turn and faded. CAPTIVATING GAL , three wide, dropped back early. DUE TO AN ORDER OF FINISH POSTED
SHOWING INCORRECT WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE SUPER AND SUPER HIGH FIVE WAGERS, THOSE PAYOFFS WERE HONORED.

Footnotes
SIR SMOAK lightly bumped with FLOOR IT at the start, gained the lead between horses leaving the backstretch, raced slightly off the rail, remained on his
left lead in the stretch and held sway under some urging. GENERAL J R lacked speed, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied.
THAT'S MY BUSINESS , a forward factor outside the winner, chased that one throughout in a willing effort. HAY CHIEF broke sluggishly, moved up down
the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, moved five deep turning for home and faded late. MOON SIGN chased the pace between horses
around the turn and through the stretch before fading in the drive. RECKLESS AFFAIR saved ground around the turn, chased the pace to the mid stretch
and gave way. FLOOR IT lightly bumped with the winner at the start, circled the turn four wide, floated to the six path at the head of the stretch and
weakened. WILDERZAR pulled up on the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN settled well back early while saving ground off the free running leader, edged up and angled out into the far turn, moved boldly four wide and
under confident handling past the five sixteenths, forged to command into the lane, kicked away soon after and eagerly widened under a steady drive.
WALK AWAY JOE , unhurried early while saving ground, worked outward leaving the far turn and followed the winner, chased four to five wide into the lane
and churned on to gain the place. PLAMEN , three deep early, took closer order under coaxing leaving the three eighths, could not match strides with the
winner to his outside entering the lane, kept on past mid stretch then flattened out late. UP AGAINST IT , between rivals early, chased two wide, gained past
the three eighths, shifted four wide but came up empty. CAN'T PASS IT UP lagged back, was under a ride two wide into the far turn, angled out
approaching the quarter pole but failed to sustain. SOUPER CATCH saved ground with pursuit, eased out mid way on the final turn, gained some into the
stretch then faded through the drive. GHOSTLIGHTER , four wide early, dropped in and lagged back through the backstretch run then failed to respond.
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , three wide, dropped back through the backstretch run and came up empty. YES SIR ROBERT was sent up between rivals early
then cleared, opened up when a bit keen and set a brisk pace towards the rail, offered little resistance nearing the lane and faltered. ACE NINE NINE saved
ground chasing the loose leader and faltered leaving the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep pace on the far turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, closed
determinedly and was up at the wire. FRIGHTLAND stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced outside DOLICE VITA near the five sixteenths pole,
opened up in mid stretch, switched to his left lead inside the sixteenth pole and just missed. DOLICE VITA showed speed, opened a clear lead leaving the
backstretch, lost the advantage approaching the stretch, swung outside in upper stretch, closed outside the top pair and twice switched leads late. MR
JEFFERSON saved ground on both turns, failed to menace. MAILMAN'S A FLYER , along the inner rail down the backstretch, around the far turn and in the
stretch, was outrun. ROYAL NUMBER advanced three wide to reach contention leaving the far turn then weakened. BADGER TOOTH , outrun, swung wide
in upper stretch. REMEMBERING WILBUR lost ground on the turns and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FUHGEDDABOUDIT settled nicely four wide outside rivals while not far back, was coaxed along past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit wider into the lane,
leveled off when put to left handed asks in mid stretch, closed determinedly and forged ahead in the final strides. BENEATH THE STARS set a pressured
pace towards the rail and under rating, moved clear mid turn, was guided two wide while still in hand into the stretch, came under pressure in mid stretch,
kept on gamely when hooked from both sides but just wasn't quite good enough. GOLDEN EFFECT , three wide early, exchanged a bump near the half
mile marker, chased between foes mid turn, dropped in under strong handling to advance in mid stretch, kept grinding along the rail and continued well to
the wire. BANDITS WARRIOR forced the pace outside BENEATH THE STAR, saw that one get away near the five sixteenths, came three wide with pursuit
into the lane, stayed on past the sixteenth marker then faded. SPICY MARGARITA , four wide early, bumped with GOLDEN EFFECT nearing the turn,
chased three wide around the turn but came up empty. BOURBON WILDCAT saved ground and moved up into the turn, was shuffled back out of a tight
spot near the three eighths, dropped back and went evenly in the drive. HOPE HAS A NAME , bumped at the break, regrouped and raced off the pace
behind rivals, dropped back leaving the far turn, shifted out and gave way.

Footnotes
MRS. DEL stalked the pace under confident handling three deep around the turn, bid for the lead near the quarter pole, was floated out in upper stretch and
prevailed in an extended drive. MS. MALEVOLENCE showed speed along the inner rail, battled around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted out late
and just missed in a game effort. SPECIAL FREEDOM , three wide on the turn, was taken to the inner rail in upper stretch and rallied mildly. MEBS WEB
disputed the pace racing in the two path between horses, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. NOTION INTERRUPTUS lacked
speed, raced in the two path on the turn and failed to be a factor. MISS MORENO raced along the inner rail on the turn and gave way through the stretch.
