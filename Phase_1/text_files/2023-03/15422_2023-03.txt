Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG quick from gate to the front, well handed throughout and held sway to wire. NANA'S GRAY secured good position to the turn, rallied
along late but not enough to get past at the wire. NARROWS BRIDGE never far back in good position outside, closed the gap in the late going for show
spot. POQUITO ROSE reared at the start, far back to the turn, came widest into the stretch and improved position late. SHANNON'S GIRL no speed to the
stretch, closed the gap late while no real threat. ABOUNDING rowdy coming on track, off rail run to stretch angled in with no gain. ANOTATION just off
leader to the turn, could not keep up and faded in stretch readily. ANCIENT BROWN had a slow start and never menaced. MY ROSIE through early from
outside and dropped back readily.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SONG good speed to chased pace to the stretch, rallied in earnest in the final sixteenth to get the nod. MALIBU TIME unhurried to turn, rallied
wide into stretch but just missed. UNCLE EARL quick to the front from inside, led to the stretch while all out and saved the show spot. CROSSTOWN
SHOOTOUT raced back early, in tight and lost position turn, re-rallied up rail while coming on too late. THE BOSS FACTOR outside run to quarter pole
could not sustain the bid and folded in the stretch run. TOSS OF FATE dropped back quickly, outside run into stretch and closed the gap mildly in the final
furlong FULCO close to rail in good position to the half with noting left for the drive. SUGGESTED inside chase to turn but gave way readily and dropped far
back.
