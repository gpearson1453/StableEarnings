Footnotes
FINNLEY'S KITTEN asked to show early speed and dictated terms into the first turn, was well rated while setting a pressured pace to the far turn, shook
free nearing the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch and remained clear to the finish to prove best. KITTEN CALLS allowed to settle in the
early stages, advanced heading to the far turn, came in tight while two wide approaching the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch, closed in the final
furlong, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and secured the place. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE took back off of the moderate early pace, improved
position nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground while in range nearing the top of the stretch, chased FINNLEY'S KITTEN to the furlong marker, was
outkicked for the place spot and held safely in the end for the show. OAT MILK LATTE tracked the moderate early pace, was well positioned through the
backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. PEACEHAVEN chased the moderate
early fractions, raced three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late response. BIG JOLT was allowed to settle, made a four wide bid on the far turn,
could not sustain that run in the stretch and did not threaten. CRY ME A RUNNER was forwardly placed into the first turn, engaged with FINNLEY'S KITTEN
and contested the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, stayed within range of that rival on the far turn, could not keep pace in the stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, had the margin cut
into nearing the half-mile pole, shook free on the far turn, extended the lead approaching the furlong grounds and was ridden out in the final stages as much
the best. SIPPIN N KISSIN took back off of the moderate fractions, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, chased the pacesetter while four wide
on the second turn, was no match for ANITANEWMERCEDES in the stretch drive and was second best. UNION GIG tracked the moderate early pace,
raced three wide between rivals into the far turn, could not keep pace with the top two in the stretch run and just held for the show in deep stretch.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP rated off of the early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, advanced to come within aim nearing the half-mile marker,
lost position on the far turn and did not offer a late rally. HANS GRUBER paused at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages,
advanced along the backstretch run, continued that gain along the far turn while two wide, could not sustain that bid in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GABBY HAYES was forwardly placed in the early going then pressed DIAMOND RANGER to the turn, kept close attendance to that foe to the quarter
marker, headed DIAMOND RANGER in upper stretch, battled to deep stretch while outside of the runner-up and wore that one down to prevail in the final
strides. DIAMOND RANGER assumed command in the early stages, set decent early fractions while pressed to the turn, kept a narrow advantage to the
quarter marker, was headed by GABBY HAYES in upper stretch, battled with that foe at bay to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while
holding for the place. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased the decent early pace, saved ground along the turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, ran evenly to
the furlong marker, encountered traffic nearing the sixteenth-marker, made a late surge and just missed for the place, while securing the show. MY
DOMINATOR unhurried in the early going, improved position while four wide on the turn, rallied in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and was
outfinished for the show. SINGLE ME OUT raced close to the decent early pace, lost position while two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the stretch,
was shuffled back while in tight quarters at the furlong marker and lacked the needed late response. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE chased the decent early
pace, lost ground while two wide on the turn, swung five wide for the stretch run and finished evenly in the final furlong. HOLIDAY HUSTLE broke alertly and
contested the early pace, took back and chased the decent fractions and raced three wide on the turn, swung widest and came six wide into the stretch and
could not muster a late rally.

Footnotes
CODE DUELLO showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early stages, raced to a clear lead heading to the turn, set decent fractions to the
quarter marker, maintained a clear advantage to mid-stretch and kept to task in the final stages. UNRAPTURED chased the decent early pace, improved
position while saving ground on the turn, swung two wide into the stretch, could not make headway on CODE DUELLO in the drive and just held for the
place. RAGER chased the decent early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, made a mild late gain but was
outfinished in the final furlong and just missed for the place. C'MON MAN allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker,
advanced in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD chased the decent early fractions, raced outside of rivals on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
LADY GREGORY chased the decent early pace from the inside, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide in upper stretch, was
full of run nearing the furlong grounds, split rivals inside of the eighth pole and drove clear in the final stages. ZAFFERANA rated off of the early pace while
not far back, advanced while two wide on the turn, was not able to reel in the winner in the late stages but made a steady bid in the stretch and was up for
the place in a blanket finish for the minor awards. BIG STRIKE was sent to establish the early lead and set decent fractions while pressured to the turn, held
a narrow advantage to the quarter marker, was not able to keep pace with LADY GREGORY inside of the furlong marker, Espinoza lost his crop in deep
stretch and was just edged for the place, while just holding for the show. HANNAH IN A HURRY bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered
to chase the early pace from the second flight, raced three wide to the quarter marker, gained ground in mid-stretch, steadied behind a weakening rival
inside of the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. A PERFECT PATH showed early speed and pressed
the decent pace to the quarter marker, battled with BIG STRIKE to mid-stretch, could not match strides with LADY GREGORY in the final stages and gave
way. AUNT NOREEN chased from the rear in the early going, saved ground to the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and lacked a late
response. TIGERIZE was fractious prior to the start, was unprepared at the break and was away slowly, trailed to the quarter marker and did not factor.
SNIP broke alertly, stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) broke alertly, took back off of the modest early fractions and stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, stayed well within
range of KIWI'S DREAM to the quarter marker, was roused in upper stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and
held on in deep stretch over the oncoming runner-up. OUR SILVER OAK lost his path at the start and was off a bit slowly, was a bit rank in the early stages
while unhurried, settled along the backstretch run, saved ground on the second turn, lacked room in upper stretch, rallied through traffic inside of the furlong
pole, closed fast in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and was up for the place. I'M DR. O broke out at the start and bothered OUR
SILVER OAK, recovered nicely and chased the moderate fractions from the second flight through the backstretch run, raced two wide to the quarter marker,
mounted a three wide bid into the drive, came within aim at mid-stretch, could not make further headway in the late stages but stayed on to earn the nod for
the show. MEMO DADDY (CHI) was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, maintained position through
the backstretch run, raced four wide into the stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for the show. NOLDE was away in good order, rated off of the
modest early pace, was well placed into the far turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced to come within range at mid-stretch and was outkicked
in the final furlong. LOVE CANDY tracked the modest early pace, raced three wide into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late
rally. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) was sent to dictate terms in the early stages, carved out modest fractions to the far turn, came under pressure from BLACK
CASPIAN in upper stretch, met that bid to the furlong marker and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
DR LOW KEY was sent leaving the break, engaged with BOLD TALKER in the early stages and dueled through solid fractions to the quarter marker,
disposed of that rival in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds and kept to task in deep stretch while remaining clear to the wire.
SGT POWELL chased the from the second flight, raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, closed in the final furlong and bested
the rest. GATO NEGRO lacked early speed, raced three wide while trailing into the turn, improved position in upper stretch, rallied in the late stages and
held safely in the end for the show. BRONZE ONE was shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, rushed up to chase the solid pace to the turn, ran two
wide to the quarter marker, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, could not sustain that run and weakened in the final stages. ONE BIG SMILE chased
the solid early pace, raced four wide on the turn, was carried five wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. WEE BEASTIE was
forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the solid fractions from a two wide path to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, could not keep
pace in mid-stretch and gave way late. RACER REX chased the early fractions from the inside, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.
COLONEL VARGO chased from the second flight in the early going, raced four wide into the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. VESTMENT chased
the fast early pace while outside of rivals, raced five wide to the quarter marker and was not a factor. BOLD TALKER broke alertly and showed good early
speed, dueled with DR LOW KEY through solid fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with that rival heading to mid-stretch and faltered in the
final stages.

Footnotes
WORK TO LIVE hustled from the gate then taken in hand when clear, relaxed nicely down the backstretch and was allowed to set uncontested moderate
fractions, responded when challenged by SEEMS LOGICAL at the five-sixteenths pole, held that one at bay through the stretch and was pulling away
slightly at the wire. SEEMS LOGICAL was forwardly placed from the break without being asked, settled a couple of lengths behind the pacesetting WORK
TO LIVE to the far turn, mounted a serious challenge for the lead on the turn, was rebuffed but chased that rival with some determination through the length
of the stretch while unable to get past. MOMMA MOCCA was last away but saved ground throughout, swung five wide out of the final turn and rallied on well
down the stretch to gain third. VRONSKY FEINT got good position into the clubhouse turn, was hard held to the half-mile pole, allowed to run through the far
turn but had to wait for room to the stretch, made up some ground running on the rail then swung out inside the sixteenth pole but came up short.
AGREETODISAGREE off a beat slow, had to steady briefly when unable to get good position before the first turn, raced mid-pack through the early stages
then advanced on the leaders to the far turn, was boxed in through most of the turn and the turn for home, finally got some room approaching the last
furlong and finished with some interest under heavy pressure late. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) broke in at the start bumping with MISS MAIA to the inside,
keen to run from the break but was taken in hand through the first turn, raced up close and three wide through both turns, loomed a threat near the top of
the stretch but tired in the final furlong. LADY'S SERMON broke out a the start then was set after the early lead, was caught wide around the first turn,
remained wide on the backstretch run and through the far turn, came under a ride passing the three-eighths pole a was never a threat. MISS MAIA broke
out and mutually bumped with NAUGHTY NADINE then lacked any speed, was a bit rank going into the first turn when the rider asked for more speed,
remained near the rear of the field to the far turn, got boxed in near the quarter pole while attempting a rally then was unable to improve position down the
stretch.

JUST A LITTLE LUCK broke alertly and showed good early speed, set pressured fractions to the turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, drew to a
clear lead heading to mid-stretch and drew away in the late stages as much the best. ROSE OF MOONCOIN chased the solid early pace, saved ground
along the turn, made a mild advance nearing the furlong marker, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages and just held for the place. PRINCESA
DEL TIGRE chased from the second flight, raced three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final furlong and just missed for the place
while holding safely for the show. MAGIC CHROME chased the fast early pace from the second flight, was steered five wide on the turn, was held up for a
few strides leaving the turn and was gaining in the stretch drive. JERSEY SUNSET was forwardly placed in the early stages, lost ground while four deep on
the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and offered a mild late bid. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA pressed the quick early pace, lost position on the turn, chased the
top pair to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. GIANT KID was away slowly, lacked early speed, raced three wide on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and did not factor. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS lacked early speed, raced two wide on the turn and did not threaten. BULLETPROOF TOO chased
the fast early pace, lost ground while four wide on the turn and was outrun in the stretch. TUDOR'S FOREST was prominent in the early stages, showed
speed while close to the pace along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered in the drive. BARBERA was away slowly, lacked early speed, lost
position nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late response. SERIOUS SECRET lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up to chase
the fast pace from the inside, could not keep pace heading into the stretch and tired in the drive.
