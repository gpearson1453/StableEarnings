Footnotes
WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE broke back, moved closer along the inside late backstretch, patiently handled through the bend, came in the two path for the
drive, set down in upper stretch, kicked down the clear leader to be up in time while outside that one. MEGAN'S CLARA broke alertly, narrowly set the pace
up the backstretch just off the inside, angled to the fence early in the turn, disposed of the other speed to be clear nearing the furlong grounds, could not
contain the winner. TWIRLING TIGRESS pressed the runner up from the outside for a half, could not keep up with that one through the stretch nor contain
the runner up, saved the show. FROSTED DIAMOND last away, raced back off the pace three wide, lacked a closing response. BIG JAVA trailed, in some
traffic into the turn, trailed in coming up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
BIDOFHONEY broke alertly, set the early pace in hand, drew clear through the turn while still under light restraint, drew off through the stretch to win ridden
out. DESTINY'S DREAM in mid pack while racing inside, continued to save ground, staged a rally up the rail to annex the place late, no threat to the winner.
ROWDY DAISY lacked early foot, three to four wide out of the turn, closest to the winner late, also proved no match for that one late, outfinished for the
second spot. TENZING closest to the winner outside, three wide turn, continued to chase that same foe past the furlong marker, had little left late to lose the
place. I GOT A NAME in the second flight for a half inside, had nothing for the drive. COURT COSTS broke back, lacked speed, came three wide for the
stretch run, lacked a closing kick. SWEET BABY KATE fell back to trail after the start, finished far back to be always outrun.

Footnotes
JAY VEE BEE in mid pack through the first turn while off the inside, moved closer three wide into the second bend, took over midway on that turn, shook
well clear through upper stretch, enough left to comfortably hold the runner up safe late. CABALLO FELIZ bobbled at the break, settled in the second flight
toward inside, traffic into the second turn, steered out, three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late. MR CREED lacked early foot, steered out
and advanced while fanned five wide into the lane, improved upper stretch to race closest to the winner past the furlong marker, could not contain the runner
up late, far clear of the others. MAJOR CONTENDER dueled up front closest to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged
three furlongs out, continued to weaken down the stretch. KISS PRINCIPAL off slowly, lacked speed in trailing early, continued to lag through the final bend,
angled five wide into the lane, improved position to the wire when passing tiring rivals, no real threat. PAID IN FULL broke alertly, alternated up front in the
two path, gave way final bend. GET THROUGH settled off the pace when inside early, slightly closer when four wide and between horses exiting the final
turn, backed up through the lane. LIARS CLUB forwardly placed while racing outside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SIR unhurried early outside, closer far turn, got out a bit to be four wide when moving to challenge turning for home, engaged the leader soon after, wore
that one down under firm handling. GOLDEN BANDIT took over into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
final turn, responded when challenged into the stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. BEN DREAMING broke with the leaders, pressed
the leader off the inside, moved closer and lodged a brief and mild bid turning for home, could not keep up with the top two to the wire, remained clear of the
others. BRIARTOWN settled off the pace in the two path, closer in some traffic late in the final turn, altered course to the inside when straightened for home,
finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. TEXAS TED in the second flight while off the rail, three wide through the final turn, went one paced through
the stretch to also come up empty. BREAD WINNER off a step slow, remained back while racing three to four wide. HALLOW POINT forwardly placed early
along the inside, began a steady retreat after a half.

Footnotes
RUM 'N TONIC broke on top, raced with the pace between foes, fell back off the leader through the turn, reengaged that one from the outside with less than
a furlong remaining and wore that same rival down late under brisk handling. STREET ART moved up inside to contest the issue early, put a head in front
before a quarter, garnered a larger advantage through the turn, briefly clear approaching the furlong marker, responded when the winner challenged soon
after, gave ground grudgingly to that one late. KOSELIO in the back flight off the inside, dropped inside late in the turn, rallied to be closest to the top two
midstretch, no gain on that pair late, clear of the others. COLE SPUR broke out, was straightened to race behind the leaders outside, three wide through the
turn, proceeded evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. DIALED A DAME off a step slow, raced well back for a half, improved position by
picking off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SALTA with the early pace while racing three wide, weakened. AMERICAN SMOOTH in mid
pack and inside, continued to save ground turn, briefly in some traffic late in the bend, nothing for drive. TOUCH CODE tired while racing four wide through
the turn.

Footnotes
STUCK N SNOW last to leave, void of speed toward the inside, circled four to five wide into contention exiting the turn, outside bid past the furlong marker,
going away late while being kept to task with a left handed crop. PEARCY ROAD in the second flight early off the inside, advanced and challenged three
wide and between foes turning for home, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. CHALECO in the second group outside the runner up,
moved with that one to challenge turning into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker, also had little for the winner late, outkicked for the runner up position.
TABLE MONEY moved closer early off the inside, remained in the two path and behind horses turn, in traffic late in that bend, moved out a bit and improved
position slightly with some mild late interest. EV'S SHERMAN away in good order, pressured the leader from the outside for a half and began to tire. FOUR
DICE broke back, void of early speed, dropped inside turn, improved slightly through the lane without posing a serious threat. ARKANSAS ZONG broke
alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, headed late in the turn, gave way through the lane. CADILLAC COWBOY broke through the gate prior to
the start, broke in good order, raced forwardly along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. MONEYSTRIKE was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
GOOD PENNY allowed the leader to go early, pressed that one in the run up the backstretch, advanced and put a head in front midway on the final bend,
steadily drew out through the lane under a left handed crop. UNDECODED off a bit slow, trailed in the two path, steered out to be three wide for the drive,
rallied upper to be closest to the winner with a furlong to run, could do little with that one the final furlong, held sway for the place late. BIG BAD DIVA in the
second flight early inside, fell back through the final turn to trail into the lane, staged a mild rally to be gaining for the runner up position late. GIANNA'S GIFT
broke alertly, cleared to the inside entering the first turn, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch while continuing outside, began to weaken when
headed by the winner midway on the final bend, continued to tire through the lane. IPSUM GRATUS settled to race within striking distance while off the
inside, had little for the drive. RIGHT TRAPPE off the early pace, moved closer in the three path midway on the final turn, flattened out into the lane and also
had little for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
SKYPED dueled up front in the two path, salted away the other speed nearing the furlong grounds, held the next two at bay late under steady handling.
SHAKE UP within striking distance while well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, closest a furlong out, no late gain. TIME ANDBEYOND
in the second flight early while four wide up the backstretch and into the turn, moved with the runner up toward the front inside late one late in the turn, also
managed little gain on the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. DEBATER moved up inside to duel with the winner soon after the start, continued on
equal terms with that one through the bend then began to weaken. KISSOFTHENILE lacked early foot off the inside, three to four wide out of the turn,
flattened in the final furlong to finish yup evenly. RUDIANO last to leave, made little impact in remaining back off the inside. FLASHY LOVER fell back off the
early pace, dropped inside late turn, railed to rally. PEPPERONIKID tired after racing five wide through the turn.

Footnotes
ALWAYS ANGELS in the second flight while in the two path, continued behind the pace turn, roused for the drive, collared the leader from the inside with
less than a furlong remaining and drove well clear. RING TWICE broke out to help tighten up YOLANDO WHO, also raced in the second group off the
inside, three wide through the bend, got the jump on the winner into the lane, bid, no match late, determined 2nd. IT TAKES HEART closest to the dueling
leaders early inside, fell back through the turn, came back for the show, not enough for the place. SUNSET PAYNTER devoid of any early foot while off the
inside, three wide into the lane, shifted out widest for the run to the wire, displayed some late energy while remaining well out in the strip, not enough in the
final strides for the place. CRACKALACKING dueled early off the inside, fell back off the leader turn, dropped to the inside late in the bend, went evenly
through the stretch. YOLANDA WHO lacked early foot after pinched back at the start, four wide into the lane when still well back, improved upper stretch
then flattened out a bit in the late going. PROUD MULE dueled early closest to the inside, shook clear in the turn, continued to show the way through early
stretch then caved in late. PIONEER PARADE was finished early while fading four wide late in the turn. SALTWATER GYPSY broke in to help pinch back
YOLANDO WHO, raced in mid pack while well wide, gave way lave, fell after the wire and was vanned off. BIOGENIC BABE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
KEY OF LIFE broke very alertly, cleared early, was given a bit of a breather in the two path midway on the turn, shrugged off her nearest pursuer into the
lane to be clear again, steadily increased that advantage under a single left handed then right handed crop to prove clearly best in a solid effort. SOCIALLY
SELECTIVE broke behind the winner but still in good order, chased that rival up the backstretch, crept a bit closer through the turn, proved no match in the
drive, edged clear second. KLASSY BRIDGETTE within striking distance inside, remained forwardly placed turn while saving ground, asked along into the
lane, little in the way of a response, not enough for the place. TOPSY forwardly placed while four wide into and through the turn, had little for the drive.
IZATIZ last to leave, moved inside, was never a threat. ADDI BUG finished early while off the inside, trailed home.

Footnotes
RYVIT broke well, dueled up front closest to but not on the rail, shook off the other speed to be suddenly clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire
under steady handling. HEY EUGENE behind the dueling leaders outside, three to four wide when advancing turn, came four wide for the drive, lugged in a
furlong out, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. MY UNCLE LEON in mid pack and off the inside, was also four wide out of the turn, lacked
a significant closing response to finish best of the others. SHARP STICK in mid pack and outside, four wide through the turn, staged a minor rally upper
stretch, never dangerous. VIOLENT RIVER broke outward and slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained back for a half while toward the inside,
displayed some belated interest to improve position, never really dangerous. BAD LARRY made little impact while racing toward the inside. HINENI lacked
any early foot outside, four to five wide turning into the lane, failed to rally. MOON CONNECTION remained always back. SWIFT CUSTOM moved up along
the inside soon after the start, raced forwardly early then began to fade before a half. OFFSHORE TITHE in mid pack off the inside for a half, had nothing
for the drive. BOLT FROM HEAVEN broke on top, dueled outside the winner in the three path up the backstretch and through the turn, was tiring when
bothered by a lugging HEY EUGEN past the furlong marker, continued to falter. FOLLOWING A BRIEF STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH MIDSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
