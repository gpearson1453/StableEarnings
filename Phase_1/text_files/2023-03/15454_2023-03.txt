Footnotes
SUSPICIOUS MINDS was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, took command at the top of the stretch then drew off at will
through the final furlongs to win as much the best. NELL'S BELLS never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished second best. I MATTER
trailed for six furlongs then found her best stride late in the six path. HERO'S DAUGHTER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside to the top of
the stretch then weakened. CONDUTTORE stumbled outward bumping the winner at the start, rushed to contention along the inside, was in tight along the
rail entering the clubhouse turn then was through after a half. VOODOOISM failed to menace.

SAY HEY KID unhurried for five and one half furlongs, closed ground determinedly six wide under right handed urging through the stretch and was along in
time. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX close up from the start, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead then couldn't handle the winner. GEH
SCHNELL waited behind the leader along the rail, got through at the top of the stretch, loomed boldly then was outfinished despite a game effort.
GOTSOMEMOJO slow early, found his best stride late four wide. ADANO with the second flight, went evenly five wide through the stretch. KING ANDRES
prompted the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. GET HAMMERED pressed the pace
three wide for a half, matched strides through the far turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then gave way late. THIRSTY ACTOR away alertly, set
the pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs then was used up. A I INITIATIVE was outrun.

Footnotes
CHACO SPIRIT unhurried into the stretch, closed with a rush five wide under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. D'MONEY HONEY trailed
early, closed fast four wide through the stretch to make the lead forty yards from the wire and just missed hanging on. AUGER never far back, rallied three
wide into the stretch, made the lead then was outfinished. MONTAUK COVE prompted the pace three wide while hung in the seven path down the
backstretch, kept pressure until deep stretch two wide then was outfinished. YOU ARE AWESOME battled for the lead two wide while hung out in the six
path down the backstretch, dropped inward entering the turn, matched strides until deep stretch then weakened. GOTTAGETITBACK was no factor. SON
OF DARKNESS contested the lead inside rivals while well off the rail in the five path down the backstretch, dropped to the rail entering the turn, had speed
into the stretch then was used up.
