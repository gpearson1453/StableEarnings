Footnotes
AA TAKE A CHANCE chased the pace from the two path while in a steady drive down the back stretch and into the turn, then rallied in the late stretch and
was up just in time to succeed. RB MUNCHIE lead the way from the gate and down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, was in gamely drive down the
stretch but was out bid by an outer rival and was able to hold the place position. HONEY PROOF tracked the pace while three wide, then menaced on the
turn to close well in the late stretch but it was not enough. PROUD AMERICAN bobbled at the start, then settled back along the inside, was in a steady drive
throughout the turn, angled out four wide to rally in the late stretch but came up empty. FLEETS ACE AA chased the pace from the inside into the turn and
never fired in the stretch. RB BLAIR HOPE tracked the pace between rivals, steadied slightly then kicked up heels before urging down the remainder of the
backstretch and into the turn, was out of momentum and had no final bid in the stretch.

stretch and was able to hold onto the show prize. PHANTOM RIDE stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied
in the late stretch just missing third pace in the end. GUNFLASH settled in the three path down the backstretch, rallied from the four path throughout the far
turn and into the stretch to close well in the end but it wasn't enough. COSMIC SOUL stalked the pace while four wide down the backstretch, was in a hard
drive throughout the far turn then gave way in the stretch. NOISE COMPLAINT stumbled at the start then was unhurried early, made a mild bid on the far
