Footnotes
AFFIRM CHIEF broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, was pressed through decent fractions to the far turn, shook free of
KINDOFBLUEKITTEN in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong marker, widened the lead in deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish.
AFRICAN PRINCE took back off of the decent early fractions, raced two wide into the far turn, swung three wide for the stretch run, could not keep pace
with the winner in the drive and held well in deep stretch to secure the place. TAKE THE TWO TEN tracked the decent early pace, saved ground to the
quarter marker, battled with AFRICAN PRINCE for the place, was outfinished for that position and was well clear for the show. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN broke
out at the start and was off a step slowly, rushed up into the first turn and raced close to the early pace, pressed the decent fractions to the far turn, could
not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the drive. FANTASTIC DREAM unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the far turn, lost contact
approaching the quarter marker and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE asked to show early speed and cleared the field into the first turn, set modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch run,
felt pressure from GOVERNOR ARTHUR nearing the quarter pole, disposed of that rival leaving the far turn, extended the lead heading to mid-stretch and
drew clear in the final stages. GORDY'S BOY stalked the modest early pace, saved ground to the far turn, waited nearing the top of the lane, chased the
winner to mid-stretch, was not able to make headway on AUSPICIOUS STYLE in the late stages and ran on to be second best. TAM'S TIME was a bit slow
leaving the break and was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, settled along the backstretch run and trailed to the far turn
while not far back, was roused four wide into the stretch and rallied late to secure the show. GOVERNOR ARTHUR broke alertly, contested the early pace
with AUSPICIOUS STYLE then ceded the early lead to that rival, attended to the modest pace to the far turn, confronted AUSPICIOUS STYLE nearing the
quarter marker, was turned away in that effort and gave way in the stretch. RUNAWAY KRISTIN raced just off of the modest early pace, came three wide
into the backstretch run, was well positioned into the far turn, was steered three wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
CREATIVE MOTION sent to establish the early advantage, set a pressured pace to the turn, carved out decent fractions to the quarter marker, was set
down in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, shifted to the left lead in the late stages, Roman lost the crop nearing the sixteenth-marker and
kept to task while remaining clear to the wire. STANFORD MISS forwardly placed in the early stages, saved ground along the turn, chased CREATIVE
MOTION to mid-stretch, was no match in deep stretch but stayed on to best the rest. MORO FIRST CLASS chased the decent early pace, gained ground
three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top two late but closed in the final furlong and was clear for the show.
BOSSY PEGASUS broke out a bit at the start and bumped NATALIA but was away in good order, lost the early lead to CREATIVE MOTION and chased
that rival through decent early fractions, advanced while three deep on the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
NATALIA was crowded then bumped by BOSSY PEGASUS and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a
factor. MISSING PENNY disputed the solid early pace while outside of CREATIVE MOTION, stalked the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped back
leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CONQUEST ROCKS rated nicely off of the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, chased MAJESTIC GIG to mid-stretch, wore down that rival
inside of the furlong marker and drew away in the final stages to prove best. MAJESTIC GIG was hustled to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace to
the turn, showed good speed while dueling through decent fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by CONQUEST ROCKS in upper stretch, held
that foe at bay to mid-stretch, relented in the late stages and held safely for the place. THE RIVER MANGITA was away alertly then took back off of the solid
early pace, chased the leaders while three wide on the turn, lost ground nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final stages but lacked the needed late
response and was clear in the end for the show. LUCKY LOCKETT asked to show early speed, pressed the quick opening fractions to the turn, dueled for
the lead with MAJESTIC GIG while outside of that rival to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. NOMI LACKEE
hesitated at the start and was away slowly, spotted the field early on and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EMILY SMILES broke alertly then took back off of the quick early pace, tracked the solid fractions while racing outside of rivals on the turn, was roused three
wide into the stretch, closed the gap on TEN THE SMART WAY inside of the furlong marker, made a final push in deep stretch to get by that rival and held
in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. LILA AT THE BEACH raced close to the fast early pace, slipped to the inside on the turn, waited a bit for racing
room leaving the turn, remained in tight at mid-stretch, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker, rallied in deep stretch and missed for the win, while securing
the place in the final strides. TEN THE SMART WAY was sent to establish the early lead, set the pressured pace to the turn, dueled to the inside of
CRYSTAL PROOF while carving quick fractions to the quarter marker, held a narrow lead to mid-stretch, battled gamely while meeting the bid of EMILY
SMILES in deep stretch but was bested by that rival and was just edged for the place in the final strides. CRYSTAL PROOF showed speed and was
prominent in the early going, pressed the quick pace to the turn, dueled to the outside of TEN THE SMART WAY to the quarter marker, vied for the lead to
mid-stretch, the rider lost his crop at the furlong marker and was outkicked in deep stretch. SWANEE chased from the rear in the early stages, raced three
wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly in the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
TOM'S STYLE broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace, raced four wide to the quarter marker, was roused in upper
stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of OTTER POP in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail in a good
debut. OTTER POP showed good early speed and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn and extended the lead nearing the quarter
marker, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, was confronted in deep stretch by TOM'S STYLE, was all out to hold that one off and was nailed on the line for
the win, while just holding for the place. MISS ACCELERATE was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the solid fractions from a two wide path to
the quarter marker, lost ground to OTTER POP leaving the turn, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, vied between rivals in deep stretch and missed for
the win and place, while clear of the rest for show. UNION STREET CAT hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed, improved position
while saving ground on the turn, made a mild late rally but was unable to impact the top three in the final stages. BLAZIN BAE raced close to the early pace,
lost ground while three wide on the turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. BIKINI NATION allowed to settle while not far
back in the early stages, raced five wide into the turn, slipped to the four path nearing the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch run. FOREVER
LOVELY chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
WELTON was a bit slow into stride in the early stages, advanced while three wide on the turn, raced four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
marker, closed with a rush while on the left lead inside of the furlong pole, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker and was up in the final strides to
prevail in a good debut. RODRIGOKNOWS tracked the solid early pace, lost ground on the turn while racing along the rail, came in tight heading into the
stretch, found room and advanced nearing the furlong marker, encountered traffic again inside of the furlong pole, rallied and split foes inside of the
sixteenth-marker, took the lead from BOB'S BLUE MOON in deep stretch and was nailed on the line for the win, while holding for the place. BOB'S BLUE
MOON rushed up in the early stages and chased the solid pace to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that gain to come
within aim in mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker but could not match strides with the top pair in deep stretch and was just edged
for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. MY BUCKET LIST forwardly placed in the early stages, was a bit hard to place on the turn and tried
to get out while three wide nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong while on the left lead and did not offer a
late response. CURVY CURLS showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, held the lead to
mid-stretch, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in the final stages. ANTHONY'S BEST broke alertly then was outrun in the
early stages, was climbing and a bit green heading to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker and offered a mild late bid. BOOMING BERNARDO
chased the solid early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground and lacked a late rally.

MOTHER'S PRAYER broke alertly then took back to stalk the decent early pace, kept attendance to TRINIDAD through the backstretch run, lost a bit of
ground to that rival on the second turn, was asked for run at the top of the lane, overtook the pacesetter inside of the furlong pole, kept to task while on the
left lead in deep stretch and held in a drive at the end. SEA DOG tracked the decent early fractions, inched closer nearing the half-mile pole, raced two wide
then three wide nearing the top of the lane, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and
held safely in the end for the place. HAPPY DOES unhurried in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far
turn, was roused four wide into the stretch drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well and was up in the final strides to secure the show. TRINIDAD
showed good early speed and established the early advantage, dictated terms while setting decent fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the lead
nearing the quarter pole, came under pressure from MOTHER'S PRAYER nearing the furlong marker, could not hold that one off and was outfinished for the
show. O B'S unhurried in the early going, raced two wide into the stretch run and was gaining in the final furlong. IN HONOR OF AUTISM rated off of the
decent early pace while not far back, raced within striking distance through the backstretch run, lost ground while three wide on the far turn and did not
produce a late rally. DE LA LUNA took back off of the early pace and settled in the second flight, saved ground to the far turn, came in a bit tight entering the
stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SHE'S RESILIENT broke well, easily made the lead without being asked, was joined by PRNCSS OF DEL MAR near the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled
briefly then put that one away passing the quarter pole, opened up on the field at the head of the stretch, held off a bid by GET MY POINT in the final
furlong and drew away under a brisk hand ride in an impressive debut. GET MY POINT broke sharply and was allowed to settle behind the dueling leaders,
angled out for clear running at the top of the stretch, responded when asked to go after SHE'S RESILIENT but was unable to make up any ground on that
one while clearly second best. TURIAF broke alertly but was not sent after the lead, settled into a tracking position while about four wide, stayed that path
while being asked to go after the leaders with three furlongs to run, swerved out and into the path of SPARKLE SWEETLY at the top of the stretch then ran
on well enough to grab third in the final yards. SMILE AND PROFILE broke alertly then checked slightly to avoid contact with GET MY POINT just before the
nine-sixteenths marker, stayed to the inside down the backstretch, had to wait for running room through the turn, responded to right handed urging when
clear and weakened in the drive. SPARKLE SWEETLY broke in at the break, brushed with RAUCOUS TIZZY, displayed some brief speed then fell back
towards the rear of the pack, took the three path through the turn then swung five wide into the stretch, was bothered briefly by TURIAF just past the
three-sixteenths pole then was kept task down the lane and did manage to pass a couple in the end. RAUCOUS TIZZY showed good speed from the break
and was amongst the leaders down the backstretch, stayed in the three path around the turn, responded when asked to pick up the pace passing the three
furlong marker but was unable to find another gear in the stretch despite the best efforts of the rider. PRNCSS OF DEL MAR broke a bit slow and raced
greenly after the break, rushed up to join SHE'S RESILIENT before the turn, went head and head to the quarter pole and weakened. LOOKOUT PASS
broke slowly and outrun through the first quarter, lost ground around the turn, saved ground to no avail and galloped home well behind the field.
