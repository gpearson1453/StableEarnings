Footnotes
TRABIESO AVELITO broke alertly, was steered to the rail while dictating terms in the early stages and set moderate fractions to the quarter marker,
extended the lead nearing mid-stretch, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch, was fully extended in the final strides and just lasted for the win in a
blanket finish. THE CALABRESE KID took back in the early stages, raced two wide into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, trailed to the furlong
grounds, rallied in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while securing the place in the final strides. INDIANERA came under a snug early hold while
tracking the pace from the inside, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, closed willingly inside of the furlong marker and just held for the show.
MILEYS BLUECAT stalked the moderate early pace, raced two wide between runners to the quarter marker, lost position leaving the turn, re-rallied in the
final stages and was outfinished in deep stretch, while just missing for the show. SASQUATCH RIDE chased the moderate early pace, advanced while three
deep nearing the quarter marker, chased TRABIESO AVELITO to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TRULY FABULOUS assumed command in the early stages and showed the way to the turn, set moderate fractions while pressed to the quarter marker,
shook free of the pressing rival in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch and was hand urged in the final furlong as much the best. CROWN
KITTEN threw her head at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the run to the turn, raced along the rail to the quarter marker then tipped two wide
for the drive, was no match for the winner in deep stretch but closed willingly late and was up for the place. DAMN THE TORPEDOES broke out at the start
but was away in good order and was forwardly placed early on, pressed TRULY FABULOUS through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, could not
keep pace with that rival in the drive, weakened in the late stages and was outfinished for the place, while holding safely for the show. SMOKIN HOT
BOBBIE bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, raced close to the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn then swung three wide into the
stretch, lost position nearing the furlong grounds and tired in the late stages. TAKES A VILLAGE chased the moderate early pace, raced two wide between
rivals into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not muster a late rally. ALL chased the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, ran three
then four wide to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ATTENZIONE settled in the second flight in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn, was roused
three wide into the stretch, took command nearing the furlong pole and drove clear in the final sixteenth. UPSTART YANKEE was allowed to settle in the
early going, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, could not match strides with ATTENZIONE inside of the furlong marker and stayed on to be second
best. MOVIETIME broke in a tangle and was away slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch, finished evenly and was not able to impact the top pair late but ran on to secure the show. RACKATAPTAP tracked the moderate early fractions
from the inside, saved ground to the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch and lacked a late response. BLUE SILVER was forwardly placed into the
first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the quarter marker, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the top of the stretch, could not sustain that run in the drive
and gave way. WAKES AND WEDDINGS broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, drew to
a clear lead nearing the far turn, felt pressure nearing the quarter marker, was caught in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the late
stages. RIVER'S BEHEST chased the moderate early pace from the second flight, was not far back heading into the second turn, came three wide to the
quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

GRIGORO rated just off of the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground while three then
two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased LADY IN A HURRY to mid-stretch, confronted that rival inside of the furlong marker, kept to task while under
firm urging to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. LADY IN A HURRY established the early lead into the first turn, set moderate
fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the lead into the far turn, held safely to mid-stretch, felt pressure from GRIGORO inside
of the furlong marker, met that bid to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest. HERE COMES RALPHIE was allowed
to settle in the early stages, raced two wide into the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, offered a mild late rally and
was well clear in the end for the show. NAN ELIZABETH was unhurried in the early going, was a bit hard to place while three wide along the first turn, kept a
three wide path to the second turn and did not threaten. COCOA CENTS broke alertly and ceded the early lead to LADY IN A HURRY, stalked the
pacesetter through moderate fractions into the backstretch run, raced a bit wide into the far turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and tired in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE was unhurried in the early stages, raced under a hold along the backstretch run while not far back, lost ground nearing the quarter
marker, circled four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed determinedly inside of the furlong marker, overtook TROJAN CLUBHOUSE in
deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. TROJAN CLUBHOUSE hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, rushed up in the
early stages and tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, advanced to press the pace into the far turn, took command in upper stretch, was
set down for the drive and held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by TIZ AN EDVENTURE in deep stretch and held safely for the place.
MADEIRA WINE was a bit keen in the early stages, tracked the moderate early pace through the backstretch run, was well positioned into the far turn, raced
two wide to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit to the furlong pole and was outfinished in deep stretch, while just holding for third. REV REE was a bit rank in
the run to the first turn, settled while not far back along the backstretch run, advanced while three wide on the far turn, lost position in the drive, could not
muster the needed late response and just missed for the show. UNDISTURBED broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while
rating through the backstretch run, came under pressure along the second turn, was overtaken by TROJAN CLUBHOUSE in upper stretch, chased that rival
to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages.

EXIT SOUL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions into the backstretch run, was well rated into the far turn, drew to a clear lead in
the drive and was ridden out in the final furlong as much the best. ELA CALIMERA MOU was allowed to settle in the early stages, maintained position
through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, was steered four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, was no match for
the winner in the late stages and ran on to secure the place in a blanket finish for the minor awards. CARMEL BY THE SEA was well placed in the early
going, tracked the modest pace while close up into the second turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, chased EXIT SOUL
to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with that rival in the late stages and was outfinished in deep stretch for the place, while just saving the show.
TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the second turn, swung six wide into the stretch run, lacked a late response
and just missed for third on the wire. KOKO'S MOM was allowed to settle while not far back, raced three wide into the second turn, slipped to the inside in
upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and did not offer a late bid. ROSE ROSE ROSE was unhurried, raced two wide into the second turn and did
not mount a late rally. SWEET TESSA showed early speed and contested the pace along the first turn, stalked the modest fractions into the second turn,
raced two then three wide nearing the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

AMERICAN FARMER tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, was well positioned into the second turn, was roused three wide nearing the
top of the stretch, closed to come within aim nearing the furlong marker, confronted CRAZY DREAMS inside of the eighth pole, dueled with that game rival
to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. CRAZY DREAMS broke a step slowly, rushed up to be prominent in the early running and
attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, stalked JIMMY BLUE JEANS to the quarter marker, confronted that rival in upper stretch,
battled for the lead to the furlong grounds, met the bid of AMERICAN FARMER inside of the furlong pole, dueled with that foe to deep stretch and was
gamely bested in the final strides, while besting the rest. JIMMY BLUE JEANS broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set moderate
fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, maintained the lead to the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, held foes at bay to
the furlong pole, weakened in the final stages and was clear for third in the end. WARD 'N JERRY was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through
the backstretch run, was steered two wide along the far turn and lacked a late response. BOBBY'S ALIBI raced on a hold into the first turn, settled along the
backstretch run while two wide, slipped to the inside heading into the second turn and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
AFFIRM CHIEF was hustled leaving the break and dictated terms in the early stages, set moderate fractions while pressured through the backstretch run,
held a narrow advantage to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, extended the lead nearing the furlong pole, kept to task in deep stretch and held
in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. DANNY MICHAEL was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the second turn, slipped to the inside heading into the stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker, was not able to reel in the winner in the final
stages but held well in the end for the place. TAM'S TIME was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace from a three wide path into the
backstretch run, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, re-rallied in the late stages, was
outfinished by the top pair and made a late push in the final strides to secure the show. BIG STORY was prominent in the early stages, kept close
attendance to the pacesetter through the backstretch run then pressed the moderate pace to the second turn, lost position in the drive, gave way and drifted
out in deep stretch, impeded PORT O' CALL in the late stages and was just edged for third. PORT O' CALL tracked the early pace from the second flight,
maintained position through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, swung three wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was
impeded and came in tight in deep stretch and lacked a late response. STAY LIT was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the second turn, lost
contact in the drive and did not threaten.

Footnotes
SHEZA QUEEN BEE broke in at the start and quickly straightened out, pressed LUCKY LOCKETT through the early stages, moved to challenge near the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled for a furlong then gained command and drew clear in the final furlong. CUTE RENEGADE broke in slightly then encountered
some traffic in the initial stages, was forced to the back half of the field down the backstretch, made good forward progress through the turn but had to wait
for room passing the quarter pole, ran on through an opening at the top of the stretch and continued the run in a good effort to beat all but one to the wire.
BIKINI NATION broke in sharply and bumped DULCE COBRE right after the break, was a little keen and hard to place down the backstretch then was
boxed in going into the turn, swung three to four wide into the stretch and sustained the bid enough to hold third. LUCKY LOCKETT got away from the gate
cleanly, sped to the front and led the field to the turn through a pressured pace, responded when challenged to the outside by SHEZA QUEEN BEE near the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled to mid-stretch and gave way inside the furlong grounds. JIM'S JET broke well, split the field down the backstretch, raced three
to four wide around the turn, kept to task and was in striking position at the top of the stretch, was a bit green but did make up some ground. DULCE
COBRE broke alertly but was immediately bumped hard by BIKINI NATION, overcame that trouble and showed good speed to be up close to the early
leaders through the first quarter mile, checked hard approaching the three-eighths pole when that same rival took her path, lost momentum but still
managed to muster a tepid rally down the stretch. VALERIE broke well then angled over to save ground, impeding TOM'S CHARM in the process, hustled
to get a share of the early pace scenario, raced wide through the turn getting close enough to be a threat under a stiff ride, then stalled turning for home and
was not persevered with in the final eighth. TOM'S CHARM broke out at the start, then was forced to check when VALERIE angled over in front of her just
after the break, lacked any early speed and raced near the back of the pack in the early stages, made a mild move through the turn but flattened out before
the stretch. RED HARBOR got squeezed back at the start when both CAUSEWAY GIRL and CUTE RENEGATE got off to awkward starts, lost momentum
and spotted the field several lengths, once gathered up chased the field with some determination but was unable to make up very much ground.
CAUSEWAY GIRL broke in a tangle then veered out sharply cutting off RED HARBOR exiting from the adjacent stall, raced near the rear of the field down
the backstretch, lost contact passing the seven-sixteenths pole and was never a factor.
