Footnotes
CYCLONE RANGER was bumped hard just after the start then pinched back soon after, trailed inside early, advanced inside around the far turn, angled
four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up late. MUFRIH settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, advanced three wide
around the far turn, seized command leaving the quarter pole, quickly cleared, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted in then out and was caught late.
I'LLSMILEAGAIN was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane
and rallied inside. BREAK THE ICE saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. SECRET POCKET veered in at the start and bumped the winner into
other foes, raced two wide and never threatened. NORFIE disputed the pace two wide, drew clear around the far turn and faltered in the stretch.
CHACHARERO failed to menace while racing two and three wide. COOL SLIPPERS (IRE) was bumped soon after the start, bumped again soon after,
nearly unseating the rider and causing him to lose the right iron for a short period of time, became rank soon after, vied inside for a half and retreated
around the far turn. CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM bumped with COOL SLIPPERS the first time through the stretch, chased the pace two wide and stopped
around the far turn.

Footnotes
PURE SPEIGHT had an awkward start and chased along the inside of foes just off the rail, was ridden around the turn and under urging while remaining
inside of foes entering the lane, tipped out to the four path after a left handed cue passing the eighth pole, and surged past the inner pacesetter in the final
sixteenth to win. JET WINGS set the pace in the two path, cleared an inner foe and tipped inside into the turn, opened up around the turn and was cued in
the two path at the top of the lane, and stayed on under a steady hand ride but was caught by an outer foe passing the sixteenth pole to finish with place.
LOST A LEGEND had his head turned at the start, travelled in range between foes around the three path, was put to a drive while in the five path turning
into the stretch, and was one paced to finish with show. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR tracked in the four path, was roused midway around the turn and cued right
handed from the six path at the top of the lane, but evened out and hung to miss minor rewards. PIPITO prompted the pace along the inside, tipped out to
the two path and was under coaxing around the turn, but faded around the four path in the stretch. DON H trailed throughout around the two to five paths.

Footnotes
PAWKY pressed the pace two wide, dueled outside of MISS M M around the far turn and through the stretch, lugged in near the sixteenth pole and dug in
between foes to prevail. CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed.
MISS M M set a rated pace along the rail, fought on inside of the winner, was forced in and steadied near the sixteenth pole and just missed second.
CLOUD STORAGE tracked the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. MURSAL failed to menace while racing two wide. ARTIFACT
(GB) chased the pace four wide and faltered around the far turn. EXTRA INDY trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY IN THE
STRETCH AND REVIEWED AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF MISS M M AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AND
FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RAKA RAKA CRUZ set the pace in the two path, was in the three path rounding the turn and was cued right handed from the four path at the top of the
stretch, opened up while tipping inwards in upper stretch, and held sway while tipping back outward in the final furlong. BLUE LIEUTENANT prompted the
pace in the three path, was roused in the four path midway around the turn and tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, and chased home the
winner while drifting in under right handed urging through the lane for place. CHLOE'S DREAM bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three
path, circled a pair of rivals from the five path around the turn and was under a drive entering the stretch, and kept on for show. ALWAYS GOLDEN broke
out and bumped an outer foe, stalked around the five path, was under a ride around the turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane, but flattened.
FUN AMERICAN got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced wellback in the two path, was under a drive in the three path around the turn, but never
threatened. TOTALITARIAN got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, chased along the inside but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
STRAND OF GOLD stalked the pace inside, seized command when the pacestter bore out turning for home, angled into the four path soon after and
widened under a drive. LENDHERCREDIT set the pace in the two path, bore out near the quarter pole, straightened out in upper stretch and stayed on to
be a clear second. SPUN OATS bumped with MO TOUGH at the start, raced off the pace inside early, went two wide around the far turn, could not threaten
the top two in the lane but won the show battle between rivals. NEOGEM raced three wide in midpack, briefly angled out near the quarter pole, ducked back
into the three path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. NO WASABI FOR ME was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, gained some
ground in upper stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. MO TOUGH prompted the pace in the three path, was forced out and bumped with
MYSTIC SUNRISE near the quarter pole and lacked a further bid. LEIPZIG played no factor while racing two and three wide. MYSTIC SUNRISE raced in
range three and four wide, was forced out and bumped near the quarter pole and faded through the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE QUARTER POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MY DESTINY stalked in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the three path around the turn, floated out to the seven path while taking aim at the top
of the lane, swept past a pair of inner rivals, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace along the inside, was cued right
handed while tipping out to the three path in upper stretch, stayed on but got overtaken by an outer foe just past the eighth pole, and held place. DEM A
WONDER prompted the pace in the three path, bid under light rousing in the two path around the turn, was cued right handed passing the quarter pole and
was floated out to the four path into the lane, but evened out for show. YOUR INHERITANCE got bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked from the
seven path early and was under a ride in the five path rounding the turn, fanned back out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. DIGNIFIED
was prompted along in the five path but never threatened. NO DECAF threw her head and bumped an outer foe leaving the gate, rated in the six path and
was never involved while lugging outwards in the stretch. BARGAINAIRE trailed throughout from the inside to around the four path.

Footnotes
LOCO ABARRIO stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. KNOX lacked early speed, edged closer
five wide around the turn and rallied for the place. NATIONAL UNITY dueled two wide between foes, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but
stayed on well enough to save the show. CANAL chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished evenly. DEVIL'S CAY set a
pressured pace along the rail and tired in the lane. EASY AS A. B. C. failed to menace while racing three wide. HARD TO HANDLE was outrun while racing
well off the rail. BIG SAVE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MANDY GREEN tracked in the three path, was roused in the two path around the far turn, loomed while angling out to the five path into the stretch, drew
past a pair of inner rivals, and went clear in the final sixteenth. KIZZY prompted the pace in the three path, bid under light rousing around the far turn and
was cued right handed while taking a narrow lead from the four path into the lane, and kept on but was caught by an outer foe nearing the sixteenth pole to
place. DEMOGORGON stalked in the four path, was coaxed from the three path into the far turn and was under urging while tipping out to the seven path in
the stretch, but finished evenly for show. STARRY HOPE rated in the two path, was coaxed while fanning out to the eight path into the lane, but was no
factor. SWOONATRA set the pace inside of rivals, was cued from the two path turning into the stretch, but faded. TRISH THE DISH was unhurried in the
two path but never threatened from the four path in the stretch. THATAINT TOOSHABBY was in the four path around the first turn and raced off the pace in
the five path down the backside, was ridden around the far turn and cued right handed from the six path in upper stretch, but was empty. AMAZIN QUEEN
travelled wellback in the four path, was asked for more run around the far turn, but failed to respond.
