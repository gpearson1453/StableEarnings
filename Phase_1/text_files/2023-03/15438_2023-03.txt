Footnotes
GINGER SPARKLE trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground late
while drifting out to get up for the win near the wire. NICOLINO dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two
path coming around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. ANGELIC STORM bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced
off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home. MY SONG AND
MELODY veered out and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three
path around the bend and faded in the stretch. SONG OF THE HEART raced in the middle of the pack through the early going, continued around the turn in
the two path and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ANTHRACITE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside
for the run up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire
while drifting mildly. MINTENON raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch,
began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and gained ground late. TUNA N STAMPS chased the leader from the three path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the three path and kept on to the finish. KENRIC led the way from the two path around the
first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the far turn and weakened in the lane.
MAGNA RULER bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, angled in to save ground around the second bend and finished evenly while never threatening. FUN AT THE FORT saved ground around the first
turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and made no bid. ISLANDMAN bumped with the horse to his outside and
steadied at the start, raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and was empty. ERLAN
raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed well behind the field in the middle of the track up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the
three path and never factored.

OUR FANTASY tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane.
LYRICAL chased the pace setter on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four and five path and kept on to the finish.
LADY TEUFLESBERG brushed with the horse to her inside at the start, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, was
caught entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CALENDULA raced in the middle of the pack early, came around the bend in the two path and
flattened out in the stretch. BOURBON BLAST bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three and four path and made no bid. AUBURN brushed with the horse to his outside at the break, trailed the field up the

CHICAGO RIVER bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from
the two path racing around the turn and drew off in the lane. MORE MUCHO chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the
three path coming around the bend and kept on in the stretch. MY GIRL MELLY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the early going,
challenged from the three and four path coming around the turn and chased the top two home from there. HOLLYWOOD HONEY dueled on the outside up
the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. LADYNESS trailed the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening. BELLA ROMANCE dueled on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, dropped back while racing in the two path around the bend and tired further in the lane. ANNA'S IMAGE bumped with the horse to her
inside at the break, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the two path and was empty from there.

backstretch, saved ground around the turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to just miss. MISS MIKAELA led the way on the
inside in the early going, kicked clear while racing in the two path around the turn and was caught in upper stretch. MAGICGIRL raced off the pace on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the three path and improved position in the lane. LIZZ A BEE raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and flattened out in the lane. HUSH Y'ALL raced off the pace on the
inside early, navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick. PURE ELEGANCE hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch,
raced in the four path around the bend and was empty in the lane. DRILL'S VALENTINE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
