Footnotes
LION OF THE SEA was bumped outward and into Charitably Gifted leaving the gate then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn, angled to the four path
toward the head of the lane, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. I ONCE STOOD ALONE ducked outward and into Lion Of The Sea
leaving the gate then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and dug in to take second later yards. CHARITABLY GIFTED was bumped off stride
leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths then relented second later yards. FIT BUT FAT was
hustled to the front inside approaching the five sixteenths pole, dug in at even terms nearest the rail midway on the turn then flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. WARRIOR'S ESTATE chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the five path, steadied off the heels of Lion Of The Sea leaving the
turn and was kept in hand through the stretch. ROLL DEM BONES became anxious in the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and
flattened in the lane. SAAFEN steadied early and gave only distant chase, race off the rail into the turn, angled widest leaving the turn and showed little in
the lane. HOPE HE'S FAST gave chase but was shuffled back toward the quarter pole. HE'S ON THE LINE set the early pace, gave chase nearing the five
sixteenths pole then weakened toward the head of the lane.

Footnotes
LAUGHINTOTHEBANK came away a bit awkwardly and settled close in the three and four paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole, took over two
deep at the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. S S FRONTIER ANGEL saved early ground, bid nearing the
three eighths pole and raced near the rail most of the far turn, angled to the four path approaching the head of the lane and finished well. LADY GANGSTER
rated close inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, was carried out toward the
head of the lane and came along for third late. PHANTOM QUEEN tapered in and set the early pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole,
was met at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. NINETY PROOF settled off the early pace in
the three and four paths, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the rail nearing the quarter, dropped back midway on the turn
and weakened in the lane. A GIRL HAS A NAME raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response. SHY BELLA rated
close in the three path the first turn but fell nearing the half mile pole and had to be euthanized on the track. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the half
mile pole before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
YAZZERA (PER) took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. SUPER SWEETIE saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, bid into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn in the four path and dueled clear in second inside the sixteenth pole. SWEET FACTOR stalked from the four path the first
turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. TAKE CHARGE LISA rated
close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. COWGIRL HOP was
never a factor. SUPER WICKED stalked in the three path then faded through the backstretch. PUERTORICAN DIVA saved ground. BREEZY
CONNECTION was taken up on the first turn and walked off post race.

Footnotes
JUNGLE BEAST raced in the three path the first turn, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep at the quarter,
rounded the far turn off the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. SUE LOVES BARBADOS raced off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and took the lead toward the five sixteenths, but was caught into the far turn, steadied at the rail approaching the head of the lane, angled out
at the eighth pole and just lasted for second. BO'S BOURBON angled in and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was
met past the pole, dropped back leaving the five sixteenths but came back in the stretch and just missed second. OROCOVIX raced well off the pace in the
two and three paths, bid passing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed some rivals in the lane. BAAGY was bumped
at the break and settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
weakened. TARAASHOQ was never a factor. MOTAWAAFEQ saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded approaching
the far turn. LIKE SEGAL came away awkwardly and made contact with Baagy, rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole then faded on the far turn. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Jungle Beast for alleged interference nearing the
eighth pole, lodged by the rider of Sue Loves Barbados, no change was warranted.
