Footnotes
INCANTATION stalked the pace on the outside, took the advantage near the nine-sixteenths, vied three then two wide around the turn, was asked under
threat outside the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the runner-up into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS broke out
and bumped soundly with a foe, was well placed just off the pace, gained under urging while four then three wide on the turn, issued a challenge with three
furlongs to run, turned into upper stretch under the crop, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place.
WEST STAR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced towards the back under urging, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed
response while just able to get the show. WONKER WARRIOR dropped back to the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor
then just missed the show. CONNECT THE BROCKS was bumped soundly at the start, moved up to dispute the pace, dropped back late on the
backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and tired. BEAR'S CORRECT disputed the pace down the backstretch, dropped back
while two then three wide around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
MAJOR SPIN went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when set down into
upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging. JOHN'S PROTEGE brushed with a rival at the
start, settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead late and
was second best. CHEEKY TICO chased the pace on the outside then dropped back, moved from the three path to the rail around the turn, pursued the
leader under a drive into upper stretch and tired while just able to get the show. SEMPER FIDELIS brushed with a foe early, was urged along while inside of
rivals, dropped back near the five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path and just missed the show. GHOSTLYPRINCE settled off the pace, dropped
back under urging leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to respond. MOONSHININGBRIGHT brushed with foes
at the start, jostled with a rival early, raced just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn and capitulated. JET SPEED brushed with a rival at the
start, jostled with an opponent early, raced towards the rear between foes, was urged three to four wide on the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
D HOPPER came inward at the break, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path while under a slight bit of
extra left-rein pressure around the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, was put to two pops of a right-handed crop outside the furlong
marker, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop inside that marker, came out under threat from the runner-up to the sixteenth-pole then was
corrected some while bothering that foe, lugged out slightly while fighting on well late and held for the unofficial victory. BATTUTA D'ORO was urged along
well off the pace, traveled in the two path around the turn, gained late on that bend, shifted four wide while rallying outside the quarter-pole, closed well
under a drive to make an outside bid nearing the sixteenth-pole, steadied while losing action off the heels of the drifting unofficial winner shortly thereafter
and swapped back to his inside lead then missed while unable to regain momentum late. PREDICTED came inward at the start then was corrected by the
rider, was well placed down the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, was taken up outside the quarter-pole, pursued the top two in the stretch and
finished with good courage for the show. MAGICAL WAYS bumped solidly with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the
three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. OPPORTUNITY SET bumped solidly with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the
pace down the backstretch, went four wide around most of the turn then moved to the five path and came up empty. CARPE CAPELLA broke in and hit the
gate, shied inward from a foe then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, D HOPPER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE
NEAR THE SIXTEENTH-POLE

Footnotes
TOUGH STREET moved out early on the backstretch then tracked the pace on the far outside, was given her cue in the five path early on the turn, made a
bid in the four path outside the five-sixteenths, took the advantage in the five path into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole
then was eased up late while much the best. STONE CREATOR was asked leaving the gate, showed the way while well out in the track, vied four then
three wide around the turn, was asked under threat nearing the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch then drifted out and
proved no match while able to get the place. BUSTIN BAY dropped in while coaxed along off the pace, saved ground while asked for more around the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. CURLY GIRL broke in and hit the gate then bumped with
foe while last away, was taken up briefly early then moved out at the rear, went four then five wide around the turn and failed to threaten. CARAMOCHA
settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path around the turn and failed to respond. SHINFULL was bumped lightly at the start, moved off the rail
early on the backstretch, was urged three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

gained three wide into the stretch, took over inside the three-sixteenths then shook clear, drifted out under a left-handed crop from the eighth-pole to the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. LADY SHYLOCK tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, went
two then three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong,
moved in behind that foe in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly while continuing on her inside lead to get the place. CURLINS CHOIR was
coaxed along on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide under stronger encouragement around the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch, gained outside in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. LOCKBOX dropped back then settled on
the outside, was urged five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved but missed the show. SICILIAN GRANDMA dropped back
between horses early then was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. WILL BE FAMOUS
bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front then showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage into the turn, drew off along the rail on
that bend, shortened stride in the two path into upper stretch, was collared by the winner inside the three-sixteenths and gave way. GRACE AND CHARM
was bumped at the start and forced into another foe then dropped back in tight, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
EARLY EDITION was urged along at the rear on the far outside, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to the three path, moved to the rail shortly
thereafter, rallied inside coming to the quarter-pole, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, went clear outside the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under good handling. KHALI MAGIC made light contact with a foe at the start, was urged along while racing a bit high-headed, moved from
three to five wide around the turn, came out into upper stretch then was in tight off heels briefly before coming between foes, tipped further out at the furlong
marker and finished willingly for the place. DIVA BANKER bumped with a rival at the start then was in tight between foes while last away, settled off the
pace, moved from four to six wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained to make a brief bid near the furlong marker then
weakened but earned the show. QUALITY STONES went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, jostled with
a rival outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was collared by the winner and tired. SPIN A
YARN was well placed down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, jostled with a foe outside the quarter-pole, spun three
wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead while chasing in the drive and capitulated. PATRIA chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun
four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. RUVIES IN TIME raced off the pace, was urged five
wide around the turn, checked while in tight between foes at the three-sixteenths and dropped out. BACKED BY GOLD was fractious in the gate, raced off
the pace under urging, went four then three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole then swerved out severely and unseated the
rider before being walked off after caught by the outrider.

Footnotes
STRIKING SPEED moved in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead outside the furlong
marker then shook clear while drifting out and proved best under steady urging. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure to
his outside, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, fought under a drive in upper stretch, was carried out into the final furlong
and outfinished while clear for the place. MIDNIGHTCHARLY moved in while ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and improved to just get the show. GANDY DANCING bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while urged along off the pace, dropped from the
three path to the rail on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and just missed the show while narrowly up for the last spot in the superfecta. HEIR PORT
broke out and bumped with a rival, pressed the pace on the outside, took a short lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path while outside of a foe
around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and tired. DEE BO was coaxed along on the
outside, dropped from the five path to the three path around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and weakened. ZERTZ was urged along towards the
rear, dropped back in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
