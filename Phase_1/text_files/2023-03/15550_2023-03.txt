Footnotes
ATHENA BEACH was away alertly to set the pressured pace towards the inside, was in the two path on the turn and was headed by the quarter pole, then
turned back the bid leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under right handed crop urging. MO CO GOLD stumbled at the
start, pressed the winner on the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn to go on even terms for command by the quarter pole, but flattened out and was
no match for the winner, held place award. CREATIVE COPY chased the pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane
and had no rally, held show award. I CAME TO DANCE was rated four wide early, then dropped down towards the inside on the turn and had no kick,
missed show award. CELTIC REVIVAL was off slowly, settled on the inside and lacked a rally. MADELINE'S GROGU was well placed along the inside
behind the vying leaders, then eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide in to the lane and was empty.

HOT FUDGE WARRIOR was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew clear by the quarter pole, then was roused nearing the furlong marker and
drew off to crush foes while being ridden out. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN broke outwardly at the start bumping a foe, then chased the early pace towards the
inside, made a four wide bid on the turn by the quarter pole, then proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. TELL ME IM
AWESOME was bumped hard at the start, settled early, came six wide into the lane and was up to just miss the place award. FOREVER FIFI was settled
early on the inside, angled out sharply leaving the quarter pole, then had no rally. AKELA prompted the pace three wide and weakened. DISCREETLIN

Footnotes
MY DEVILS CHILD was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed well on the outside to get up in time to score
the victory under a drive. I SEE THE STARS was well rated early and made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, but was caught
late to just miss. W W SPRINGTIME was rated early on the inside, shifted out and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, slowly gaining late but
hung and was out kicked between rivals late. ALL TIME CLASSIC bumped at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the lane, bested rest.
MAD GENIUS dueled for the lead on the outside, then was between rivals by the quarter pole, weakened. BOURBON MISSION was settled early, inside by
the quarter pole and had no rally. KIKKERLAND chased the pace four wide and stopped.
