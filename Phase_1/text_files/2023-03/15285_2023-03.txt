Footnotes
SILENT FLASH stalked the pace inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and was up late. SILARDI set a pressured pace along the rail and
led until deep stretch. XY SPEED saved ground off the pace, tipped three wide in midstretch and ran on to gain the show. DISCREET TUNE pressed the
pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. CHARLES CHROME was off a bit slowly, raced four and five wide and never
threatened. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. DR. DUKE raced up close three wide and tired in the drive. LITTLE
JUANITO played no factor while racing two wide. UNIFIED CONQUEST was fractious in the gate and trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
TURN ON THE CHARM stalked in the five path, ranged up in the four path into the turn and was cued to bid passing the three eighths pole, took command
and opened up into the stretch, stayed on thru the stretch before beginning to shorten stride inside the final furlong and drifted out late, but held on.
KAREN'S HONOR dropped off the pace in the opening quarter and went out to the five path, was cued rounding the turn, tipped out to the seven path into
the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. DOT MARIE broke out at the start, chased in the four path, was driven around the turn and in the five path
at the top of the lane, and kept on to hold show. PRINCESS TENKO raced off the pace along the inside, was under urging in the two path around the turn
and angled out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished evenly. FEDALINE tracked in the two path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but
flattened in the final furlong. GOODBETTERBEST stumbled at the start but recovered to prompt the inner pacesetter in the three path, was coaxed to bid
into the turn, but faded into the stretch. SO OVER IT set the pace inside, was roused passing the three eighths pole, but gaveway entering the lane.
GRATIA trailed throughout around the six path.

Footnotes
MOPED DENNIS prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed around the turn and under a heavy drive from the seven path into the stretch, drew past
the inner pacesetter inside the final furlong, and held off another inner foe late to win. MAJOR KING rated along the inside, was cued right handed
approaching the quarter pole and shifted out to the four path into the stretch, and ran on while tipping outward through the stretch to finish with place. RARE
JEWEL set the pace in the two path, was roused around the turn and urged right handed while floating out to the six path into the stretch, stayed on before
yielding inside the final furlong and was caught on both sides to finish with show. ACTION DREAM tracked in the four path, was ridden around the turn and
in the six path entering the stretch, but was one paced. DRUM AND DRUMMER stalked in the five path, was under urging in the four path around the turn,
but flattened while tipping out to the eight path into the stretch. ALLAGASH RUN was brushed by an inner foe at the start and raced from wellback in the
seven path and was eased while shifting inside into the stretch. UNLONELY broke out and brushed and outer foe at the start, was prompted along in the six
path, failed to respond around the turn, and was eased in the stretch.

was driven around the turn and shifted out to the eight path for the stretch, and kept on for show. SENSEI LAWRENCE set the pace inside, was cued right
handed from the two path entering the stretch, and yielded passing the eighth pole. KIDDIE HOLIDAY hit the inner side of the gate hard at the start, tracked

Footnotes
JAMES ALOYSIUS was firmly rated in the three path through the opening half, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, battled on between to deep
stretch, drifted out under left handed urging and forged ahead late. NOT PHAR NOW set the pace along the rail and led until deep stretch. LORD OF WAR
saved ground in range and had a mild rally between foes to gain the show. STAT was wrangled back nearing the first turn, raced in the four path around that
bend, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, was forced to steady when the
winner drifted out late and just missed third. DOUBLE CLUTCH failed to menace while racing three wide. VOLCANIC played no factor while racing two
wide. FEDERAL EXCHANGE chased the pace in the three path then retreated inside around the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY PETAL chased along the inside, tipped out to the two path and was cued rounding the turn, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and rallied
down the center under right handed encouragement to get up in the final sixteenth. BREAKING BULLET tracked in the three path, was roused from the two
path around the turn, and shifted out to the four path at the top of the stretch, ran on to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by a late
charging outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. WICKED ICE was hustled along while in range in the three path, was in the four path around the turn and
urged left handed while angling out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. CONSTITUTIONALIST was fractious, reared and popped open
the gate before the start, rated in the three path, was cued in the four path passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, but
was one paced. PARDON MOI prompted the pace between foes in the two path, was in the three path around the turn and cued right handed while shifting
out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and flattened in the final furlong. HOOCHIE COO trailed in the two path, was cued in the four path rounding the
turn and floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. WOLF RAYET raced wellback in the four path and never threatened. VIMISOFA
dueled for the lead in the three path, took a narrow lead around the turn and was cued in the two path at the top of the lane, but yielded passing the eighth
pole. PINK PARTY PANTS dueled for the lead along the rail, was roused from the two path around the turn and under a drive along the rail at the top of the
stretch, and gaveway into the final furlong. FINAL NOTE brushed the side of the gate at the start, chased from the two path into the turn but was no
menace.
