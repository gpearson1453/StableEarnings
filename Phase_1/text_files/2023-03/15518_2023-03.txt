Footnotes
HERMISTON Tucked in behind the first flight into the first turn, traveled comfortably to the three-eighths when commencing in the two path at the
three-eighths, made a three wide bid at the quarter pole, loomed boldly at the eighth, seized the lead at the sixteenth and powered through to the wire. AX
'S SHORE Secured rail positioning and the lead into the first turn, dueled inside through up to the eighth pole when HERMISTON joined, fought on rail
through the lane willingly. PIRATE MISCHIEF Moved two wide into the first turn, dueled throughout outside of rival, caught between horses at the eighth
pole, battled down the lane, could not find enough. SHACKEY'S LOVE Dove to the two path from an outside draw into the first turn at the nine-sixteenths,
traveled between rivals up the backside and through the turn, finished evenly. IGO Trailed into the first, lagged throughout and only rallied mildly beyond
tiring foes. GEBO Forced four wide into the first turn, tracked widest of all foes off the lead, moved two wide on the second bend, shifted to the six path for
the drive but never progressed. CARRIZO SPRINGS Pressed leaders three wide from the break to the five-sixteenths when backing out, shifted to the rail at
the quarter pole and weakened through the final furlong.

ALPHABETICAL Settled inside on the first turn but took advantage of a clear path when ROUGE SUNSET took off outwards on the first turn, opened up at
the half mile pole to a distant advantage and never looked back, rolling to a comfortable victory. ROYAL TAP Moved two wide into the first turn but was
carried sharply by inside rival around the bend, moved up the backside in the four path, dove to the rail at the three-eighths while progressing, fought
between down the stretch to hold place. BULLY RIDE Shifted inside in the run into the first turn to avoid troubled foes, went on to track off the loose leader
throughout, moved three wide on the turn and through the stretch, finished evenly. GOLD STAR STUDENT In the three path on the first turn, carried wide
by inner rivals, moved in the five path on the backside, shifted to the rail for a run on the turn that commenced at the quarter pole, bid flattened out and
weakened in the final sixteenth. ROUGE SUNSET Broke inwards, settled on the rail into the first turn but veered out many paths while impeding a pair of
foes, shifted to the six path in the clear up the backside and dwelt home from there.

Footnotes
NIP NAP Rushed clear from the break, quickly opened up a sizable lead on the turn, accordioned back to the eventual runner-up but was always in control.
HAYNESPUN Tracked inside well off the pace, advanced up the rail at the three-sixteenths pole, pursued intently through the lane, had too much to do to
beat the winner. BIGGER THAN YOU Chased two wide up the backside, moved three wide and widest on the turn, ended in five path through the lane, a
clear third best. YOU NEVER CALL Chased loose leader up the backside while inside of rival, traveled between horses on the turn, outfinished in strech.
GOING ALL IN Could not keep pace with preceeding rivals throughout, in the four path on the turn, never fired. CATHRYN VALENTINA Was a touch slow to
break, outsprinted early by all, never improved.
