Footnotes
VETTORI KIN (BRZ) unhurried to quarter pole, angled three wide to lead, drifted late cleared. NOT SO EASY awkward start quickly to rail, reserved to
stretch, bothered late. LORD REVELSTOKE no speed to far turn, rallied into the stretch run for show spot. HIGH POWERED antsy in gate, broke sharp to
front, led to far turn, weakened. EL CHEAPO with leaders to far turn, nice move to contend but flattened out. DOWN HOME KITTEN saved ground to no
avail while fading in the stretch run. SUBDUED outside trip while never a factor throughout. TORNADO BOY trailed to the stretch, passed one late. STORM
RISK hounded leader to the half, gave way readily, bled, vanned off. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF NOT SO
EASY AGAINST THE WINNER, VETTORI KIN FOR INTERFERNCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG THE WINNER WAS DISQAULIFIED AND PLACED
SECOND FOR SWERVING OUT IN THE LATE STRETCH RUN.

ON A SPREE off rail chase to far turn, took over into the stretch, cleared off while ridden out to the wire. CLEARING WAIVERS quick to the front, stayed to
stretch and dug in gamely to hold the place spot. BAKENEKO chased pace to quarter pole but weakened in the stretch for show. IOYA AGAIN unhurried,
put to a drive into far turn but could not go on and leveled off in the stretch. CAROM unhurried from inside while going along evenly with no response.
TOMAHAWK KITTEN inside run to quarter pole, between horses stretch run while no real threat. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME never menaced throughout.
CAPPY HOUR squeezed at the start and never in contention throughout.
