bend and drew off in the stretch, geared down at the wire. HOKU raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the
far turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. WALL STREET TRADER led the way while racing ground around
the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second bend, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the finish. INVISIBLE
WAR saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back from the two path headed around
the far bend and made up some ground in the stretch but never truly fired. WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW raced in the two path early, continued up the
backstretch off the pace between horses, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid while drifting out mildly late. STRONGER TOGETHER raced in
the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and was empty in the stretch.

MUNNYS GOLD dueled on the inside up the backstretch, led the way from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best.
DREAMING OF SNOW tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on in the
lane while proving to be no match for the winner. AWESOME PIC raced off the pace early, began to move up while racing in the four path around the turn
and continued to improve position mildly in the lane. DREAM CONCERT bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, chased the leaders up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and weakened in the lane. SHERLYN GO GO trailed the field through the opening stages, navigated the
bend from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. PRETTY'N AWESOME bumped with the horse to her outside and was squeezed back at
the start, recovered to duel up the backstretch, chased the leader from the two path around the bend and faded in the lane. LYNX bobbled slightly leaving
the gate, raced at the back of the pack early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. JACKIE'S SPIRIT raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
DRAGONERA raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming
around the second bend and edged clear late. ROMAN FLAME raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled while
saving ground around the second bend, dug in the stretch and kept on while drifting late. SKYVIEW DRIVE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to
track the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the second turn in the three path, launched a bid approaching the quarter
pole and improved position in the stretch. PEAK POPULARITY raced in the three path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far bend in the four path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. LA PACHANGA bumped with
the horse to her outside at the start, stumbling in the process, saved ground around the first bend, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in late stretch. LA MAZEL hopped up leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of the pack through
the opening half mile, swung out to the five path for the run around the second turn and gained ground mildly in the lane. MONEY BEETS raced off the pace
on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch.
MACHIAVELLIQUE bumped with the horse to her inside at the break and was shuffled back, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up
the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the two path and showed no kick. FLYLIKEABUTTERFLY (IRE) raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside through the opening half mile, navigated the second turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. BET THE HOWES saved ground early, settled
off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and was empty in the lane. DOMO ARIGATOU
saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
tired from there.
