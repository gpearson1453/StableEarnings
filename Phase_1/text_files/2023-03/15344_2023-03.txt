Footnotes
SWEET TATUM showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. WILDWOOD MAGGIE was bumped at
the start, settled near the back of the pack early on, swung five to six wide into the lane and finished well to get up for the place position. QUEEN
CORDELIA chased the pace while racing three wid and kept on to the wire. AMERICAN REALITY stalked the pace while racing just off the inside and
weakened in the drive. UNHERDOF was bumped at the start, raced near the back of the pack early on, raced four wide and had no response. SUCH
GREAT HEIGHTS was forwardly placed along the inside and faded. SABER QUEEN failed to respond.

Footnotes
DALLAS GOLD rated along the inside, shifted three wide through the far turn and finished well to get up under all out pressure. FAKE SOLUTION showed
good early foot from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. FALCON HEAVY was void of early speed, moved up through the far turn into the stretch
while racing four wide and made a good late gain. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY settled off the early going, raced from the inside near the three sixteenths pole
and had no final winning bid. FORT KNOX raced a bit wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from the outside and tired. DEALMEINBUD stalked the
pace and tired. LADDIE BOY failed to sustain a bid. THAT'S D 'CAT was forwardly placed to lay up close and tired readily.
