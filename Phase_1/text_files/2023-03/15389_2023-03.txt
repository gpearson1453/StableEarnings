Footnotes
ALLIACEOUS was three wide going into the first turn, settled in hands while stalking the pace from the inside down the back side, advanced through a hole
along the rail going into the second turn, waited patiently even though she was able to take the lead, raced up the rail after the quarter pole, then drew off at
the eighth pole. SPELLBINDING was off a step slow and was given time to find her stride while racing from the five path, was asked at the half mile marker
and responded well, moving up closer to the field, was in contention at the three eighths pole and followed the eventual winner through a hole, shifted out a
path and drew beside the eventual winner at the quarter pole, challenged for the lead but didn't have enough for the win today but ran a nice second.
ISOLATION landed mid pack on the outside after the break, comfortably raced along the outside, was asked at the half mile marker and advanced but
having to go wide, traveled into the second turn on the outside and gaining ground, was in contention at the quarter pole, was strongly encouraged but tired
in the lane. BEAUTIFUL ENDING was slow into stride, settled along the fence well off the pace, was cued at the half mile pole advanced up the rail after the
quarter but to no avail. AVERI EVER AFTER vied for the early lead, stalked right off the leaders hip from the three and four paths, maintained position and
flattened out in the lane. KITTENOFTHE COURT vied for the early lead, established the pace from the rail, drifted out a bit going into the second turn, was
collared at the three eighths pole and stopped after that.
