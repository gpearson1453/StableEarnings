Footnotes
OXBOW'S RIDE broke sharply, chased the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted out two wide, made the lead at the quarter pole then widened the
balance of the trip under left handed urging to win as much the best. SOMETHING ON TAP stalked the pace along the inside, shifted out on the turn, had a
mild late rally three wide and finished well clear for second. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS passed tiring rivals in the five path. FAST AS FAST CAN B sped to
the lead soon after the start, set the pace for seven sixteenths of a mile, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened late. MARK'S BUDDY
JACIN failed to menace. COSI EXPRESS trailed.

Footnotes
NIGHT TIME RULER away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated, was put to a right handed stick in mid stretch, drifted out late while under a hand ride
and drew clear. BLOOD MOON chased the winner, was set down on the far turn, inched closer nearing the quarter pole, his rider steadied past the
sixteenth pole when the winner drifted out and finished second best. UPTOWN stalked the pace two wide and went evenly. FALCONS FURY close up along
the inside, was through after a half. BOURBON WISDOM hopped at the start and trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE
RIDER OF BLOOD MOON LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ODER OF FINISH.

WICKED CHANCE never far back, circled river five then two wide through the turn, made the lead before the furlong marker then finished full of run to win
going away. CHROMED IMPULSE pressed the pace three then four wide, rallied to make the lead on the turn, dropped to the rail, battled with the winner
until deep stretch then was no match while well clear for second. GRAND DEAL trailed into the stretch, swung wide and found his best stride late. EL
SICARIO vied for lead the lead along the inside into the stretch then failed to offer the needed response. ONEMORANDTHECHECK pressed the pace two
wide while hung out in the six path into the turn then dropped back. BIG BAD BEAST offered a mild bid between horses two wide on the turn then came up
empty. MASTER sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace off the rail in the five path into the turn then weakened. WHISKEY SUNRISE had brief
speed.

Footnotes
THE MIRACLE KIUT sped to the lead leaving the chute, set all the pace and finished full of run through the stretch under strong handling to win going away.
KAT TRAX never far back, rallied four then three wide through the stretch and finished second best. TRULY INCLUSIVE pressured the winner two wide into
the stretch then was outfinished. LADY JASPER offered a mild bid along rail into the stretch then leveled off. HELLO SWEETS broke slowly, trailed into the
stretch then passed tiring rivals along the inside. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ failed to menace. MARGARITA CINCO raced wide early and was no threat.
PENNIESANDDIMES with the second flight, was through after a half.
