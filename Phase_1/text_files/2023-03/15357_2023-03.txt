DEMOCRAT was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. SAYERS
showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up for the place. BUMPY CUP was away in good order to duel for
the early advantage with EZ GUESS from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. EZ GUESS disputed the pace with BUMPY CUP while racing
four-wide and gave way after going a half. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
PASSION OF JOE'S broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. THE
RONALD sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control into the lane and yielded to the winner through the
final furlong. SUGAR SHANE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MR BIG DEAL lacked early
foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. CORK MASTER chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. LIL
KOWBOY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. I'M MR. SHENANIGAN was fractious at the post then was off
a step slow, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

TIZ THE PROSPECT set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. PRINCESS
JAYLEEN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. THE COMRIE RULE chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. TAKIN SHOTS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. MISS CONTINENTAL raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. BABY JOY pressed the pace from the
inside and weakened after going three furlongs. PARK IN THE DARK was off a step slow, showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did
not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

EDDIE'S ON PATROL settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out late and was up in time. STARDUST DREAMS was off slow, lacked early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied late. ABOVE THE STARS was away in good order to set a pressured pace,
responded when challenged by BLESSED ANGEL nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late. BLESSED ANGEL pressed the
pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid into the lane, vied and gave way through the final furlong. BEAUTIFUL MESS was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. HERSABIGGIRL settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. GRACIE'S A TIGER raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MISCHIEF MAME pressed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. WHEREDIDITGO was off slow and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

NORTHCUT sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. CITY AT NIGHT was reserved just off the leaders
from the inside throughout and failed to gain on the winner late. GIANT PAYDAY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady bid. CONVENTION showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. THE GREEN CRUSADER
broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. PLAYOFF BOUND showed no early speed, raced three-wide through
the second turn and failed to rally. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROYALTY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the final yards. SEVEN POINTS
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and just failed to last. MY EXPRESSION
sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was off slow, lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. BEAU ROCKS raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and
failed to gain late. PIPER ROSE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. EARLYNTHEMORN raced off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. FULL OF GRACE broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and
weakened after going a half. RAGING LADY showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
