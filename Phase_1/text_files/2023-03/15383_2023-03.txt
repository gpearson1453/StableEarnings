Footnotes
SODDY DAISY forwardly placed in the two path up the backstretch, remained within striking distance off the rail early turn, ranged up three wide to
challenge late in the turn, drew clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling while drifting in a bit. KEEN CONTENDER
lacked early foot while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, rallied belated while remaining well out in the strip, clear second. SWEET N SALTY
broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, dueled through the turn, continued to vie into the stretch inside, proved no match for the
winner to the wire, caught late for the place. GRANDMA BELLE last away, moved up off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, vied between
horses into the lane, weakened. CANARY NATION settled off the pace in the two path, went one paced in lacking a rally. TRUEBLUEGIRL saved ground to
no avail while also failing to respond. ASEEL faded while racing three wide, well back at the end.

Footnotes
SAINT PIO in the second flight while between horses, closer turning for home, challenged while again between rivals inside the furlong marker, gained the
nod. GALACTIC EMPIRE floated out at he start by BRAVE MAGIC to be last away, void of early foot as a result, began to advance late in the turn, five wide
into the stretch, late bid, narrowly missed the nod while outside the winner. BRAVE MAGIC within striking distance outside, raced the four path through the
turn, closer into the lane, drifting in a bit when lodging a bid between the top two with a furlong to run, could not match that pair late, narrowly saved the
show. UPTOWN HUSTLER sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn and upper stretch, remained clear
past the furlong marker then caved in soon after when confronted by the top three. NEW DICE in the second flight inside the winner, failed to respond in the
drive. BOTANY remained back while racing toward the inside. THE FIVE B'S chased the leader for a half in the three path and began to give way when
bothered slightly in upper stretch.

Footnotes
QUEENIES WAY broke in, asked a bit to clear along the inside early, set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, shrugged off a mild bid from the
outside approaching the furlong marker, clear again late under steady handling. THE X FACTOR off step slow, raced back off the pace, advanced and was
floated out five wide while looming boldly into the stretch, brief bid, proved no match for the winner late, all out for the place. FLASH OF CHEROKEE off the
pace and the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, moved closer past the furlong grounds, late bid for the place, outfinished. SWEET HOLINESS
back off the pace and the inside, angled out to be four wide into the lane carrying the runner up out while moving closer, could not sustain that advance to
the wire. SHEZA CAT back off the pace after breaking a step slow, on the outside in the four path when moving closer with the second fight late turn,
dropped in sharply to he inside, lacked a further bid. FINISHWHATUSTARTED chased the winner in the two path for a half and gave way between horses.
DIAMONDS R FOREVER forwardly placed after breaking alertly, three wide through the turn, also had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
FLATOUT WINNER squeezed back at the break to be off slowly, raced well back inside, began to advance while still inside far turn, steered out sharply to
engage the two leaders into the stretch, drove well clear. COLOSI in the second flight while racing in the two path, continued to be patiently handled into the
second turn, steered three wide behind the winner turning for home, proved no match for that cone, clearly second best. JINGLE in tight start, settled off the
pace and the inside, three wide into the far turn, steered in gradually through that bend to emerge into the stretch along the rail, along for the show, no threat
to the top two. FIRST LINE lacked early foot while outside the winner, three to four wide late in the final turn, improved slightly in picking off a couple of
faltering foes but lacked a significant closing kick. HOME RUN TRICK away in good order, dueled from the get go in the two path, helped set some lively
fractions and gave way in the drive. LITTLE DEMON broke alertly, alternated up front along the inside for six furlongs through those glib fractions, also
caved when the real running began at he head of the lane.

Footnotes
ARTHURIAN advanced soon after the start and take command, cleared down to the two path, continued to show the way through the turn, shrugged off
DRENA'S STAR into the stretch and drew steadily clear while kept to pressure. DRENA'S STAR bumped early and bothered when TOWN CHAMP got out
soon after the start, raced in mid pack three wide into the turn,crept a bit closer and lodged a mild, brief bid late in the bend, proved no match in the run to
the wire, saved second. TOWN CHAMP got out soon after the start to bother outer rivals, was righted to race closest to the winner into the turn, moved out
to the three path by late in the bend, slowly getting to the runner up late, well clear of the rest. COAL TRUTH off slowly, lacked early foot inside, continued to
save some ground turn, improved inside of rivals into the lane, went evenly the final furlong. SMILEFORME bothered just after the start, was slow to settle in
some traffic up the backstretch, four wide for the drive, finished up evenly while remaining well out in the strip. STORMIN HONGKONG off a step slow,
moved out early in the turn, was four wide into the stretch, widest in the drive, failed to muster a rally. HEZA WILD RIDE fell back after the start to trail,
moved inside early turn, never a factor. OJITOS bumped in the early going, faded off the rail, trailed home.

Footnotes
PRINCEDREAMCESS with the pace from the start just off the inside early, dropped to the inside for the turn, raced in hand while holding a slight edge late
in the bend, disposed of the other speed turning for home, drew out steadily down the lane under an intermittent left handed crop. SILVIA behind the pace
along the inside, continued to save ground through most of the turn, eased out and raced between foes into the lane, could do nothing with the winner to the
wire, held sway late for the place. SUPER WONDER GIRL off a step slow, raced back and just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn,
angled in a bit for the run to the wire, not enough late for the place. TALES OF HOME forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch five down to four wide,
angled in a bit by mid turn, came four wide again for the drive, widest, went evenly in the late going. LOFTHOUSE forwardly placed early between horses
and outside the winner, pressured that one through the turn then could not keep up down the stretch. COMEDY ACT prompted the issue up front for a half
while three wide, also had little left for the stretch run. SHE'S ALL CLASS with the lead pack five wide into the turn, fell back and was finished before a half.

Footnotes
WINDY BAY away in good order, vied four wide into the first turn, cleared to the two path before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch when clear,
maintained a sizable advantage through the second bend, just enough to last. LADY WITH A CAUSE last to leave, void of early foot along the inside,
continued to save ground into the final turn, came three wide when coming for the drive, finished willingly to narrowly miss. PERFECTLY GOLDEN back off
the early pace, two path gain, continued to close the gap the final furlong, far clear of the others. PIVOSKY broke on top, closest to the winner early,
continued to chase the middle half, weakened in the drive. WREAKING HAVOC back off the pace, continued one paced throughout in failing to menace.
LOVELY JOYCE in the second flight early, began a steady fade while continuing inside. MOLLY OF STRATFORD four wide into the first turn, remained
always back. NAUGHTY MADAM staged a steady retreat and finished far back.

Footnotes
SMILE HAPPY settled off the early pace off the rail, remained three wide and unhurried up the backstretch, ranged up while being floated out four wide to
challenge turning for home, took over, fully extended to hold the runner up safe late. SPEED BIAS prompted the leader from the outside for six furlongs,
moved to challenge midway on the final turn, came out three wide to take the winner out a bit tuning for home, dueled with that one to the wire and proved
stubborn to the end. SEIZE THE NIGHT asked a bit early to clear into the first turn, set a pressured pace inside, could not match the top two in the drive,
held the show. CREATIVE MINISTER back off the early pace while just off the inside, two to three wide through the second turn while between foes, lacked
a serious closing kick through the lane. TIZ RYE TIME lacked speed while saving ground through the first turn, continued along the rail in the run up the
backstretch and into the far turn, two path for the drive, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat. PRESIDENTIAL four wide into the first turn,
moved a bit closer while three wide second bend, got out late in that turn, went flat though the lane. CAMP DAVID in the second flight toward the front along
the inside early, gave way second turn.

Footnotes
DANCIN N THEPULPIT broke alertly, clear past he wire the first time, set all the pace in the two path, maintained a daylight advantage through the lane
under steady handling. DR. WOODS MIRACLE lacked speed while along the inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, rallied up an open
rail to gain the place, no real threat o he winner. SOPHIE'S STAR also saved ground through the first turn when off the pace, moved off the inside for the
drive, mild rally to gain the show. REAUX BINA settled off the pace, well wide backstretch, five wide into the far turn, four wide exiting, improved upper
stretch then flattened out late to lose the show. PETULA dwelt start, four wide into the first turn, angled in, two path middle half, made little impact through
the stretch. DIXIE GIRL TO away in good order, chased the winner from the three path, faltered the final furlong to lose several positions. BE BO rank then
stumbled at the break, raced forwardly and four wide, also faltered in the drive. ONLYTHREESOCKS stumbled badly at the break, raced back early as a
result, moved closer in some traffic with a half mile remaining, steadied soon after and began to weaken.
