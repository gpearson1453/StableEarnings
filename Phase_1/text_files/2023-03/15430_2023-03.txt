Footnotes
ONE LAS OLAS settled well back as a contested pace developed leaving the far turn, gathered momentum and advanced two wide past the three eighths,
shifted out four wide into the lane, closed in under solid right handed asked, took over from DROPKICK QUEEN with a sixteenth to go and drew clear under
steady handling. DROPKICK QUEEN tracked three then two wide, moved up outside and engaged the leader around the far turn, sparred past the three
eighths, took over heading to the lane then cleared off, kept on past mid stretch, switched over to her left lead and gave way grudgingly.
THENCOMEMORNING , in the clear and within range of the leading trio early on, steadily advanced three wide into the stretch, gave hard chase from there
and continued on with some effort. GRASS CUTTER was sent up leaving the chute and prompted from the rail, rated off the leader near the five eighths,
angled out, gained five wide leaving the quarter pole, failed to sustain past mid stretch and faded. DUNDER BOSS lagged back early while four wide, was
under pressure making a mild three wide run nearing the lane, chased from there and came up empty. ANATH saved ground off the pace, steadied when in
close leaving the far turn, swung out and failed to rally. GALACTIC TIDE , two wide early, retreated. JIMMYDABOOK sped to the early lead, set the pace
two wide while handling some inside pressure, secured the rail into the far turn then was met with a challenge, dueled around the turn, stayed on to upper
stretch then faltered.

CLASSIER , rank at the break, steadied soon after, regrouped and edged up four wide into the turn, took closer order of the duel mid turn, circled six wide
into the lane and engaged the leaders, took command leaving the three sixteenths, responded to left handed encouragement past the furlong grounds and
drew clear. CRYO broke outward, corrected and prompted the pace three wide outside ABUELO PAPS, applied more pressure then dueled leaving the far
turn, carried that battle around the turn and into the lane while fanned five wide, fought on between rivals in mid stretch and stayed on well to be second
best. ABUELO PAPS was sent up to the early lead, dueled to the inside of CRYO, was under asking to hold the lead past the five sixteenths, drifted four
wide into the stretch, straightened and continue to fight inside the top pair past mid stretch, failed to match strides leaving the sixteenth marker and gave
way grudgingly. DOWN COLD , hustled along while removed from the rail, circled four wide into the stretch, altered in leaving mid stretch and kept on with
good energy. BOSS MAN J J bobbled at the break then was put in tight, sent up soon after three wide and chased, angled in around the turn, pursued into
the stretch then faded. HIGHLAND DREAM drafted back early, saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK stalked the pace between horses down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch,
rallied between horses and edged clear. MR THRIFTY , four wide the first turn, advanced four deep on the far turn, bid for the lead outside horses in upper
stretch, remained on his left lead and finished willingly. OXIDE stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a three wide lead leaving the far turn, drifted
in near the eighth pole and weakened. KRUG disputed the pace outside ACE NINE NINE, put that one away on the far turn, raced near the inner rail
through the stretch and weakened. ACE NINE NINE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) , along the inner rail
both turns, swung out in upper stretch and gave way. OUR LUCKY MAN broke slowly and pulled himself up entering the first turn. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

MINE RUN pulled his way to a short lead outside MISSION MAN, moved clear into the turn then secured the rail, was pestered by RAGTIME RICHES from
the three eighths to mid stretch, spurted away under strong handling soon after then was fully extended to hold off SHERRIFF RONNIE. SHERIFF RONNIE
broke a step slow, regrouped and edged up off the rail into the turn, exchanged bumps with DIALER when advancing between runners mid turn, came three
to four wide into the lane, closed strongly through the final furlong and simply ran out of ground. PORCH SWING saved ground off the pace, was stalled
behind a tiring rival leaving the far turn, angled out, circled six wide into the stretch and closed nicely. MASTERWORK broke slowly, was firmly rated off the
pace while saving ground, eased out, advanced between runners near mid stretch and continued on with good energy. RAGTIME RICHES prompted
outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, pressed the pace to mid stretch, failed to kick on from there and faded.
LIBRARYOFCONGRESS stumbled at the break, raced off the pace while three wide, edged up between runners near mid stretch, angled out some and
churned on. DIALER , between rivals early, chased three wide leaving the three eighths, bumped around with SHERRIFF RONNIE soon after and gave
way. STARSTREET gave early chase two wide and dropped back leaving the three furlong marker. MISSION MAN vied inside early on, failed to keep pace
leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
THREES OVER DEUCES , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted to the inner rail in mid stretch and was
under urging in the drive. KADRI , four wide around the turn, rallied. EXCULPATORY , right to the early, set the pace in the two path around the turn and
gradually weakened in the stretch. MR. HUSTLE lacked speed, behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and offered a mild gain.
WHISKEY AND YOU raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way. PLOT THE DOTS chased the pace while racing along the rail and
faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FACTOR IT IN settled off the pace while five wide, responded when given his cue and commenced his run leaving the three eighths, ranged up five wide
outside rivals to challenge with a quarter to go, put a head in front soon into the lane then sparred outside SIR ALFRED JAMES, got the better of that one
leaving mid stretch, spurted clear and held firm while kept alert. SIR ALFRED JAMES , nudged along chasing three wide, moved up between foes and
battled on near even terms into the stretch, emerged in a duel to the inside of the winner leaving the three sixteenths, could not quite go with that one
heading to the sixteenth pole but stayed gamely and held down the place. ALWAYSINAHURRY saved ground and steadied briefly entering the turn, angled
out mid turn, circled six wide into the stretch and closed nicely through the final eighth. HOPEFUL TREASURE drafted back a bit early, took closer order
three wide mid turn, had aim under pressure in upper stretch but lacked a serious response. WAR TOCSIN rated close up early while saving ground,
dropped back some leaving the far turn, eased out under pressure into the stretch but failed to mount a solid run. LIKEABLE sped clear early, set the pace
two wide, was taken on by a host of rivals to his outside nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.
BACKNTHEWOODS , four wide tracking, moved up a bit between foes past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch entering the stretch and faded.
