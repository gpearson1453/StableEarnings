AWESOME PRINCE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the stretch.
UNXPECTED TIGER trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole
and gained ground late. SEAX raced off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and kept on to the finish, no
match for the winner. FAST FIXER led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane. MIND FLAYER
tracked the pace setter on the outside in the early going, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to tire in the
stretch.

BELMAR SUMMER chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane.
HAPPY UNION trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position
in the stretch. CHILD PROOF stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, veered in and bumped with DA
JOURNEYGIRL entering the stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong. WAITWAITDONTTELLME raced in the middle of the pack early, came around
the bend in the three and four path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground mildly in the lane while never threatening. DA
JOURNEYGIRL led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn was bumped lightly by CHILD PROOF in upper stretch and
weakened from there. SUMMER NITRO raced off the pace on the outside through the early going, continued around the turn in the three path and was not a
factor.

REINVEST trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, raced outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend, launched a bid
passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in the final furlong. ESTILO MAGICO led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside
up the backstretch and around the second turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home from there. DECEITFUL pressed the
