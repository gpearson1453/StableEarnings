prompted the pace two wide, had her heels clipped past the half mile marker, kept pressure into the stretch then was no match while second best.
BISCAYNE BAY vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, swung wide giving up ground then came on again late in the eight path. NORTHERN

stretch then leveled off. PISTOL PACKIN BOS with the second flight two wide, went evenly. BEEBLEGEE failed to menace. CUT RATES drifted in clipping
heels with NOT A WILD BRAT past the half mile pole causing her to stumbled badly and unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY

TIME FOR CUPID never far back, closed rapidly four wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under brisk
handling to win going away. SPEEDY FIRE pressed the early pace along the inside, made the lead nearing the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch,
drifted out to the six path late and was no match for the winner. MARIMBA stalked the pace into the stretch and finished with good courage in the seven
path. V K STAR went evenly. MAGESTAL BASTIDA passed tiring rivals inside. TERRIFIC LADY set the pace for five sixteenths of a mile, kept pressure into
the stretch then weakened. IRON WILMA was no factor.
