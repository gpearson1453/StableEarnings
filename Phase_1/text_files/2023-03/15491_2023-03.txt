Footnotes
HANNAH IN A HURRY raced close to the early pace, steadied slightly while in tight quarters nearing the half-mile marker, took back off of the pace into the
turn, advanced while saving ground to the quarter marker, took command nearing the furlong pole and drew away under steady urging in the final stages.
CAT BANDIT was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate pace to the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter
marker, raced three wide into the stretch, was not able to keep pace with HANNAH IN A HURRY in the drive and stayed on to be best of the rest. BOSSY
PEGASUS lacked early speed, raced two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top two in the late stages and
passed tiring rivals to secure the show. A PERFECT PATH was hustled to be prominent early, set the pace to the turn while off of the rail, set a pressured
pace to the quarter marker, drifted out a path in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages. CHEATER'S WALTZ broke out at
the start, chased the moderate early pace, raced two wide along the turn, came three wide for the drive and tired. MORO FIRST CLASS showed speed and
chased the moderate early pace, raced four wide into the turn, angled over a path midway through the bend, lost position nearing the top of the lane and
gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
WILD BILLY D stalked the moderate early pace to the turn, advanced while outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the
stretch, overtook MY MAN STAN nearing the furlong pole and drew clear in the final stages. PERFORMATIVE was squeezed at the start and off a bit
slowly, lacked speed heading to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, waited for racing room in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong
marker, was not able to impact the winner in the late stages and was clear for the place. AZURE STAR (IRE) broke out at the start and crowded
PERFORMATIVE, was prominent in the early running, dueled through moderate fractions to the quarter marker while inside of MY MAN STAN, lost position
approaching mid-stretch, was not able to keep pace with the top two in deep stretch and held well in the end for the show. ALTITUDE chased the moderate
early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was brushed in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and missed for show. MY MAN STAN showed good
early speed, dueled through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
TWIRLING DERBY stumbled at the break, was allowed to settle in the early going, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused four wide
into the stretch, loomed approaching the furlong marker, took command in mid-stretch, pulled away in the final furlong and was hand urged to the wire.
GORDY'S BOY lunged leaving the start and was off a step slowly, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter
marker, ran evenly while within range to mid-stretch, could not match strides with TWIRLING DERBY in the late stages and ran on to secure the place.
LYING GHOST broke alertly and was hustled into the first turn, engaged with RUNAWAY KRISTIN and dueled through decent fractions with that rival to the
quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, battled with TWIRLING DERBY to the furlong grounds, weakened inside of the furlong marker and was
outfinished for the place while holding safely in the end for the show. VANISKY was allowed to settle early on, was well placed through the backstretch run,
lost a bit of ground heading to the far turn, raced two wide into the stretch and could not muster a late response. STAY LIT was shuffled back soon after the
start and trailed into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn and did not factor. RUNAWAY KRISTIN
engaged with LYING GHOST in the early stages and contested the decent fractions through the backstretch run, dueled with that foe to the quarter marker,
dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

TABLE FOR TWO broke alertly, ceded the early lead to CARDIFF CRACK and tracked that rival through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker,
advanced to confront CARDIFF CRACK nearing the quarter marker, battled with that foe to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead leaving the furlong marker, kept
to task while under firm urging to deep stretch and held sway in the final stages. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) took back off of the early pace, was well
placed through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, lost ground heading to mid-stretch, re-rallied in the late stages and was up for the
place in the final strides. CARDIFF CRACK showed early speed and was prominent into the first turn, cleared the field and dictated terms into the
backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, was confronted by TABLE FOR TWO nearing the quarter marker, dueled with that rival to
mid-stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final stages and was just edged for the place, while clear in the end for the show. NICKEL NICKEL NINE took back
off of the early pace, raced three wide along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run while well placed, came four wide along the far
turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster the needed late response. DAZZLE THE COMMAND was
forwardly placed into the first turn, chased the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn, checked slightly
leaving the three furlong marker, was shuffled back heading to the quarter marker and came up empty in the stretch. STOUT was allowed to settle, saved
ground through the backstretch run, lost contact along the far turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly, dueled with GAYLES EVENING soon after the start and carved out fast fractions with that rival to the quarter
marker, battled head and head with GAYLES EVENING to mid-stretch, continued that duel to deep stretch, was able to take a slim advantage inside of the
sixteenth-marker and determinedly kept to task in the final strides to prevail. THE GREAT HAYNES took back off of the fast early pace, raced outside of
rivals into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, could not quite reel in the winner in the final strides and was up
in time to secure the place. GAYLES EVENING broke out a step and crowded ICONIC SKY at the start, engaged with REDSTWIRLINGDANCER from the
outset and dueled with that rival through fast fractions to the quarter marker, continued to battle to mid-stretch, fought stubbornly from the inside to deep
stretch, grudgingly gave way in the final strides and was just edged for the place, while holding for the show. CIELO DIAMANTE chased the fast pace to the
turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong pole and just missed for the minor awards.
ICONIC SKY bobbled at the start then was crowded by a neighboring rival and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace from the inside, made a
steady gain along the turn and into upper stretch, was gaining into the final furlong but could not muster the needed late response.

Footnotes
APPLAUD THE BENCH broke alertly and showed the way into the first turn, contested the pace with ARISTEIA into the backstretch run then yielded the
lead to that foe and rated nicely to the second turn, stalked ARISTEIA while two wide nearing the quarter marker, overtook that rival in upper stretch and
drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, kept to task to deep stretch, drifted out under firm left-handed urging in the final stages and just lasted over the
oncoming runner-up. MOONSHINE CAT was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, came four wide into the
drive, loomed nearing mid-stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-pole, was gaining on the winner in the
final strides but just missed on the line and held safely for the place. DRESS REHEARSAL was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the solid fractions
through the backstretch run, raced closest to the top pair into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker, continued to
advance to deep stretch, came in tight in the final stages when APPLAUD THE BENCH drifted out and was outfinished in the end, while clear of the rest for
third. DANGEROUS ILLUSION broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to track the solid early pace from the second flight, raced three wide
into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. STEIN'S GIRL was unhurried in the early going, was content to trail
through the backstretch run, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and showed good late interest, while unable to threaten.
SNOW HILL was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter marker,
could not sustain that run in the stretch and gave way. ARISTEIA hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, was hustled to show early speed and
contested the early pace along the first turn, assumed command along the backstretch run and carved out decent fractions into the far turn, came under
pressure at the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

RODRIGOKNOWS pressed the decent early fractions into the turn, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, assumed command in upper
stretch, was set down for the drive and drove clear under steady urging in the final furlong. MY BUCKET LIST chased the decent early pace while outside of
rivals, made a steady advance while four wide into the stretch, came within aim at mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the final furlong and
held well in the end for the place. CAUSE FOR DIVORCE lacked early speed, saved ground along the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, advanced nearing
the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response but stayed on to secure the show. ANTHONY'S BEST bobbled at the start and was off a step
slowly, rushed up to chase the pace into the turn, advanced while three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the late
stages. DEO hopped at the break and was off slowly, was a bit green in the early running, trailed to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung
four wide for the drive and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. CURVY CURLS broke alertly and was forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the
pace while three wide between rivals on the turn and tired in the drive. BOOMING BERNARDO was hustled to show early speed and set the pressured
pace to the turn, was confronted by RODRIGOKNOWS nearing the quarter marker, could not hold that rival off leaving the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CROSBY BEACH tracked the fast early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, came within aim while three wide nearing the quarter marker,
overtook TRIBAL NATION in upper stretch, shifted to the rail and drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, came under
extreme pressure from GALLANT WARREN in deep stretch, was fully extended at the finish and just lasted for the win. GALLANT WARREN was allowed to
settle in the early stages, improved position while three wide on the far turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, made a bit of headway nearing the
furlong grounds, closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of CROSBY BEACH in deep stretch, continued to gain on that rival in the final
strides and just missed for the win, while securing the place. CONUNDRUM took back off of the fast early pace, maintained position through the backstretch
run, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to mid-stretch, was gaining in the final furlong, could not reel in the top pair in deep
stretch and was clear in the end for the show. LIL MIRACLE MAN broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace, was well placed while off of the fast
fractions through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, came two wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was unable to
offer the needed late response. CHIEF WILD EAGLE took back off of the fast early pace, raced in the second flight to the far turn, saved ground to the
quarter marker, advanced in mid-stretch, could not sustain that rally in the final furlong and finished evenly. SUGAR BEETS was unhurried, improved
position while three wide on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch run and did not threaten. TRIBAL NATION showed good early speed and
contested the pace along the first turn with STONE'S RIVER, set quick fractions while pressured to the second turn, shook free of the pressing rival nearing
the quarter marker, was overtaken by CROSBY BEACH in upper stretch, chased that one to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages. STONE'S RIVER was
prominent in the early stages, disputed the pace along the first turn then pressed TRIBAL NATION through quick fractions to the far turn, came three wide
into the second turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TURIAF popped from the gate and quickly seized the early lead, was pressed by DANCING BONBON to the inside and MAJESTIC GIG to the outside into
and through the turn, ceded the lead briefly past the three-eighths pole while still in hand, took command nearing the furlong grounds and held off a late
charge by BREVILLE to prevail. BREVILLE broke inward throwing the rider off balance then bumped with SMILE AND PROFILE a few strides out,
recovered but raced near the back of the back in the early stages, once into stride made good forward progress on the field going into the turn, tipped out six
wide into the stretch and launched a furious rally that came up a neck short. DANCING BONBON raced mid-pack down the backstretch then shifted to the
inside while making a mid-race bid approaching the half-mile pole, moved inside of TURIAF near the three-eighths pole, held a short lead at the top of the
stretch but was unable to muster a response when that foe re-rallied and got away. SMILE AND PROFILE bumped hard by BREVILLE after the break, did
not show much early speed, steadied slightly at the half mile marker when DANCING BON BON came in aggressively, made a mild move around the turn
while racing in the three path, swung seven wide into the stretch then had steady when bothered by BREVILLE once again, kept to task and was gaining
ground at the finish. CHROME'S BEST COPY broke well, tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, made a four-wide bid around the turn, tipped out
into the clear at the head of the stretch and finished up with good interest but needed a bit more. MAJESTIC GIG hustled into contention after the break,
shifted paths several times before the half, pressed TURIAF from the outside through the turn, began to lose ground near the quarter pole and was outrun
from there. SERIOUS SECRET broke out awkwardly then had to steady when DANCING BONBON took the path, rushed up into contention while angling to
the rail heading into the turn, awaited room to the top of the stretch then had no response when called upon.
