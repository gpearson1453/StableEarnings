SHADOW CHASER lacked speed, angled inside on the turn, rallied then edged clear late under steady handling. SHOW EM THE LIGHTS raced outside,
moved closer on the turn, led briefly but was caught. FRUGAL JUDE lagged far behind them showed some late energy to gain the show. LET IT FLOW JOE
raced three wide early, moved inside and flattened out. RYE WHISKEY broke alertly and went to the front, widened on the turn then gave way. STORMY
FIRE flashed speed along the inside then stopped on the turn.

HOLDTHEFLIGHT vied outside to the stretch, took over and moved clear nearing the eighth pole and was clearly best while ridden out. SUPER JOHN
reserved off the leaders, angled out into the stretch and gained the place. EXPENSIVE CUT dueled the winner along the inside and continued gamely to the
finish. SECRET ALLIANCE settled just behind the dueling leaders, flattened out in the stretch. BOSS LOGIC dropped back outside and lacked a solid rally.
OLYMPIC ROMP lacked speed saving ground and was never a factor. ONE MORE SCOOP chased close up inside then began fading after half a mile.
IRISH BOOLUM dropped back early and raced far back throughout. NONEEDTOWORRY raced at or near the back of the pack and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LOOSE ENDS settled outside the pacesetters, bid wide into the stretch and was up in the final furlong in a determined effort. BULLET BUTCH raced close
up inside, rallied in the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. DANCE CODE dropped back in the two path, angled very wide in the stretch closing
well. CAPTAIN CHAZZ set the pace, moved clear before half a mile then weakened in the stretch. CLASSIC UNION saved ground in midpack, angled out
and finishing willingly. DEPLANE broke slowest and trailed early then passed rivals late. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA lagged far behind and was never a
factor. NORTHERN EXPRESS raced just off the leaders four wide and faltered. GOLDEN TALENT chased very wide down the backstretch and turn and
faded. BORRACHO CONCHO was urged close up outside to the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
KADENS COURAGE set a clear pace off the inside, widened on the turn and stayed safe in a convincing score. JUPI'S LIGHTNING saved ground close up
and continued well to hold the place. DIZZY GILLESPIE chased three wide off the pace and rallied in the stretch. GOLDENLINEOF dropped back inside and
continued willingly. EMPIRE'S SCORE was eased back to the outside in the opening quarter and flattened out. TIO WIL trailed early racing wide and was
never a factor. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD dropped back early and was never a factor. POINTER flashed speed in the two path and gave way readily.
