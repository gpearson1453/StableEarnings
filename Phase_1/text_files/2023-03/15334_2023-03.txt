Footnotes
HULA KING Pressed pace early along rail, moved up inside leader to challenge at the seven-sixteenths pole, continued fight on rail while traveling best,
fended off challengers at the eighth and into the stretch, drew off handily. LIL LATIGO Forced four wide into the first turn, commenced a three wide move to
the lead inside the three-eighths, continued to vie around turn, came home on the wrong lead, second best. TRACK BOUND Set into the five path around
the first turn tracking the pace, moved four wide at the three-eighths to battle for the lead, remained four wide on the far turn, got out a few paths at the
eighth pole, ran evenly through the stretch. BIGGER THAN YOU Broke awkwardly outwards, led two wide into the first turn, overtaken at the
seven-sixteenths but remained in conention in a line of four, fought, faded from the sixteenth home. AMITY HARBOR Stalked three wide into the first turn,
advanced at the three-eighths pole, just short of room between without anywhere to really progress further, chased top quartet from the quarter pole to the
eighth pole, not a threat to winner. OUTLAW BY NATURE Settled off the pace on the rail, was never able to reach a challenging position. MIDNIGHT
DRAMA Stumbled at the break, the rider lost the irons and never regained them throughout the event, settled in the two pace off the pace, made a mild
move up the backside, had nothing left for the stretch run, departed with rider shortly after the wire, walked off. HAMMERING LEMON In rear throughout,
wide on both turns and never factored. A RIDERS OBJECTION FROM #6 AMITY HARBOR WAS LODGED AGAINST #4 BIGGER THAN YOU. NO
CHANGE WAS MADE.

OUR EMPIRE Travelled deepest in a line of four while contending, left to two rivals into the far turn at the quarter pole, pushed away from inner rival just
inside the three-sixteenths, dominated stretch. EDINBURGH EXPRESS Dueled between early, left to hold hold and battle at the quarter pole, could not
match the winner. DARKSABER Vied early while chasing top trio, bowed out from the four horse battle just outside the quarter pole, swung to the four path
into the lane, came home evenly. SHELBY R. Broke best, vied three wide, backed out at the quarter pole, finished off with mild interest. NIGHTHAWK
SPECIAL Tracked off the pace and off the rail, never a threat. BECOME AN INSIDER Ran detached in the back, never contended.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR Sent and led throughout, shifted out a path from rail positioning around the third and final turn, saw off all comers. CHEF Tracked along
the rail, advanced inside at the three-eighths, tried to take advantage of hole at the eighth pole, staved off by the winner. STRAUS'S PLACE In the rear early
along the rail, commenced at the quarter pole and picked up well, split rivals into the lane, just had too much to do. BIG CITY BANE Settled in back along
the three path, dove inside of rivals at the three-eighths, made steady progression around the final bend, ran evenly through the lane. COURAGEOUS
Pressed the leader and eventual winner from the outset in the two path, maintained position until dropping out at the quarter pole. BACK TO BUSINESS Set
up in a pocket behind leader and presser into first turn, dropped back steadily in first run by the stands, shifted to the four path around second turn, emptied
from there. BULLY RIDE Traveled off the pace two wide, gave way at the three-eighths, never a threat to anyone.

MINISTERSDON'TLIE Hustled hard to the lead, settled up the backstretch, waved goodbye to the field at the quarter pole, trounced the competition. SAN
GIORGIO Settled in behind runners early, moved three wide up the backside, fully commenced at the five-sixteenths and advanced widest of all, continued
steady gain while being forced four wide through the lane, a clear second best in the wake of a no doubt winner. OMACHE KID Stalked in the four path into
the first turn, traveled kindly in the two path up to the quarter pole when asked by rider, ran evenly through the stretch. TIGER BY HIS TAIL Tracked in
behind top flight runners early, scrubbed at the five-sixteenths to present more feet, was no match to the top trio when the running got going. TIZ A SPEED
BOMB Forced to press two wide when unable to outfoot MINISTERSDON'TLIE to the lead, tried to keep up with that rival but he shook clear, allowed to
move to the rail and try to fight up to the three-sixteenths, gave way shortly after.

Forced five wide in a line of five into the first turn, had to stalk, advanced in the four path at the five-sixteenths pole, presented a mild gain, unable to match
