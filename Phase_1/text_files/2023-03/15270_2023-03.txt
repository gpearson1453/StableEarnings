Footnotes
RED HOT MOON was unhurried early entering the first turn, then saved ground on the backstretch, was gamely gaining throughout the far turn to close
fastest down the lane to be up just in time. HOT TUB HOTTIE set the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout he
second turn, then continued to hold the lead down the homestretch but was caught late by an outer rival and was second best. MRS. KRINKLES was in a
steady drive to chase the pace from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn, then bid down the lane to close well for the show prize.
FROSTY FLIRT raced along the rail in the middle of the field heading into the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn to come up evenly in the
stretch. FADED MEMORIES tracked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, was in a steady drive entering the final furlongs to make a mild bid in the
late stretch but it was too little too late. KIM'S TEXAS BLING tracked the pace in the middle of the field while two wide on the backstretch, then slowly faded
throughout the second turn, then bid in the stretch and was no menace. AFFICIONADO (FR) chased the pace from the inside into the far turn to bid in the
stretch but never fired. TOP TEN DUCHESS trailed behind the field throughout the course and was no factor.

Footnotes
STREET TAPPER raced in the middle of the pack from the two path heading into the first turn, was well reserved on the backstretch to bid on the far turn
from the four path, dug in gamely in the early stretch then shook clear to hold onto the win in the end. HONOR GIVEN was unhurried early then saved
ground on the backstretch while five wide, was eagerly gaining ground on the second turn to close willingly for the place position. AUSTIN CITY GIRL was
two wide while heading into the first turn to chase the leader down the backstretch, then was moving up to duel for the lead on the far turn, continued to bid
gamely in the stretch then gave way in the end. GRASS QUEEN was allowed to settle on the backstretch while two wide, was moving up throughout the
turn to bid in the stretch and was closing well but it was not enough. IMA SKY TRAVELER chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive to make a
mild bid on the second turn then flattened out in the stretch. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE settled along the inside on the backstretch, then bid in the early stretch
and passed tiring foes and was no threat. BALLERINI set the pace leaving the gate and heading into the backstretch, then was challenged by an outer rival
on the far turn, was used up and tired in the stretch. GEE SHE'S PRETTY tracked the pace from the two path, then dropped back slowly between horses on
the backstretch and had no final bid in the end.

Footnotes
HERN was nicely rated along the inside on the backstretch, then bid gamely on the second turn to draw off in the stretch proving best in the end. BIG
BERNIE chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive to bid from the four path on the second turn, rallied in the stretch but it was not enough to
catch the leader. TALE TWISTER raced in the middle of the field from the two path while saving ground on the backstretch into the second turn, then rallied
in the early stretch from the four path and was closing well in the end. PAST VISIONS stalked the leader down the backstretch from the two path, was
moving up eagerly throughout the far turn to menace three wide entering the stretch but flattened out instead. LIONS NOT SHEEP raced in the middle of the
field while three wide on the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER settled early
while three wide on the backstretch, then bid in the early stretch and was no threat. LOVING LUCKY was unhurried early while two wide on the backstretch,
then bid in the upper stretch and was no threat. FIND NEW ROADS showed the way into the first turn and onto the backstretch, was in a long drive, then
was used up on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. KING KONGO settled along the inside throughout the course and failed to rally.
