Footnotes
SHOW EM THE LIGHTS took control inside then held rival safe throughout under a steady drive. RUN FOR KARL pursued the pacesetter throughout but
could not get by under constant pressure. EL GRAN CUYAYA chased in the two path then went evenly through the stretch. KANE angled inside early,
moved out in the stretch with a mild rally. ALIGNMENT chased along the inside and flattened out in the stretch. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY dropped far behind
then passed fading rivals. ENANO trailed to the stretch and was never a factor. SETTE STELLE raced well behind three wide and weakened steadily.
FRUGAL JUDE was urged off the leaders outside and gave way readily.

CUP OF LIFE vied for the early lead under confident handling, took charge nearing the turn, moved away, drifted out some in the stretch run, drew off and
was ridden out. BET ON DRAMA vied outside for the early lead, then chased the winner on the turn, was no threat and remained well clear for the place
spot. ONLY GIRL chased along the rail, chased on the turn, raced evenly in the lane and earned the show spot. RUBY DOOBY DOO raced off the rail, off
the pace, moved up at the quarter pole and closed belatedly inside. PEACEMON chased close up early on the outside and tired. COUSIN MARIE raced off
the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. FLORA raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. WILD KEYLIMAR vied close up early
on, then chased between rivals and gave way.

NORTH POLE set the pace on the inside, sueled with MY BOY COLTON on the backside, shook free from that rival on the far turn, drew clear and then was
kept to the task in the final furlong. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied steadily outside in the
stretch run and was along for the place spot. MY BOY COLTON pressed the pace racing close up outside early on, then dueled with NORTH POLE on the
backside, coult not stay with that rival on the far turn and gradually weakened on the rail. JUNGLHERLY LOVE raced four wide early, then settled off the
pace inside, advanced on the far turn and lacked a stretch rally. DOCTOR MAGIC trailed the field and passed tired rivals. WHIRLY'S BACK raced off the
pace inside, chased and faded. PRINCIPE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. CAMP COFFEE was forced outside five wide entering the first
turn, settled two wide off the pace and gave way.

HORSE BE WITH YOU forced the pace outside, led into the stretch, then edged clear following a long drive. SCOOP DAWG settled inside the dueling
leaders, angled out in the stretch and was up for the place. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM set a pressured pace inside, was collared on the final turn and
continued willingly. WE BE THERE was firmly rated off the pace then failed to respond when asked. EDDIE'S CHARGE prompted the pace briefly inside
then gave way readily. FEARLESS FLY trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA showed sharp early speed from the outset, opened up a comfortable lead, responded when roused turning for home and was kept
to the task through the lane. BRODY'S CODE chased the leader racing along the inside, continued willingly in the stretch and remained clear for the place
spot. WHATSAGIZMO stalked three wide, then four wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and closed for third. CLOUDY TIMES was off slowly, moved up
three wide in the early stages, chased inside on the turn and weakened in the stretch. SOCIAL LADY raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. BRUNO BARBER GIRL was outrun early and passed tired rivals. GETAWAY PALACE was outrun early and passed tired foes.
JAVA'S LUCKY LADY chased two wide, chased on the turn and faded. ICE was off slowly, raced three or four wide off the pace, came wide for the drive
and failed to threaten. NOW ACT SURPRISED raced off the pace between rivals, steadied at the quarter pole and did not factor.

the front early, battled when hooked then weakened. CLASSIC UNION lacked speed inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. ALTA FOX chased
wide early, moved inside in the stretch and flattened out. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA dropped far behind then passed rivals while no menace.
WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS lacked speed and was never in contention. COLES CONUNDRUM urged off the leaders outside for half a mile and faltered.
RENEWING VOWS trailed early and was always outrun. WILKINSON WARRIOR raced within range of leaders early and gave way readily. ROAN

DAYDREAMING BOY tracked close up on the inside, waited for room behind horses from the quarter pole to eighth pole, swung out for a clear path, closed
willingly outside and won going away. MCCRAKENS GHOST stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled outside rivals in upper stretch,
rallied to a short lead, then was no match for the winner. PARKERNESS vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely between rivals in the
lane and earned the show spot. ALL EYES ON YOU vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely on the rail and weakened late. PROFESSOR
KOOL raced off the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. HARLEY'S CHARLY was outrun.
