Footnotes
NORGAY away without apparent mishap, was the outermost of three contending for the top, mostly from the three path, began to shake free of the others
during the late stages of the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole when asked for more, responded and steadily kicked clear.
ACHILLES HEEL was put to a firm hold shortly after the field had been sent on its way, kept watch on the dispute a little up ahead, two to three wide, saw
the pilot resort to a drive a few strides past the the half mile pole, stayed within striking distance, stepped into the stretch and continued its pursuit in earnest,
checked when bumped into by an errant AFJAN with approximately a sixteenth to go, recovered with good courage and won the place. AFJAN set up
towards the two path after the start, was in between rivals vying for the command until late on the turn, came under stronger handling right around the
five-sixteenths marker, was shaken off, came out twice, the second time after some left side stick work, bumped into the runner up, went on to lose out on
second to that one. LEGENDARY LORE three wide onto the turn, swung out one path wider exiting it, failed to get involved. CLASH A. J. a bit sluggish on
the chute, dove onto the inside route by its conclusion, went on to save ground to no avail. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT bobbled soon after the start, displayed no
ill effects and moved up into a forward position, showed the way on a narrow advantage, feeling pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside, ventured
onward under same scenario until the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, came under a drive at that station, fell back, then fell back even more in
the lane. There was a General Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident in deep stretch before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared
official.

MIDTOWN LIGHTS chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a furlong out,
edged away under a drive kept to task. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT hustled from the gate, came inwards placing rivals in tight briefly before being corrected,
dueled from the two path with LUNA LOCA to her inside, took over sole command at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under
challenge, dug in and was collared a furlong out, ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. SWEETEST PRINCESS chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home, proved no match for the top pair while along well clear and best of the rest.
MONROE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired. LAVON chased three to four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. HARLAN'S BOND hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. LUNA LOCA hustled from the gate, dueled inside of I'MHAVINGAMOMENT, came under
coaxing and was headed at the five-sixteenths, faded and spun just off the inside for home, then faltered in the drive.

MOMMASGOTTARUN chased two to three wide advancing on the front to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning three wide
for home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. HONEY MONEY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. MOVIE MOXY got brushed at the start
by TONED UP, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. TONED UP
broke out a step at the start brushing MOVIE MOXY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide for
home, offered up a belated bid. PHAROAH'S HEART chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing when taking command
near the three-eighths, got headed inside the five-sixteenths and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish. SELF ISOLATION
showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing and was displaced from command at the
three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
TEN CENT TOWN coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with ON THE LEDGE to his inside, took over command near the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming out slightly under a left handed stick just inside the eighth pole and again near the sixteenth
marker, came under threat from EMPIRE SKY, employed a left handed crop once more four jumps from the finish and bumped with his main danger before
holding on under correction with the left rein at the wire. EMPIRE SKY coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong, dug in latched on to the outside through the final
sixteenth and was bumped four jumps from the finish and missed on the wire. ON THE LEDGE coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of TEN CENT TOWN
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SCHERZANDO coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home
and weakened. TIE BREAKER chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. SUPERB SURPRISE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CENTRAL STATION
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired. STONECOLDWARRIOR chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, offered little. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch focusing on TEN CENT
TOWN bumping EMPIRE SKY. After review the order was allowed to stand the result was declared official.
