HIT BY A WAVE led the way on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and pulled clear in the stretch. EXPRESS
PHAROAH raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the five path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late. ROYAL SQUEEZE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend and kept on in the lane.
BLAME BISHOP pressed the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. GOLOVKIN tracked the pace
setters on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. MR LIGHTNING BOY was
away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and was never a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE FIVE, MR LIGHTNING BOY, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES
WERE MADE.

on to the finish. NINETY NINE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground late. DAMASO chased the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, and faded in the stretch. REDIFINED raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside early, began a bid from the five path coming around the bend and flattened out in the lane. MOTOWN MISCHIEF led the way on the inside up the

Footnotes
PRINCESS TERESKA raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn, cut in upper stretch and
pulled clear in the final furlong. FEEL LIKE GUESSING dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the
bend, kicked clear in the lane and was caught late. RAIN OF BLESSING tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
four path, switched to the outside when PRINCESS TERESKA cut in near the eight pole and chased the winner home from there. SOLDAT TEMPTATION
raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position mildly in the stretch. TOOSWEETFORME dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and weakened in the lane. SONGTELLER raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside early, dropped back from the two path coming around the turn and was empty in the stretch. FABULOUS PHILLY chased the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane. POLITICAL ASTRAY was reluctant to load, walked out of
the gate, hopping up in the process and generally just getting away slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not a
factor. THE TRAINER OF HORSE SIX, RAIN OF BLESSING, FILED AN OBJECTION CITING INTERFERENCE AGAINST HORSE FIVE, PRINCESS
TERESKA, IN UPPER STRETCH. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS ALSO MADE INTO THE START CONCERNING HORSE EIGHT, POLITICAL ASTRAY.
UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINSIH FOR EITHER INSTANCE.
