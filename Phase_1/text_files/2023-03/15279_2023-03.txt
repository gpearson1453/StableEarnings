STEPPER broke a step slow, trailed down the backstretch, circled her field at will on the far turn, made the lead nearing the top of the stretch then widened
the balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out. DATTTSAFANCYFOX stalked the early pace, slipped through along the rail to make
the lead nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. ALSANAH had speed from the start, moved up three wide before a half, then was
outfinished. LADY GIULIANA away alertly, set the pace into the far turn, kept pressure into the stretch two wide and faded late. WILDCAT DREAM failed to
menace. PACIFIC GROVE pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE

Footnotes
AZTEC EMPIRE unhurried early, closed willingly five then three wide, made the lead before the furlong marker and won under brisk handling. DEBDURITE
stalked the pace along the inside, split horses nearing the quarter pole then couldn't handle the winner despite a game effort. KING ANDRES pressed the
pace two then three wide into the far turn, gained a narrow lead, battled into the stretch then was outfinished. VISKI JONES moved up six wide on the far
turn then leveled off. GEH SCHNELL brushed at the start, offered a mild bid four wide on the second turn then failed to sustain that bid. ADANO failed to
menace. GOTSOMEMOJO was no factor. AULD LANGE SYNE settled mid pack, advanced five wide on the far turn then came up empty. VALEROSO set
a pressured pace along the inside for nearly six furlongs then folded. HONORABLE was brushed at the start, hung five wide through the clubhouse turn,
prompted the pace three wide into the far turn then flattened out. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE UNAVAILABLE. FINAL
TIME WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS PROVIDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
LOVELY LISA away alertly, set pressured all the pace under pressure, dug in late two wide and prevailed under brisk handling. CALLMEMARTHAJANE
never far back, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch and just missed in a determined effort. SLICKSNEAKYANDFAST allowed to settle, found her
best stride late inside rivals. HONORIFIQUE trailed early, swung outside and closed a gap late four wide. YEARS AGO stalked the pace in the five path into
the stretch and faded late. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING pressured the winner two wide into the stretch and weakened late. SKY was no factor. GRAY ROYALITY
had good early speed inside and was through after a half. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME
WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS PROVIDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
