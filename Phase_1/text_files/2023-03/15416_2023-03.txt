TOOTUFFTOSWALLOW Pressed into the first turn two wide and opened up with rival to the backside, kept dueling with inner foe while further distancing
from other trio in field, took clear command just inside the quarter pole while still in the two path, drifted off straight course to the five path as field made way
into the stretch, joined by another foe inside who was mitigated at the sixteenth pole, re-engaged and drew off. LILY PAD LAKE Joined in a line of three into
the first turn, allowed inner two to run off and stalked off of them three wide, commenced move in the three path at the quarter pole, dove inside of drifting
rival at the eighth pole and surged hard at foe but was repelled at the sixteenth pole. IDA NEEDA DRINK Tracked off the pace in the four path after being
forced four deep into the first turn, maintained position until making a mild move at the three-sixteenths, passed a tiring rival for show awards. TECATE
GOLD Held the rail into the first turn, went on with outside rival and match-raced up the backstretch in a fierce duel that she lost at the quarter pole, giving
way and fading through the lane. WE WANT ANOTHER Always lagged behind the other four runners and never had an impact on the outcome of the race.

Footnotes
TEXAS LONG BOW Settled in the second flight on the inner portion of the track, maintained position until commencing a bold rally at the three-sixteenths,
switched to the clear in the two path at the eighth pole when taking the lead, drew off confidently. EDINBURGH EXPRESS Was hard on the muscle early
and opened up a hefty advantage early, led until being overhauled at the eighth pole, switched to the two path shortly after for a rebid that was held at bay,
a clear second best. HARROVIAN Stalked three wide into the first turn, dropped back marginally up the backstretch while traveling in the three path,
re-engaged at the three-sixteenths and gained well for show awards. BAD KARMA Settled well off the hot early pace on the rail, continually progressed up
the backstretch, fully began pursuit while picking up well on the rail from the quarter to the eighth pole, move flattened out through the lane. ROCKED
Outrun early and trailed, never improved and only passed one tiring. ROUGE SUNSET Stalked two wide into the first turn, chased throughout, swung four to
five wide on the turn beginning at the quarter pole while dropping back, gave way.

LOW DOSE Led from the outset, opened up on the field at the five-sixteenths, won as easily as could be. HUGHIE'S HOLIDAY Let inner rivals go on and
cleared to the rail while sitting in a pocket on the first turn, progressed through the backside attempting to threaten the leader but was never able to get in
reach of that foe. JUSTIN'S LADY Missed the break a touch, was unable to find cover while traveling three wide into the first turn, ran along in the four path
through the backstretch, asked at the three-eighths without showing much response, mildly picked up at the eighth pole in the four path and to the wire but
never threatened. RETURN TO HARBOR Pressed the leader two wide into the first turn, let that rival get away in the run up the backstretch, saddle slipped
and jogged home from there.

Footnotes
PEACE OF EKATI Stumbled at the start but recovered to take up the running in the second flight, switched to the two path to move between horses at the
quarter pole and into the far turn, sustained bid through the bend, took command around the sixteenth and drew away. ROYAL TAP Dueled two wide from
the break, moved to the lead at the quarter pole, kept top spot through the turn, battled in a line of three between horses down the stretch, no match for
winner. FIGHT ME Led on the rail into the first turn while being pressured outside throughout, overtaken at the quarter pole, kept fighting up to the sixteenth
pole but had nothing left. SHARK HARBOR Chased dueling leaders throughout along the two path, ran evenly when asked at the quarter pole, stayed even
through the stretch and never threatened for better finish. LIL LATIGO Moved in the four path on the first turn, maintained position up the backside, tried to
keep pace three wide while still in the second flight on the second turn and never menaced when the running got going. GENERAL THAYER Settled in a
solid rhythm just in behind leaders in run to the first turn but became uncomfortable between an outer rival and the rail, got out on that first bend and ended
up in the rear, lagged from that point and never regained touch with the field.
