Footnotes
MAGIC CARPET settled last but one racing inside, saved ground through the turn and put to urging at the top of the stretch, drove past along the inside
seventy yards from home. ROBERT WHO tracked the pacesetter from inside, switched outside that one and took closer order on the turn racing about three
wide, asked for more midway on that bend, edged past the leader coming past the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner while second best.
SERENDIP RULER set the pace racing off the rail, lacked the needed late kick. VISION OF ELIAS chased briefly from outside, dropped back and failed to
rally. MUCHO BLING switched off the inside, trailed up the backstretch, failed to menace.

BILLIE BABY broke a half-step slowly and was urged forward to track the pace from inside, moved out a bit for room at the top of the stretch and was put to
urging, struck the lead a sixteenth out, edged away and held safe. EASTER VISION set the pace inside, was challenged by mid-stretch and worn down but
clearly second best. BOTTLES AN BIBLES was encouraged to press the pace outside two to three wide, could not keep up with the top pair in the stretch
but was best of the rest. DEVINE CANDY got away alertly, chased going three to four wide on the turn, tired. GOSPEL GLORY was encouraged along four
to five wide on the turn but never near enough to threaten. JANE'S COURSE swung six wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TEQUILA REVOLUTION bumped a rival twice after the break, moved clear heading to the first turn and shifted in early on that bend to set the pace, was
pressed by an outside foe late up the backstretch, shook clear leaving the far turn and drew away while being kept to the task. GOLDBRIDGE was bumped
twice soon after the break, settled in to stalk three to four wide off the leader, was within striking distance coming to the top of the stretch but no match for
the winner while second best. LOST GOLD bumped a rival at the start, stalked the eventual winner, moved forward to apply pressure heading to the far turn,
went two to three wide on that bend, asked for more before the top of the stretch and weakened. J R ORCHESTRATE settled off the leaders racing near but
off the rail, moved out a bit on the far turn, never launched a rally. CLASSIC SHINE switched off the rail early racing two wide and toward the back into the
first turn, continued off the rail moving out a bit on the far turn, was never a threat. ARCH OF SWORDS was caught three wide on the first turn, shifted in up
the backstretch, was never near enough to threaten. KONA SHOT was bumped at the break, saved ground to no avail.

second best. REVEREND AJ moved forward inside a rival but off the fence to duel for the lead, weakened. YOU SEXY BOY bumped on both sides at the
start, raced in behind off the pace two to three wide through the turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on. JUST CHILLIN dueled three wide, weakened.

PEARL'S CODE settled last but one, took closer order on the turn, was given some encouragement at the quarter pole, moved out a bit at the top of the
stretch seeking room then back toward the rail, bid inside in mid-stretch and edged clear late. BOUJEE BRITT was coaxed forward inside runners to set the
pace racing off the rail, drifted just a bit in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but held the place from SAYAAD AIN'T SO, who pursued the leading
pair outside four wide, moved closer turning into upper stretch and kept on willingly. GODDESS OF WONDER stalked the pace three wide, weakened.
MISS COFFEYVILLE was outpaced and failed to menace.

EXCETERA set the pace racing off the rail, raced in the two path through the turn, drifted nearer the rail in upper- to mid-stretch and held sway. C C THE
BARTENDER was coaxed forward at the start, tracked from inside, lacked room in upper stretch then switched out at the furlong marker, closed the gap
late. BIG TINY raced outside a rival three wide toward the rear and was a bit hard to control into the turn, moved out four wide for the drive, ran between
runners near mid-stretch and improved position inside ACERTIVE MISS, who stalked four wide, lacked the needed late kick. SAILSINTHESUNSET chased
from outside going three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. MUSICAL MILLIE raced off the pace near the rail, came out leaving the turn, was five
wide in upper stretch and ran on. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

CALIBRATE was reserved at the rear racing two to three wide off the leaders, moved out five wide coming to the quarter pole, took aim and under steady
urging surged past late. ROYALLY set the pace racing off the rail, was challenged entering the far turn, dueled from the three-eighths, was clearly headed in
upper stretch but kept on late while drifting out a bit to defeat the sparring partner but was no match for the winnewr. UNITED PATRIOT hit the gate, was
caught four wide on the first turn moving forward, engaged the leader from outside late up the backstretch, dueled from the three-eighths putting a head in
front in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. CASEYS MEMORY tracked up close inside saving ground, asked for more by the quarter pole but had
no response and ran on evenly. ROWDY RASCAL pursued the leaders three to four wide, lacked a late bid. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
SINNIN N GRINNIN attended the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn, had command past the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in upper- to
mid-stretch but held well and was geared down in the final strides. FIGHTINGTEMPTATION was forwardly-placed, vied for the lead between runners two to
three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit in the stretch but kept on while no match for the winner but second best. OH NIKI settled in behind runners in the
three path into the turn, angled five wide turning for home, ran on to get up for show honors over LOVELY LOLITA, who set the pace racing inside, faced
outside pressure into and on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SERENDIPITY COCO raced outside the second flight three to four wide on the turn, was
encouraged along past the three-eighths but had no rally. SIGICRICKET bumped a rival at the start, chased from between runners two to three wide in the
second flight on the turn, had no rally. LENA'S SHADOW was bumped at the break and consequently a bit slow into stride, pursued from inside the second
flight but made no bid. NOODLE SALAD got away slowly and lost the path at the start, was ridden along but had no response.

Footnotes
WESTCOAST BREEZE raced off the leading pair mid-pack, advanced three to four wide on the turn making a bid by the quarter pole, was clear by upper
stretch and held well. SAZON was outside mid-division, ridden along three furlongs out going four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep
and finished well to gain the place. BABY LIAISON rated in behind the leaders in the three path through the turn, moved out a bit turning into upper stretch
and ran on. SUPER SIZER settled at the back inside, swung six wide for the drive and improved position. CAPTAIN DOZER dueled outside a foe two wide,
weakened. C C'S LEGACY was bumped at the break, moved forward to set the pace, dueled inside, gave way. INDIAN SKY chased near the inside, failed
to menace. GIT AROUND BROWN bumped a rival and was away awkwardly, moved up racing three wide and between foes into the turn but off the
leaders, failed to rally. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED UPON REVIEW.
