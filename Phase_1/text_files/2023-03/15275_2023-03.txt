Footnotes
KHOPILOT stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the far turn, drifted in at the quarter pole, matched strides through the stretch three then two
wide and proved best in a stiff drive. WELLER ROGUE allowed to settle, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
SILVER MATT pressed the pace along the inside then two wide until mid stretch, altered course three wide near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished.
CATCHING MAGIC moved up four wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. PRETTY LOUD passed tiring rivals. SOUPER PRONTO had good
early speed along the inside then faded. INGERSOLL away alertly, set the pace into the far turn, checked between horses at the quarter pole when in tight
and dropped out of it. PASION AZTECA was through after a half. THS STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF INGERSOLL
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF KHOPILOT AND SILVER MATT FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE. AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KHOPILOT AND PLACED HIM SEVENTH. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE SEVEN EIGHTHS TIME
WAS UNAVAILABLE.

empty. BON DEUX contested the lead along the inside into the far turn then flattened out. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF inside, was through after a half. DUE TO A

Footnotes
BROADWAY SKY away alertly, set the pace while nicely rated, responded under mild right handed urging and won going away. TONKAWA SPRINGS
stalked the early pace three wide, loomed boldly two wide into the far turn then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. ROSE'S PEPINO
bore out at the start bumping TARAASHOQ, was unhurried early, got out on the far turn then finished with good courage three wide once straightened out
for the drive. FLOCKED stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide midway on the second turn then was outfinished. PRIVATE CONNIE chased the
winner around the first turn, drew closer to apply pressure two wide before a half then failed to sustain that bid. TARAASHOQ was bumped at the start then
no factor. ALFIO failed to menace. DAWN WEST was no threat.
