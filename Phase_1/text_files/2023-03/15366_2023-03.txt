Footnotes
WELDON G was lightly brushed at the start, moved forward under early coaxing, set the pace racing off the fence and facing outside pressure, was
engaged more thoroughly coming past the midpoint of the turn, dueled while drifting out and under right-handed urging through the stretch and edged clear
fending off that sparring partner. BLUESKIESANDANGELS got away alertly, settled in to press the pace from outside going three wide, drew nearly even
past the five-sixteenths, put to urging past the quarter pole, dueled till late stretch while being carried out and was only second best. IRA CHAMP broke
outwardly, stalked the leading pair four wide, was no match. HES BIG CHIEF broke a step slowly then was allowed to settle into stride at the back racing off
the inside, moved out five wide and closer to the leaders coming to the five-sixteenths pole when put to urging, lacked the needed late kick. JEANO broke
outwardly brushing a rival lightly, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MESSAGE DISCIPLINE moved forward inside a rival soon after the break to set the pace racing just off the rail, came out a bit in upper stretch, held rivals
at bay. MAGNET AND STEEL broke a half-step slowly, moved up inside saving ground on the turn, came out a bit at the top of the stretch then back inside,
attempted to rally inside the leader but could make no headway while securing the place over MASTER RED, who got away alertly but ceded the lead
content to press from outside the eventual winner going three wide on the turn, could not match strides with that one and was outfinished for second. WHAT
ABOUT JIMMY was encouraged at the break, chased five wide, went evenly. NORTHERN ORBIT broke a half-step slowly, moved up between runners
going two to three wide into the turn, failed to rally. CRAFTY SWORD dropped back while lacking speed up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, had
no late kick. MR GYPSY pursued the leaders four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
CAMANCHE RIVER attended the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn, engaged for the lead turning for home, dueled outside and edged
past a rival late under moderate urging. LUCKY MCCOY prompted the pace two to three wide between runners, took a narrow lead leaving the turn but was
quickly challenged and overtaken by an outside rival, fought on dueling gamely inside that one but was outfinished. EASTER JIM stalked from outside the
second flight three to four wide through the turn, kept on to secure show honors while no threat to the top pair. ST PATRICKS SWORD set a pressured
pace inside but just off the rail, drifted out a bit in the stretch while weakening. CRYPTO MINER tracked inside the second flight, saved ground advancing
some on the turn but could only run on evenly. SERVICEMAN chased two to three wide and between runners in the second flight, failed to rally. MR.
SMOKEY lacked early speed and was outpaced.

Footnotes
GOSPEL BUZZ was reserved at the rear, advanced some along the inside on the far turn, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, took aim and drove
past seventy yards from the wire under steady handling. EARS TO ME stalked from outside three to four wide, moved closer to take a narrow lead past the
three-eighths, was clear by upper stretch but outkicked while second best. DOMINANT OKIE pressed three wide then moved closer early up the backstretch
to force the issue, vied between runners on the far turn, kept on gamely under stout urging to fight for show honors over DENS DEVILLE, who got away well
and quickly moved clear while shifting in, set the pace on or just off the rail but was soon overtaken, contended inside up the backstretch and on the far turn,
was outkicked and lost the battle for third. PRINCE CAROLINA J rated in behind and between runners in the second flight early, fanned four wide turning for
home, failed to rally. COUNTRY BRAVE was urged forward at the break but then forced to rate inside off heels early up the backstretch, pursued the
leading pair into the far turn coming off the inside for that bend, dropped back and made no late bid.

Footnotes
ADRIA settled off the pace mid-pack, began to advance three then four wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the eighth pole and drove clear. OKIE
FRONT tracked from inside, got the nod for place over BENDELENE, who was encouraged along early, moved out from the three to the five path on the
turn and put to strong urging late on that bend, kept on but just missed the place. LIGHTNING HART got away alertly albeit breaking outwardly just a bit
then was given some encouragement and moved clear by a few lengths, set the tempo in the two path, weakened in the stretch. COST A FORTUNE
pursued the pacesetter two to three wide outside a rival, failed to rally. TAYLOR'S VISION was in just a hair tight at the start, settled at the rear, saved
ground on the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

BIG NORTHERN RIVER stalked off the leaders, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch and cleared. KICK IT AGAIN
BOB bumped with a foe lightly at the start, moved forward outside three to four wide into the turn, bid and took a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, was
just clear at the top of stretch but soon overtaken and outkicked. BLAKE FROM TISH got away alertly, settled off the leader to stalk, advanced racing
between foes into the turn two to three wide on that bend, was in just a hair tight at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. ROWDY GALE raced
inside, came out four wide turning for home, ran on. CAT NAMED HERCULES had bumps on both sides at the start, was encouraged along racing off the
inside at the back, failed to menace. BIRD TALK bumped the outside rival at the start then was urged forward to set the pace, vied inside on or just off the
rail early on the turn, came up empty for the stretch.

STOLEN KISSES pursued the pace from inside, engaged in a duel in upper stretch, edged rivals under steady urging. DODGEBALL set the pace racing off
the rail and facing outside pressure, asked for more in upper stretch when engaged by an inside rival, dueled with that one and was outfinished but saved
the place. GOSPEL SISTER raced off the pace and outside, went four then five wide on the turn, was gaining late but missed. EURA NORTHERN SKY was
off the pace, advanced inside a foe three wide then moved out four deep on the turn, gained steadily in late stretch but needed more. THE VEGAS BOMB
pressed from outside four wide, started dropping back on the turn, steadied near the quarter pole, ran on. SAENGER STAR hit the gate, raced at the back
near the inside, made no bid. RUN DOTTIE RUN pressed the early pace three wide and between, came up empty.

NOSTALGIA broke outwardly just a bit, attended the pace from outside, took a narrow lead past the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, kicked
clear and was asked in mid-stretch, held safe. ITSONLYMONEYHONEY settled off the pace while shifting in to go in the two path on the turn and advancing
inside, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, had good late stride to be gaining but was too late. NAUGHTY NATALIE was very lightly brushed at the
start, raced forwardly inside in behind the leaders into the turn, came out four wide turning for home, ran on to secure show honors. SMOKING GUITAR had
brief foot three wide between runners, dropped back heading to the turn, moved out five wide turning for home and ran on. PAYDIEM was in just a bit tight
at the start and outpaced early racing in the three path into the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, was never a threat. COLD AS YOU brushed a
rival just lightly at the start, set a pressured pace racing in the two path, weakened. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL chased three to four wide, faded.

Footnotes
HE'S MUNNIE pressed the pace from the outset, moved to the lead outside the seven-sixteenths and was well clear by the three-eighths racing in the two
path on the turn, maintained a clear advantage into late stretch and just lasted under steady urging. HEROIC SONG broke a step slowly, steadily advanced
outside rivals four wide on the turn, surged in late stretch under stout encouragement but just missed. CANEY'S GHOST settled mid-pack tracking inside on
or just off the rail, kept on well in the lane to secure show honors. RIVER RULER raced off the pace four to five wide, asked for more run about the
five-sixteenths, improved position. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL settled toward the back racing off the inside, fanned seven wide into the stretch and improved.
MEAN CANNON switched off the rail early, raced evenly and made on bid. PROUD MOMENTS was in tight just after the break and raced unhurriedly early,
passed tired rivals. GONNA GETCHA set a pressured race just off then on the rail, gave way. MORO MERICA chased the leaders three to five wide, came
up empty.

Footnotes
GHOST HERO pressed from outside three wide, took command past the three-eighths, drifted nearer the rail turning into upper stretch once clear then back
out, extended the margin while being kept to the task. HUNTER QUICK broke inwardly a bit, settled off the pace three wide into and on the turn, swung six
wide for the stretch run, drifted out a bit but secured the place while no threat to the winner. FRIGERATOR was forced in at the start, switched off the inside
early racing toward the back going four wide through much of the turn, fanned seven wide for the drive, was carried out a bit and got up for show honors.
DANCING DEVIL chased outside five wide, kept on evenly. CONNORS OUTLAW stumbled at the start, chased four wide, lacked the needed late kick. I'M
CRENSHAW settled inside, angled eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. CINCO STEVE was coaxed forward, vied inside briefly, was done by
the seven-sixteenths, dropped back and faded. KWONTRO vied between runners then inside the winner, came up empty and faded.
