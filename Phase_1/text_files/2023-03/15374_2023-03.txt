LADY LANA sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by VALUE DANCER nearing the three-eighths
marker, vied with that rival and drew off through the final furlong with complete authority. VALUE DANCER chased the winner while racing five-wide, moved
up to engage nearing the three-eighths pole, vied but could not match strides with that foe in the drive. FAST TO FORTUNE lagged early, raced five-wide
through the second turn and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SEVEN-EIGHTHS TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
K P HARRY KITTY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane, reached the fore with a
sixteenth to run and drew off. DADDY'SFAVORITESON settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally.
ANGRY EMMY broke sharply to duel for the lead from off the rail and gave way through the final sixteenth. FINE POINT ASSAY lacked early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn angled in with a furlong to go and again nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. TED'S CANDY GIRL was never far back,
angled out in mid-stretch and gave way in the drive. VALDINI was off slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a
furlong to run, steadied and lost chance. GRANDIOSE SUMMER disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. FULL OF WINE
showed brief speed and weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF VALDINI IN MID-STRETCH
AND AFTER REVIEWNG THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH TED'S CANDY GIRL HAD DRIFTED OUT AND FINE POINT ASSAY HAD DRIFTED IN
TO CAUSE THE INFRACTIION AND DISQUALIFIED TED'S CANDY GIRL TO SIXTH AND FINE POINT ASSAY TO FIFTH. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED. SOME TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
GIVE EM HECK BECK was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker,
opened a clear margin and held off the closing BARNFIELD to prevail. BARNFIELD lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out
into the stretch and was gaining on the winner late. MONGOL ALTAI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
rallied late. EXECUTIVE ACTION was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. OUR
VALLEY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going five furlongs. FRISCO KID was void of early speed, raced off
the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. IN THE MIDST was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened.
FORGOTTEN VOWS lagged early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. SOME TIMES
CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
