Footnotes
GIANT CRITIC tracked four wide, rallied on the far with a quick move and gained the lead, remained clear late under firm handling. JR'S GIFT was
unhurried early, rallied on the inside down the backside, angled out four wide in the stretch and closed fast to be second best. ACROSS THE AISLE was
never far back, rallied on the far turn, put in his bid and hung late. JUSTIN'S QUEST raced close up for six furlongs and weakened slightly. GILES saved
ground and was no threat. BLAME IT ON EDDIE pressed early, rallied down the backside and gained a slight lead, then flattened out on the far turn.
VITALE was no threat. NOT YET CHARLIE had early speed and tired. TO WIN broke in the air and lost his rider. The stewards posted the inquiry sign but
took no action.
