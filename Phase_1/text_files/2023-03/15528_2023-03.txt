Footnotes
DEL MOON was prominent into the first turn, ceded the lead content to press from inside, lost ground into the far turn, asked midway on that bend, regained
nearly even terms inside the leader in upper stretch, dueled in close quarters while possibly brushing with that one, inched past late. PARABELLUM set the
pace off the rail, went in the two to three path, dueled through the lane, was outfinished. MAJOR GRIFFIN settled outside to stalk, raced four to five wide
throughout, gained slowly but steadily in the stretch however needed more. GREAT REALIZATION switched out leaving the first turn to stalk from outside
three wide, took closer order to reach striking distance coming to the quarter pole three deep but could not sustain the effort in the stretch. BILLHILL was
taken back and shifted in entering the first turn, raced at the rear in the two to three path on both bends, failed to rally. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
RUBY THE DESTROYER set the pace racing off the rail, was asked coming to the top of stretch and responded by drawing clear and widening through
upper stretch, was kept to the task and held safe. GOSPEL FABULOUS broke outwardly bothering a rival and was steadied at the start, shifted in reserved
at the rear racing in the three to four path early, angled five wide coming to the quarter pole, could not gain on the winner but was clearly second best. MISS
LONG LEGS stalked three wide just off the eventual winner, was asked for run inside a foe within striking distance coming to the five-sixteenths, failed to
rally but was best of the rest. CREES VALENTYME stalked from outside four wide, steadily weakened in the stretch. SKY ECHO tracked just off the leaders
inside, came out a bit for the drive, failed to rally. ALTERNATE ABBY got away slowly and was bothered at the start, moved forward outside rivals five
through the first turn and early up the backstretch to reach the flank of the leader, began to drop back outside foes on the far turn, faltered and faded.

UNITED PATRIOT set the pace racing off the rail with moderate outside pressure early, edged clear about the nine-sixteenths, faced a challenger and was
asked for more past the quarter pole, headed by that one at the top of the stretch and put to stronger urging, came back inside the sixteenth to nab the win.

top of the stretch, dueled from outside still with a head in front but was outfinished. GOT MOJO exchanged a very light brush at the start, raced off the pace
in the three to four path, was asked for more past the three-eighths, ran on but was no threat to the top two. REACH THE CIRCLE brushed lightly at the
start, pressed the winner from outside three wide, began to drop back leaving the backstretch, steadily weakened. WAVERUNNER brushed very lightly after
the start, angled in and was reserved in the two path, failed to rally. BAOZUN exchanged a very light brush after the start, pursued from outside five wide,

Footnotes
ADRIA was quick to the fore to take command and dictate terms in the clear racing just off the rail, turned back a challenger late on the turn, was clear into
upper stretch and asked for more, kept to the task and held sway. LINGERING PROMISE got away alertly then allowed a rival to go forward content to stalk
that one, took closer order on the turn drawing alongside the flank of the eventual winner racing three wide, proved no match for that one but second best.
LACEY BOSS tracked from inside on or just off the rail, came out about four wide turning for home and put to urging, ran on for show honors three to four
wide in the stretch but unable to threaten the top ones. OKIE FRONT settled racing off the pace between runners in the second flight into the turn, moved
out five wide turning for home, ran on evenly. ROZEY CHEEKS trailed racing off the inside, went in the five path through the turn, angled in once in upper
stretch and failed to menace. MARIA ELENA Y. G was ridden along outside runners four wide on the turn, weakened and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

SHE'S FIRE AND ICE pressed the pace then applied more pressure three wide up the backstretch, dueled outside three then two wide on the far turn taking
command by the three-sixteenths, forged clear under urging. BID FOR POWER was bumped lightly at the break but moved forward to set the pace racing a
path removed from the rail, faced pressure up the backstretch, moved nearer the rail late on the far turn, was no match for the winner but second best.
DIXIELAND CANDY settled three to four wide off the early pace, advanced between runners two wide on the far turn, came out four wide for the stretch
drive and ran on. SATURDAY SERVICE bumped a rival at the start, tracked from inside, saved ground on both turns, came out a bit for the stretch run and
failed to rally. MUSICAL MILLIE raced outside off the pace four to five wide throughout and failed to menace. CAMCORDIA shifted in two to three wide early
and advanced forward between rivals up the backstretch, asked by the quarter pole racing three deep through the far turn and came up empty. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FIGHTINGTEMPTATION prompted the pace from outside then from between runners up the backstretch, raced two to three wide contending to the top of
the stretch, was headed in mid-stretch while drifting out a bit, dug in and surged late to prevail inside over KACHINA, who moved forward three to four wide
early, prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, continued to contend through the far turn, took command nearing the eighth pole, drifted out a bit
in upper- to mid-stretch, was outfinished. OH NIKI vied inside on or just off the rail, was no match for the top pair. BILLIE G tracked off the leaders near
inside, ran evenly and made no bid. LENA'S SHADOW rated between rivals in the second flight up the backstretch having travelled two to four wide to that
juncture, continued between foes on the far turn and put to some urging, angled five wide into the stretch, failed to rally. RIVER LIBERTY raced outside four
to six wide throughout, moved up closer to the leaders early up the backstretch, soon dropped back to race outside the second group and had no rally.

MAGNET AND STEEL was coaxed to more forward position at the start then settled in to track from inside, found room cutting the corner to bid inside
turning for home, took command by the three-sixteenths, was soon challenged by outside rivals and put to stronger urging, was stoutly challenged past the
sixteenth pole but dug in to hold those rivals at bay. BOLD COURAGE stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, bid about the sixteenth pole but was
outfinished. MANDOLIN WIND broke a step slowly, advanced into the turn racing about three to four deep, went four to five wide on the turn still gaining,
drifted in through the stretch, made a mild bid about a sixteenth out but appeared to hang while clearly best of the rest. SAZON was forwardly-positioned
pressing three wide, went between rivals and asked to keep up three furlongs from home, steadily weakened. LITTLE SOLDIER BOY chased from outside,
asked for more midway on the turn moving out from five to six wide late on that bend, came into upper stretch seven deep and was never near enough to
threaten. RAINBOW CREST had the early lead setting the pace in the two path, was pressured thoroughly into the turn, wilted in upper stretch.
SCRIMSHIRE got away a step slowly, moved out off the inside into the turn while moving forward on the leaders, swung six wide into upper stretch and
failed to menace.

away, drew clear in the stretch when roused. CAT TALE SKY raced at the back near the inside, came two to three wide in upper stretch and put to urging,
got up for second over CAT TALE BREEZE, who set a pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, could not kick on with the winner and lost place late. MS.

Footnotes
RAGAN'S JET moved clear soon after the break to dictate terms, was put to urging in the stretch and kept to task late to hold. SINNIN N GRINNIN pursued
two to three wide through the turn, was put to strong urging in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch, gained steadily but too little too late. DICEY
settled toward the back, advanced on the turn inside rivals but off the fence, moved out three wide by the quarter pole, was carried out a bit near the furlong
grounds, finished up willingly but needed more. GOTTA SEE RED chased from outside, failed to rally. PLENTY OF VISION got away several lengths slowly,
raced inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PUNCH EM had forward position early racing inside, gradually came out through the turn, struck the lead just past the furlong grounds and edged clear,
held well. TERAWATT got away well, was prominent early but steadily eased back off the leaders racing off the inside about three deep into the turn,
finished willingly but was second best. SERENDIP RULER was urged from the start, pressed from outside going three wide on the turn, struck the lead in
upper stretch but was soon challenged, could not kick on with the top ones but maintained show honors. FIRE EXTINGUISHER was off the pace and forced
four to five wide on the turn, angled in to the two path in upper stretch and kicked on willingly to be gaining but too late. ROMANCER was caught six to
seven wide on the turn and improved position. ROBERT WHO got away well, moved to the fore soon after the start, set the pace facing pressure while
racing just off the rail, weakened. MUCHO BLING had brief early speed among the early leaders two wide, dropped back into the turn, had no late kick but
ran on evenly. G'S STORM broke a bit awkwardly and was ridden along but lacking speed, went five to six wide on the turn, passed tired foes. TRADE
DEADLINE raced evenly while off the inside part of the course and made no bid. ORNERY AS HELL chased from outside just off the leaders going four to
five wide on the turn and came up empty. TWILITE LIASON chased mid-pack, faded.
