leaving the turn and ran on to the wire, second best. FAVORITE DOLL was allowed to settle along the inside, made a mild bid on the inside leaving the turn
but had no late kick. SIMPLE SOUVENIR tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and weakened. DANCE A LITTLE JIG was void of

ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT was reluctant to load, then broke sharply and was soon clear to set the pace, then drew clear on the turn, then drew off in the drive
to prove much the best under a mild drive. MITROPANOS prompted the winner three wide early, then tracked that rival on the turn and failed to go with that
rival, second best. EGOT A POKER FACE stalked the pace four wide at the half mile marker, chased the pace on the turn and weakened, bested rest.
BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and angled out in the drive and passed the tiring rivals. LILTONYTWOPHONES
steadied leaving the eleven sixteenths, then shifted out and chased the pace five wide and then was empty the final furlong. SHARP RED EAGLE chased
the pace on the inside and weakened. TURNS was void of early speed, came wide into the lane and had no rally. TURNPIKE BOB was allowed to settle on
the inside and then failed to respond.

JUSTICE OR APPEAL set the early pace while clear, drew off on the turn and then held sway late to prove best under a mild drive. ARROGANTE was
settled early, came four wide into the lane and closed well but too late, second best. ONE LAST FLING chased the pace four wide, then was three wide on
the turn and weakened, held show award. BUSTIN WIDE OPEN was reserved early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally to just miss the show
award. COWGIRL SHINE was settled back early, came five wide into the lane and had no serious rally. LET'SGOSHAGDANCIN was settled early on the
outside, came widest into the lane and had no rally. FINE ALEIGH chased the pace three wide early, then was two wide on the turn and then empty in the
drive. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR failed to menace. IOANNA chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

couple right handed pops with the riding crop to prove much the best. HIGHWAY QUEEN was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and rallied well to
gain the place award. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY bobbled slightly at the start, tracked the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened
out, lost place award late. SAKARI chased the early pace two wide, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no kick. FALL CAMPAIGN was settled
early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. PURELY SILVER set the early pace on the inside, then was headed and dueled with the winner by the
quarter pole and weakened. BLEZNIATKA was settled back early and failed to respond. LOVE RAN RED tracked the early pace on the inside, eased out on
the turn and came four wide into the lane and came up empty.
