RODEO CHAMP was off well, then settled early while three wide, was moving up throughout the turn to rally in the upper stretch, then shook clear to hold
onto the win under a strong hand drive. KISSES PER DIEM chased the pace from the inside, then menaced leaving the turn to close willingly in the stretch
and was up for the place prize. PROPERLY CONNECTED stalked the pace while two wide, then vied for the lead throughout the turn, continued to rally
gamely in the stretch and closed strong for third. GONE COUNTRY was allowed to settle while two wide on the backstretch, then rallied from inside in the
upper stretch to close well in the end. OLCZYK was moving up in the middle of the field from the two path down the backstretch and into the turn to bid
mildly in the stretch, then was closing well but it was not enough. DREAMS ROCKETMAN was in a hard drive to lead the way into the turn, was used up
and gave way in the end. SUPER PROSPECTOR tracked the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch.
GWYNETH'S MALIBU raced in the three path at steady pace to bid on the turn but was no threat. IN BOND WE TRUST raced along the inside and slowly
faded throughout the turn and had no final bid. YOU EFF OH was unhurried along the inside and was no menace.

Footnotes
VIOLIN MAKER stalked the pace from the inside, then was gaining ground down the backstretch to vie for the lead on the turn from the two path, then
dueled with an outer rival in the early stretch, bore out slightly and bumped rival, then was able kick clear to be up just in time for the win. EXETER stalked
the pace from the three path heading into the backstretch, was moving up to vie for the lead on the far turn, then continued to duel while two wide in the
early stretch, lugged in slightly and bumped the inner rival and gave way in the end. MIDAS CAT was allowed to settle along the rail heading in the first half
of the course, then was gaining ground on the far turn to rally from the four path in the stretch and was closing willingly in the end. CONVICTION TRADE
lead the way into the first turn and onto the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout the far turn, then faltered in the stretch. TURN ON THE MAGIC was
in a steady drive to track the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. SWEET MEDICINE
raced along the inside down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the far turn and into the stretch but it was too little too late. D TOWN BABY was
unhurried early and no threat. HOT STOVE LEAGUE tracked the pace from the inside heading into the first turn, then steadily faded throughout the
remainder of the course and had no final. FLEXATI was unhurried early and no menace. BRICKBAT raced in the middle of the field at an even pace while
