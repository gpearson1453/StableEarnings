Footnotes
WOHLGEMUTH was well reserved in the middle of the field while racing along the rail, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, then slipped through in
the early stretch, dug in gamely and held on to prove best in the end. WHITEROSE JEWEL steadied slightly into the first turn, then was in a steady drive
chasing the pace from the inside, came out three wide on the far turn to bid in the stretch and closed willingly in the end. BIG WAVE JAMES lead the way
into the first turn and onto the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout the far turn, to bid from the two path in the stretch, then gave way in the end.
WILBERT stalked the leader heading into the backstretch, was moving up to duel shortly from two path, settled back throughout the far turn to rally in the
upper stretch then gave way in the end. HENDERSON tracked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then continued to race evenly throughout
the far turn and into the stretch and did not fire. TOP COP was allowed to settle in the three path on the backstretch and into the far turn, then made a mild
bid in the early stretch from the two path but came up evenly. LITTLE SOLDIER BOY settled along the inside throughout the course and was no menace.
SOMERSETSLASTRIDE was out slowly then raced from the two path on the backstretch, came out four wide on the second turn to bid in the stretch and
was no threat.

WITCH'S VOW lead the way into the first turn to open a clear lead down the backstretch and into the far turn, then outkicked the impeding rivals in the home
stretch and held on grudgingly to prove best in the end. BRUCELEA settled early on the backstretch while three wide, was moving up throughout the second
turn to rally from the four path in the early stretch and closed gamely for the place position. DARE TO FAIL was allowed to settled on the backstretch while
two wide, then bid on the far turn to close willingly in the stretch for the show prize. FLASH OF GENIUS settled along the inside heading into the
backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn to rally in the upper stretch, then gave way for show position in the end. GOLIATH RIDGE was
unhurried early, then made a mild bid while three wide on the far turn and was no threat. LARIDAE was unhurried early, then bid two wide on the far turn
and was no threat. WEST TEXAS BOB was out run and no factor. PRINCE OF GLORY trailed throughout and eased across the finish and was no factor.
