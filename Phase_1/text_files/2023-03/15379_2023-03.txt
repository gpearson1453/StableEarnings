Footnotes
AWESOME WILLY moved forward between rivals into the first turn, set the pace racing off the rail with pressure from an outside rival, shook clear by upper
stretch and put to steady but moderate urging through the lane to hold sway. ELECTRIC CHARGE raced between rivals two wide in the second flight on
part of the first turn, moved out four deep for the run up the backstretch and stalked the leading pair solo, advanced three to four wide on the far turn to
reach striking distance but could make no further headway on the winner while clearly second best. KITTEN'S CLOWN settled outside mid-pack three wide,
continued unchanged through the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, ran on to get up for show honors. UNCLE DICK got away alertly but steadily
dropped back inside through the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground on the far turn and ran on evenly. GUS GUS moved forward in
tandem with and outside the eventual winner four then three wide, pressed that one to the top of the stretch and came up empty. JACKPOT BOY was in
tight just after the break then forced out a bit, trailed into the first turn racing off the rail, failed to menace. GRAND FESTIVAL chased from outside mid-pack
four wide, steadily dropped back, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MRS. NUSHI moved forward from between runners, stalked the dueling leaders three wide into the turn, came into upper stretch wider with aim on the
leader, drove past inside the final sixteenth. FROST WARRIOR dueled outside a foe to the latter part of the turn going two to three wide, drifted out a bit in
the stretch while clear but was worn down late and only second best. ARNEIS settled mid-pack outside going four wide on the turn, kept on for show honors.
EVIE chased from inside mid-pack, came out in the stretch and ran on evenly. BELLS OF JOY settled at the back racing outside five wide into the turn,
swung seven to eight deep for the drive and ran on. NOT TO BE DENIED was outpaced early and unhurriedly raced at the rear, entered the turn about
three wide floating wider into upper stretch before shifting in, ran on with mild late interest. HEY MA dueled inside coming off the rail into upper stretch and
gave way. SEQUAYA chased from between runners briefly before dropping back racing about four into the turn, moved wider into upper stretch, altered
outside a foe nine wide and failed to rally. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER was in a bit tight early, shifted nearer inside, saved some ground on the turn, made no
late bid.

Footnotes
RALLY SQUIRREL bobbled ever so slightly at the start but recovered to quickly move forward just off the rail to set the tempo into the first turn, dueled up
the backstretch inside a rival, began to edge away from that one racing off the rail turning for home, forged clear under steady handling. ROCKET
HOTSHOT, unhurried early at the rear near the inside, advanced inside foes into the far turn, angled out past the three-eighths and continued to progress,
could not make up ground on the winner but secured the place in the lane. JEALOUS EYES was encouraged forward on the first turn five then four wide,
dueled outside the eventual winner, had no extra for the drive. GATE CREW raced off the leaders in the three path early, continued about mid-pack off the
rail on the far turn, kept on evenly. AHEADOFTHEGAME was forwardly-placed between runners into the first turn then eased back off the leading pair and
switched out to stalk three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. CINDY'S STORM was caught four wide through the firs turn, continued racing toward
the back of the field and off the inside, failed to rally. UNCLE NICK chased briefly inside just off the rail, dropped back whilst moving out a bit and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
TWO WORLDS moved forward and clear while shifting in to the two path into the first turn, was thereupon joined by outside rivals forcing the issue, again
re-established a clear lead midway up the backstretch, drifted out a bit turning for home, held sway while kept to the task. MOMENT switched outside the
leader and moved forward to force the issue three wide and between runners up the backstretch, lost ground on the leader heading to the far turn, continued
to pursue from outside that one, altered inside at the top of the stretch, was no match but just saved second from GLOBAL EMPIRE, who broke a bit
awkwardly and a couple lengths slowly, settled at the rear off the inside, advanced up the backstretch into the far turn, moved out five wide turning for home,
finished up with interest but just missed the place. DIAMOND DAVE raced unhurriedly at the rear inside, came out for the stretch drive and ran on. HE
TAKES CHARGE switched outside rivals and moved up outside four wide to force the pace heading up the backstretch, began to drop back into the far turn
and came up empty. DYNABLUE was briefly up close chasing in behind the leaders about four deep, raced mostly four to six wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
Z U SOON was encouraged along chasing the leaders racing wide, moved out from four to six wide on the turn, put to stout urging by upper stretch, took the
lead in mid-stretch and drew clear. PACHI was in tight just after the break between rivals, angled in and advanced to pursue from just off the rail saving
some ground through the turn, was no match for the winner and just held the place from WINGING WAYS, who bobbled slightly at the start, chased the
pacesetter from outside three wide, was carried out into upper stretch, kept on in the late stages but just missed second. OVERBEARING broke outwardly
lightly brushing with a rival and was urged but outpaced early racing off the inside, angled wider coming into upper stretch about eight deep and gained
some late. HATCHET CREEK bumped a rival at the start, settled inside racing on or just off the rail, steadied slightly outside the five-sixteenths in behind
runners, ran on in the stretch. JETTIN OUT lacked early speed racing off the inside, passed tired rivals. IRISH TUFF bumped the outer rival lightly at the
start, raced four to five wide on the turn mid-pack but failed to menace. CHOPPER set the pace racing just off the fence and in the clear to the turn, drifted
out turning for home and then further still in upper stretch, came up empty. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was bumped at the break, encouraged along racing up
close in behind the leaders, went about four wide on the turn, weakened. RIPE ATTACK shifted in racing three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally.
SHANGHAI POINT was lightly bumped at the break, raced five to seven wide through the turn swinging nine deep for the drive and was never near enough
to threaten.

Footnotes
TILTED TOWERS moved forward to challenge for the lead from between rivals and took over past the half-mile marker, was soon clear dictating terms from
off the inside, held safe under moderate urging through the lane. LATIN CASINO moved forward outside and with the eventual winner to briefly contend
three to four wide, was no match for that one but second best. FENESTRA sped clear early but was soon overtaken, switched outside the two new leaders,
ran on and held show honors. ALPINE GHOST was forced in at the start, chased two wide mid-pack, continued to race near the rail coming out a bit for the
drive and kept on. STALLONE broke inwardly, settled three wide mid-pack, was carried out early on the turn then eased back and altered in, raced about
two wide from that point and moved nearer the rail turning into upper stretch, ran on willingly. MEDAL OF FACT chased while being carried out wide going
four then five deep on the turn, needed more. FIRST MASAMUNE was not a threat racing off the inside. THAT KHENNY was urged to chase the leaders
inside foes, began getting out early on the turn and continued in the four path on that bend, was empty for the drive. MKAR THE FAST was fractious in the
gate, forced in and tight at the start, raced at the back off the inside and was not a factor. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE QUARTER-MILE
FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE. QUARTER-MILE FRACTION ADDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ESCAPE vied inside rivals, drifted out turning for home, dueled inside a rival and dug in to come back and prevail. COMISKEY PARK moved
forward outside four wide into the turn taking a narrow lead, continued to challenge for the lead in upper to mid-stretch but was outfinished. BASEBALL
POLITICS vied three wide and between runners into the turn, eased back and switched outside those going four wide the rest of the bend, kept on in the
lane to get show honors. SWISHAWISH moved out from three to five wide on the turn off the leading quartet, finished up willingly but missed show honors.
BALADINE was bumped at the break, shifted in to save ground near inside, ran on evenly. FORREST CITY was forced in, exchanged contact at the start
and checked just after, fanned six wide into the stretch and ran on. DUST DANCER broke inwardly, shifted in racing in the three path through the turn and
made no bid. LAKE MILLS was bumped into a rival at the start, came out in upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. PUTTHEPASTBEHIND
contended between rivals, came up empty.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR brushed with a rival lightly at the start, quickly moved clear while shifting in to the two path to dictate terms, extended the advantage into
the stretch and held safe under moderate urging. COUGER bumped with the inside rival at the start, rated in behind the leaders near but off the rail,
switched out up the backstretch, advanced outside rivals three to four wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner but second best. LINDALOUIMAGE
was a bit fractious in the gate, caught four to five wide early with forward position, dropped back, continued off the inside through the far turn and improved
from between rivals about five to six deep in the lane. HER GOLD MINE stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two to three wide early, moved out fanning
seven wide on the far turn for the stretch run and closed willingly to improve position. FANCY EMPRESS pursued the pace inside foes on or just off the rail,
moved out for the stretch run, lacked the needed late kick. WEEKEND PASS lacked early speed bringing up the rear racing off the inside, passed tired foes.
AH LEAH bumped with the outer foe at the start, moved off the rail early, failed to menace. SILVERA chased briefly three to four wide, steadily dropped
back, fanned eight deep into upper stretch and failed to rally. WATCHIN THE WHEELS exchanged a light bump and was shuffled back at the start, caught
four wide on the first turn, shifted in, failed to menace. AUNT STELLA was a bit fractious, chased two to three wide, dropped back and faded.
