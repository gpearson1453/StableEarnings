Footnotes
MORGANS COVE was rated along three wide early, made a four wide bid on the turn and hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then drew out in the final
furlong under a mild drive. DISCREETLIN JONES dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then was headed by the
furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival while saving the place. MAKE A SPLASH chased the pace on the inside and then was two wide by
the quarter pole and just missed the place award on the inside. FINISHING TOUCH was settled early, four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.
FAIRVIEW dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. OUTSPEND was through early. KIRRABON bumped at the start and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SHARP CATCH set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed by the quarter pole, turned back that bid and shook clear by the furlong marker and
edged away to prove best, driivng. ONE LAST FLING tracked the early pace from between rivals, then made a three wide bid on the turn to go on even
terms for command by the quarter pole, but hung in the lane, second best. LET'SGOSHAGDANCIN tracked the early pace on the inside, fell back on the
turn, then finished willingly late but needed more. BUSTIN WIDE OPEN was reserved early, angled in by the furlong marker and had a belated rally for the
minor rewards. IOANNA chased the pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and weakened. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR lacked a solid rally.

Footnotes
CUENCA stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide move on the turn when ready to draw clear by the quarter pole, then widened the margin off
the turn and then remained well clear to prove much the best, mild urging. DANCE A LITTLE JIG was void of early speed, came wide into the lane and
rallied well to be clearly second best. GINGERS WISH was rated along the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed winning bid,
bested rest. SPECTACULLARI was reserved early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole but flattened out. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES pressed the pace
three wide and then dropped back on the turn, weakened. COSMOLOGICAL vied for the early lead on the inside, drew clear on the backstretch, then was
headed by the winner on the turn and gave way. SPRINKLE THIS was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid four wide on the turn but then was empty.
