urging. VAX A NATION lacked speed, was three wide on the turn and gained the place. MILLBANK MAN , a bit rank at the break, was four deep turning for
home and had a mild rally. IRISH RILL showed some speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, dropped back on the turn, moved to the two path in
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE , well placed in the two path on the turn, angled three wide entering the stretch and
faltered. TREASURER showed speed along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KERNESS took over soon after the break, secured the inside and set a rated pace, handled some outside pressure, spurted clear around the turn, moved
away in upper stretch, responded to right handed asks in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while geared down a bit late.
UNCAPTURED STORM rated back off the leaders early on and stalked, edged up three wide leaving the far turn, was under pressure pursuing past the
three eighths, failed to gain in the final furlong but kept on willingly to be second best. CHELONIAN prompted the pace outside the winner, was pushed
along heading towards the lane, stayed on with effort to mid stretch then faded. R B'S THE BOSS broke through the gate pre race and unseated his rider,
was quickly apprehended and re loaded, settled off the early pace while saving ground, edged up into the far turn, had aim into the lane, failed to go on past
the quarter pole and tired. STARDUST ZIGGY broke a step slow, and failed to menace. BLOWN SAVE , off the pace, saved ground mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
GOODGIRL BADHABITS bobbled at the break, recovered and sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and pulled away under confident
handling. RUN AROUND SLEW raced along the inner rail and gamely chased the winner. WONDER GIRL , in the two path between horses around the turn,
moved to the three path in upper stretch and failed to rally. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE lacked speed, circled horses around the turn, was taken five deep
entering the stretch and passed tired foes. WARIDI CANDY along the inner rail most of the trip, was not a factor. ZIPPY DO DA DAY , fanned four wide
turning for home, gave way. ITALIAN WAR CRY bore out leaving the starting gate, was a forward factor in the two path around the turn and faltered.
DAYLIGHT QUEEN was outrun.

Footnotes
HASHTAG LUCKY pulled her way clear early on and set a rated pace off the inside, took outside pressure around the turn while nursed along, met an inside
challenge from DRY WELL entering the lane, drifted out briefly then was straightened, dueled under right handed asks, wandered outward in deep stretch
and held firm. DRY WELL settled within range while saving ground, took closer order under some coaxing mid turn, moved through along the rail to join the
winner into the lane, dueled on near even terms from the quarter pole, drifted out some late and fought gamely to the wire. GAMESTONKS , off the pace
and in the clear, was under a ride mid turn, swung out to be widest through the final sixteenth and steadily gained. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO showed speed
the rated off her stable mate, prompted three wide, raced behind foes in upper stretch, altered in late and churned on. DOTADA rated off the inside while in
range, angled out under asking mid turn, moved up four to five wide into the stretch, briefly brushed with a foe to her inside, gave hard chase outside foes in
mid stretch but flattened out. FLASHNDYNAMITE edged up then eased out to stalk past the three quarter pole, applied more pressure leaving the far turn,
forced the issue to the five sixteenths, exchanged a brush with DOTADA while between rivals into the stretch, pursued past mid stretch then faded.
STARTWITHABANG lagged well back early, saved ground making some headway into the stretch, angled out and moved up behind rivals leaving the
furlong grounds, was blocked with run near the sixteenth marker, altered in but had no time to recover.

Footnotes
CRYPTO MAMA rated kindly three wide stalking the pace, was put to some asking past the three eighths, closed in under left handed encouragement
leaving mid stretch, wrested command outside MISS FUSSY PANTS with a sixteenth to go and edged clear. MISS FUSSY PANTS sped to the early lead,
set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted away while guided two wide soon into the stretch, switched over to her left lead near mid stretch, failed to resist
the winner leaving the sixteenth marker, switched back to her correct lead and dug in for the place. COVER THE SPREAD , three deep and in range, angled
out mid turn, circled four wide with some momentum into the stretch, ranged up past the three sixteenths then flattened out late. BALPOOL advanced inside
leaving the chute and gained a forward spot, dropped back a bit under asking mid turn, cut the corner into the lane, shied from the rail near the quarter pole,
gave hard pursuit leaving the eighth pole but came up empty. NAVAL EMPIRE settled off the pace, saved ground into the stretch, shifted out and lacked a
bid. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA , off the pace and outside a rival, angled five wide with some advance into the stretch but failed to follow through. FAST
TRACKED was steadied along between rivals early on, dropped back mid turn, angled out and came up empty. GENIEINABRIDLE forced the pace outside
MISS FUSSY PANTS, failed to kick on entering the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD four deep around the turn, closed determinedly outside horses was up approaching the finish. RUTHANNE set the pace along the
inner rail and gave way grudgingly. PUNKIN , a forward factor in the three path on the turn, finished willingly. SHE GOT THE MUNNI , caught in close
quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail the final furlong and rallied. WILL TAKE ODDS , fractious during the post parade, saved ground
around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to menace in an even effort. DIAL FOR LOVE prompted the pace outside RUTHANNE and gave way
in the drive. DESTINED TO DANCE , outrun, was eased. BEE MOUNTAIN , kept wide around the turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
JARDANI settled off the pace while saving ground, commenced a run under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, swung out four wide for clear sailing in upper
stretch, closed relentlessly under strong handling and nipped TATE in the final jumps. TATE , eagerly to the front, set a rated pace towards the rail, took
pressure then dueled from the three eighths to upper stretch, kicked back clear under left handed asks in mid stretch, kept on gamely but was nailed on the
wire. UNION FLEET broke a step slow, regrouped and moved up three wide past the seven eighths, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, bid
three deep leaving the far turn, vied outside rivals into the lane, failed to match strides with TATE near mid stretch, wandered outward near the sixteenth
marker, steadied as the winner rolled by to his outside then faded. SEA GHOST prompted the pace outside TATE, moved to near even terms leaving the far
turn, sparred between runners from the five sixteenths to upper stretch, stayed on willingly past the eighth pole then weakened a bit late. MAXIMUS MIDANI
, sluggish early, raced off the rail and failed to respond. TRASH TALKIN LARRY tracked two wide behind rivals, lacked a punch leaving the far turn and
faltered. ORO DE MORO MORO was squeezed back soon after the break, regrouped and advanced four wide in early backstretch, stalked to the three
eighths then gave way.

Footnotes
SPECTRIER , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, gained command in mid stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. DISTANT FIRE disputed
the pace racing in the two path between horses in a sharp effort. MUNGO MAGIC hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the four path at the
head of the stretch, was within striking distance in upper stretch and flattened out. SNIP THE ROSES , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung five
deep turning for home and weakened. EXPECT LUCKY stumbled leaving the starting gate and was no factor. DUKE OF DOOLY hugged the inner rail,
disputed the pace to upper stretch and gave way. LUNAR GHOST trailed.
