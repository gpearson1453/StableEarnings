Footnotes
SMOKIN' JAY tracked along the inside, tipped out under coaxing late around the turn and was in the six path at the top of the lane, and rallied in the final
furlong to get up late for the win. AGENT PETER GRAVES was held up off the pace in the two path, was roused in the three path into the stretch, ran on
between rivals and was in tight late, but got up for place. MAMBA ON THREE bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the three path into the turn,
bid in the four path at the top of the lane and took a narrow lead into the final furlong, was caught on both sides late, but held on to show. COPPOLA
bumped with an outer foe at the start and was steadied into the first turn while racing up close in three path, was roused from the five path into the stretch,
and stayed on. SHEKKY SHEBAZ bumped on both sides at the start, rated in the five path into the turn, tipped out to the nine path entering the lane, and
finished evenly. WARP RIDE stalked in the two path and was ridden from said position into the stretch, tipped out past the eighth pole to avoid a tiring foe,
but was one paced. FIRECROW set the pace inside, was coaxed in the two path entering the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole.
MEETMEINKINGSTON got pinballed and bumped badly between rivals at the start, chased in the four path into the turn, fanned out to the eight path into
the stretch, but flattened. UNDER OATH broke out at the start and was wellback in the two path, angled out around the turn and was in the ten path at the
top of the lane, but was no factor. NEWBOMB raced in midpack in the three path but never threatened in the four path in the stretch. MATTA raced
prominently in range from the four path into the turn, was cued from the seven path turning into the lane, but was empty. BOCA BOY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JUST KATHERINE was bounced around at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three deep rounding the far turn, took over near the
quarter pole, quickly cleared, angled in and drew off under left-handed urging. BACK TO GRIDLOCK came in and bumped the winner into STARTERS
ORDERS soon after the start, raced in range three wide, could not match strides near the quarter pole but ran on between foes to gain the place. IMAGE
OF LOVE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter pole, offered little resistance and just lasted for the show. MILLENNIUM PARK had early
speed at the rail, steadied nearing the five-eighths pole, chased inside around the bend, angled three wide turning for home and lacked a closing bid.
PRINCIPIA pressed the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and faded. RAGGEDY was shut off at the start, made a four wide middle move
around the and retreated through the lane. STARTERS ORDERS bumped with the winner at the start and then again a few strides later and had only brief
speed two wide.

Footnotes
UP TO THE MARK was reserved in the two path early, tipped out to the three path into the far turn and was cued while angling out to the ten path into the
lane, rallied down the center under steady urging, and got up in the final sixteenth to win. OLYMPIC RUNNER brushed with an outer foe at the start, settled
in midfield in the three path, tipped out around the far turn and was cued right handed from the eight path at the top of the stretch, ran on and took a brief
lead inside the final furlong, but was quickly caught by the outer winner to place. SMOKIN' T broke inwards at the start and was held up in range from the
three path early, was roused to range up and bid from the four path around the far turn, took a narrow lead from the five path in upper stretch and led into
the final furlong, but was caught by a pair of outer rivals late to show. CANDY TYCOON raced up close alongside the inner pacesetter while under a hold in
two path, was cued to bid into the far turn and was in the four path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. COINAGE stalked along the inside, was
under a drive while angling out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but evened out in the stretch. BEUYS (IRE) rated in the four path into the
backstretch, was under coaxing while fanning out to the twelve path into the stretch, and mildly improved while tipping inwards but was no factor. A. P.'S
SECRET set the pace inside, was roused into the far turn and lost the lead in the two path at the top of the lane, and yielded in the final furlong. EYES ON
TARGET got pinched between foes at the start and was wellback in the five path, was driven in the six path around the far turn and floated out to the ten
path into the stretch, shifted inwards, but was no factor. PREVALENCE tracked in the two path, saved ground around the far turn and was driven from the
three path turning into the stretch, but flattened. RY'S THE GUY brushed with an inner foe at the start and steadied slightly into the first turn, was unhurried
in the three path and never threatened. CARPENTERS CALL veered in and bumped an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace in the three path but
backed up around the far turn. SANCTIFIED bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack from the four path, was cued into the far turn, but was
no menace in the stretch.

was along for the show. SWEET CHERRY PIE was off a bit slow, advanced between foes down the backstretch, tipped three wide and bid midway around
the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. AMSTRONG saved ground in range, made progress inside in upper stretch and tired in the

DUDE N COLORADO (GB) prompted the pace in the three path, was roused to bid into the far turn and took a narrow lead from the three path into the
stretch, and held on gamely under left handed encouragement through the stretch to win. WEBSLINGER bumped with an inner foe at the start, was held up
off the pace in the four path, moved up from the five path into the far turn and was under a drive from said position into the lane, and ran on for place.
BOPPY O tracked in the three path around the first turn and was in the four path down the backstretch, was under coaxing in the four path turning into the
stretch, and kept on between foes under left handed urging while tipping slightly inwards for show. OK BOOMER raced in midpack in the three path, was
driven in the four path around the far turn and tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, stayed on but just missed minor rewards. BLUEBIRDS OVER
set the pace inside, was roused in the two path turning into the lane, but faded inside the final furlong. SANTORINI stalked in the two path, was cued left
handed in upper stretch, but was stymied in the final furlong and had to check late. BELOUNI (FR) bumped with an outer foe at the start, was reserved
along the inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was coaxed while tipping out to the eight path into the stretch, but was
no factor. OUR DREAM RYE'D settled off the pace in the five path down the backstretch but never menaced from the eight path in the stretch.

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO was prompted along in the four path, tipped in and was roused to bid in the three path around the turn, took the lead from the four path
into the stretch, and drew clear under left handed urging. WEYBURN had an awkward start and brushed with an inner rival, rated in the six path into the
turn, took aim from the six path under coaxing into the stretch, chased home the winner and held place. COLLABORATE raced off the pace in the three
path, was driven along outside of foes and was in the seven path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. SEAL BEACH trailed in the three path, was
ridden around the turn and shifted out to the six path entering the lane, and finished evenly while passing tired rivals. LEGAL DEAL was bumped by an inner
foe and brushed with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. COASTAL DEFENSE
broke outward and bumped an outer foe, chased in the four path, was driven between rivals around the turn and floated out to the eight path into the stretch,
but was tired. GRAN RUNNER raced wellback in the six path into the turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and was no threat. KLUGMAN set
the pace along the inside but yielded in upper stretch. LEGENDS CAN'T DIE raced in midpack from the five path into the turn but was empty entering the
stretch. HIGH OAK was nudged along in the two path but gaveway turning into the lane, was eased thru the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
EMMANUEL stalked the pace two wide between foes, angled out clear sailing in upper stretch, kicked in and was up in deep stretch. STEADY ON prompted
the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and led until the final strides. FORT
WASHINGTON was off a step slow, trailed in the three path around the first turn, edged closer two wide around the far turn and finished strongly inside of
foes. DAKOTA GOLD raced off the pace four wide, advanced still four deep around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. ENGLISH BEE stalked
the pace inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) raced
off the pace three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. SOUPER DORMY became very rank around the first turn, pulled his way
forward through stout restraint to press three wide and weakened in the lane. CALIFORNIA FROLIC was outrun inside. SAFE CONDUCT advanced two
wide to the lead, angled in late on the first turn, set the pace inside to midstretch and tired. SHADOW SPHINX saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DANSE MACABRE stalked in the three path, was coaxed between foes into the far turn and bid from the three path around the far turn, took the lead from
the four path into the final furlong, dug in gamely to hold off outer rivals for the win, and was bumped by an in-veering outer foe late. PAPILIO (IRE) was
steadied then checked midway around the first turn, tracked in the four path, was roused around the far turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane,
ran on and bid while veering in through the final furlong, bumped with the inner eventual winner in deep stretch, and was denied to finish with place. CAIRO
CONSORT rated in the three path, was roused into the far turn and under right handed urging while shifting out to the eight path into the lane, angled in
through the final furlong while rallying outside of foes, but was too late and finished with show honors. REVALITA (FR) trailed in the three path around the
first turn and into the backstretch, was ridden around the far turn while shifting outward and was in the seven path entering the stretch, and improved down
the center. RIDING PRETTY was held up in midpack between foes in the two path, was coaxed around the far turn and was in the six path at the top of the
lane, and finished evenly. MOONAGE DAYDREAM set the pace inside, was challenged by outer rivals around the far turn and was headed from the two
path at the top of the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. MALLEYMOO was unhurried along the inside, tipped out to the
three path entering the lane but never factored. BLIND SPOT was fractious in the gate, raced up close along the outer flank of the leader in the two path but
faded turning into the stretch. ANNA KARENINE (FR) raced in range while under a hold along the inside but never threatened. SWEETLOU'SGOTACES
steadied and went out to the six path around the first turn to avoid a checking rival, settled off the pace in the five path but was no menace.

ENDORSED prompted the pace three wide, took over turning for home and drove clear. CHARGE IT pressed the pace two wide between foes, took a short
lead near the three-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed on to be
clearly second best. SIMPLIFICATION settled off the pace while racing two and three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. DEAN
DELIVERS raced in range inside, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole, chased outside and was one-paced through lane. STEAL SUNSHINE saved
ground and failed to menace. OCTANE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenth pole and tired inside. NOBLE DRAMA was outrun
inside. O CAPTAIN played no factor while racing three wide. NITROUS CHANNEL bobbled at break, chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
FAITH IN HUMANITY (FR) set the pace along the inside, was confidently handled around the far turn and roused from inside at the top of the lane, opened
up slightly into the final furlong and held off late closing outer foes under steady urging to win. WHITE FROST rated in the two path, waited while shifting out
around the far turn and was cued in the eighth path in upper stretch, and rallied down the center foe place. PRINCESS THEOREM traveled in midfield
around the three path, was driven around the far turn and bumped with an outer foe while tipping out to the six path into the lane, and kept on between rivals
for show. FAST AS FLIGHT settled in range along the inside, was roused from the three path passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the four path into
the stretch, stayed on but missed minor rewards. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL (FR) was held up off the pace in the three path, was roused while angling out
around the far turn and bumped with an inner foe from the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) stalked along the
inside but flattened in the final furlong. TOUCH OF CLASS prompted the pace in the two path, was driven into the stretch, but yielded late. KAHIKO hopped
at the start and was wellback in the two path, was cued right handed in the five path at the top of the lane, but was no factor while tipping in through the
lane. MISS YEARWOOD trailed from the four path into the backstretch, was under a ride around the far turn and fanned out to the nine path into the stretch,
but was no threat. SWEET DANI GIRL tracked in the three path but faded from the five path in the stretch. MISS DELICIOUS raced in midpack along the
inside early but was no menace.

DORTH VADER stalked the pace three wide, took over in midstretch and drew off under a drive. GUNS N' GRACES was devoid of speed in the two path,
angled out in upper stretch and finished strongly. RED CARPET READY set a fast pace in the two path, led to midstretch and tired. INFINITE DIAMOND
settled off the pace while racing two wide and lacked the needed rally. LYNX failed to menace while racing four wide. POSITANO SUNSET chased the pace
inside and lacked a closing bid. UNDERVALUED ASSET had early speed inside, chased from the rail around the turn and came up empty in the lane.
LEAVE NO TRACE led three wide early, stopped after a half and was eased.

Footnotes
VALUE ENGINEERING brushed between rivals at the start, tracked in the three path, was driven around the final turn and bid nearing the quarter pole,
bumped with an outer foe while taking the lead in the four path at the top of the lane, and dug in gamely to hold off that outer foe for the win. MARWAD (GB)
broke in and bumped an inner foe, was held up in midflight from the four path, tucked into the three path around the second turn, ranged up in the four path
around the final turn and bumped with the inner eventual winner while making a bid from the five path into the stretch, ran on and sustained that bid to the
wire, but could not get by to finish with place honors. MASTER PIECE (CHI) settled off the pace inside, tipped out around the second turn and was in the
four path down the backstretch, was roused into the final turn and urged from the seven path into the lane, and kept on for show. HIGHEST HONORS raced
off the pace along the inside early, tipped out around the second turn and was in the three path down the backside, was under a drive around the final turn
and angled out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly while passing tired rivals. WICKED FAST broke in and brushed an inner foe and then
was bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced in midfield around the three path, was roused in the final turn, but was one paced from the five path in the
stretch. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY brushed with an outer foe at the start, was unhurried in the three path, under urging while tipping out to the nine path
in upper stretch, and was no factor. HENLEY'S JOY raced wellback in the two path, moved out around the second turn and traveled in the four path down
the backstretch, was driven around the final turn while swinging out to the nine path into the lane, but flattened. BARBERINI raced in midpack in the two
path early, was under a ride inside of foes down the backside, and was tired from the six path in the stretch. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) set an open pace
along the inside, was roused around the final turn, and yielded in the stretch. ASTRONAUT was closest to the pacesetter while under a hold in the two path,
was coaxed into the final turn, but faded into the stretch. BEMMA'S BOY trailed in the two path early and never threatened from the four path in the stretch.
TIME FOR TROUBLE stalked along the inside, received a right handed cue midway down the backstretch, but backed up around the final turn.

Footnotes
FORTE broke slightly inward and lightly bumped SHADOW DRAGON into LEGACY ISLE, settled in range in the two path, edged closer in the two path
early on the far turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, seized command in upper stretch and readily drew off while ridden out. ROCKET CAN
stalked the pace in the four path around the first turn and down the backstretch, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, turned for home on near
even terms, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly to hold the place. CYCLONE MISCHIEF set the pace along the rail, vied inside around the
far turn, led to upper stretch and weakened. MAGE hit the starting gate to get away last, bumped with BLAZING SEVENS soon after, rushed up five wide
around the first turn, tracked the pace three wide down the backstretch, bid midway around the far turn, turned for home on near even terms between foes,
steadied in upper stretch, angled out soon after and churned on. SHADOW DRAGON was lightly bumped by the winner at the start, raced off the pace two
wide and lacked a rally. IL MIRACOLO was fractious behind the gate, bumped with BLAZING SEVENS not long after the start, raced off the pace two wide
early, went five wide around the far turn and had little left for the drive. DANGEROUS RIDE broke sharply, pressed the pace in the three path around the
first turn, chased down the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn and retreated inside. BLAZING SEVENS was bumped on both sides soon after the
start, raced three wide and was never involved. LEGACY ISLE was lightly bumped at the start, angled out entering the turn, chased three wide, steadied
midway around the first turn, remained in range outside down the backstretch but had no response around the far turn.
