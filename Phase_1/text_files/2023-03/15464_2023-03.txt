Footnotes
WILDCAT DREAM stalked the pace along the inside into the far turn, shifted out, surged late under strong handling three wide and got up in the final strides.
AYY LADIES pressed the pace two wide for five ad one half furlongs, gained a narrow lead, battled until deep stretch, gained the advantage then just
missed hanging on. ALSANAH slow early, found her best stride late in the four path. UNCAPTURED FAITH never far back, swung wide then finished evenly
six wide. QIA trailed for nearly six furlongs then closed a gap late along the inside. IRON BERTIE sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace for five
and one half furlongs, dug in when headed, fought back until deep stretch then gave way. UNESCORTED was no threat. LADY GIULIANA was through
after a half. LELAWALA was through early.
