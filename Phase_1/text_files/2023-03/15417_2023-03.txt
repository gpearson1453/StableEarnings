Footnotes
APPROPRIATED FUNDS tracked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, gained command heading into the second turn, then shook clear in the
early stretch and held on well to prevail. TAYLORS TAP was allowed to settle while two wide on the backstretch, was moving up gamely from the four path
throughout the second turn to menace in the stretch and was closing willingly but it was not enough. LUCKY DEPUTY was allowed to settle along the inside,
then bid on the far turn to rally from the three path in the early stretch and was closing well but it was not enough in the end. BONNIEVIEW raced from the
inside in the middle of the pack throughout the first half of the course, then bid from the two path on the far turn to rally four to five wide in the stretch and
was no threat. ROSES ARE GRAY was unhurried early while racing from the inside down the backstretch, then swung four wide on the far turn to bid in the
stretch but it was too little too late. DRENCHED set the pace entering the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the second turn, was used up then
weakened in the stretch. IM THE BIGGER BEAR raced in the middle of the field while two wide, made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in the
stretch.

DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then took command around the three eights pole, then continued to hold
onto the lead down the lane under a confident hand drive. MR. NIGHTBLINGER broke inwardly and bumped rival, then chased the pace from the three path
down the backstretch , was urging steadily on the turn to menace in the stretch but could not catch the leader in the end. FEARLESS PRINCE broke
outwardly, bumped rivals, then lead the way down the early backstretch, then was outbid by an outer rival heading into the turn, continued to bid mildly but
could not regain the lead in the stretch and was best for third. SILVER AND GOLD was unhurried early then swung four wide on the turn to bid evenly
throughout the stretch drive. KLIMCO stalked the pace from the inside, then slowly faded heading into the turn and had no final bid in the end. SWEET
TAPIN MORO was bumped at the start, then was unhurried early, bid on the turn then found the best stride in late stretch.

Footnotes
TAPADINE raced in the middle of the field along the rail down the backstretch, then came out three wide on the far turn to bid in the early stretch, angled out
to the five path then surged to the wire to be up just in time. DAWSON CITY lead the way from the first turn into the second turn, then was in a hard drive
down the home stretch, but was caught in the end by and outside rival and was second best. BOUGIE JOE chased the pace from the inside, under a steady
drive down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch and was best for the show position in the end. NERKY ROSE tracked the
pace between horses while racing down the backstretch, was gaining ground on the far turn, then rallied gamely in the stretch to close well, just missing the
show prize in the end. ELUSIVEDESTINATION chased the leader while three wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn, was
used up and gave way in the end. I AM GRODD was allowed to settle in the three path on the backstretch, then was steady urging on the far turn to make a
mild bid in the stretch but came up evenly in the end. LET'S GO ROMEO was unhurried early then continued to race from from the inside down the
backstretch and into the far turn and needed more in the end. MALIBU MENDELSSOHN settled in the two path under a steady drive down the backstretch,
then bid on the far turn and was no menace. BABY ITS COLD chased the pace from the two path throughout the first half of the course then slowly faded
throughout the far turn and had no final bid. MENDEL WARRIOR was unprepared at the start, bobbled and lost rider. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in
regards to the start of the race. After review, MENDEL WARRIOR was declared a non starter.

Footnotes
FLIP THE COIN JAN pressed the pace from the inside, then settled back throughout the turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch, split rivals and was up in
the final strides to prevail in the end. FRESH ONE was in a steady drive to set the pace heading into the turn, then continued to bid gamely in the stretch but
was caught at the wire and was second best. MEGA BOND was in a hard drive to chase the pace from the four path, then came out five on the turn to rally
gamely in the stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. K C TIZ MORO chased the pace while two wide then made a mild bid from the four path on
the turn and into the stretch but came up evenly in the end. LOUIS LE GRANDE was pinched back at the start, then was unhurried early, came out four
wide on the turn to rally in the late stretch but it was too late to make a difference. WITH VERVE chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and
into the turn, then flattened out in the stretch. BIG ROJO was unhurried early then bid mildly on the turn and into the stretch but it was too little too late.
IRISH EXPECTATIONS was in a hard drive to press the pace while two wide, was used up on the turn and gave way in the end. EUROEXIT was unhurried
early then made a mild bid in the late stretch and was no threat. LANGUAGE BARRIER chased the pace from the three path into the turn and needed more
in the end. LITTLE AVENGER was unhurried early and needed rally.
