Footnotes
DASHING DELLA showed speed in hand, moved clear with five furlongs to run, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, responded well when
set down once straightened for the drive, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drew off under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole
then was placed under a brisk hand-ride to the wire while much the best. K D KAKES broke out then was corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the
inside of a foe, chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the winner along the rail on the stretch and was second best. FROSTY INVASION moved
out while settling off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
SPATIAL REALITY came outward at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, went four then three
wide around the turn and tired. LA CHANCE brushed the outside of the gate at the start, pressed the early pace then dropped back near the five-eighths, fell
further back leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused late on that bend, moved out just inside the furlong marker and failed
to respond. SARAH'S PRIDE settled off the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn, shifted three wide nearing the quarter-pole, moved out in the
stretch and also failed to respond. DELIGHTFUL RITA moved in at the rear, settled under some urging, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no
factor.

Footnotes
GLORY ROAD settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, rallied through a clear rail opening in the stretch and closed strongly to get
up the final sixteenth and prevail. ALCOOLS pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led
under a drive into the final sixteenth then was caught while clear for the place. CHARLIE FIVE O bumped with a rival near the three-quarter pole, raced just
off the pace, drafted in the two path around the turn, steadied while blocked from the three-sixteenths to near the furlong marker then was asked and
narrowly earned the show. FUNNY JOKE came in near the three-quarter pole then jostled with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide
on the turn and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. SEVIER went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two
path around the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then was in tight nearing the wire. BLAKE B.
bumped with foes on both sides near the three-quarter pole, was rated off the pace, went three wide early on the turn then was roused while shifting five
wide coming to the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. RISK PROFILE angled out near the
three-quarter pole, was urged along on the far outside, went five then six wide on the turn and was no factor.

TIMELESS JOURNEY was reserved off the pace, drafted in the two to three path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, came out and bumped
CAPTAINSDAUGHTER then nudged her out to create room at the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead at the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the
three path around the turn, gained the lead under a drive in upper stretch, led until near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place.
IMPAZIBLE DONNA went clear early, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, raced in mostly the two path around the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. MIA BEA STAR rushed the front of the gate at the start,
settled under some restraint, was roused along the rail on the turn, dropped back around that bend, came out into the stretch and failed to threaten.
CAPTAINSDAUGHTER was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the turn, was bumped by the winner and forced out in upper
stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATING CARA was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path under urging around the turn, kept on in pursuit of
the leader in the stretch and got up in the final sixteenth under strong urging to prevail. BRISKY FROLIC stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue
in the four path on the turn, chased outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole then reached even terms for the lead, fought with two
foes to the wire and was denied while just able to get the place. ICY STARE DOWN bumped soundly with a rival at the start but came out in front, showed
the way under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path while asked on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole
then was headed, fought on to the wire and just missed while clear for the show. FANTAIL (GB) broke out and bumped soundly with a foe then was hustled,
raced just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, dropped in from behind horses while roused around the three-sixteenths, moved out into the final
furlong and lacked the needed response. SWEET AS SUGAR settled just off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and came up empty.
LONDON GOLD was rated off the pace, moved from three to five wide while roused on the turn, chased outside into the stretch and also came up empty.

Footnotes
EXCELLENT TIMING showed speed then set the pace, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper
stretch, drew off under a drive until the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. FIRST DEPUTY settled at the rear of the field, was roused in
the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and got up for the place. WARRIORS REVENGE showed
speed between horses, was eased back off the pace at the five-eighths then switched out, chased from that juncture, went around the turn in the three path
and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show. WRITER'S REGRET moved out early, settled on the inside of an opponent, was urged four wide
around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. QUICKFLASH was crowded between foes early, raced off the pace under urging, went
five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FOOLISH GHOST was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside
of two foes then just the winner, was taken back off the pace late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAGGIE T bumped lightly with a foe at the start, moved out while going to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied inside on the
turn, shook clear while set down into upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. AMANDA'S FOLLY prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in
the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the crop and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place.
HYPNOCURRENCY was hustled from the gate, moved in under urging then was rated off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn,
saved ground around that bend, swerved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SHASI bobbled slightly while making
light contact with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path under urging on the turn and failed to rally. PEBBLE LANE
stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, was taken in hand off heels near the
three-sixteenths and weakened. BELLA MICHELLE was urged along off the pace, dropped back in the three path around the turn and failed to respond.
JOEY THE FISH was slow into stride then dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path and trailed.

into the stretch, gained to make a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the advantage, kicked clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady
urging. QUEENS OVER THREES bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven
three wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, was corrected off heels outside the sixteenth-pole and just earned the place. SPOOKY LADY broke
out and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and just missed the place while
able to get the show. PHINNEYS HARBOR was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper
stretch and weakened. PRINCESS SONYA was rated just off the pace, bumped with a rival near the seven-sixteenths, went mostly three wide around the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RED JASMINE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in mostly the two path around
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while chasing in the drive and tired. PAUCILOQUENT bumped with a rival at the start,
was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. FOREVER AMY bumped with foes on both sides at the start,

along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. SUPER PRINCESS was unsettled in the gate then hustled from the start, raced off the
