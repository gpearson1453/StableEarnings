Footnotes
HONEYMOON SUITE sped clear early and crossed over, cut the corner into the stretch, drifted out through the lane and held well. LEMON DROP SHOT
chased four outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, moved out in the lane and finished willingly to close the gap on the winner. CARPE
BELLUM chased in range early while moved off the inside, went three then two wide around the bend, kept on through the lane and outfinished HULK for
third. HULK paused early then switch outside the leader while closest in pursuit, ridden along in the two path on the turn, flattened in the final furlong and
lost the show. AGAPETOS was off a bit slow and dropped back, round the bend in the two path and improved position while failing to threaten. COLLEGE
BOY chased between rivals early then got crowded and shuffled back near the half-mile pole, angled in to save ground through the turn and failed to
menace. TUCKER'S TRIBUTE sat off the pace outside rivals early, angled in then back out on the turn, lacked further response in the drive, pulled up on
the clubhouse turn and walked into the van. RAVELLO chased wide up the backstretch, went five then four wide while falling back on the turn and had little
left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TROPICANA GIRL stalked from outside up the backstretch, rounded the bend three wide, drew alongside the leader with a furlong remaining and dug in to
edge away late. BELLA RENELLA broke out a bit then went up to stalk the pace along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, looked to make a run up
the rail but lacked room behind RAIN DIVA, steered off the fence and finished determinedly to edge that rival for second. RAIN DIVA vied with TROPICANA
GIRL briefly before taking full control, showed the way in the two path around the bend, met the challenge from the winner with a furlong left to run, resisted
to the sixteenth pole, then yielded late and was nailed for second. FLATTERWITHJEWELS settled off the pace, angled into the two path, moved out in the
drive and failed to threaten. SAILING ALONG got put in tight between rivals and checked shortly after the start, came out at the half-mile pole, took the turn
four then five wide and never made an impact. RIGHTEOUSLY was rank briefly early, tracked in the four path through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
TALKLESSWORKMORE sped to the front and moved inside, was pressured by SO I'M TOLD early before moving clear on the backstretch, challenged by
that rival on the far turn, shook free under hand urging in upper stretch, put to the crop shortly after and drew off. SO I'M TOLD applied pressure to the
leader early from outside then remained close up the backstretch, drew alongside once again on the far turn, could not kick on with the winner at
three-sixteenths pole and stayed on to secure the place. LIL RICHARDS BELLO angled over to the rail into the first turn while giving chase then came out
leaving that bend, took aim three wide into the stretch but flattened in the lane. NOLONGERAHOBBY chased along the rail then pause behind a rival
entering the first turn, switched out into the two path, went four wide into the far turn, dropped back while moving into the three path around the bend and
came up empty in the lane. BOTTLE OF SMOKE was off slow from the outside, took the first turn three then four wide, continued at the back in the middle
stages, remained off the rail and came three wide into the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
BONITA LEONA chased along the rail into the first turn, steadied behind the leader then moved off the inside around the bend, tugged the rider forward to
draw alongside and dueled up the backstretch, took over and cleared around the far turn, showed the way two wide into the stretch inched away under a
drive. ROMAN EMPRESS was prominent early between rivals then got put in tight nearing the first turn, chased four then five wide around the bend, angled
in early on the backstretch, split foes early on the far turn, went two to three wide into the stretch and got up for second. TROJAN WAY hustled to the front
and took control early, went four wide into the first turn then crossed over to the rail, dueled inside BONITA LENOA up the backstretch, lost contact with that
rival past the five-sixteenths pole, kept on from the fence in the drive and got outfinished for second. STARSHIP SKY broke a step slow, chased on the
inside then steadied behind the winner on the first turn, lost ground through the far turn while along the fence, moved out in the drive and kept on for a minor
award. CALIFORNIA GIGI broke on top then became rank while three then four wide on the turn, trailed four wide on the second bend and lacked a rally.
SPRING SPINNING stalked two then three wide on the first turn, continued three wide into the stretch and never responded to urging.

Footnotes
DESERVEDLY took control from inside, met the challenge from FAMOUS STAR on the turn, put away that rival in upper stretch and held safely under a
drive. PURIFIED broke inward to lose a step at the start, tracked off the inside, went between rivals on the turn then asked right-handed two wide at the
quarter pole, finished willingly in the final furlong but could not get to the winner. WARRIOR ROAD chased four deep into the turn, three deep into the
stretch and flattened in the furlong grounds. FAMOUS STAR raced up close between rivals early, challenged DESERVEDLY around the turn, lost touch with
that rival in upper stretch and weakened. CUPID'S CRUSADER broke in and brushed rival at the start, chased along the rail into the turn, moved out in the
lane and lacked a rally. LUTHER PASS chased three deep into the turn, lost ground three wide around the bend and weakened down the lane. SILENT
HEAT tossed his head and broke slow, trailed three then two wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ALICE MARBLE was closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter early, applied pressure into the turn, vied between foes and took over with a quarter
mile left to run, inched ahead in upper stretch and held ROSE MADDOX at bay in deep stretch. ROSE MADDOX broke a step slow and trailed early then
angled to the inside and moved into stalking position behind the leader, tried to launch a bid at the five-sixteenths pole but lacked room and checked hard,
swung four wide leaving the bend, finished gamely from outside but lacked the needed late punch. TAMING THE TIGRESS stalked outside rivals to the
turn, challenged three deep around the bend, could not keep up with ALICE MARBLE into the final furlong and flattened to third. FEELING GRAZEFUL
showed speed from inside to assume command, vied with outside pair around the bend, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole and weakened down the
lane.

Footnotes
TECUMSEH CAROLINE broke out, stalked in the two path, loomed three deep on the far turn, took over at the eighth pole and gamely prevailed. ROSE
HARBOR was off slow and bumped at the start, raced off the pace then moved closer on the backstretch, had to pause when running up behind a rival near
the half-mile pole, came three wide into the stretch, rallied four deep in the final sixteenth and just missed. ELEUTHERA broke a step slow and bobbled
leaving the gate, pulled behind the leader and became rank prior to the first turn then rated on the inside, got boxed in past the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
out and bid between rivals while brushing in the stretch but lacked then needed late kick in deep stretch. GHOSTEM bumped leaving the gate then sped to
the front, set the pace on the inside to the stretch, challenged in upper stretch, lost command at the eighth pole, fought into deep stretch and faltered.
PEPPERMINT FLIRT broke out, stalked two wide, pressed the leader into the far turn but failed to keep pace around the bend, got crowded between rivals
at the quarter pole and weakened. AMERICAN CONQUEST tossed his head and came away slow, trailed on the inside and never got involved.
