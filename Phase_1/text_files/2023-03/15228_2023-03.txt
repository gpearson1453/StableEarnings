Footnotes
TELLITTOTHEJUDGE prompt the pace from the outside took command into the turn, shied in, hit rail nearing the three sixteenths pole, came out thereafter,
bothered foes and finished gamely in the drive to be clear late under strong handling. An Objection was filed by jockey of Miss Addisyn K, a stewards inquiry
was lodged and stewards ruled Tellittothejudge be disqualified and placed fourth behind P R Girlfriend for interference at the three sixteenths pole. MISS
ADDISYN K rated along down the backstretch along the inside, shifted out near the quarter pole, was bothered, forced out nearing the three sixteenths pole
and finished gamely to the wire. MISS MEAD settled off the early pace, swung five to six wide into the lane and made a late gain to improve position. P R
GIRLFRIEND showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace, was forced to take up sharply nearing the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the
wire. INEWAGALLIKETHAT raced off the early going, forced out nearing the three sixteenths pole and weakened through the drive while racing four deep.
JOY FOREVER settled off the early going, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. LOVESAFLYIN vied for the early lead and tired readily in the drive.
