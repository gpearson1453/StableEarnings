four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. LIL' MISS MISCHIEF broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way
through the final furlong. SHES A KILLA QUEEN chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final eighth. NATURAL IMMUNITY lagged

finished willingly when clear. A LOT OF SPUNK sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final
furlong. MY FIRST PEARL broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.

DESTINY ONE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a quarter to run, quickly opened a widening lead and was
ridden out to be kept to task. SEAFARING WILDCAT broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive
but clearly second best. ANOTHER WINE pressed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. COUSIN MARK lacked early foot,
raced six-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with some late run. ROBIN'S EMPIRE was off a step slow, lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. WESTERN CHARM settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and
weakened. BRENSON BUNS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WORKIN NINETOFIVE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew clear. PARTY
POLICE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way to the winner after going six furlongs. IMPULSUS was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the
second turn and gave way after going three-quarters. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and did
not offer a bid. LADY JADE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND
TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

TA TA FOR NOW raced unhurried early, circled the field through the second turn while racing five-wide, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and had
GEEJAYTEE measured to the wire. GEEJAYTEE settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the lead with a furlong to run
but could match strides with the winner late. TOP HAT TIGRESS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gave way in the
drive. ANOTHER TEN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged nearing the half, re-cleared approaching the
stretch and gave way in the drive. NO CAUSE TO DOUBT raced off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and failed to threaten. SHE'D RATHER
DANCE was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. FOREST ACCLAMATION lugged out
through the first turn, chased the leaders, lugged out through the second turn and was pulled up and walked off. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND
TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
