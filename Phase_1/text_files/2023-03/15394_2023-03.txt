Footnotes
CENTER MID MADDIE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, closed outside and was brushed by BRION when taking the lead inside the sixteenth
pole. BRION prompted the early pace two wide, sprinted clear approaching the stretch and brushed the winner when drifting out in the drive. DESPITE
ODDS , forced in by MR. EXTENSION leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path inside horses around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. YOUNG TURK , checked when pinched back leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch
and failed to be a threat. SUMO worked between horses throughout and was not a factor. MR. EXTENSION sped to the early lead, saved ground around
the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. TOTAL EFFORT raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. GILLIGAN raced between
horses in the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO drafted back early and saved ground, was put to some coaxing as a three pronged duel developed leaving the far turn, shifted out three wide
advancing into the stretch, altered a bit wider past the quarter pole, leveled off under left handed asks, forged to command with about a sixteenth to go and
drew clear while kept alert. VELVET GHOST rated kindly tracking three wide, moved up and bid three deep leaving the half, sparred outside rivals around
the turn and into the lane, held a slim advantage leaving the eighth pole, failed to contain the winner but kept on well to the wire. SHOOT THEMESSENGER
, off the pace while saving some ground, came three wide into the lane and found his best late between runners to grab the show. ANTIPOISON drifted out
a bit at the break and bumped with CARTE BLANCHE, corrected and led early, rated back off the lead heading to the three quarter pole, eased out into the
turn and came back to bid between foes, dueled on a short lead around the turn and into the lane, fought on to mid stretch then weakened late.
UNEQUIVOCAL , bumped at the break, settled off the rail, was fanned five wide into the stretch, moved up to gain on the embattled leaders near mid stretch
then flattened out late. CARTE BLANCHE , bumped from both sides at the break, regrouped and moved up outside ANTIPOISON to take command
heading to the three quarter pole, spurted clear under some rating and dropped in, was engaged by a pair of foes past the half, kept on under asking around
the turn, failed to go on leaving mid stretch and weakened. EKATI'S VERVE , wide, was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG CHEEKS bobbled soon after the break, recovered and was taken wide soon into the backstretch, moved up four wide outside a trio heading to the far
turn, advanced menacingly to set her sights on the leader past the five sixteenths, wrested command entering the lane, powered away under strong
handling and was kept alert to very late. FOLLY , between rivals early, raced in the clear leaving the far turn, circled four wide under a ride into the lane and
finished willingly to gain the place. VIKING QUEEN , forward early along rail, steadied when a bit rank off heels heading to the seven eighths, saved ground
advancing to the half, shuffled back out of a tight spot soon after, regrouped and chased into the lane, angled out and churned on. ESPERANNNA , three
wide outside foes to clear around the first turn, dropped in and set a rated pace, widened near the five eighths, saw her advantage diminish past the five
sixteenths, failed to fend off the winner entering the lane, stayed on with some interest to mid stretch then gave way. BONITA LASSIE saved ground early,
eased out and stalked, raced two wide between runners nearing the far turn, lacked a punch from there and gave way. LOVE IS STRONG failed to menace.
BRAMBLE BUSH , three wide stalking the early pace, raced between foes and in range near the half, gave hard chase in the clear past the five sixteenths
then retreated through the drive.

PELOTA saved ground on the turn, was in hand waiting for room leaving the turn, found room along the rail inside SPRING THE BEAST to take command
in mid stretch then drew out under steady handling. SPRING THE BEAST set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch, was no match for the
winner but held the place late. ERAWAN , four deep around the turn, lacked the necessary late effort. BAHAMA CHANNEL prompted the pace in the two
path between horses to upper stretch, weakened and drifted out near the eighth pole. HAGLER , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, was caught in
tight quarters near the eighth pole. KING NATE , outrun, raced along the inner rail around the turn. EXCALIBUR , outrun, drifted to the six path in upper
stretch. RIDING CLOUD NINE chased the pace and gave way.

COCKTAIL DREAMING broke a step slow, raced well wide and outside rivals heading to the turn, bumped with VEGAS WILD CAT mid turn, circled five
wide making some headway off of a contested pace into the lane, shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, sustained a run under left handed asks, drew
alongside the leader with a sixteenth to go and wore that one down to prove best in the final yards. BAYLIS STREET tracked the leaders three wide, edged
up four wide into the lane, took over between rivals inside the three sixteenths, briefly went clear leaving the eighth pole, dug in when confronted and
switched over to her correct lead, battled gamely inside the winner but wasn't quite good enough. O SHAUGHESEY , five wide outside foes nearing the
turn, advanced five wide into the lane, ranged up to loom and kept on churning to the end. WILLFUL DESIRE prompted the pace outside the leader, bid to
threaten leaving the far turn, battled into the lane, stayed on between foes in mid stretch then faded late. PEACH BE WITH Q sped to the front, set the pace
towards the rail, staved off pressure past the five sixteenths, dueled inside foes in upper stretch, continued willingly to mid stretch then weakened. DON'T
TELL DEREN , urged along while saving ground, dropped further off the pace near the three eighths, angled out in the final furlong but came up empty.
VEGAS WILD CAT , four wide between rivals with pursuit into the turn, steadied when bumped and in tight mid turn, shifted out some and gave way.
OJITOS BELLOS failed to keep pace. SISTER'S DUTY steadied briefly while between rivals heading to the half, dropped back and failed to make an
impact. An objection by the rider of VEGAS WILD CAT against the winner for alleged interference mid turn was not allowed

Footnotes
SEMPER FI saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased off the rail turning for home, swung outside near the eighth pole, closed determinedly and
was up at the wire. BOBBY G , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch and battled inside horses in the drive.
CAPTAIN QUINT stalked the pace to the stretch, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, gained the lead in mid stretch then hung between the top pair.
EVERETT'S SONG , right to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. ROMP , three wide on the turn, angled to the six
path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. CROUCHELLI trailed.

Footnotes
SHAFT'S BULLET rated outside a rival, moved up under confident handling to take aim off the dueling leaders mid turn, cruised up four wide and from the
outside to take over in upper stretch, moved away past the three sixteenths, was given a couple right handed asks past mid stretch, eagerly widened and
was taken in hand late. BE BETTER saved ground, took closer order under coaxing mid turn, swung five wide for the drive, churned on and was clear of the
rest. WORKIN ON A DREAM , three wide stalking early, angled out and circled six wide into the stretch, offered a mild response and got the show over a
tiring rival. MOMOS , well in hand and to the early lead two wide, was joined from inside heading to the turn, sparred around the turn and into the lane, failed
to resist the winner leaving the three sixteenths and faded. LOCAL MOTIVE prompted the pace along the rail, drew on near even terms after a half, battled
around the turn and into the stretch, lacked a kick from the three sixteenths and weakened. PRAIRIE , off a step slow after being a bit restless in the gate,
made a mild gain four wide past the three eighths, dropped in some in upper stretch and tired. DIXIE DRAWL saved ground off the pace, was hustled along
nearing the three eighths, offered no response and faltered.

IRISH LACE stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, closed outside foes in the drive and was up near the finish. BEST WORST IDEA opened up on
the turn, raced near the rail around the turn, was still clear in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. FIVE STAR FRAN saved ground on the turn and chased
the pace in an even effort. HAZARD lacked speed and was no factor. LET'S MAKE A ZEEN raced along the inner rail on the turn and was outrun. GOLDEN
BLOSSOM , unhurried, raced wide throughout. CAMI RACHELLE chased the pace racing between horses, faltered in upper stretch and was eased.
DESTINED TO DANCE , under urging soon after the start, dropped back leaving the turn and was eased.
