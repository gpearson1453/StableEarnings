Footnotes
MISSCZECH sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. LARIMAR broke sharply to
chase the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but clearly second best. RED NOON RISING was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and
did not offer a bid. MIDNIGHT GARDEN was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

a furlong to run and drew clear. REAL GOOD VYBZ pressed the pace of ROUBAIX while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and
yielded to the winner through the final furlong. UNUSUAL DANCER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out into the lane and finished evenly late. JERUSALEMA (IRE) was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

MISTY MATT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MI REYNA broke sharply to race
just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. EVEN PANDURA lacked early foot, raced
six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch
and finished with a belated bid. RED VENUS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. CIDSTAYINURLAINE settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. FLO TIME pressed the pace from the inside, weakened after the opening quarter

Footnotes
SASSY CAT sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off as a handy winner when
asked. HEART RIVER lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. AND I KNOW was void of early foot,
raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. AMERICAN ROYALTY showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the second
turn and finished with a belated bid. LUCKY STEPPER settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly. LEXOPHILIA chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. ELEMENTAL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. TICK TOCK raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
