EASTBOUND bobbled leaving the gate then took back shortly after, raced outside a rival at the back early, looked to advance on the far turn back lacked
room behind a pair of rivals, angled widest at the top of the stretch, rallied under hand urging and proved best in the end. BALTHAZAR settled inside, tipped
two wide leaving the far turn, moved out further and bumped rival entering the stretch, rallied three deed and took over midstretch, showed the way into the
final sixteenth but was overtaken by the winner late. QUALITY WINS broke a step slow, went up outside the top pair early then dropped back off the leaders
while racing a bit green on the clubhouse turn and backstretch, rounded the far turn three wide, got bumped by inner rival entering the stretch, bid four deep
between foes in the final furlong and finished a game third. NASHOBA'S JOY pulled on the inside around the clubhouse turn and early on the backstretch,
continued to save ground at the back through the far turn, moved out in the final furlong and summoned a mild rally. CLASSICALLY stumbled to the front,
vied inside a pair into the first turn then ceded command, bid two wide around the far turn and took over late on the bend, lost command in upper stretch and
flattened in the late stages. DURAN was off a bit slow to start then went up and started to pull between rivals then tugged clear, challenged around the far
turn from outside, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, fought back to regain the lead outside the eighth pole then weakened.

STRUT ON LOUIE broke out, chased outside rivals early, rounded the bend three wide, drew alongside the leader past the eight pole, took over shortly after
and drove clear. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING sprinted clear quickly, showed the way under confident handling on the inside around the turn, roused at the top of
the lane, could not offer much resistance to the winner in midstretch and stayed on to hold the place. TOP OF MY GAME broke out, trailed two wide into the
turn, moved out to the four path around the bend and outkicked LITTLEBROTHERJOEY for the show. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY broke out, chased the lone
leader early, moved closer into the turn, navigated the bend two wide, weakened in the final furlong and got edged for the show. LET HIM DO broke a step
slow, stalked from inside to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROSE set the pace a bit off the rail early, met the challenge from outside past the half-mile pole, maintained a short lead through the far turn
while saving ground, kicked clear at the top of the lane, pressured by JIBBER JABBER (IRE) in the final sixteenth and held on. JIBBER JABBER (IRE)
settled on the inside at the back, was on the move while steering from the two path out into the four path on the far turn, closed in and drew alongside
CRIMSON ROSE in the final sixteenth but missed. QUARIA THUNDER stumbled badly at the start, tugged in the two path early and backstretch, got
blocked behind rivals on the far turn, tipped three wide around that bend, steered out in the lane and finished willingly to gain the show. CONTROL
FUNCTION was off slow in the beginning, became a bit rank into the first turn, traveled four deep in the middle stages, gained three wide on the far turn but
faltered in the late stages. DENDERA pulled and was rank early while two to three wide, got boxed in on the far turn, lacked room behind rivals at the top of
the stretch, moved out to a clear path and weakened. BALI DANCER broke a step slow, stalked from inside on both turns and weakened down the lane.
SOMMER DAISY (FR) was closest in pursuit in the early going, applied pressure past the half-mile pole, stayed alongside the leader through the far turn,
then retreated in the drive.

drifted out and stayed clear to the wire. BLUE CHEESE OLIVE brushed inner rival early, was forwardly placed outside rivals, bid three deep midway around
the turn, altered in from behind ROYAL HALO with a sixteenth to go and held the place. CAROL'S COMIC stalked the pace along the inside, lost her path
into the turn, angled out and started to gain on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, took aim at the leader in the final furlong but lacked the needed final
kick. BAILEY'S BUDGET was off slow to begin then quickly got into contention, raced two wide leaving the backstretch then angled to the rail and saved
ground around the bend but flattened in the furlong grounds. WHISKEY VISION broke out, lacked early speed, trailed two wide around the bend, angled
outside a weakening and drifting FORDY G in the stretch and failed to make an impact. FORDY G broke out, took a bump from outside early, raced up
close to the outside of the pacesetter early, rounded the bend two wide and between rivals and tired while drifting in the lane.

Footnotes
THUNDER RUN was off slow to begin, settled outside a rival, got blocked midway around the turn, tipped out three wide, angled out further in the stretch,
rallied and drew alongside PRINCESS MIDNIGHT in the final sixteenth and drove past. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT dueled for command outside MISS POLO
BAR, fought with that rival through the turn, held a short lead through the lane but could not fend off the winner late. WIRLY GIRLY broke a bit slow, got
crowded a bit between rivals early and moved back to last, traveled along the rail into the turn, moved out to the three path around the bend, came two wide
into the stretch, angled out in the drive and finished well to miss the place. MISS POLO BAR dueled for command from inside, battled around the turn and
down the stretch, then faltered in the final sixteenth. CON SEAL AND KERRY attended the pace outside the top pair to the turn, could not keep up and
chased the leaders while moving into the two path and flattened out in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT SILENCE became rank early and climbed approaching
the dirt crossing, chased along the inside through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZZY TWISTER brushed leaving the gate, stalked in the two path early, traveled along the inside then tipped out leaving the far turn, angled outside and
took aim at the top pair in upper stretch, drew alongside SANGRE AZUL and drove clear. SANGRE AZUL rated two to three wide early, bid outside the
leader at the five-sixteenths pole, put a nose in front at the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. SHVERE ARBETER sped clear
from inside and controlled the early pace, inched away on the backstretch, met the challenge from SANGRE AZUL on the far turn, resisted to the eighth
pole, then weakened in deep stretch. SAILING ALONG chased four to five wide on the first turn, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the
stretch, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. CALIFORNIA GIGI chased three to four wide on both turns and lacked the needed response when
called upon. SEMI SWEET brushed with the winner at the start, settled inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
OLD PAL drifted out and steadied into the first turn, raced outside a rival off the pace, angled out on the second bend while on the move, chased four deep
into the stretch, reeled in the leader midstretch, kicked clear in the final sixteenth and won going away. JOHNNY PAYCHECK vied inside pair into the first
then inched ahead to set a pressured pace, moved clear past the three-eighths pole, showed the way into the final furlong, then was run down by the winner
and stayed on to hold the place. BE PUNCTUAL pulled a bit early from inside then drifted on the first turn and became rank when corrected, stalked the
pace from inside into the far turn, was closest in pursuit entering the lane, tipped off the fence and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. CHROME TO
RICHES broke a step slow, went three then two wide on the first turn, angled four wide leaving the far turn, kept on through the final furlong and gained a
minor award. MY RANSOM got floated out a bit into the first turn then chased in the two path, traveled outside a rival in mid-pack then moved into range
nearing the far turn, chased three deep into the drive and flattened out. COUNTRY BOY pulled early near the inside, hugged the rail into the stretch and
was not a factor. J D'S RUDE BOY raced up close three deep into the clubhouse turn, dropped back three wide on the second bend, went four to five wide
into the drive and tired. SILENT HEAT pulled early while vying two wide into the clubhouse turn then pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the
leader past the three-eighths pole, weakened between rivals leaving the bend and faded.

Footnotes
DANCE TO THE MUSIC was away quickly in the beginning, dueled outside VIOLENT RUNNER, battled two wide through the turn, inched ahead outside
the eighth pole and remained strong to the line under hand urging. VIOLENT RUNNER broke out and bumped HALF PAST TWELVE, went up to challenge
DANCE TO THE MUSIC for command, battled through the turn and into the stretch, stayed on from inside through the lane but had to settle for second best.
STELLA NOIR chased widest up the backstretch, went four deep into the turn, moved in some around the bend and failed to launch a bid in the stretch run.
HALF PAST TWELVE bobbled then got bumped from inside leaving the gate, chased off the rail then flanked DANCE TO THE MUSIC three deep into the
turn, started to weaken under urging around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK broke in and bumped rival, sprinted clear and moved inside, controlled the pace up with a comfortable lead up the backstretch, held a
diminished lead while cutting the corner into the stretch, then responded to a few taps of right-handed encouragement by drawing away in deep stretch.
LOVESICK BLUES tracked from inside, angled out on the far turn and took aim three wide outside a rival into the stretch, chased the winner through the
lane but had to settle for second best. WEEGEE got sandwiched leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack outside a rival, rounded the far turn three then four
wide and rallied to beat KEENEBEC for the show honors. KENNEBEC bumped with WEEGEE at the start, raced in mid-pack on the inside, hugged the rail
into the drive and gained the show. OVERDUE was bothered from inside at the start, raced on the inside near the back into the clubhouse turn, got boxed in
on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and improved position. DOMINANT SOUL was closest in pursuit while moving to the inside, cut into the lead on
the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. MOODY JIM (IRE) broke a step slow and unhurried on the inside in the
opening stages, went two to three wide on the far turn, steered out in the drive and failed to menace. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) had his shadow roll come
loose in the beginning and bounced throughout the race, saved ground off the pace and failed to menace. BIG BUZZ traveled two wide near the back early,
rounded the far turn four wide, moved out in the drive and was never a factor.
