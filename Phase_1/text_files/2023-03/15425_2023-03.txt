Footnotes
WAR ENSIGN pressed three two two wide into the turn, spun into the lane in the four path while producing a bid, led at the three sixteenths pole as an outer
TWO HANDS FULL challenged, drifted out slightly leaving midstretch while maintaining a margin, and subtly shook free late. TWO HANDS FULL tracked
three wide, took aim on the new leader while in the five path at the three sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid after changing leads leaving that juncture, got
gradually herded out while failing to reach level terms through midstretch, and was turned away in the final sixteenth. LAST PENALTY stalked along the
inside while pocketed around the turn, then sustained a chase along the fence to gain show at the furlong pole, and held that position from an outer rival
late. SWEETASBAILY broke a length slow, but was slow into stride soon after and lagged behind the field into the turn, shifted from the two path to the five
path while rallying in upper stretch, but leveled off in the final furlong. HONEST ANGUS set the pace while feeling pressure from an outer rival around the
turn, was a bit green to change leads while getting headed coming to the three sixteenths, and weakened at the furlong grounds. IDDY BIDDY tracked two
wide and between horses, chased entering the lane, and faded. ABBY DABBY lacked speed in the four path, and was outrun through the lane while
hanging on her left lead. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN FOR THE TOP TWO, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MY SWEET SUMMER vied for the early lead, was up front in between two other competitions all matching strides and making the pace, kept on from that
position through the turn, shifted towards the rail at the three sixteenth pole, to meet other rival in the lane, battled with this rival the rest of the race, was
encouraged and driven and was kept on point and passed this rival in the last few strides in time to take the win. MYSTIC CREED broke slowly, rushed
forward to vie for the early lead, set the pace willingly while racing along the rail, battled down the lane with an outside competitor, but gave in and
succumbed late. CONFLICTING TALES broke out, was in the second flight of horses, shifted out from behind the other horses into the five path, inched
closer outside of rivals around the turn, was still four to five wide entering the stretch, gained show in upper stretch, then failed to progress on the top two
while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong. ROSIE'S ANGUS was off a step slow, saved ground early, starting advancing and shifted out into the
four path, circled the field through the turn, was in contention at the quarter pole, started to lug in down the lane and had trouble switching leads. SAN
MATEO KAT broke on top, prompted the pace outside of a pair of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with them at them after a quarter mile, weakened
into the turn, and was done early. MONTANA ROSE broke into the second flight from the rail, rated behind horses through the turn, chased while racing
along the fence in upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY stalked the leading trio from the two path around the turn, loomed a danger while finding racing room in the four path between horses
entering the lane, ranged up to produce a bid in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway under moderate handling through the final
sixteenth. HOSTILE AFLEET broke half a beat slow at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and rallied
willingly outside of foes to gain place at the sixteenth pole. MY MAN LOUIE tracked two wide and between horses, moved forward along with his outer
counterpart to challenge into the turn, vied with a narrow advantage around the bend, spun into the lane in the three path, but was headed by an outer
bidder approaching the furlong grounds, yielded, yet held show. DIXIE STREET stalked in the four path, inched closer into the turn to vie outside of a pair of
rivals around the bend, but was floated to the five path while failing to keep pace entering the lane, yet sustained a chase in the final furlong while hanging
on his left lead. COHERE was void of early speed along the inside, shifted from the two path to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. JEB'S
LUCKY EIGHT steadied out of crowded quarters in the opening furlong, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, and failed to rally. FLASHY PREMO
was keen between horses early on, checked back to trail the field nearing the five furlong pole, took the turn in the three path, and was outrun. BASEBALL
LOVER set the pace along the inside, was confronted by a pair of outer rivals into the turn, got headed around the bend, then stopped through the lane
while failing to change leads.

Footnotes
CALL ME Q broke outwardly,, was quickly corrected, then rated while setting the pace willingly, raced along the rail through out, was given the cue at the
quarter pole and drew off under driving pressure. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN vied for the lead, pressed two wide and between horses around the turn, but
proved no match for the lead nearing the lane, and was second best. LITTLE MAN CAN took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, yet was
prominent early, took in hand to chase behind the leaders down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, then lacked a bid. STATE SCHOOL SMART
stalked outside of the top pair around the turn, and weakened. FLYING CAROLINA broke a step slow before bumping an inner rival at the start, lagged
behind the field down the backstretch, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CAT FIVE saved ground off of the pace, then sustained a grinding rail charge to wear down the leader in the final sixteenth, and drove clear.
FASTNFURIOUS set the pace, showed the way with a clear margin in the two path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, shifted in while
maintaining a clear margin through midstretch, but was caught by a rail bidder in the closing stages. FOE chased three wide and between horses, then kept
on to hold show. MIDNIGHT HUNTER broke out, tracked four wide, chased around the turn, and lacked a bid. G'S LAW broke out, trailed in the three path,
fanned to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. FOWLER CASTLE broke a step slow, recovered to press outside of the leader down the
backstretch, but failed to keep pace under an all out drive in the three path and weakened. RONNIE'S REASONING never got involved.

Footnotes
BISHOPS BAY clipped the hind heels of FIRST DEFENDER as that foe crossed over into the first turn, sharply shifted outside of that foe in the process,
recovered to press two wide soon after, sparred around the far turn, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, inched away from his inner counterpart in
the final furlong before his stablemate loomed a large danger in the final sixteenth, embraced that one's challenge nearing the wire, and held gamely.
DEMOLITION DUKE shied away from an inner rival soon after the start, got brushed to the five path entering the first turn, gained a three wide tracking
position around that bend, pursued the embattled leading pair from within striking range around the far turn, failed to shift outside of them until the three
sixteenths pole, yet steadily offered a grinding charge in the final furlong, ranged up to produce a bid in the closing stages, but was fended off. FIRST
DEFENDER had his hind heels clipped by an inner rival while shifting across his path entering the first turn, set the pace around that bend while that
aforementioned foe applied pressure, dueled with him around the far turn, fought gamely through upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, and
grudgingly yielded leaving the sixteenth pole. PRINCELY checked slightly in the opening stages, trailed in the three path, fanned to the five path in upper
stretch, and failed to menace. MOTOWN MISSILE tracked along the inside while running well in the bit, but faded through the lane. THREE ON THE TREE
stuttered a step at the start, then was brushed by a troubled inner rival into an outer foe entering the first turn, laid off of the pace in the four path, and was
done early.

PROMISE ME A RIDE was in the second tier on the rail going into the first turn, angled out into the three path leaving the first turn, tugged forward to press
the leader down the backside, forged an advantage with a half mile to go, cleared while still in hand entering the far turn, was given rein at the three eighths
pole and showed the way with his ears pricked from a pair of outer chasers turning or home, then drew off under a drive in midstretch. TAPTHEDRUM was
off the pace in the two path around the first turn, angled to the four path leaving that bend, gained ground while following his stablemate's move approaching
the far turn, reached place under a drive passing the seven sixteenths pole, chased that loose leader from the three path turning for home, then battled for
place with an outer rival while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong, drifted out and bumped that foe inside the final sixteenth, and prevailed for that
position. GETTLEMAN broke slowly and trailed early on, advanced outside of foes under urging into the far turn, chased the clear leader from the four path
through that bend, responded well to urging in the lane, dueled for place with an inner foe through the final furlong, but was bumped by that rival in the
closing sixteenth, and narrowly missed. MOESAHANDFUL vied early for the lead, settled into the second tier from the two path, but got shuffled back last
after passing the three furlong pole pole, and failed to menace thereafter. SCAT DANZ was on the lead early from the two path, got headed nearing the far
turn, weakened with three furlongs to go, and was eased through the late stages

Footnotes
ANN'S STORM stalked in the two path, was urged in pursuit of the top pair from the three path around the far turn, bid in the four path approaching the
furlong pole, and edged away. LADY CHURCHILL vied two wide, led around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the final furlong, tired, yet
narrowly saved place. CRIDER CHASE set the pace inside of a vying rival, yielded before shifting out turning for home, and kept on to rebid for place late,
but missed. STAR'S DREAM tracked along the inside, yet only managed to chase through the lane. START WELL laid off of the pace in the three to five
paths around the first turn, failed to respond to stout urging in the five path around the far turn, and made little impact. ZEEROCK trailed around both turns,
shifted out at the furlong grounds, and moved up. KAITLYN'S COURT pursued from midpack in the three to four paths, but faded around the far turn. I
DONT KNOW EITHER laid off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved.
