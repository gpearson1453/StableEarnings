Footnotes
TAP FIRST tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, brushed with WOOTDAREITIS entering the stretch and
kicked clear while drifting out mildly late. RUNAWAY TOM raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
turn from the three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. AWESOME ENOUGH pressed the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, dueled from the three path around the bend, raced into traffic in late stretch, causing a pause in his drive and kept on from there to just miss
second. WOOTDAREITIS led the way on the inside early, dueled from the two path around the turn, couldn't go with the winner in the final furlong and
chased that rival home. EXCELLENT MARK raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the tow path and improved
position in the lane. LIL GREEN MACHINE hit the gate leaving it, knocking his rider off balance in the process, settled at the back of the pack for the
opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and made up some ground in the lane while never threatening. WILD IRISHMAN hit the gate leaving it,
raced far off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and passed tiring horses in the lane. EDMUND FITZGERALD stalked the
leader on the outside through the opening stages, raced in the three path around the bend and faded from there. ABE HONESTLY raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four and five path and was empty in the stretch. DUN RIGHT chased the leader
between horses early, navigated the bend from the three path and tired in the lane. CAJUN RED stalked the pace setter between horses up the backstretch,
began to drop back while racing in the three and four path around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch. BRAVE HILARIO dwelt at the break, trailed
well behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START OF THE
RACE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SEVEN, BRAVE HILARIO, HAD A FAIR BEGINNING. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF HORSE FIVE,
AWESOME ENOUGH, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FOUR, TAP FIRST, CITING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

backstretch, challenged from the four path coming around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and edged clear late. SCOTISH STAR (ARG) led the field
from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way racing up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the far bend and dug in in
the lane, giving way in late stretch. SURPRISINGLY saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, switched to the outside with a sixteenth of a
mile to go and gained ground to the wire from there. TEMPLE CITY TERROR raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half
mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. ROUGIR (FR) raced in the three path early, continued up the
backstretch off the pace between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position in the lane while never truly threatening. GAM'S
MISSION bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up
the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four and five path and showed no kick. KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) raced off the pace on the inside
