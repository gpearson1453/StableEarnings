Footnotes
PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) sped to the front, set pace under pressure from along the rail, resisted when challenged in mid-stretch, then inched away
under urging in late stages. CALM SEA chased from two path into backstretch, found traffic briefly midway around the far turn, tipped out three wide into the
stretch, challenged outside winner past eighth marker, drifted in to bump that rival and was turned back. PRECISION STRIKE settled inside, saved ground
chasing p[ace, advanced around second turn, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, finally got free past sixteenth marker and finished willingly.
MALTESE FALCON (IRE) threw his head in the gate and hopped at the start to be off behind field, settled inside then between foes, tipped out three wide in
upper stretch and improved placing late. RAJI broke out then gained the rail, came out chasing the pace, was three then four wide on the final bend,
bumped past the quarter pole, drifted out six wide into and finished with interest. STONKS crossed over early, chased on two path, came out further on the
final turn, was fanned seven wide into the stretch and did not threaten. STORM THE NIGHT pressured the pacesetter from two path into and through the
backstretch, remained close up on same path to the stretch then weakened. ZIHUATANEJO was antsy in the gate, chased three wide early, stalked two or
three wide to second turn, bumped past the quarter pole then four wide exiting that bend and weakened. SURF AFFAIR angled over early, chased two wide
then three deep to the far turn, came back in, secured the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
GILA broke alertly and quickly crossed over to grab command, set pace from the inside, shook free leaving backstretch, padded that margin around final
turn and was kept to task while well in front through the lane. JACQUELINE COCHRAN forced to steady sharply then bumped inside rival shortly after the
break, chased two wide, later gained the rail, pulled clear of others and held for the place. PRESTIGIOUS bumped with outside rival and steadied in opening
strides, settled inside, angled three then four wide into the stretch and passed tiring foes. ANACARAVA (IRE) was forced in and steadied in opening strides,
saved ground chasing the pace, shifted out two then three wide around the second turn and did not threaten. NOBE stalked while outside pacesetter into
and through the backstretch, lost contact with winner around last bend, drifted out into the stretch and faded. TIME TOGETHER got crowded a bit early
between rivals, saved ground tracking the pace to the far turn, also dropped back from the inside around that bend, was eased in the stretch and walked off.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START, THE STEWARDS DID NOT MAKE A CHANGE RULING THAT EVEN THOUGH GILA CROSSED
OVER, THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST JACQUELINE COCKRAN A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BUTKUS was off bit slow and had path taken in opening strides, chased three wide early, made some progress four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the lane, angled in some, reeled in leader, reached front and powered away late. SAWASDEE contested the early pace from the inside, gained slim lead on
the turn, remained inside and edged away in upper stretch, was overtaken in the drive but safely held second. SONIC BREES chased from the inside,
continued along the rail and kicked cleared from others in the stretch. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) was bit off the rail tracking the leaders, drifted out four wide
leaving her turn and weakened in the lane. STIR THE POT broke in slightly, dueled outside runner-up into the bend, forced the pace on same path on the
turn, drifted out bit into the lane and also weakened.

continued inside, dug in late but could not hold the winner. STANDING O tugged early and continued to pull from off the rail down the hill, finally settled later
nearing the dirt section, remained off the rail into the lane, could not match top pair in the drive and was much best of others. MECKLENBURG (IRE) moved
up early then gained lead down the hill from the inside, lugged out four wide crossing the dirt section jumped back onto the turf and weakened bit from
between foes in the drive. HIGHLAND GHOST broke on top and set early pace, forced the issue outside foe later down the hill, got floated out over the dirt
crossing then also weakened in the drive. TIDAL FORCES reserved early, angled out nearing dirt portion was forced six, seven then eighth wide into the
stretch and finished willingly from the outside and three deep on the wire. ONE SILK STOCKING unhurried from the inside, remained along the rail, angled
out three then four wide leaving the hill and was no threat. KANDEREL reserved early from off the rail, angled inward later down the hill, came two wide into
the stretch and lacked late response. FAYATHAAN (IRE) prominent early from the outside, continued three or four wide down the hill, was fanned out seven

BIG BELL reserved off the early pace, chased three to the bend then moved up four wide around the turn and into the stretch, came in bit and challenged
leader nearing sixteenth marker before inching away in late stages. SILENT BEAUTY settled off the leaders, moved up three wide, engaged leaders three
deep midway on the turn, gained lead on same path into the stretch, edged away, dug in when challenged but was out gamed to the wire. SPOILED
ROTTEN broke in and brushed rival, forced the pace on two path, bid between foes nearing quarter marker, continued on same path into the lane and
weakened. SHEMAKESCENTS brushed at the break, moved up inside, gained slim lead from along the rail, set pressured pace into and on the turn,
remained inside and weakened. SPANISH CHANNEL tracked leaders from along the rail, taken off fence on the turn and failed to threaten in the drive.
NAUGHTY EVELYN was a bit rank from the gate and early on the backstretch, chased five then four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
BALLET DANCING content to track pacesetter while along the rail or on the two path, moved up briskly on final turn, swept past leader past quarter marker,
kicked clear in upper stretch and padded final margin under steady handling. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE reserved along the rail and saved ground chasing
the pace, swung out three wide for room leaving the last turn then rallied and was up late from between rivals to grab the place. DUVET DAY (IRE) was off
slow to begin, content to trail from along the rail or on two path, angled out four wide exiting the final turn, rallied from the outside and got up in last jump for
third while three deep on the wire. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) was off slow, drifted out early, unhurried while moving inward and raced slightly off the rail
most of the way, between foes into the stretch, took up chase of winner, could not close on that rival, remained inside and was caught in final jumps and lost
placing. ASCENDANCY hugged the rail chasing the pace to the last bend, paused early on the last bend, then waited and was boxed in along the fence
later on that turn and into the stretch, finally got free in the stretch but was no late factor. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) pulled her way to the front early, set
uncontested pace from along the rail, had no resistance for winner nearing the stretch then faded from the inside. AUSTRALIA MIA bobbled in bit of
awkward start, traveled in two path early then was three deep passing half-mile marker, dropped back on the final turn, was taken to the far outside entering
the stretch, was eventually eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SUNRISE JOURNEY was off alertly and quickly sped to the front, set uncontested pace into and on the turn, extended cushion in upper stretch and scored
convincingly under steady hand pressure. I GOT NO MUNNY was away a step slow, climbed early, chased two wide, waited briefly for room in traffic
nearing stretch, moved three wide and between rivals entering the lane and gained the place. JOKER BOY reserved from off the rail, chased three wide into
the bend, was four wide on the turn then five wide turning for home and along for minor award. TOOK CHARGE close up and between rivals to the turn,
was closest pursuer to winner entering the stretch, remained bit off the rail and lost third in final yards. CLAMPETT broke a step slow, chased three deep
early, remained on same path on the turn, came out further leaving the bend and flattened in the drive. GOOD VIBES ONLY broke thru the gate prior, was
caught and reloaded, bobbled slightly at the start, stalked from along the rail, continued inside and weakened in the stretch.
