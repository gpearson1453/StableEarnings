YANKEE AGATE ducked out leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and drew off in the
stretch. JULIANNA'S RUBY was reluctant to load, brushed with the horse to her inside at the start, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from
the three path around the turn and kept on to the finish. OPEN SKY bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, settled off the pace between rivals for
the opening quarter of a mile, moved up from the three path coming around the turn and finished evenly. BAILOUT KELA raced off the pace on the outside
early, navigated the turn from the four path and was not a threat. KEENE ON JENNY bumped mildly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in
the middle of the pack on the rail up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and was empty in the lane.

late. SHUT IT CALI stalked the pace setter on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the bend, dueled down the lane and gave way
near the wire. LUNITA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while
proving to be no match for the top two. DON'T ANNOY ME led the way on the inside up the backstretch, gave way from the two path coming off the turn and
weakened further in the stretch. AFTER NOON KISSES raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, continued around the turn in the five path,
swung wider still into the stretch and finished evenly while never threatening. STAR OF SARAH was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. SUNSHINE GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the three and four path and faded from there. LA VILLANA raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages,
navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. LUCKY VAN HEMEL tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while

began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in the lane. KISSES FOR HANNAH bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off
the pace in the two path for the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the far bend and gained ground late. DONNA LIRICA saved ground around
the first turn, led the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, was caught in midstretch and chased the winner home. SUWANNEE CHICK saved
ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the second bend from the two path and gained ground
mildly in the lane. MYSTIC DREAMS bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside
up the backstretch, began to move up from the three path around the far turn and continued to improve position mildly in the stretch. RAINOUT raced in the
three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and
finished evenly. DYNA'S HONOR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend in the four
path and showed no kick. GLEAMING BRUTALITY raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn
and faded in the stretch. RAHTID saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back from the rail
coming around the far turn and tired further in the lane.
