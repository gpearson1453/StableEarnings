Footnotes
LAST INNING forwardly placed in the early stages, assumed command along the first turn, was well rated through moderate fractions to the quarter marker,
extended the lead and drew clear in mid-stretch, felt pressure from oncoming rivals inside of the sixteenth-marker and held on for the win. STEIN'S GIRL
tracked the moderate early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, swung four wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, could
not reel in the winner in deep stretch and won the nod for the place in a blanket finish for the minor awards. MOONSHINE CAT allowed to settle in the early
stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final stages and just
missed for the place while just getting up in time to secure the show. SNOW HILL took back off of the moderate early pace, was not far back through the
backstretch run, saved ground through the far turn, improved position in mid-stretch, closed well in deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards.
ARISTEIA broke alertly, ceded the early lead to LAST INNING and kept close attendance to that foe through moderate fractions, lost ground in upper stretch
and weakened in the final stage. DANGEROUS ILLUSION unhurried in the early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run, lost ground on the far
turn, came two wide into the stretch, was gaining in the late stages but lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
LOTSA PEPPER was asked to show early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions while rating nicely on the lead to the quarter marker, drew
to a clear advantage in mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in the final stages to hold in a drive. NEVER FOR MONEY chased
the solid early pace, improved position while three wide on the turn, ran in pursuit of LOTSA PEPPER to mid-stretch, closed in the final stages but could not
reel in the winner and held for the place. TIP TOP GAL took back in the early going, saved ground through the turn while improving position, chased to
mid-stretch and made a mild late gain while holding safely for the show. SQUARED SHADY unhurried in the opening stages, raced two wide to the quarter
marker, swung four wide into the stretch, was gaining in the drive but lacked the needed late response. HOT RAGEOUS stalked the solid early pace, lost
ground while two wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

ENJOY IT STRAIT broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled through decent fractions to the second turn, maintained a clear lead to
mid-stretch and drew away while on the left lead in the final stages. HOLY GHOST unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the far turn, closed willingly
in the stretch, was no match for the winner in the late stages but stayed on to secure the place. EAST RAND allowed to settle while never far back,
advanced on the second turn while saving ground, tipped two wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just
saved the show. MAGIC TIGER allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide into the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was gaining in
the final furlong and just missed for the show. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was forwardly placed early on, tracked the decent fractions while outside of the top
pair through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground at mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. BRONZE WARRIOR
forwardly placed in the early going, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground to ENJOY IT STRAIT on the second turn,
dropped back in the stretch run and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
OUR EXPECTATION was allowed to settle in the early going, raced two wide into the turn, angled four wide for the drive, made a mild gain nearing
mid-stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, caught AMANOFMYSTATURE in deep stretch and outfinished the runner-up in the final strides
to prevail. AMANOFMYSTATURE was hustled to be forwardly placed, engaged with PHANTOM DROP and dueled with that foe through solid early
fractions, shook free nearing the furlong marker, was confronted nearing the sixteenth-marker by OUR EXPECTATION, met that bid but was outfinished in
deep stretch and was second best. SATANTA lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, swung widest and came five wide into the stretch, rallied
inside of the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch and was up for the show in the final strides. PHANTOM DROP broke alertly,
engaged with AMANOFMYSTATURE in the early stages and disputed the solid pace with that rival, dueled outside of AMANOFMYSTATURE to the quarter
marker, lost position to that foe in mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS chased the fast early pace, gained ground while
three deep on the turn, lost position nearing the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY took back in the early stages, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well
inside of the furlong marker, caught A DIME FOR ME in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prove best. A DIME FOR ME tracked the solid
early pace, advanced two wide between runners on the turn, confronted the pacesetter in mid-stretch, was set down inside of the furlong pole, could not
hold off AUSTRIAN NAVY in deep stretch and bested the rest. GET'EM TIGER chased the early pace from the inside, lost ground nearing mid-stretch, was
not able to impact the top two in the final stages and held safely in the end for the show. GIANNA'S WILD CAT broke alertly and showed good early speed,
dictated terms through solid fractions to the quarter marker, came under pressure from A DIME FOR ME in mid-stretch, could not hold off that rival and gave
way in the final furlong. LADY IN A HURRY was slow into stride early on, spotted the field heading to the turn and was not a factor. TONI TWO POCKET
raced close up to the solid early pace, chased three wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FLY WICKED EAGLE was sent to establish the early pace, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, turned away FAST SERVICE heading to the
furlong marker, kept to task in deep stretch and kicked clear in the final stages. FAST SERVICE chased the solid early pace from the second flight,
advanced three wide on the turn, pressed the pace to the quarter marker, was held at bay in mid-stretch by FLY WICKED EAGLE, could not match strides
with the foe in deep stretch and stayed on to be second best. DARK MYSTERY lacked early speed, improved position while three wide on the turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, was gaining in the final furlong and was up for show in the final strides. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW broke awkwardly and was green in
the early running, lacked speed through the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, closed willingly and challenged for the show spot. AZURE STAR (IRE)
chased the solid early fractions, advanced two wide while between runners on the turn, could not keep pace in the stretch and gave way. MY MAN STAN
was off a step slowly, rushed up to dispute the early pace, lost position on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages. COBRE broke alertly,
ceded the early lead while forwardly placed heading to the turn, lugged out on the turn, was not persevered with in the stretch, was eased through the lane
and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ALL took back in the early stages, was allowed to settle while three wide on the turn, tipped four wide for the drive, advanced in mid-stretch, closed fast
inside of the furlong marker, caught GARDEES WORLD in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. GARDEES WORLD was a bit
fractious in the gate, broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set decent fractions while clear to the quarter pole, was set down nearing the furlong marker,
held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, was all out in deep stretch, was caught by ALL in the final stages and held on for the place. RUNNING LUCK
tracked the decent early pace, ran in pursuit of the pacesetter while two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, advanced nearing the furlong
marker, made a mild late bid, steadied while racing in traffic in deep stretch and just held for the show. BOUNDFORJAMAICA rated off of the early pace
while not far back, raced three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed well in the drive and just missed for show. DANIELA BELLA crowded
PHANTOM INDIAN at the start, rushed up early on and chased the decent fractions to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, mounted a two wide bid
into the stretch, came within aim at mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and steadied while racing in traffic just before the finish. ROLINGA chased
the decent early pace, raced four wide to the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive and came six wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally.
PHANTOM INDIAN bobbled at the start then was crowded by DANIELA BELLA and was away slowly, lacked early speed, raced two wide into the stretch
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SMILING MOLLY broke alertly, raced close to the solid early pace then advanced while two wide on the turn, continued to gain on QUEEN MOLOTOV in
upper stretch, confronted that rival nearing the furlong marker, dueled to the outside of QUEEN MOLOTOV to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in
the final strides. QUEEN MOLOTOV asked to show early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted at
mid-stretch by SMILING MOLLY, met that bid and battled gamely from the inside to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides. LA V. stalked the solid
early pace, maintained position while three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed willingly in the final furlong and just held for the show. CIELO
DIAMANTE lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive, found her best stride late and just missed for the show.
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and was gaining in the late
stages. PRESKITT chased the solid early fractions, lost ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch drive. THE GREAT HAYNES took back off of the
quick early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not factor.

Footnotes
SPROSTON unhurried out of the gate, was nudged to retain contact with the trailing pack coming out of the first turn, started a sustained rally with a half
mile to run, circled the field on the far turn, continued the rally down the stretch and outfinished a stubborn NIGHT PROOF and HARBOR SKY in the last
strides. NIGHT PROOF showed good speed from the break but was not quite fast enough to grab a inside position and had to take a four to five wide path
around the first turn, remained in the three path down the back stretch, began to rally from the three-furlong marker, chased HARBOR SKY and dueled with
SPROSTON to the outside to the wire, was very game and just missed. HARBOR SKY was among the first into the clubhouse turn, tipped out to the three
path for clear running, joined the leading pair making three across the track at the start of the backstretch run, took over the lead near the nine-sixteenths
pole and opened up on the field going into the far turn, entered the stretch run still with the lead and something left to respond to a pair of challengers to the
outside, was overtaken inside the sixteenth pole but kept on with determination to the finish. BEROLIJEAN (FR) lagged near the back of the field through
the first half mile, mounted a sustained rally under pressure through the turn, came six wide into the stretch and passed some tired ones in the late stages.
LYING GHOST came away well from the inside gate and got the inside run through the first turn, was on the inside of the pacesetting trio to the
nine-sixteenths marker then dropped back, re-rallied when asked to pick up the pace approaching the quarter pole but had to steady behind horses, was still
behind horses with three-sixteenths to run, found a hole along the rail and finished up well. DI LAURIAN hustled to the front from the break, was in the
middle of a trio setting moderate fractions on the front end down the backstretch, started to run with HARBOR SKY when that one separated from the pack,
then ceded the lead and took up a tracking position around the far turn, came under a hard ride with three furlongs to run, stayed to the inside into the
stretch and got within striking distance of the leaders but was unable to sustain the bid and tired in the final furlong. VANISKY lacked early speed, saved
ground and raced mid-pack to the far turn, made some forward progress from the seven-sixteenths pole while still on the inside, swung out a few paths into
the stretch and continued on one-paced. WILD WAGER broke alertly but showed no early speed, saved ground while racing at the rear of the field,
quickened from the three eighths pole, swung six wide into the stretch and ran on down the middle of the track evenly without making up much ground. MR
BOTANICALS near the front of the tracking group through the first half-mile, began a rally from the three-eighths pole while about three wide, got within
striking distance of the leader passing the quarter pole, was under heavy pressure when overtaken by a pair of closers to the outside turning into the stretch,
tired and fell back through the field down the lane. BORKAN was a bit rank while three or four wide into the first turn, settled down for the backstretch run
while racing near the back of the field and still wide, never found another gear and was not persevered with down the lane.
