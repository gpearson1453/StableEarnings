Footnotes
SPEAK YOUR MIND pressured the pace and dueled at even terms two deep into the turn, took the lead approaching the head of the lane, dug in under
steady encouragement leaving the turn and just lasted. AKEMI bore in and made contact with Manarola on the chute then gave chase, was blocked past the
seven sixteenths pole and lost momentum from that point, recovered stride outside nearing the five sixteenths, raced in the five path of the far turn, finished
well and just missed. REIGN ON AND ON chased toward the inside, took aim in the three path midway on the turn, dueled through the stretch and just
lasted for third. MANAROLA was bumped into COACH RUBE and squeezed on the chute then gave chase past the half mile pole, raced in the five and six
paths of the turn, finished strong and just missed third. The latter was bumped on the chute then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly
in the lane. SPARKLE SPRINKLE gave chase then faded into the turn. COLLEGE KID set a pressured early pace, was met and dueled at even terms at the
rail into the turn, but weakened past the eighth pole. HIPNOTIZADA gave chase and faded in the three path of the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of
foul against the rider of Akemi for interference on the chute, lodged by the rider of Manarola, and disqualified the former to fourth place for that incident.

S S SPARTAN ENERGY settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the head of the
lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well under steady handling. MONKEY WRENCH raced with the pace three wide, challenged at the three eighths
pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, took a very brief lead nearing the head of the lane but was soon caught and relented the final
sixteenth. COLONIAL ROAD rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, steadied in tight mid-stretch but came
along for third late. COMEONTURNMELOOSE settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the three path and ran evenly in the lane. JUBAY moved to the inside and rated a slim lead, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, contested even
terms at the rail on the far turn then weakened past the eighth pole. SHADE TREE CORNER saved early ground and showed little response through the
backstretch. WATCHING SNOW FLY raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but faded at the
rail on the far turn.

LATE IN THE GAME raced well back off the rail on the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, lacked
room entering the stretch but angled out at the eighth pole and dug in to take the nod at the wire. ALLEN CAN DO IT rated close off the rail, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, took the nod leaving the turn, dug in under steady encouragement but was
nipped at the wire. SUBJECT TO CHANGE tapered in and took over approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole, was met midway on the far turn but dug in gamely to the finish. WITH SECRET ENERGY settled off the pace about the three path,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride.
UNCAPTURED KING saved ground close to the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened later yards.
ROYAL THUNDER raced in the four path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn.
SAG HARBOR raced well back inside on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the six path and showed little in the lane. CLOSE THE CASE was shuffled back early then saved ground, gave chase into the backstretch and
rounded the far turn in the four and five paths. HUMPTY GRUMPTY rated close inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the
far turn.

Footnotes
CASTLE TOY took the lead at the half mile pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths, rounded the turn at the rail and
was steadily handled in the lane. CHEROKEE CASTLE chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, steadied from anticipated tight quarters at the rail and
altered course mid-stretch but came back to finish well. DENALI D'ORO chased, raced in the four path of the turn, came along for third later yards and was
gaining on the runner-up. LA MADDALENA chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, steadied mid-stretch and flattened stride. IT'S A
REAL HONOR chased through the backstretch, ran near the rail on the turn then raced hemmed in through the upper stretch. NEW AGE BAD GIRL
chased, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and passed rivals in the lane. BLUE MOUNTAIN gave chase, raced in range three wide on the turn but
weakened from mid-stretch. LUCKY BOP gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. LET'S DO THIS chased inside but
checked in tight at the rail nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
NO CHANGE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and came between horses in the three path midway on the far turn, then dug in
under determined handling, matched strides late and took the nod under the wire. AUBURN MILL tapered in and rated the pace, came under pressure at
the three eighths pole, was steadily encouraged leaving the far turn but missed the nod under the wire. FREEDOM RIDER rated close toward the inside,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dueled through the stretch and took third late yards but lacked room nearing the
wire. OUT OF CENTS rounded the first turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and ran evenly in the
lane. ISHIHARA stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths, raced close two deep on the far turn, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
NEVER COMPROMISE rated close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far
turn. FANCY CONCHO rounded the opening turn in the five path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and
flattened stride.
