MY SWEET LORD raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. PANZER
PRIDE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear margin but could not match
strides with the winner through the final furlong. JOHN'S KID lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. SIX SHOTS
OF T hopped at the start, settled off the leaders early, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. WHEREDIDITGO disputed the pace from
between foes and weakened after going a half. ENDALE ARCH was away in good order to vie for the lead from the inside, weakened after going a half and
was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

JEWEL OF DENIAL raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing five-wide, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. SHE'S A
BOSSY GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, gained command with a quarter to run but was no match for
the winner in the drive. RATTLEME chased the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the three-eighths marker, moved three-wide through the second
turn and failed to gain late. MUNNINGS TALE lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a
belated bid. DRAMADORA sprinted clear soon after the start, appeared hard to rate and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

energy. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was off a step slow, rushed to contention, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. ANDY
BOBBY lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. BECKHAM JAMES was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn

Footnotes
ASK THE KING was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with MY MOONDANCER, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held
sway to the wire. THE COMRIE RULE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. MY MOONDANCER
disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, could not match strides with that rival in the drive but finished willingly. DREAMINGOFBLING was
forwardly placed from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and lacked the needed late response. MAMALONA was never far back, raced five-wide
through the turn and gradually gave way. O SHUGAH MINT was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. WAYWARD STORM lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
