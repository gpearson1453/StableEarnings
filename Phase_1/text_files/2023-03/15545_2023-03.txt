Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD STRONG was urged at the break, moved forward inside a rival to press then take over the lead, was clear after the opening quarter,
dictated terms racing on then just off the rail through the turn and with outside challengers, put to urging in the stretch and held sway while being kept to the
task. READTHETRANSCRIPT shifted in early settling last but one, saved ground on the turn advancing on the leader, switched outside that one nearing the
furlong grounds with aim and in striking distance but could make no serious headway while clearly second best. DEORA STORE switched off the inside
early then back to the rail then out a path heading into the turn, raced on or just off the rail through the turn, was along for show inside rivals. TAPIT SAM got
away alertly with the early lead but was soon challenged and overtaken, chased the eventual winner two to three wide into and on the turn floating four to
five wide by upper stretch, failed to rally. WHERE'D THE DAY GO switched out early, advanced between foes three then four wide on the turn to reach
striking distance while floating five to six deep into upper stretch but had no late bid. IRONMAN RICHIE got away well, chased from outside four to five wide
on the turn coming six to seven deep into upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
G MONEY LIV was coaxed forward to take the lead after about the opening sixteenth, moved clear and shifted in to dictate terms, drew off when roused and
was in hand late. FROST WARRIOR got away alertly and had a brief early lead, chased the winner two to three wide, held the place. MAIDEN ROCK broke
just a half-step slowly, raced toward the back two to three wide on the turn coming out a bit into upper stretch before angling in, ran on willingly inside for
show honors while missing second. BELLS OF JOY broke inwardly, settled off the pace inside, came out late on the turn and a bit further in upper stretch,
ran on evenly. EVIE chased three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the lane. OCEAN HONEY switched out widest up the backstretch, went five then
four then five wide on the turn coming out six deep for the drive, lacked the needed late kick. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER pursued four wide into the turn
dropping back and moving out six deep for the stretch run and faded.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SECRET bumped with a rival and steadied just slightly at the start, moved up inside to press but was in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths and
tapped on the brakes, switched out on the turn going two to three wide on that bend looking for room, found it coming to the top of the stretch and struck the
lead past the three-sixteenths, drifted out a bit through upper- to mid-stretch but held sway. IRISH MAJOR settled at the rear shifting in, saved ground on the
turn, advanced inside to gain the place but missing the top spot. HATCHET CREEK got away alertly, was outsprinted early and shifted in, entered the turn
two wide but soon switched out advancing on the leaders, raced four wide through much of the turn coming into upper stretch a bit wider and within range,
kept on steadily but needed more. PO BOY exchanged a bump at the start, moved forward under urging to set the pace racing just off the rail, was
challenged in upper stretch, kept on before yielding late. RESTORING HOPE was urged at the start, chased three wide, was forced out wider leaving the
turn, steadily weakened. IRISH TUFF broke awkwardly and slowly, chased outside four to five wide on the turn, had no rally.

GITA'S LAD moved clear and shifted in to set the pace, drew off when roused, was kept to the task. FIRST MASAMUNE switched outside the
aforementioned heading into the first turn, stalked that one two to three wide, was no match but second best. DYNABLUE saved ground tracking from
inside, came out three to four wide turning for home, lugged in a bit near mid-stretch, held show honors. PINEDALE was brushed lightly and steadied
slightly just after the break, settled at the rear shifting in, saved ground, needed more. GOING WITH STYLE brushed the outer foe just lightly after the start,
chased from outside four to five wide, continued three to four wide on the far turn fanning six deep for the drive, failed to rally. JEFF THE LION chased from
between runners three to four wide, was encouraged along nearing the half, moved in a touch on the far turn, tired.

LICHITA got away alertly and was soon clear to set the pace racing off the rail, was challenged turning for home, met the bid of that foe and dug in to draw
off under steady handling. ICY RIVER stalked the winner drawing nearly even three wide coming to the quarter pole but proved no match while clearly
second best. JULIAISON raced off the rail early, moved nearer the rail for the turn, saved ground, ran on for show. WAR COLORS chased outside going
three to four wide, failed to rally. GET N TIPSY shifted in and advanced inside foes early to third, moved out a path for the run through the turn, could not
rally for the drive.

DARK HEDGES dueled outside a rival from the start, forged clear of that rival in the stretch under steady handling. PERFECT WAGER was bumped at the
start, settled off the pace outside, went four to five wide on the turn, kept on to get the nod for second over TRY TRY AGAIN, who was bumped at the start,
taken hold of near the seven-sixteenths racing on the rail into the turn, switched out soon after travelling in the two to three path, was in a bit tight past the
furlong marker, got through between rivals but just missed the place. SILVER MOON ROAD exchanged some bumps at the start, moved forward to duel
inside the eventual winner, was overtaken by that one in upper stretch, switched out about the furlong grounds while weakening. WILD FOX lightly bumped
a rival at the start, chased three to four wide, had no late kick. CHANNEL WON bumped the inside rival at the start, chased about two wide early,
weakened. CINDY'S STORM had some light bumps at the start, raced at the back, swung seven wide, failed to menace.

RAINY MOUNTAIN bumped a rival at the start, settled while shifting in, saved ground advancing along the rail through the turn into upper stretch, angled out
near the eighth pole drifting just a bit in the process, drove past a sixteenth out and cleared. BEG BORROW N STEAL was bumped at the start then
bumped the inside rival hard, raced off the pace two to three wide through the turn, was gaining while five wide in the stretch, was forced out just a bit in
mid-stretch and was second best. TIME BREAK was within range pursuing three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five to six deep, needed more
late. WILDWOOD DREAMER bumped the inner rival then was forced out bumping the outer rival at the start, recovered to stalk the pace, advanced three
wide coming to the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch, was outkicked. I DON'T KNOW MARGO was bumped at the start, came out a bit and moved
forward to set the pace, was challenged by an outside foe coming to the top of the stretch, dueled inside that one but was outkicked by others. RANK AND
FILE chased briefly inside, steadied about the nine-sixteenths when crowded by the loose horse and retreated to the back, swung six wide into the stretch
and failed to menace. FROSTED ECLAIR was bumped hard on both sides just after the start, lost the rider, was caught on the gallop-out and walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BEG BORROW N STEAL AGAINST RAINY
MOUNTAIN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
WALKER'S WIN brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the leading pair racing off the rail into the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, struck a narrow
lead soon after, edged clear late. TAPE TO TAPE bobbled ever so slightly at the start, dueled for the lead inside a rival, came off the fence turning for home,
could not kick on with the winner but fought on to maintain the place. W W HOTSHOT broke outwardly, dueled outside two then three wide on the turn
drifting out a path turning for home, contended between rivals in upper stretch, kept on to save show honors. W W CANDY bumped with the outer foe at the
start, raced off the pace two wide into the turn, came out four to five wide for the drive, kicked on belatedly but could only gain a minor placing. PALACE
KITTEN saved ground, failed to menace. W W SCOUT'S HONOR got away several lengths slowly, raced outside foes three wide at the rear on the turn
coming out seven wide into upper stretch, needed more.

Footnotes
RATTRAPANTE dueled inside, dug in while being flagged by the rider's crop tp prevail. BETHY broke outwardly brushing a rival at the start, dueled outside
the eventual winner, was second best. WITCHING shifted in settling well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was best of the rest. SUM KINDA PRETTY
had brief speed between runners, dropped back and switched outside the dueling leaders, chased those three wide through the turn, failed to rally.
MAYSTART was brushed and shuffled back at the start, shifted in then moved out four wide nearing the half, came out wider for the drive and showed late
interest. RUNNERS HEAT settled off the pace racing three to four wide into the turn, failed to rally. LORI ATTACK was urged early but lacking speed racing
inside, moved out going two to three wide on the turn, was not a factor.
