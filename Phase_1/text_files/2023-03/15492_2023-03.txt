Footnotes
ORDINARY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn and rated in the five path down the backside, was roused in the
six path rounding the far turn and swung out to eight path into the lane, rallied down the center, and was up for the win in the closing stages. ST IGNACIO
brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, ranged up under a drive around the far turn and bid from the five path under left handed cues
into the stretch, ran on to take the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. LYTE CRUDE chased between foes in the three
path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn and tipped out to the six path into the lane, bumped with an inner foe thru the lane, and kept on for
show. SHOCKWAVE travelled in range along the inside, was under coaxing along the rail around the far turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch
and bumped with an outer foe, continued to bump with that foe thru the stretch, and stayed on but just missed minor rewards. GUSTAVOR bumped with an
outer foe at the start, settled off the pace in the four path, was driven between foes around the far turn and tipped out to the eight path approaching the
eighth pole, but finished evenly. DITHER got bumped between the foes at the start and was keen along the inside around the first turn, raced up close under
a hold in the two path down the backside, waited for room around the far turn and was coaxed between foes passing the quarter pole, tipped out to the sevn
path in upper stretch, but was one paced. DONTONIO got bumped by an inner foe at the start and was behind in the two path, was under coaxing along the
rail around the far turn, and was no factor from the three path in the stretch. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR prompted the pace in the three path, bid between
foes under light encouragement around the far turn and took a narrow lead around the three path at the top of the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole.
CHANGEORDERSONNY bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside of foes, was roused midway around the far turn, but gaveway
at the top of the stretch. CADDY MAN raced in midpack around the five path, was asked for more run going into the far turn, but failed to respond. COSMIC
STARDUST travelled in the six path around the first turn and from wellback in the four path down the backstretch, and was never involved. SUPER
COMPUTING broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced off the pace in the five path but was no menace and eased into the stretch.

DREAM OF A DAY got bumped between foes at the start, rated in the four path, tipped out to the five path and was cued into the far turn, swung out to the
nine path while under a drive into the stretch, and rallied under left handed encouragement to draw past an inner rival in the final strides to win. SOLAR TAP
prompted the pace in the four path, bid under rousing into the far turn, took over and opened up into the lane, stayed on under steady urging, but was
caught by an outer foe late to finish in place. STARSHIP WIZARD travelled in range under a hold along the inside, was under a ride in the two path around
the far turn, in tight while floating out to the five path into the lane, tipped inwards under right handed cues thru the lane, and ran on for show. BLUTO'S
CANDY raced in midpack in the six path, was under urging from the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on but missed minor rewards. BACH
checked in the two path rounding the first turn and chased from there down the backside, was under coaxing in the three path around the far turn and
shifted out to the eight path into the lane, and chased on. IMPULSIVENESS bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the four path, was
driven around the far turn and angled out to the center in upper stretch, but finished evenly. EUPHORIA STAR raced off the pace in the three path but was
no factor while tipping out to the six path in upper stretch. I AM RESILIENT was behind in the two path and never threatened while going wide into the
stretch. SEBARAY stalked in the five path but faded between foes in the stretch. TOLKIEN bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was
under a drive from the four path around the far turn, but was empty in the stretch. DRUM AND DRUMMER pressed in the three path, bid between foes
around the far turn, but yielded into the lane. ROMAN POET set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the rail into the stretch.

ETNICO set the pace in the two path, was roused and opened up into the lane, began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, but held on. MAPPER chased
in the five path, was driven around the turn and in the six path entering the stretch, ran on under left handed urging for place, and just missed getting up for
the win. BAD BOY FRANK trailed in the five path early, shifted in to the two path and was ridden around the turn, fanned back out to the seven path at the
top of the lane, and kept on while tipping back inwards for show. STARTONAHIGHNOTE stalked along the inside, was cued right handed passing the
quarter pole, but faded in the stretch. CHAPLIN prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed into the turn, but was empty in the four path down the
lane.

Footnotes
SIEGE OF BOSTON set a rated pace along the rail and drew off under a mild drive. INFLATION ADJUSTED settled off the pace while racing two wide and
ran on to gain the place without threatening the winner. BREAKWATER tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, had aim
outside of the winner in upper stretch but was no match for that foe and settled for the show. GLIDER chased the pace four wide between foes, edged
closer five deep rounding the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on. RED HORNET raced in range three wide and never threatened.
VLADISLAV failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MY MAN FLINT tossed his head at the start and was off slowly, trailed inside early, went four
wide around the far turn, swung wider in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. WINSTON BLUE pressed the
winner two wide and retreated through the lane. VOLCANIC stalked the pace three wide, steadied while tiring near the eighth pole and was not urged from
there. MOMS MOON chased the pace five wide and was through after a half. RUTHLESS INTENT played no factor while racing four and five wide. ARUBA
was outrun inside and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BRYCE CANYON chased the pace around the four path, ranged up under a ride in the five path and bid rounding the far turn, took the lead going into the
stretch, drifted in against left handed urging into the final furlong, and drew clear. PREFECT settled up close in the three path, was under a drive while trying
to bid between foes around the far turn, but was outrun by an outer foe, shifted out to the six path into the lane, and chased home that foe to place. KIDDIE
HOLIDAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, had to check early down the backside and trailed in the five path, circled inner rivals in the six path rounding
the far turn and was under urging in the eight path at the top of the lane, and got up for show. DAZZLING TRUTHS was unhurried in the three path, under a
drive in the four path around the far turn and angled out to the eight path into the stretch, but finished evenly. JOE PHILLIPS set the pace in the two path,
was cued right handed passing the quarter pole, but faded around the three path down the lane. CASTAGNO rated in the two path, was under coaxing
around the far turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. CASH CALL KITTEN raced off the pace around the four path, was under a drive in the
three path turning into the lane, but never threatened. HEAT OF THE NIGHT tracked between foes in the two path, was under urging out in the five path
around the far turn, but empty from the six path in the stretch. VELOCE raced wellback in the two path and was never involved from the five path in the lane.
HROTHGAR stalked along the inside but backed up around the far turn. MARISA'S MISSION bumped with an inner foe at the start and raced off the pace
around the four path, was cued right handed around the far turn but did not respond and was eased into the stretch, pulled up in the final furlong and walked
off.

Footnotes
HERCULES was unhurried around the six path, cued into the turn and circled inner foes from the seven path around the turn, took aim from the six path at
the top of the lane, rallied to the lead into the final furlong, and drew clear under left handed encouragement. DANVILLE chased in the five path, ranged up
under a drive in the six path around the turn but was stymied from the five path into the stretch, tipped out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and ran
on for place. HEY PORTER stalked in the four path, bid under coaxing from the five path around the turn, headed the leader passing the quarter pole and
was in the five path entering the lane, evened out late but held show. HIGH YIELD KITTEN prompted the pace in the four path, bid under a hold into the turn
and took the lead rounding the turn, was headed passing the quarter pole and roused from the two path into the lane, but was outrun in the final furlong to
miss minor rewards. MR TITO'S rated in the five path, was driven around the turn and angled out to the eight path into the stretch, but was one paced.
TONE FEELIN raced prominently along the rail, was under rousing in the three path around the turn, but faded in the stretch. THE BIG GREY trailed in the
eight path and was cued right handed into the turn, shifted into the five path around the turn, and passed tired horses from out in the center down the lane.
STRASBOURG raced wellback in the five path and was empty going into the stretch. FEDERAL EXCHANGE tracked in the three path but backed up while
floating out around the turn. ASSERTIKO set the pace in the two path but gaveway rounding the turn.

Footnotes
SASSY NATURE set the pace in the two path, shook clear around the turn and held clear under a drive. JUST A CARE (IRE) was pinched back at the start,
made a sharp rail move around the turn, waited for room near the quarter pole, split foes in upper stretch and finished willingly. VAI BELLA saved ground off
the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FLOR DE SOMBRA bumped with JUST A CARE at the start then with SURE CAN soon
after, chased the winner in the two path and was outfinished for the minor awards. WIDE WEST (IRE) prompted the winner in the three path and weakened
in the lane. BEDTIME STORY failed to menace while racing three wide. PRIMROSE RIDGE (GB) had early speed four wide and steadily faded. SURE CAN
veered in at the start and slammed into SHOWGIRL LYNN B then bumped FLOR DE SOMBRA soon after, raced off the pace four wide, swung widest in
upper stretch and had no rally. MIAMI GIRL (IRE) played no factor while racing five wide. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B hit the starting gate, was slammed on both
sides soon after, nearly unseating the rider and trailed in the two path.

STANLEY HOUSE tracked in the four path, loomed up in the six path under a ride around the far turn, bid at the top of the lane, swept past an inner foe
near the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final furlong. BEL AMI raced in the two path around the first turn and stalked in the three path down the backside,
waited for room in the two path around the far turn, was roused passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on for
place. NATE THE GREAT prompted the pace in the four path, was cued to bid in the three path rounding the far turn, took a brief lead from the four path
into the lane, but was quickly overtaken by the outer eventual winner, and evened out for show. SIMCOE bumped with an outer foe at the start, travelled up
close in the five path, was under rousing in the four path around the far turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. RIGEL raced
in the five path around the first turn and chased from the three path down the backside, was driven in the five path rounding the far turn, but flattened while
drifting inwards in the stretch. LANIGAN was unhurried along the inside but never factored from out in the six path in the stretch. NANGA PARBAT (GB) got
bumped between foes at the start, rated in the two path but was tired from the five path in upper stretch. MY FAVORITE TOPIC raced in midpack in the two
path but was empty from the three path turning into the stretch. FULL COVERAGE set the pace inside but gaveway turning into the lane. VINCENZINO was
behind from the two to four paths and never threatened. SILENT MODE broke in and bumped an inner foe, and never menaced around the two to four path.
