Footnotes
THESEGUYSGOTGAME vied three wide down the backstretch, edged clear on the turn, repelled a stretch challenge and stayed safe driving. CAPITAL
CONQUEST prompted the pace inside, angled out into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. PINE ALLEY was urged five wide close
up early then began fading on the turn. RETWEET settled behind wall of dueling leaders and lacked a solid rally. UNION PARK dueled three wide between
rivals early then weakened steadily. KEEP DEM TALKING appeared to take a bad step and bobbled early then was always outrun. IT'S A PITY earned a
narrow lead between rivals in the opening quarter and stopped.

ABIDALE stalked the pace outside, took over after half a mile, drew off quickly and was under wraps in the final sixteenth. SEAMIALAUGH saved ground
close up, eased back and outside near the far turn then came again while no match for the winner. CICI UNIFIED earned a narrow advantage inside for half
a mile and weakened. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD chased inside off the pace and passed fading rivals. YOURINDENIAL trailed far behind early inside and
was never in contention. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE lagged far behind, moved very wide on the final turn and had no response. BOOM BOOM GIRL prompted
the pace three wide and stopped after half a mile.

FOR THE DREAMERS led in hand with narrow advantage, shook loose when ready, drew away in midstretch and remained clear driving. NIMBLE BEAST
prompted the pace three wide, faded on the turn then came again inside through the stretch. EGO MAN prompted the winner outside to the stretch and
continued willingly. PRINCE FILIP angled inside within striking range then flattened out in the stretch. CUMBERLAND AVENUE dropped well behind racing
wide and was never a factor. STRIKE ME DOWN lacked speed near the inside and weakened steadily. WE READY broke very slowly and trailed
throughout. TROPHY CHASER injured his right front leg during the warm-up, was ordered scratched and subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
TOMATER GATOR raced off the early pace on the inside, tracked the leaders on the turn, rallied on the rail, dueled past the eighth pole, then edged away.
JUPI'S LIGHTNING chased outside, bid four wide at the quarter pole, dueled to midstretch and came up second best. MAGNETRON steadied at the start,
was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn, rallied mildly between rivals in the stretch run and got third. LOVERBOY LOU raced off the rail, off the pace,
made a strong wide run on the turn, came five wide into the lane, bid and flattened out. SHACKLE CAT set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and
tired. BREITHORN stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the turn, dueled and tired. CATCH MY VIBE raced three wide off the pace and did not factor.

VITAEMI quickly took control, widened under rating in the stretch and remained well clear while kept to her task. ADHWAA far behind early, advanced inside
with good late energy while no threat to the winner. HIGHTIME VALENTINE lacked speed, moved very wide in the stretch and rallied nicely. EXCITABLE
LADY urged off the leaders outside and continued willingly. WISHES AND DREAMS trailed far behind then passed faltering rivals. BLUNT FORCE dropped
back early, raced wide and faded steadily. VICS COOL CAT moved closer under urging outside on the turn then proved empty. VALUABLE BREIGH raced
in closest pursuit of the winner and stopped in the stretch.
