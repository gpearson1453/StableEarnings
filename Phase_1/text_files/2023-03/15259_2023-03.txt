Footnotes
SUPER QUALITY went straight to the front, dictated terms down the backstretch, drew off in the two path around the turn, was let out slightly in upper
stretch and proved much the best with the rider relatively motionless in the saddle to win handily then pulled up abruptly on the gallop out. BRASS MONKEY
chased the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped well behind the leader in the three path on the turn and safely secured the place. GRAND AGAIN chased
the pace on the outside, dropped well behind the runaway leader in the four path around the turn and tired while clear for the show. TIZA BROWN was
coaxed along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. CHASIN' YOU was urged along off the pace, raced in the three path
around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. AWESOME WEAPON came inward at the break then was sent hard, raced inside
under vigorous urging, saved ground around the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
SALUTE TO AMERICA was well placed down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, pursued the
runner-up while outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. B C GLORY DAYS went to
the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the tempo while inside on the turn, was set down in the two path into upper stretch, responded
well under a right-handed crop, came outward when shown a left-handed crop just inside the furlong marker, led under a drive into the final sixteenth, fought
on under threat from the winner to the wire and was denied but well clear for the place. DEE'S SPEEDSTRE settled just off the pace, chased four wide
around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while best of the rest.
ROMANOATSEE settled on the inside, angled out near the five-eighths then came under urging, went four wide around the turn, moved out near the
three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the stretch, dropped in around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. PAPI ON ICE broke awkwardly and
was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground around the turn, moved out in the stretch and was no factor. BOURBON'S HOPE prompted the
pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, spun five wide under a drive into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until just outside
the furlong marker, faltered badly after swapping to the proper lead at that juncture and was pulled out of the race by the rider then was allowed to ease past
the wire before being walked off.

TRY IT AGAIN broke very alertly, angled in while sent hard, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked inside the
three-eighths, shook clear under one pop of a right-handed crop into upper stretch then switched to a left-handed crop, drew off into the final furlong,
remained under the crop until near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS
settled off the pace, brushed with a rival late on the backstretch, was urged four wide around the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the
winner in the drive and was clearly second best. NEW YORK SUPREME was last to commence then tossed her head early, moved up on the outside,
brushed with a rival late on the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and weakened while just able to get the show. WICKED LADY bobbled
slightly at the start but came out in second position, tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped to the rail at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground
around the turn, moved out inside the furlong marker and just missed the show. CRYSTAL ORB stalked the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide
on the turn and tired. RIDING ON A WINNER steadied while in put in tight against the rail early, settled at the back, went around the turn in the three path
and was no factor. PREDETERMINED was hustled from the gate then urged along near the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced inside to
the two path around that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WISHING ON A STAR stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path midway through the turn, dropped to the two path late on that bend,
responded well when set down briefly in upper stretch and drew off with the rider poised like a statue in the irons to win handily. AFILADA settled off the
pace, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the turn, dropped to the three path outside the quarter-pole, chased the winner into upper
stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. GERMANY JAYVO settled just off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path on the turn and
came up empty while best of the rest. EXTESSA was in tight between foes at the start, settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn and
capitulated. SHAYMYNAME was away alertly, settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the turn and failed to respond.
MEAN MONGOL moved up to take the lead then showed the way in hand, vied in the two path early on the turn, lost the lead to the winner at the
three-eighths, dropped to the rail later on the bend and stopped.

WARRIOR IN CHIEF disputed the pace on the outside of an opponent, moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, controlled the action in the two path around
the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, drifted out some under threat, turned back the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best
under strong handling. LIL COMMISSIONER tracked the pace on the inside of a rival then outside beginning around the five-eighths, was given his cue in
the three path on the turn, gained on the winner coming to the quarter-pole, loomed a threat outside that foe while chasing into the final furlong but was
turned away and outfinished while well clear for the place. KUMAR disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, saved
ground around the turn and tired while just able to get the show. GOLDINI settled off the pace, moved from three to four wide early on the turn, chased
outside into the stretch and weakened then just missed the show. JUMPSTER had a shoe repaired in the paddock, broke out and a bit awkwardly while last
away, angled out at the rear, went five wide around the turn and was no factor. SUPPLY CHAIN chased the pace on the outside, dropped back with five
furlongs to run, went three then four wide around the turn and capitulated. MUCHO SUNSHINE moved out early, leapt in the air outside the seven-eighths,
shifted from the rail to the three path around the turn, was pulled up by the rider into upper stretch and vanned off.

TOXIC GRAY dropped back under urging, moved out outside the nine-sixteenths, gained five wide on the turn, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, drifted
in under a right-handed crop while battling outside of two foes just inside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, came
in a touch more while proving best near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed. EAST COAST GIRL had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was hustled to the front,
set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, fought on well along the rail while inside of two
foes into the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the place. PAROS was off a step slow, settled under some urging, was urged three wide around the
turn, shifted five wide while gaining outside the quarter-pole, chased the leading trio while outside into the final furlong and was out-kicked but earned the
show. CAMM' DUKE was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, battled between horses

ranged up at the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into the stretch then kicked clear, drew away under a drive into the final furlong and maintained a safe
advantage under strong urging. TEMPERMENTAL was well placed just off the pace, drafted behind horses while two then three wide around the turn,
shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. MERAVIGLIOSO was hustled from
the gate, contested the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path under urging while between horses on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened while able to get the show. MY FIRST LOVE dropped back off the pace, was urged five wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed response. LEFT LEANING LUCY chased the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then three wide around the
turn and came up empty. BETTY'S SMILE showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the rail under urging on the turn and
