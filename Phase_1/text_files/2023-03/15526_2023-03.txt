Footnotes
SPIRIT MAKER raced up close between rivals then stalked the top pair in the two path, raced between rivals leaving the backstretch, angled four wide while
launching a bid late on the far turn, quickly took over and clear in upper stretch, asked a few times right-handed and held safely under hand urging in the
final sixteenth. BENDER brushed with inner rival at the start, settled inside at the back, steered out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch,
finished well through the lane but had to settle for second best. STOTLAND traveled two wide outside a rival then a bit off the rail, moved out and took
closer three deep in the middle stages, challenged the top pair from outside with a quarter mile remaining, took over late on the turn, lost command to the
winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. BEE CATCHER stalked the pace from inside, chased behind the leader from the fence through the far turn,
clipped heels and bobbled sharply in upper stretch, altered out midstretch and gained the show. WESTWARD LOOK stumbled and brushed with outer rival
leaving the gate, went up to set the pace inside DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL, held a short lead to the quarter pole, then relinquished command and weakened
down the lane. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL was keen early three deep first time through the stretch, pressed the pace from outside to the far turn, vied
between rivals at the quarter pole and faded while lugging out in the drive.

Footnotes
KISS MY KAT chased from inside then switched to the outside of the pacesetter, commenced a bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the turn, inched
away past the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, shortened a bit late but held safely. ROSY EDGE broke out and bumped rival, saved ground from
off the pace through the turn, moved out in the lane and put in a mild late bid to close the gap on the winner. CHEVY GIRL broke a step slow on the outside,
raced well off the rail then angled into the two path for the turn, chased between foes around the bend, drifted out a bit under a left-handed crop and was
along for the show. SAPADILLA took a bumped from inside at the start, raced four into the turn, three deep around the bend, steered out in upper stretch
and failed to rally. RUFA RED KNOT sprinted clear early, crossed over to the inside, challenged by KISS MY KAT into the turn, dueled around the bend, lost
touch with the winner past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. DANEHILL SONG tracked three wide just out of range, came out into the stretch
and failed to rally. LADY DERBY climbed early and dropped back, went three wide into the turn, angled to the rail then drifted back out and had to be
corrected before moving back inside late on the bend, drifted out in the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN broke clean then dropped back to last, moved closer between rivals then got boxed in from the nine-sixteenths pole to the half-mile
pole, was lightly coaxed on the turn outside a rival then lacked room behind CHAO PHRAYA at the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the stretch,
drew alongside the runner-up approaching the final sixteenth and drove clear. THE GIANTS CANDY set the pace under pressure from outer rival, led two
wide into the turn, cleared and moved inside, showed the way into the final furlong, was collared in deep stretch and yielded late. BLUEGRASS GO GO
coaxed from the gate then angled inside the leader early, stalked along the fence into the turn, tipped two wide leaving the bend, took aim in upper stretch
but lacked the needed closing kick. CHAO PHRAYA pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader two then three wide on the turn and faded. MEGA
MOON broke a step slow from outside, chased three deep early, three to four wide into the stretch, moved to the inside and had little left for the drive.

WYFIRE stalked the pace from inside, waited through the turn, tipped out in the drive, launched a rally under left and right handed urging, put a head in front
past the sixteenth pole, disposed of BOOK SMART and held over the late run from REALLY BIG NEWS in the closing moments. REALLY BIG NEWS
settled inside, lacked room on the turn, steered out in the lane, rallied outside the top pair and was gaining to the wire. BOOK SMART dueled for the lead
inside ZOOKEEPER, inched ahead of the rival on the turn, cleared exiting the bend, was headed by the winner with a sixteenth remaining and yielded.
WARRENS WORLD broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and summoned a mild rally gain a minor award. NEW
YORK DREAMS (GB) bobbled slightly at the start, ran up on heels early, stalked outside a rival into the turn, went two then three wide into the stretch,
tipped at the top of the lane and lacked a rally. WOUND UP broke a step slow, settled outside a rival, steered out four wide leaving the bend, angled widest
in the stretch and weakened. ZOOKEEPER dueled for command from outside, kept the pressure on through the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS SPRING settled inside then moved into the two path early, trailed to the far turn off the rail, started to gain while angling out on the far turn,
challenged five wide entering the lane, took over with a furlong remaining and kicked away in the final sixteenth. STARSHIP DEFIANT chased outside the
top pair into clubhouse turn then dropped back off the pace in the three path, moved forward again in the middle stages, challenged three deep on the far
turn, took over and led four wide into the drive, lost command at the eighth pole and stayed on to secure the place. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE dueled for the
lead from outside, ceded command on the backstretch, challenged into the far turn, fought two wide to the stretch, weakened in the lane but managed to
save the show. DELTA WIND dueled for the lead from inside, cleared up the backstretch, pressured again into the far turn, fought through the second bend
along the fence, lost command leaving the bend and weakened in the final furlong. ROMAN EMPRESS raced up close between rivals then dropped back
and tucked inside for the first turn, trailed into the stretch and lacked a rally.

ROSENQUIST broke out and bumped rival, set the pace on the inside under pressure from AMERICAN REFUGEE, maintained a short lead through the far
turn, put away outer rival in upper stretch and finished strong to the wire. BIRTH OF COOL stalked in the two path then between rivals, had to steady when
running up on heels near the half-mile pole, remained between rivals through the far turn, was hemmed in while trying to get out and bumped rival in upper
stretch, gained a clear path and rallied to earn the place. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, finished
willingly up the fence and got edged for second. AMERICAN REFUGEE stumbled leaving the gate, chased three deep then went up to press the pace from
outside, kept the pressure on to the stretch, then lost touch with the winner and was edged for the place and show. ARREST got bumped in the beginning,
settled two then three wide outside rivals, chased three deep around the far turn, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch and lacked a bid. FROST ALERT
hopped at the start and almost unseated the rider while losing his right iron, regained footing then had to steady when his mount started to pull, raced at the
back then passed rivals on the backstretch, rounded the far turn four wide, came in and impeded BROTHER REID in upper stretch, then kept trying through
the final furlong. CRYPTO MUNNY raced on the inside near the back and never made an impact. BROTHER REID broke a step slow, unhurried in the
beginning racing two wide outside a rival, continued two wide to the stretch, moved out then got impeded by FROST ALERT in upper stretch and never got
involved.

Footnotes
ANYWHO was closest in pursuit of the leader up the backstretch, bid from outside on the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared LIBERAL LADY
entering the stretch, then inched away from COFFEE IN BED under a drive. COFFEE IN BED stalked the pace on the inside into the turn, exited the bend
two wide, moved out and took aim from outside but could not find the needed late kick in deep stretch. GETTHEMONEY was off slow and broke inward,
trailed on the inside into the turn, angled out late on the turn and into the stretch and rallied for the show honors. LIBERAL LADY set the pace up the
backstretch, dueled with ANYWHO on the turn, lost command past the quarter pole and chased that rival into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
LILY POO stalked outside a rival, two then three wide on the turn and weakened. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE chased outside rivals up the backstretch, took
the turn three to four wide and also weakened.

Footnotes
TIERGARTEN pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, cleared in upper stretch and remained strong under mild urging to the line.
PRECOCIOUS TIMES stalked two to three wide early then went between rivals, tipped three wide on the far turn, took aim at the winner at the top of the
lane, needed to find more in the final furlong but was clearly second best. CHEEKIEST was off slow in the beginning, raced three wide then outside a rival
early, found traffic on the far turn and angled out late on the bend, kept on through the drive and bested the rest. ONE ARROW broke out to bumped rival,
raced two wide off the pace early on, moved inside on the backstretch, eased off the rail and came three wide into the lane and got edged for the show.
CALIFORNIA BLING stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the far turn, came off the rail in the drive and lacked a bid. VULIN broke a step
slow from inside, trailed two wide early, had one rival beat into the far turn, tipped out and improved position while failing to threaten. TURQUOISE BIKINI
took a bump from inside at the start, set the pace from inside under pressure, dueled around the far turn and weakened down the lane. DISRUPTIVE
ARTIST broke a step slow, started to pull and became rank early, was taken back clear of trouble on the backstretch, trailed through the far turn and into the
stretch, asked in the lane and was no factor. TIZ MY PRINCESS came away awkwardly in a slow beginning, chased four then three wide on the clubhouse
turn, remained off the rail then got floated six wide into the stretch and made no impact. BUY AMERICAN raced up close three deep, lost ground on the far
turn, got floated out into the stretch and weakened. AMAGE stumbled badly and lost the rider at the start, ran around the track and was eventually caught
near the finish line and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF AMAGE AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER
OWN PROBLEMS LEAVING THE GATE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
