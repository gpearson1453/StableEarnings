Footnotes
STAVANGER settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out leaving the second turn and bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, took over toward the
three eighths and kept the edge over Dakota Boy through the backstretch, drew clear nearing the quarter, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and
just lasted. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS settled off the pace about the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three
path, dug in leaving the turn and just missed. HERETODAYGONMANANA saved ground well off the early pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the six path and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. LIGHTNING LAD rounded the opening turn about the four path
then steadied off the inside flank of Tyry Tyrannosaurus approaching the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths, raced in the five
path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. DAKOTA BOY moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, was met nearing the three eighths and gave chase from that point, but dropped back into the far turn and weakened in the lane. AMERICAN
ROCKY raced off the pace inside on the first turn, rounded the second turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through
the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. DOMINANT FACTOR raced in the five path the first turn and never factored. LIL TOUGHMAN rated close
off the rail early on, gave chase passing the half mile pole then faded through the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against
the rider of Tyry Tyrannosaurus for alleged interference in the vicinity of the seven eighths pole, lodged by the rider of Lightning Lad.

Footnotes
TRUE HEIRESS chased inside and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in to match strides with CAPTAIN SAM and inched ahead of that one through
the final yards, while the latter was hustled to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was
met mid-stretch and grudgingly relented the final yards. FORTES chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and
finished well to take third later yards. GARY DOING BIZ broke through prior the start, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four
path and ran evenly down the lane. DEEMED ESSENTIAL became a bit anxious in the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five path and
passed rivals through the lane. CLEARLY VISIBLE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MS HEADLEY had a brief early
lead, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the turn. SCARLET TANAGER gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened in
the lane.

JEFFERSON SECURITY was a bit reluctant to load but took the lead approaching the three quarter pole, moved to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, edged clear of BERNIE THE GAMBLER midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. The
latter rounded the opening turn about the four path then stalked into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the
far turn and dug in through the stretch to maintain second. FELICIAS CASTLE raced wide on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the five path of the far turn and finished well at the outside girth of Bernie The Gambler. S S ALASKAN CRUZ raced off the rail on the first turn then
eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. WINDSOR'S
TRACKER stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far
turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. ORANGEBURG was shuffled back early and raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride. MADDEYE MOODY rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN rounded the first turn about the six path and showed little response
through the backstretch. MIO GRACELAND raced off the rail on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

forced outward toward the head of the lane but ran evenly in the lane. SHOWTHEMONEYHONEY chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn,
was eased outward toward the head of the lane, lost momentum off the heels of ONLY ROMANCE at the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. The

Footnotes
HAPPY CHARLIE entered the first turn in the six path and raced close into the backstretch, challenged at the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms
from the five sixteenths, raced two deep most of the far turn, bore out approaching the top of the lane but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew clear late
yards. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR rated close to the early pace inside but dropped back at the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and dug in to take second under the wire. JOHNNY SWISH rated close off the rail then closed to the lead
approaching the three eighths pole, was met a dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, relented the final sixteenth and
was nipped from second under the wire. BET ON BITZ rounded the first turn about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the two and
three paths of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. OLD FORTY FIVE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. MONEYFORNOTHING entered the first turn about the five path and settled off the pace,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. REVERE NOTE contested the early pace then showed the
way from the five eighths pole, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths, was met toward the three eighths and faded through the backstretch.
BELMULLET rated close three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn.
