Footnotes
CINDY'S G MAN was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, widened the margin by the quarter pole, then drew off to prove much the best
while being ridden out. C F V RED NOVA was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out when straightened and finished well to
be clearly second best. TRIPLE CHROME chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane while making a bid but flattened out,
bested rest. SPALDING STROLL was reserved early, passed the tiring rivals. MON AMI FUZZIE was allowed to settle early, then lacked a solid rally. LOOK
AWAY was reserved early and failed to respond. THE LAST FACT stalked the early pace and was three wide on the turn, then was forced out leaving the
three sixteenth and then was empty.

Footnotes
WESLAN was allowed to settle early, two to three wide on the turn, then closed well in the three path to hit the front leaving the sixteenth marker, then held
off the late bid from DASH TO THE CASH late to prove best, driving. DASH TO THE CASH was settled back early, wide on the turn and came widest into
the lane, closed full of run late. INSIDE THE CIRCLE vied for the lead between rivals, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear by the furlong marker but
faded late. A P BLAZING GREEN threw head at the start, then rushed up the inside to vie for command, then fell back leaving the turn, then kept on while in
tight the last hundred yards on the inside. SILVER CHILLER was off a step slowly, settled back and was three wide on the turn, then altered course in the
lane and had a belated rally once clear. SMOOTH ATTACK chased the pace four wide and was bumped by the three sixteenths and weakened. MAN ON
ATTACK vied for the lead three wide and then was empty in the drive. MEDAL KING chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, bumped with a rival
leaving the turn and weakened. FLYING CRICKET chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
ONASA dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn, then drew off in the lane while being ridden out.
RUSSIAN HAMMER was settled back early, four wide on the turn, shifted in leaving the furlong marker and then finished well late on the inside with good
energy. MERLOTTI was fractious in the gate opening the front doors but stayed in the stall, then was off slowly, no early speed, two wide on inside on the
turn, then had a belated rally on the inside to gain the show award late. SECRET OPERATION reluctant to load, then was settled early, three wide by the
quarter pole but had no late kick while just missing the show award, even effort. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH dueled for the lead on the inside of the winner,
then shifted out by the three sixteenths when the winner shook clear, then was empty the final furlong. READY MADE chased the pace four wide and
weakened in the drive. ALL ABOUT CROGE was reserved early, five wide on the turn and lacked a rally. GOLD SMOKE was two wide on the turn and not a
factor. TENPAK checked after the start and never threatened.
