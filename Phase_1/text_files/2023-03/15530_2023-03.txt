much the best while being ridden out. CALLMEMARTHAJANE trailed early, offered a strong bid four wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner
while clear for second. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE had good early speed, offered a bid three wide nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished. YEARS AGO
chased the winner along the inside through the turn then faded in the stretch. BOURBONWITHGINGER pressed the early pace two wide and weakened in
the stretch.
