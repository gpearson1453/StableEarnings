Footnotes
WEST SIDE GIRL off a step slow, moved up and stalked pace in the two path, confidently handled far turn, ranged up at will to challenge four wide turning
for home, drew off through the lane to win ridden out. MUMBLEBEE broke on top, narrowly showed the way into and through the first turn, continued to vied
for the lead the middle half mile closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner through the lane, edged clear for the place. EMITYAAZ away with the
runner up, pressured the pace from the three path, vied between horses and inside the winner turning for home, could not match that one or the runner up in
the run to the wire, remained clear of the others. GP'S AMAZING GRACE set or forced the pace while between horses and outside the runner up,
weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL fell back to trail after the start, moved closer four wide through
the second turn, flattened out in the drive. LIL'S TURN was finished early along the inside.

Footnotes
HACKER broke alertly, set the pace off the inside and between rivals, extended drive, proved best in determined fashion. ALL IN GOOD TIME broke to the
outside, pressed along the inside, continued to apply pressure through the turn, stretch duel, outkicked, clearly second best. SINGING GROOM fell back to
trail after the start, swung out four wide turning for home, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. TRAFFIC BOSS pulled while slow to settle in the two
path, remained in the second flight turn, evenly through the stretch, not enoug for the show. FALCONITE forwardly placed for three furlongs outside and
three wide, two path into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. JUST BECAUSE off a step slow, lacked speed, three wide through the turn, failed to
muster a rally. MY KINDA TETON behind the pace while inside, continued to save ground turn, tired through the lane. PERIPATETIC failed to menace while
racing in the two path.

OPENING NIGHT last to leave, raced unhurried early, began to move into the far turn, three to four wide advance second turn, took over into the lane,
steadily clear under firm right handed urging. AWESOME ALLY VEE settled off the pace, also raced three to four wide into the stretch, rallied for the place,
not a threat to the winner late, clearly second best. CHURCH SERVICE asked a bit in the early going, prompted the issue from the three path, brushed with
RATIFIED into the first turn, challenged and put a head in front midway on the final turn, no match for the top two through the lane. RATIFIED away in good
order, in a bit tight and bothered slightly between foes into the first turn, vied between horses the middle half, weakened in the drive. ACCELERATING
BABE broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, continued to contest the issue up front until a quarter remained and faltered. BICARB BETTY fell
back to trail after a quarter, showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
ESPIONAGE with the pace from the start, cleared late on the backstretch, set a pressured pace early in the turn, shook off that rival to be clear again into
the stretch toward the inside, drew out under a right handed crop. COLTONS DREAM chased the winner into the turn, moved up inside to vie with that one
through much of the bend, proved no match through the stretch. DRILL'S LI'L MAN behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, finished
up best of the rest. FIRERY TALE between horses in the second flight up the backstretch, continued in the two path into the lane, went evenly to the wire in
lacking a closing response. LIGHTNING STRUCK void of speed in trailing for a half, passed a couple of tiring horses without posing a serious threat.
JUNIOR BUG last away, moved up to a forward position three wide, asked for some run late in the turn, had little for the drive. SISAWAY NOW in the
second flight while two out to three wide, faded through the lane.

Footnotes
POLTERER within striking distance while five wide through the first turn, bit closer after a half, four wide bid late in the second bend, kicked clear through
the stretch under firm handling. WARTIME HERO dueled up front while racing off the inside, took over and was briefly clear midway on the second turn,
dueled inside the winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one to the wire. TRUMPENCE forwardly placed while four wide and inside the winner
through the first turn, continued to race within striking distance up the backstretch, four wide again entering the stretch, went evenly down the lane in lacking
a closing punch. EGO last to leave, trailed while devoid of any early foot, improved upper stretch after steering out three wide, flattened out a bit the final
furlong. HIGHER AUTHORITY well back, came five wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing kick. TAKE CHARGE GENT within striking distance along the
inside, began to tire through the final turn, continued to fade stretch. OTIS OTIS OTIS narrowly set the pace in the two path, gave way late in the second
turn. BRAVO BRAVO was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SPEND BENJAMINS broke back, lacked early foot, advanced three to four wide into a forward position by late in the turn, lost considerable ground to the
runner up entering the stretch, closed with good resolve out in the strip to get to that one in the waning strides. CHAPEL BARN away in good order, cleared
before a quarter, shrugged off a couple of rivals turning for home, well clear late, could not last. TOWN CHAMP forwardly placed well out in the strip,
advanced and challenged three wide late in the bend, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. COLONEL KLINK void of speed well wide, four to five
wide when moving closer late in the bend, flattened out the final furlong. VIOLENT GIGI behind the first flight inside, in traffic midway on the bend, steadied,
went evenly through the stretch when clear. BLACK STORM also in the second group behind the pace, two to three wide turn, waited late in the bend, also
failed to respond in the drive when clear. PRESS SNOOZE void of speed after breaking back, dropped inside turn, failed to muster a rally. WHOOPING JAY
closest to the runner up early, closer, brief bid between horses late in the bend, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
DAWNY allowed the leader to go early, second flight while three wide turn, collared that early leader inside the furlong marker, quickly clear. GUSTAVI off a
step slow, raced firmly in hand for a half inside, steered out for room when straightened for home, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a threat to
the winner. CANDY COOP hesitated at the break, raced well back for a half inside, rallied up the rail and was also going well at the end. ZIPPIN PIPPIN in
mid pack outside, three to four wide through the bend, failed to respond when set down for the drive. GOING THE DISTANCE broke very sharp, quickly
clear, long lead through some glib opening fractions, caved in late. WAR SAVER lacked speed outside, four to five wide turn, remained back. CLOAK OF
MERCY chased the leader through those lively early fractions, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MAN IN THE CAN broke alertly, allowed the leader to clear before a quarter off the inside, stalked that one in the run up the backstretch, advanced and took
over by midway on the final turn,3w into the lane, drifted out upper stretch, responded when challenged nearing the furlong grounds, proved best in
determined fashion. ONE TEN STADIUM lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, waited briefly in traffic along the inside
turning for home, rallied up the rail after getting clear and finished willingly to earn the place and while getting to the winner. BANDIT POINT outrun early
while outside, closer three wide second turn, mild bid outside the winner nearing midstretch, flattened out. NAVY SEAL settled three wide, came four wide
into the lane, challenged a furlong out, also hung in the late run to the wire. TWISTED DIXIE within striking distance along the inside, came in the two path
for the drive when running with the runner up, tired in the late going . BELLAMYS ROAN in mid pack outside, four wide into the stretch, had little left for the
strtetch run. MORE THAN BLESSED last to leave, void of speed, five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. MACHO RONNIE used a bit to clear the
opening quarter, showed the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed by the winner second turn.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL settled off the pace and the inside, prompted that one up the backstretch, collared that rival turning for home, drew clear, kept to task.
ZOOMER unhurried in the early going, asked along in the second turn, split foes when advancing into the lane, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no
real threat to the winner. ALEX JOON last to leave, void of speed for five furlongs, angled out to be five wide turning for home, displayed a mild amount of
late interest to be along for the show. DECISION MAKER fell back to trail after the start, continued back while in the two path second turn, improved position
through some traffic without posing a serious threat down the lane. SILVER DUST within striking distance after working his way to the rail before a half,
waited briefly into the far turn, stalled, evenly drive while continuing along the inside through the lane. STEFANO sprinted clear to set the pace in the two
path, offered little resistance to the winner in the second turn and gave way. CATDADDY in the second flight while four wide through the first turn, continued
outside, four wide again through the second bend, tired. DIGITAL forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, dropped inside, began a steady retreat
before a half.
