Footnotes
HIP HOP HOORAY pursued the loose pacesetter, vied through the turn and drew away under moderate pressure. BET ON DRAMA was urged close up
inside, dueled on the turn, proved no match but lasted for the place. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL split rivals advancing on the turn and closed well too late.
AZTEC QUEEN settled off the pace outside, moved briefly closer then proved empty. TREASURE SEEKER trailed early then raced wide passing rivals late.
ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced within striking range outside and faded after half a mile. RUBY DOOBY DOO lagged far behind and was never in contention.
SCARLET'S SONG broke very slowly, rushed up along the rail then gave way. YELOMA sprinted clear in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

SAILOR AGAIN set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, drew off and then widened in the final furlong under intermittent urging. WAGON BOSS
stalked close up in the early stages, chased inside on the turn, dug in through the lane and just held on for second at the wire. INDIRECTLY raced two wide
off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied late on the rail and just missed for the place spot. MANAHAWKIN raced two wide
off the pace, failed to threaten and bested the others. MAGNETRON raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn and lacked a rally. CAPE MAY
STYLE raced off the pace inside and was outrun. FOREST FIRE stalked close up outside, chased on the turn and gave way.

DIVINARY saved ground throughout, awaited room briefly on the turn, collared the pacesetters and was just up after a long stretch drive. BRUNO BARBER
GIRL moved swiftly to contention three wide on the turn, led in midstretch but lost the head bob. NOW ACT SURPRISED vied inside then between rivals
and weakened in the final furlong. IMAGINE RITA lacked speed saving ground and lacked a rally. BIONIC KAT hustled to a narrow advantage outside and
was finished before half a mile. MAP OF LIFE rated close up three wide down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PEAK OF CHIC set the pace on the inside, shook free nearing the quarter pole, pulled away under urging and was wrapped up for the final yards. LOVE ON
FIRE pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid on the turn, could not stay with the winner, dug in gamely in the lane and earned the place spot.
SHIRLEY GREENE raced two wide off the pace, went three wide on the turn and rallied mildly. STARSHIP ROGUE raced off the pace inside, saved ground
on the turn and lacked a rally. WISHES AND DREAMS raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. CAJUN COUSIN chased three wide, chased on
the turn and tired. MISS PEPPINA chased five wide early, three wide on the turn and faded. AWESOME PAL chased close up four wide early, moved near
the inside on the turn and gave way.

MALIBU STAR moved easily to the front before the half then eagerly drew away while ridden out. EXIT RIGHT settled off the pace, advanced on the final
turn but was no threat. LARGE rated wide off the pacesetters, made a brief bid on the final turn and faded. BRETT'S WORLD dropped far behind then
advanced without menacing. LAVERY trailed for five furlongs then passed fading rivals. KITH forced the pace briefly then stopped abruptly. CRAFTY DON
hustled to the front inside, was collared before half a mile and gave way. SICILIA MIKE dropped back inside, lost contact with his field and was eased in the
stretch.

the turn, dug in gamely outside of SMOOTH B in the stretch run, battled heads apart to the wire and prevailed. SMOOTH B vied four wide for the early lead,
then three wide, dueled two wide on the turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive, battled heads apart with TWISTED RIDE to the wire and just
missed. SIR ALFRED JAMES raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied mildly outside and finished evenly late.
FIVE DREAMS came over slightly early on bumping TWISTED RIDE, vied three wide, then between rivals, dueled inside on the turn and weakened.
THREE TWO ZONE raced off the rail, off the pace and had no rally. KADRI raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. DREAMS UNTOLD raced close up early on the rail, was in tight and forced to check at the five furlong marker, then dropped back. After a
Stewards' Inquiry into the early stages, the race was declared official.

DISCO EBO controlled the pace, repelled challenger near the quarter pole then widened through the stretch while ridden out. CENTRE COURT CHAMP
broke a bit awkwardly, rushed to contention wide, went after the winner on the turn, tired and just lasted for the place. SWEET WILLEMINA trailed early
inside, advanced along the rail, angled out in the stretch and finished with late energy. BUY THE BEST lacked speed outside, moved very wide into the
stretch with a mild bid. LISCOLVIN saved ground close up to the far turn and faltered. NURTURING raced in closest pursuit of the winner and was finished
after half a mile. AMERICAN PYRAMID was urged just off the pace between rivals and gave way. DECO STRONG dropped back three wide and was
always outrun. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE lacked speed and gave way readily.

FOREWARNED raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied into the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole, closed willingly, surged in deep
stretch and was up in time. PRINCE OF RAIN tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid past the half mile marker, dueled inside on the far turn, took
over, drew clear, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides. RUBY BLEU set the pace racing well off the inside, dueled two wide
on the far turn, weakened and then finished evenly to save the show spot. WISH FOR PEACE raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and
gained mildly on the rail. TREASURE TROVE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a
rally. DOUBLE CROWN raced four wide early, then three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and faded. TOUGH TICKETS stalked three or two wide,
then chased and gave way.
