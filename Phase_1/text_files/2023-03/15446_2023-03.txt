Footnotes
DOUBLE DEALER controlled the pace inside, repelled rival on the final turn then drew off through the stretch driving. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE advanced
inside after half a mile, proved no match for the winner but was easily second best. LUCKY MUCHO MAN prompted the winner outside for five furlongs then
proved empty. LIBERTY RUNNER trailed far behind then offered late energy along the rail. EXCLUSIVE ORDER settled off the pace, moved four wide and
lacked a rally. ALONZO MOSELY raced within range three wide for half a mile and retreated. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN saved ground close up then was
finished after half a mile. TOUGH WORKOUT stumbled badly and broke out at the start losing all chance. BOB IN OUR MIDST lacked speed and stopped
abruptly losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
TOURING MARYANNE raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied five wide, charged to the front, pulled
away and was ridden out. POWWA OF LOVE chased outside a rival, rallied three wide into the stretch, bid, then dueled with BOSS CARA in the final
sixteenth and got the nod for second. BOSS CARA chased on the inside, advanced on the turn, split rivals, rallied inside in the stretch run and just missed
for the place spot. STARSHIP BLANCA raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn, came wide and rallied mildly outside. QUASAR raced off
the rail, off the pace, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. FROSTED WILD RIDE stalked the leader in the early stages, chased on the turn and tired. JET
FORCE showed good early speed on the inside, opened up a clear lead, dueled into stretch and gave way. TWIRLING WIND raced off the pace between
rivals and did not factor. LULINDA'S HEART raced three wide off the pace and was outrun.

LAZARETTO rushed to the front inside, widened on the turn and remained well clear under moderate urging. HOPE FOR GOLD moved strongly four wide
on the turn and continued willingly while no threat to the winner. DANGNABBIT rated five wide down the backstretch then flattened out in the stretch.
HEALY'S HOPE far behind early, showed some late energy while no threat. HIDE THE RANSOM chased in midpack in the two path and lacked a rally. GO
FOR THE KILL saved ground off the pace and was never a factor. DISTRACTANDATTACK raced inside, steadied along inside on the turn. SPLITZVILLE
trailed early then moved extremely wide into the stretch. CALCULATED BREEZE flashed speed along the inside and gave way. REFUND RIGLER
prompted the pace then weakened steadily and steadied while fading in the lane.

start, raced off the pace inside, rallied on the rail and closed well to earn the place spot. TRUE DAKOTAN was off a bit slow, trailed the field, angled out in
the stretch, rallied mildly outside and dug in for third. VERO SUN raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied mildly in the stretch run and
steadied slightly behind a rival in the final strides. DADASHEV raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. BIZZY
GILLESPIE raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. FRANK N DUCKY tracked on the
inside, chased on the turn and tired. CRISTIANO'S DREAM set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn and faded. MR. TUTTLE
stumbled at the start, raced three wide off the pace, went five wide on the turn and did not factor. I SAW IT ALL raced three wide off the pace and gave way.

ARTISTIC REASON dueled outside to midway on the final turn, took over then drew away in the stretch while kept to his task. ANGELUS WARRIOR settled
inside the dueling leaders, bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. SPEIGHTSTER RED stalked the pace three wide then continued well
while no threat. SON OF A SAINT prompted the pace outside for three quarters and faded. EXCURSION lacked speed and failed to offer solid rally.
JARLIAN was urged from outset to the front inside then gave way in the stretch. CURLIN'S THRILL far behind early, moved wide on the final turn and was
no factor. MIRACLE SILVER dropped back along the inside and was never in contention. ABSENTEE raced within striking range briefly wide then retreated.
AMOUNT trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. COBBLE HILL fanned six wide on the first turn then stopped abruptly.

BROAD JUMPER raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied farthest outside, drifted in a bit at the eighth pole, closed willingly and
charged to the front in deep stretch for the win. MIA TOSCA was bumped at the start, raced close up inside, chased inside on the turn, moved up behind
rivals, angled to the rail, rallied inside to a short lead at the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to the finish. CHELSEA WALL was outrun early, moved up
at the quarter pole, altered course for a clear path at the eighth pole and finished well on the rail. JEZEBEL JADE raced off the pace inside, came three wide
into the lane, rallied between rivals, steadied when lacking room at the furlong marker, then rallied mildly outside. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE was bumped at
the start, stalked the pace, chased on the turn, bid in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in front of JEZEBEL JADE and tired. ARUMA showed good early speed
three wide, dueled two wide on the turn and tired. MOONBOOTS was bumped at the start, set the pace between rivals, dueled inside on the turn and tired.
After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of JEZEBEL JADE against the winner, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
CHARLYS WILD ANGEL tracked close up on the inside, made a strong rail bid on the far turn, dueled with LEAPING FOR CANDY in the stretch run, dug in
and edged away late, driving. LEAPING FOR CANDY stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with the winner in the stretch drive,
dug in gamely and came up second best. ESCANDALO set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn, weakened and
remained clear for the show spot. TREASURE SEEKER raced off the pace inside, angled off the rail at the quarter pole and closed mildly. WILD N' SASSY
raced off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and passed tired foes. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and
failed to threaten. QUEENPIN raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DONS LAST CALL bobbled at the break, raced four wide early, stalked outside,
chased and faded. SOUL SEARCHER raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and gave way. CANDY FLASH was outrun.
