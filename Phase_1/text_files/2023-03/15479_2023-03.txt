Footnotes
EMPRESS DEONA set the pace in the two path while being well handled, maintained a clear advantage throughout while being given a vigorous hand ride
in the lane to prove best. PERFECT HIDEAWAY was well placed on the inside, continued to save ground on the inside on the turn, then finished willingly to
the wire to gain the place award. SEEKING THE DREAM stalked the winner three wide and made a bid leaving the turn but hung in the lane, bested rest.
ONE MORE KELLY was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and then had a belated rally. CONFIRMED GENIUS was settled on the turn,
came three wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. AEGEAN SEA chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane and was empty.
ECLIPTICALS SARAH tracked the pace four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
T C GREELEY dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid nearing the quarter pole to gain a short advantage, drew clear leaving the turn and then
widened the margin under hand urging. TORRID dueled for the lead two wide to the quarter pole, then could not go with the winner while staying on to be
clearly second best. NECCO prompted the pace three wide, then chased the front runners and dropped to the inside by the quarter pole, weakened while
besting the rest. HE'S FANCY FREE was fractious in the gate, setttled on the outside on the turn and had a belated rally. HERE COMES LUCKY chased
the pace on the inside and weakened. PAGETT tracked the pace three wide early, then dropped back on the turn and swung out wide leaving the turn and
was empty. SYLVIA I AM had no early speed and was far back throughout.

Footnotes
LINGFIELD PARK was well rated early towards the inside, shifted out to be three wide on the backstretch, ridden along on the turn and came four wide into
the lane while making a bid, then went on even terms with COUSTEAU leaving the furlong marker and then won the bob on the wire to prove best.
COUSTEAU was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace three wide and then made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, took over
leaving the turn, then was confronted by the winner leaving the furlong marker, dug in and dueled with that rival to the wire but just missed.
ALLABOUTTHEMONEY was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane but flattened out. C C'S KINGDOM
vied for the early lead three wide, then was between rivals on the backstretch to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. LAKE NAKURU passed the
tiring rivals. BLUEBERRY MASH failed to menace. CONDITION ONE vied for the lead on the inside to the quarter pole, then stopped and was eased the
final furlong, walked off.

OUR MARK STEVEN was five wide into the first turn, settled outside of rivals throughout, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane
while making a bid, then hit the front leaving the furlong marker and then held off ON THE EDGE late to prove best, driving. ON THE EDGE was reserved
early on the inside, shifted out and advanced four wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane, closed well but was too late to get to the winner, good
effort. LONG LEGGED BOY was well placed along the inside, eased out leaving the five sixteenths and launched a bid four wide, vied between rivals by the
furlong marker and then was out kicked late. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid and shook clear by the quarter
pole, but faded the final sixteenth. SLINGSHOT BOY was reluctant to load, reserved early, then moved up between rivals on the backstretch but then had
no late rally. LUCKY LEWIS pressed the pace three wide and then was two wide on the turn and tired. SHADOW CHASER was settled early and then
dropped back. BUCK WILD set a pressured pace on the inside and then gave way on the far turn.

AGGRANDIZE was rated early on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn, then went on even terms for the lead by the furlong marker and had a
long drive with MYSTIC POINT then prevailed late under a drive. MYSTIC POINT stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to
shake clear by the quarter pole, then dueled by the furlong maker but was out kicked late to just miss. BUSTIN PIETRE chased the early pace between
rivals, then was two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane and finished willingly to gain the show award. BOX OF JOE tracked the pace along
the inside, shifted off the inside leaving the turn and kept on to just miss the show award. TIZ HANDSOME set the early pace while clear but was headed on
