WICKED COWGIRL SMART bumped in at the start, put to steady right handed urging and edged away well. ATTACKED broke in two paths at the start,
failed to fully level as he was leaning in until the final yards causing him to get caught. EDDINGTON broke out a path, drifted in three paths midway, and
kept to task in a good try. IMM SIZZLIN IVORY broke in two paths, under strong right handed urging early, outkicked under a hand ride thereafter. JESS
BEING FAMOUS off slow and weaved a bit early in a green effort. JD COWBOY came in and bumped rival at the start, not asked rest of the way in a
educational outing.
