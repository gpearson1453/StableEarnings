Footnotes
I'M NOBLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
was going away late. HE'S INIT TO WINIT pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter but could not resist the
winner from over the top. JOHN'S KID lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy.
MISTER MAFIOSO was away in good order to dispute the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way. CAPACITY was off a
step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NORTHERN COCKTAIL broke sharply to duel for the lead with MISTER
MAFIOSO from off the rail and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

LIGHT CRUISER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, reached the fore nearing the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. BEL RAGAZZO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, could not match strides with the winner in the
drive but finished well to gain the place. BOLD VOYAGER broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
quarter, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and yielded to the winner late. FORGOTTEN VOWS was away in good order to set a pressured pace
from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MR LOVE MUFFIN settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly. CHAMPS SUCCESS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive.
WARRIORS HERO lagged early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF BEL RAGAZZO LODGED AND

Footnotes
KNIGHT EYES pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker opened a clear margin approaching the
stretch and held sway to the wire. SASSY TINKERBELL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady
bid. K P HARRY KITTY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, reached a striking position and finished evenly late. KEEPMEINPOWER was void
of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. PAULINA'S STAR was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not offer a bid. ASK THE KING chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave
way through the final furlong. BOOSICAL LADY set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE was
off slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING
