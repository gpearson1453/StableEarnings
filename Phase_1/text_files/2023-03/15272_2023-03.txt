FOR LOVE NOT MONEY pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, took control through the stretch, opened up and drew off as an easy winner.
UNIQUE BABE set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. GEMSTONE GAL raced in mid pack
early, went five wide into the turn, drifted out mid stretch and was along for third. BRAVE CINDERELLA was void of any early speed, went four wide into the
turn, angled in and flattened out. REVENOOR WOMAN was reserved early, raced six wide, angled in and offered no late rally. BLUEBERRY EYES was
unhurried early, saved ground into the turn and never fired. BIRDIE CURDY tracked the early pace from between rivals and was empty.

SENOR BUSCADOR was unhurried early, advanced six wide through the second turn, was closing steadily through the stretch, took control mid stretch and
edged clear under mild urging. LIMONITE set a clear early pace, raced four wide into the turn, was no match late and was clearly second best. GODDARD
was reserved early, went five wide into the second turn angled in early stretch and was along for third. SHERIFF BROWN was void of any early speed,
raced seven wide through the second turn and offered no late rally. MAGIC IS FLYING tracked the early pace from between rivals, drifted in and gave way.
DUBRONSKY was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
CORRINA CORRINA was unhurried, made a seven wide middle move into the second turn, made a bid on the leader at the quarter pole, dueled to late
stretch and prevailed for the win. BYE BYE BRANDI set a clear early pace, raced four wide through the turns, met the bid of the winner in early stretch,
dueled to the wire and finished second best. OUR TIME TO SHINE was outrun early, angled out to the eight path out of the second turn, was gaining fast
late and needed more ground. BOSSY BABY tracked the early pace, went six wide into the second turn and was empty late. FLAXY LADY was allowed to
settle early, raced along the inside into the home turn, drifted out and flattened out. DELIA chased the early pace, raced between rivals into the home turn
and faded. PASSION BELLE was taken back early, angled out to the nine path in early stretch and offered no late rally. THE RIDER OF NUMBER ONE
LOST HIS WHIP IN MID STRETCH.
