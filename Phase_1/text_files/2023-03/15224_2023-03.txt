Footnotes
DARING DO inside speed to duel, clear into turn, lasted in stretch to the wire. BEACH WALKN trailed to the turn, rallied in earnest outside in the stretch run
too late in a solid effort. EXHIBIT HALL had an inside run to the turn, angled out for clear run for show spot. SPENCER'S SPARKLE three wide speed,
chased to stretch off rail, weakened late going. HARTFUL HOPE speed between horses, finished well on rail to the wire. NEVER TELL PATTI hopped at the
start in a tangle, lost best chance at once. ROCK THE NILE outside run to turn and stretch with no late response when needed. MIDNIGHT MEGHAN could
not keep up outside, faded from the turn and stretch. PETERPAM five wide run to turn, retreated in the stretch run on empty. CLIMB TO GLORY showed no
speed and never menaced throughout.
