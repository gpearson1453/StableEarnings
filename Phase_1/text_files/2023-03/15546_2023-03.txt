Footnotes
TOLLER broke awkwardly but took a quick lead and set a pressured pace while tapering to the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and just lasted under
steady stretch handling. MOSS BOSS chased the pace inside, rounded the turn near the rail, dueled for a clear second inside the sixteenth pole and
finished well while gaining on the winner. STEVETHEVANDRIVER pressured the pace, raced close off the rail into the turn but drifted leaving the turn and
flattened the final sixteenth. SCARLET TANAGER chased the pace, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. GOT FLOFFY gave
chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. TIZ DEJA BLUE gave chase but faded in the five path of the
turn. ALWAYS DRINKING chased outside, raced in the six path on the turn then weakened. BIG HAMBONE stumbled to his nose and lost his rider leaving
the gate. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Toller, for alleged interference in the vicinity of the three eighths pole,
lodged by the rider of Stevethevandriver.

Footnotes
DULCIMER DAME rated close in the four path on the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the
far turn, dueled clear inside the eighth pole and held on well under steady handling. DAT DARES GOLD rounded the first turn in the three path, bid leaving
the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, came between horses at the eighth pole and dueled through the stretch for second. TEQUILA
FOG saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SECRET
CASTLE raced with the pace two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep approaching the five sixteenths pole, was
met between horses midway on the far turn then flattened in the lane. UNLOCK raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and flattened in the lane. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY was hustled along to show the way early then rated into the first turn,
came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths pole, continued close at the rail on the far turn and weakened in
the lane. SHERIFF'S KID showed little response through the backstretch. CLASSIC COLORS saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and weakened. TEMPORARILY rounded
the first turn in the three and four paths and never factored.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE LISA pressured the pace inside, took the lead at the rail midway on the turn and was steadily handled in the lane. FESSIN UP was bumped
leaving the gate and gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and dueled clear in second mid-stretch. GREAT DEVOTION set a
pressured pace leaving the half mile pole, was met two deep midway on the turn and relented second mid-stretch. GOT MORE chased the pace, rounded
the turn in the four and five paths then flattened in the lane. RED LIL SHIPMENT broke inward and made contact with Fessin Up and took a brief early lead,
gave chase past the half mile pole, rounded the turn about the four path then moved to the inside leaving the turn and showed little further.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR stumbled at the break and raced well back, rounded the turn in the three and four paths, eased out into the lane and passed
rivals. PIPERINTHEPULPIT became anxious in the gate then steadied at the start, picked up the chase through the backstretch, angled out toward the head
of the lane and showed little in the lane. PUERTORICAN DIVA was not a factor. CATAFFAIRWITHMEDAL steadied at the start and was through early.

clear under the wire. BLACK CANDY pressured the pace and took the nod approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn,
dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in later yards and just lasted for second. KUKULKAN rated just off the early pace, bid nearing the
quarter pole and rounded the turn near the rail, finished well and just missed second. NITRO TIME came away awkwardly and set a pressured early pace
outside, was met nearing the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then flattened in later yards. FATHER WALSH chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased inside, raced near the rail on the
turn and weakened in the lane. BUTTONED UP was jostled at the break, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and rounded the turn about the four
path, lost some ground leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. BIG DADDY D R exchanged contact with Buttoned Up leaving the gate, raced well
back outside and never factored. MI GUSTO ES exchanged contact with Buttoned Up leaving the gate, raced off the pace outside, rounded the turn about
the four path and weakened in the lane.
