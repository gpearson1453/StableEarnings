in the end. SMARTY RIDGE was unhurried early on then rallied on the turn, moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive and was no menace in late
stretch. UNCLE BUFF chased the early pace while three wide into the turn, was used up and no menace in the stretch. JOHN LOUIS' BEVO was unhurried
early then rallied four wide in the stretch and was no threat. VINDICATO chased the early pace while four wide then dropped back on the turn and was no
threat. CIBOLO ERL was four wide early on then angled inside to save ground on the turn but faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
TEMPLAR RED was allowed to settled along the inside while tracking the pace down the backstretch, then steadied around the five sixteenths pole, angled
out five to six wide on the far turn, then surged down the lane to be up just in time. SUPER EMPIRE raced in the middle of the field while two wide on the
backstretch, then was gaining ground gamely on the far turn, to lead the way entering the stretch, but was caught in the end by an outer rival and was best
for second. CAPETOWN CANDY was well rated while two wide on the backstretch, then was in a hard drive throughout the far turn to menace while four
wide in the stretch to finish well for the show prize in the end. STAR FASHION was unhurried early then continued to race behind the field down the
backstretch, swung five wide on the far turn to close well in the stretch but it was not enough. POET LAUREATE chased the pace while two wide on the
backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn but came up empty in the stretch. DANZIG UP A STORM chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady
drive down the backstretch then flattened out throughout the turn and into the stretch. VICENZA GOLD lead the way into the first turn, then dueled with an
outer into the second turn, was used up and tired in the stretch. CHEER UP dueled for the lead from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn,
was hard used and stopped.

FREEDOM FACTOR pressed the pace down the backstretch from the two path, was moving up to duel throughout the second turn, gained command in the
upper stretch, then drew off in late stretch to prevail in the end. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) tracked the pace while two wide, then was in a hard drive throughout
the far turn to rally from the four path in the stretch and closed willingly for the place prize. DRIVEHAPPY lead the way heading into the first turn and into the
backstretch, then dueled with an outer rival throughout the second turn but could not keep the lead and gave way in the home stretch. EXETER was in a
steady drive to track the pace from the inside into the backstretch, came out three wide on the far turn then continued to race evenly throughout the stretch.
MIDAS CAT was unhurried early then settled in the two path the first three quarters of the course, rallied on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch.
TURN ON THE MAGIC settled along the inside on the backstretch, made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. MOOJAB JR tracked the pace while
three wide on the backstretch, then faded throughout the far turn and had no final bid. DREWPOWER tracked the pace while four wide on the backstretch
then flattened out throughout the second turn and had no final bid.
