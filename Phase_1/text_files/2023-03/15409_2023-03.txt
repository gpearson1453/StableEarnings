Footnotes
WARP SPEED BABY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked around the three path, was under coaxing in the four path around the far turn and cued
right handed while tipping out to the six path at the top of the lane, rallied while tipping inwards through the lane, took the lead just before the sixteenth pole
and drew clear. SIR SAMUEL rated in the three path, was in the four path and roused midway around the far turn, tipped out to the seven path into the
stretch, and ran on under right handed encouragement for place. TAPIT BRIO raced in midpack along the inside, was roused in the two path around the far
turn but was short of room passing the quarter pole, found an opening while shifting out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on for show.
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR brushed with an outer foe just after the start but was unhurried in the two path, was under a mild hand ride in the three path
midway around the far turn, was stymied and had to wait in the six path at the top of the lane, angled out to the center into the final furlong, and stayed on
belatedly. MORETHANICANHANDLE set the pace in the two path, was along the rail around the far turn and roused while tipping back out to the two path
into the lane, stayed on in upper stretch, but yielded while tipping inward in the final sixteenth. SOUPER ROYAL MOON settled up close along the inside,
was coaxed along the rail around the far turn and cued right handed entering the stretch, had to alter course just past the eighth pole, but flattened. GOOD
SOLDIER trailed in the four path, was under a ride into the far turn and urged right handed while swinging out to the eighth path into the lane, and was no
factor. TRUPIA settled in ranged in the five path, tipped into the three path around the far turn and was in the four path entering the stretch, but faded.
STORMY VICTORY stalked in the four path, was between foes in the two path around the far turn, but yielded from the three path in the stretch.
BEACHMONT CHARLIE brushed with an inner foe after the start, raced in midfield around the four path, floated out to the six path while losing ground
around the far turn, and was no menace. CHEF MENTEUR bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the early pace outside, suffered a catastrophic
injury nearing the far turn, pulled up shortly after and was euthanized.

Footnotes
VIGIL ANNA settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, drifted in under right-handed urging in upper stretch,
straightened under solid hand urging, kicked in and was up and clear late. TEMERITY broke inwardly and bumped ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE into TURBIE
soon after the start, raced in range two wide, angled the rail near the quarter pole and rallied inside to gain a share of the place. NOBLE DREAMER set the
pace along the rail, moved into the two path in upper stretch, dug in inside of JUNO SEA through the lane but was unable to fend off the winner late. JUNO
SEA pressed the pace two wide, dueled outside of a foe through most of the stretch and was outfinished. TURBIE was bumped at the start, raced four wide
and had a mild rally. FOR EVER OURS chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was bumped between foes at the
start, raced up close two wide and weakened in the lane. HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO was outrun while racing two wide. ROCK ALONG had early speed
inside, steadied near the half-mile pole and steadily faded inside.

Footnotes
ARCANGELO brushed with an inner foe a the start, was held up off the pace in the three path, was under a drive between rivals around the turn, shifted out
t into the stretch and was in the seven path, swept past an inner foe just past the eighth pole, and drew clear. MAGICAL POWER bobbled slightly at the
start, tracked in the four path, was roused to bid from the five path rounding the turn, took a narrow lead from the four path in upper stretch, and ran on but
was outrun by an outer foe in the final furlong to finish with place. MR MCGREGOR stalked in the two path, bid under rousing around the far turn, kept on
from the three path in upper stretch, but evened out passing the eighth pole to finish with show. SOUTHERN DREAM chased in the five path but was no
factor. JONAS' DREAM broke well and stepped on the tail of a crossing lizard leaving the gate, set the pace in the three path but yielded while drifting
outward turning into the lane. CITIZEN MACK was behind in the four path early and never menaced. NEUTRAL brushed with an outer foe at the start, rated
under a nudge along the inside and was done after a half.

Footnotes
SOUPER LEGACY had his head turned at the start then was in tight soon after, was keen to move forward four wide between foes around the first turn,
advanced four wide around the far turn, took over near the sixteenth pole and dug in to repel a late challenge. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE settled off the pace
while racing two and three wide, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed. SARAWAT set the pace in the two path to the sixteenth pole
and held on for the show. FREE SHIPPING raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. THORN saved ground and failed to menace.
EYES OF CHAMPION was outrun inside. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND chased the pace five wide and came up empty in the lane. STRONG AGAIN pressed the
pace in the three path and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
ACCOMPLISHED GIRL set the pace inside, was under mild rousing around the turn, received a tap on the right shoulder from the two path at the top of the
lane, kicked clear and was much the best. RUGELACH was prompted along while in range from the two path into the turn, was under a drive in the three
path into the stretch, and ran on while tipping in to get up for place. CALABRIAN QUEEN stalked in the two path, was roused from the four path into the
lane, and kept on but was caught by an inner rival late to finish with show. DECIDEDLY SO chased along the inside, was under coaxing while angling out
around the turn and was in the five path entering the stretch, and mildly stayed on. ROYAL BLOOD rated in the four path, was floated out to the six path into
the lane, but was one paced. GOLDEN STAR tracked along the inside, was roused while tipping out to the three path into the stretch, but flattened.
ASTRILA trailed in the two path early and had to steady into the turn, and was no factor while tipping outward thru the stretch. MY MALIBU HONEY raced in
midpack around the three path, was under coaxing from the four path entering the lane, but was no threat. NOW SHOWING steadied into the turn while off
the pace in the two path and was never involved along the inside down the stretch. GUNS N' LILIES was wellback in the four path and never menaced.

HOLY BERRIES tracked the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but
stayed on well clear of the rest. KUKARO raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show. TRUE BLUE PEARL set the pace along the rail around
the first turn and in the two path rounding the far turn and weakened in the lane. DISCO QUEEN pressed the pace three wide and faded through the stretch.
BRODY'S CAUSEWAY failed to menace while racing three wide. WHAT KNOT stalked the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane.

RICHY set the pace inside, was roused from the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, and drew clear under a
heavy drive in the final furlong. NIC'S BRO chased along the inside, was coaxed in the two path rounding the turn, angled out to the seven path into the
lane, and ran on for place. LOYAL LOUIE rated in the four path, was under a ride from said position into the stretch, kept on between foes and nailed an
outer foe on the wire to get show. ADIOS GARY broke out and brushed an outer foe, stalked along the inside, was in the two path around the turn, shifted
out to the six path into the lane and mildly stayed on, but was nailed by an inner foe on the wire to miss minor rewards. DISCREET TUNE prompted the
pace in the three path, was under coaxing in the four path around the turn and took aim from the five path into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong.
FEELTHEBEAT hit the inner part of the gate while leaving and trailed in the three path, shifted to the rail rounding the turn, but did not threaten from the two
path in the stretch. BIG DADDY DAVE brushed with an inner foe at the start and was wellback in the three path early, was under rousing in the four path
around the turn and in the five path at the top of the stretch, had to steady and was stymied in upper stretch, tipped out in the final furlong, but was no factor.
REGIMENTAL COMMAND tracked from the five path, was driven around the turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch. JAVA BUZZ pressed in the
two path but gaveway from the three path in the final furlong. EXCHANGE DAY raced off the pace in the three path but was empty along the rail in the
stretch.

SUPER CHOW was off a bit slowly, angled three wide not long after the start, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command near the
five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while drifting out under right-handed urging. LIVE IS LIFE settled off
the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn and ran on to be clearly second best. TWO OF A KIND set the pace along the rail, gave way near the
five-sixteenths pole and held third. YOUBETTERBEJOKING pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the
drive.

CLEVER THOUGHT brushed with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, was coaxed around the far turn and swung out to the seven path into the
lane, rallied outside of foes and just got up on the wire for the win. MISSIONAIRE bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate, set the pace inside, was
roused turning into the stretch, stayed on under left handed encouragement through the stretch, but was caught on the wire by a late surging outer foe to
finish with place honors. SPINZAR broke out at the start, stalked around the two path, was roused along the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out to the four
path into the lane, ran on while tipping back in passing the eighth pole to get show honors. BEE WELL was in the two path around the first turn and tracked
in the four path down the backstretch, was ridden around the far turn and urged left handed while taking aim from the five path into the lane, and kept on but
was out finished by an inner foe to miss minor rewards. CAMILO settled up close around the three path, was cued to bid around the far turn and was under
a drive while still in the three path entering the lane, but yielded between foes inside the final furlong. ROCKSTAR RED got bumped between foes at the
start, raced in midpack around the three path, was ridden around the far turn and floated out to the six path into the lane, but flattened passing the eighth
pole. GREYSTONE hopped at the start, chased the pace around the four path but never threatened. JUST FOR LUCK raced off the pace in the three path
early and was no menace. UNION TAP trailed in the two path around the first turn and in the four path down the backstretch, and was never involved.

Footnotes
ROYAL KITTEN set the pace well off the rail, continued to lead in the three path around the turn then drew off while continually drifting out under
right-handed urging in the lane. SIR KAHN prompted the winner in the four path, was no match for the that foe in the lane but dug in to save the place.
MOPED DENNIS was bumped hard soon after the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, raced in range in the five path around the turn and
was one-paced through the lane. THE TWINS SNEAKERS raced off the pace three wide and improved position without threatened in the lane. POWER
(BRZ) failed to menace while racing five wide. DUNNIGAN chased the pace five wide and faded through the stretch. ASTROTURF stalked the pace inside
and came up empty in the lane. CHIQUIRIN was bumped between foes just after the start, saved ground and made little impact. PIYPA DE LYNDA broke
inwardly and bumped just after the start, raced four wide and was never in contention.

Footnotes
BIG INVASION settled off the pace in the four path, was under rousing around the turn and tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, tipped inwards
while rallying under steady encouragement down the lane, and was up for the win in closing strides. YES I AM FREE set the pace inside was roused in the
two path around the turn and opened up along the rail into the stretch, stayed on but was caught by an outer foe in closing strides to finish with place
honors. CAROTARI stalked along the inside, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, cued left handed in the two path entering the stretch, and ran on
between rivals under left handed urging for show. FULL DISCLOSURE prompted the pace in the two path, was under a ride in the three path around the
turn, and kept on from the four path in the stretch. NOVGOROD THE GREAT chased in the three path, was under coaxing in the four path around the turn,
and finished evenly from the five path in the stretch. OMAHA CITY rated in the five path, fanned out to the seven path while under a drive into the stretch,
but was no factor. BELGRANO bumped with an inner foe at the start, was wellback in the three path, under urging while floating out to the center in upper
stretch, but was no threat. PANTHER ISLAND tracked in the four path, was cued passing the quarter pole, but faded between foes from the six path in the
stretch. SIGILOSO bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout.
