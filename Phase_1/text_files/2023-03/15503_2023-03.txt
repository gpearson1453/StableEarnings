Footnotes
ROOKIE SALSA stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged and took over the lead while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked
clear in the stretch and held off a late closer at the wire. LITIGANT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from the five path
coming around the turn and gained ground steadily to the finish. SAVAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from
the four path coming around the bend and kept on in the stretch. SIXTY ONE raced off the pace through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the
four path and never threatened. CATCHING FISH chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and
faded in the lane. SHANGHAI WARRIOR led the field through the opening quarter of a mile, pressed the pace from the three path around the bend and tired
in the stretch. JACK LUVS NOVA trailed the field throughout, raced in the three path around the turn and wasn't a factor.

Footnotes
INANNA'S QUEST trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, began to move up the second time around the oval, began a bid from
the four path coming around the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire. PANOTTI raced in the middle of the pack in the two
path through the first mile, swung out to the five path coming around the third turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. FALL
MOON raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the four path
and kept on in the stretch. PACIFIC PRINCESS saved ground early, chased the leader far behind that rival around the second turn and up the backstretch,
continued around the third turn in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. COOL FRONT raced off the pace in the two path through the opening mile
and never threatened. SLIME QUEEN raced in the two path in the middle of the pack around the first turn and the first time by the stands, saved ground
around the final turn and was empty in the stretch. KATIES A LADY opened up a commanding lead while saving ground the first time around the oval, was
caught while racing on the rail entering the stretch and tired quickly from there. BEAUTIFUL TIZ raced off the pace while saving ground through the early
going, dropped back to trail the field coming up the backstretch and was eased to the wire.
