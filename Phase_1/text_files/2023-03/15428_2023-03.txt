Footnotes
ROOT CAUSE stalked in the two path, was cued while shifting out around the far turn and was in the seven path at the top of the lane, rallied past inner
foes while tipping inwards in the final furlong, and drew clear. SETTLING STORM got bumped by an inner foe just after the start, tracked around the four
path, was roused to range up around the far turn and was under a drive from the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on between foes for place.
TAWARET steadied at the start, chased in the two path around the first turn, moved up along the rail into the backstretch and brushed an outer foe, was
under a drive around the far turn and remained on the rail into the stretch, tipped out off the rail into the final furlong, and kept on to get up for show.
WHAT'S GOOD broke outwards and bothered an outer foe, set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside around the far turn and tipped out to
the two path into the lane, stayed on in upper stretch, but evened out late. KAYLEIGH'S PRIDE rated in the two path, was brushed by an inner foe and had
to check into the backstretch, tipped out to the three path just after, shifted back in to the rail around the far turn, angled back out to the six path in upper
stretch, but was no factor. SHIRL'S DELIGHT prompted the pace around the three path, was under coaxing in the two path into the far turn, and weakened
around the four path in the stretch. STRATEGERIZED bore outward just after the start and bumped an outer foe, trailed in the three path around the first
turn and was out in the six path down the backside, and never threatened from the eighth path in the lane. NONNA'S TIRAMISU raced off the pace in the
five path but was no menace.

UPSTREET pressed the pace in the three path, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off handily. BLACK ICE set the pace in the two
path, could not match strides with the winner late on the turn but stayed on well enough remain far clear of the rest. DIXIE GROOVE raced off the pace
three wide and was along for the show. QUICKSTYLE failed to menace while racing two wide. SUBTLE SENORITA chased the pace four wide and lacked a
closing bid. SPRINT BREAKER played no factor while racing three wide. MUTOLA chased the pace from the rail and tired in the lane. GRATIA was outrun
inside.

Footnotes
NEOPHYTE chased in the two path, was put under a ride from the three path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and rallied
under left handed encouragement in the final furlong to get up in closing stages. FLATTER ME trailed in the two path, was cued right handed in the four
path midway around the turn, swung out to the nine path into the stretch, and ran on down the center to get up for place. GONE NUTS prompted the pace in
the three path, was roused to bid around the turn, took the lead from the four path into the stretch, and kept on but was caught by a pair of closing outer foes
late to finish with show. CHEERS FOR KITTEN stalked along the inside, was roused from the rail around the turn, tipped out to the two path while under a
drive into the lane, stayed on under right handed urging, but evened out late. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH raced off the pace in the two path, was coaxed
along the inside passing the quarter pole, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, but was short of room and in traffic passing the eight pole, and was
unable to factor. COUNT DOWN tracked in the four path, was coaxed to range up around the turn and urged right handed from the five path in upper
stretch, but faded. JEST ABOVE rated in the four path, was cued while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, but never threatened. TI SENTO (IRE)
set the pace in the two path but gaveway at the top of the lane.

BEST SELLER pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole and dug in between foes to fend off several stretch challenges.
ZOSTEROP settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied in tight quarters between foes to just miss.
ALWAYS ROYAL tracked the early pace two wide, bid four wide around the far turn, vied outside of a trio through the final furlong and was outfinished.
MAJOR PRYCE raced off the pace two wide, advanced between foes around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of the winner in
midstretch and flattened out late. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, gained a bit five wide around the far turn and
was one-paced through the lane. IRONY hit the starting gate, saved ground in range and came up empty in the lane. FINAL EPISODE had only brief speed
four wide. GREAT ANALOGY steadied early and was outrun while racing two and three wide. LEAD PERFORMER set the pace in the two path and
stopped midway around the far turn.

Footnotes
PORTOFINO set the pace in the two path, was under light rousing along the inside around the turn, was cued while tipping out to the three path into the
lane, opened up slightly into the final furlong, and held safe. MONET NEVER (IRE) pressed along the rail, waited for an opening around the turn, tipped out
to the four path in upper stretch, and kept on for place. LAWFUL was held up in midfield along the rail, was roused passing the quarter pole and angled out
to the eight path into the lane, and ran on for show. ETERNAL BLISS prompted the pace in the three path, was cued to bid between foes rounding the turn
and was in the five path at the top of the stretch, but evened out late. LITTLE SKIPPY bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was
roused in the three path around the turn, moved up while tipping inside entering the lane, but finished evenly in the final furlong. SIDE EYE tracked in the
four path, was under coaxing around the turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but flattened. JAMESTOWN bumped with an outer foe at the
start, raced in midpack in the three path and had to steady into the turn, was coaxed between foes nearing the quarter pole and fanned out to the nine path
at the top of the lane, but was no factor. KING OF MISCHIEF stalked in the two path, was under a ride between foes rounding the turn, and faded from the
six path in the stretch. MACLIN raced wellback around the three path and never threatened. DOLOS travelled off the pace in the four path but was no
menace. ARAK trailed in the four path early and was never involved. DECISIVE PRIDE chased in the five path, moved up early around the turn, but was
empty from the eight path in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHORT CIRCUIT settled in range inside, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up late. CURRENT SITUATION stalked the pace the
four path, took the lead in upper stretch, vied through midstretch, briefly cleared near the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner in the later yards.
THRILLING BABY saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside to gain the show late. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE)
broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced through the stretch. MACHISIMA
went evenly while racing two and three wide. EMIRATES AFFAIR set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch, fought on inside past the
eighth pole then weakened late. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. KHOSEA was no threat while racing four
wide. RED WIND hit the starting gate, raced off the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. AWESOME APEAL prompted the pace in the three path and
faltered nearing the quarter pole. LA RUSIA was outrun inside.

GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR bumped with foes on both sides after the start, rated around the four path, was under a ride around the far turn and swung out to
the eight path into the lane, rallied down the center under left handed encouragement, and was up in the final strides. INDY LYON brushed with an inner foe
after the start, prompted the pace in the three path rounding the first turn and in the four path down the backside, was coaxed to bid in the two path around
the far turn, was in the three path at the top of the stretch, was carried out by an inner foe passing the eighth pole and bumped with that foe passing the
sixteenth, but ran on for place. UNO TIGER stalked around the three path, was under rousing along the inside around the far turn, angled out to the five
path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. STEAK AND CHEESE brushed with an inner foe at the start, was held up off the pace in the two path, tipped
out to the four path turning into the lane, shifted inwards passing the eighth pole, and was staying on but was forced to steady late. CHAPALU was brushed
on both sides after the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused along the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out to the two path into the stretch, drifted
out against right handed cues and bumped with an outer foe near the sixteenth pole, and yielded late. WIN D'ORO trailed in the four path early and never
factored from the six path in the stretch. INVECTIVE brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack inside of rivals, was ridden in the two path
around the far turn and fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, but was stymied passing the eighth pole, and did not threaten. MAGICAL MARRIAGE
bumped with an outer foe after the start, tracked in the four path but backed up in the three path around the far turn.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN JACK settled off the early pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn, took the lead in midstretch, dueled outside of POWERTRAIN from
there and prevailed. POWERTRAIN tracked the pace in the two path, angled four wide to split rivals turning for home, took a brief lead near the eighth pole,
vied inside of the winner and was outfinished. IMMENSE FAITH chased the pace six wide and churned on through the lane to gain the show. O'CONNER
SUNSET raced off the pace two wide, made an inside bid nearing the eighth pole but could not sustain it through the final furlong. MR. RHODIUM raced off
the pace four wide, steadied near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. NIGHT RIDE pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths marker, vied to midstretch and tired. WEST COAST RIDE played no factor while racing two wide. DREAM ON BABY was off slowly and
outrun inside. INSTINCTUAL set the pace in the two path and faltered nearing the quarter pole. FAR FROM HOME was outrun while racing four wide.
