Footnotes
HARRODSBURG brushed with a foe at the start then moved up to take the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to near
the rail while asked on the turn, extended the advantage late on that bend, drew off into upper stretch, came in under one tap of a down-turned right-handed
crop inside the three-sixteenths then switched to the proper lead, was put to a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker and held under steady urging.
OCASEK steadied while in tight along the rail near the three-quarter pole, was urged along at the rear, went three to four wide around the turn, passed foes
into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until being pulled in outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and finished well for the
place. SHREVEPORT made light contact with a foe at the start then was coaxed early, raced just off the pace on the inside, chased against the rail early on
the turn, shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch, moved out while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong,
swapped to the proper lead while dropping in outside the sixteenth-pole and tired while just able to get the show. ARMY TIMES brushed with a foe at the
break then bobbled, chased the pace on the outside, went three then two wide around the turn, dropped back late on that bend and weakened then just
missed the show. CARPE CAPELLA made light contact with a foe at the start, was urged along just off the pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, fell
well behind in the two to three path on the turn and was distanced.

Footnotes
JUST A NYQUIST coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of HOLIDAY JAZZ from the outside in the two path, went three wide through the turn taking
command near the three-eighths when placed to coaxing, got headed with five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide for home, came again to take over
the front near the eighth pole, then edged away under a drive kept busy to the end. NEW YORK SUPREME four wide in pursuit, commenced a four wide bid
pulling her way into contention at the three-eighths and taking command at the five-sixteenths seemingly of her own design, swung four wide into upper
stretch let out for the drive, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong from home, kept on to secure the place honors. HANDLE THE TRUTH chased
three wide down the backstretch before being tucked inside through the turn getting put to coaxing midway, tipped out three wide into upper stretch and was
along clear and best of the rest. FLATTERING GAL chased five to six wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, passed tired
rivals. RICELLE chased just off the inside down the backstretch before going five wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued
five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HOLIDAY JAZZ hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand from the inside and then just off the inside
under pressure from JUST A NYQUIST to the outside, yielded the front under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in
retreat and folded in the drive. PREDETERMINED chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper
stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
ENGINEER EMPIRE was taken under a tight hold early, tugged hard on the bit while keen in the three path around the first turn, tossed his head nearing
the seven-eighths, tracked while traveling more comfortably down the backstretch, engaged the leader at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the
far turn, took the advantage when asked at the quarter-pole then kicked clear, drew away under solid urging to the sixteenth-pole then was put to very light
encouragement while much the best. WANNA WINNA broke a touch in the air and was off last but one, pulled under restraint while eager in the three then
two path around the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged along while moving from the two path to the four path around the final turn and
earned the place while no match for the winner. MORETHANAFEELING was coaxed to the front, showed the way along the rail on the first turn,
relinquished the lead early turning onto the backstretch, settled just off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, checked off heels coming to the
quarter-pole then steadied behind a foe into upper stretch, altered out behind horses inside the three-sixteenths and just missed the place while clear for the
show. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE stumbled at the start and was last away, went four to five wide under restraint around the opening bend, pulled his way forward
to the lead entering the backstretch, showed the way off the rail, vied in the two path while asked on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and
weakened. FOR PROFIT dropped back early, went two then three wide around the first turn, was urged at the rear on the backstretch, traveled three then
four wide on the far turn, came out a bit into upper stretch and failed to threaten. WYNN GIANT dropped from the two path to near the rail on the first turn,
was urged along on the backstretch, dropped back in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.

TRUCULENT coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed three wide through the first turn before settling three then four paths off the inside down the
backstretch latched on the leader attending that rival to the outside, had GOLDINI advanced outside him and decided to take over the front just inside half a
mile to go, came under some pressure from that foe through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide straightened
away into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole before drifting out a path when coming under growing threat to the inside, got headed
just inside the sixteenth marker by MICROSCOPE, dug in gamely surging in the final trio of strides to the wire to come again and get up on the line by a
nostril. MICROSCOPE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
rallied to take command just inside the sixteenth marker, dug in under a drive and was nailed on the wire. GOLDINI three to four wide through the first turn,
chased four to five wide down the backstretch before advancing four wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths applying pressure to
TRUCULENT through the latter portion of the bend, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. BINGO JOHN just off
the inside through the first turn, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the far turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. KUMAR hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through
the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch under attendance to the outside but facing little pressure save through TRUCULENT'S
presence, got displaced from command just inside the half mile pole and got coaxed along in pursuit along the rail through the far turn, tipped three wide into
upper stretch and tired in the drive. FOREVER WICKED chased just off the inside under a prolonged drive from the half mile pole, swung four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. ROYAL REALM off half a beat slow, raced three to four wide through the first turn and then four to five wide down the
backstretch, continued five wide through the far turn before going five to six wide into upper stretch, and faltered through to the finish.

Footnotes
DANCING SOPHIA was forwardly placed on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, took the lead late on
that bend, responded well under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while moving clear coming to the furlong marker and
drew away under steady urging. RUN DEVIL was hustled from the gate, moved out while settling under some urging, shifted further out around the
five-eighths pole, gained four wide under urging around the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for
the place. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN was hustled from the start, dropped well behind while showing no speed, went two then three wide around the turn
and earned the show while no match for the top two. MARIAH'S FORTUNE tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid between horses at the
seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, led from outside the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner and tired.
TEXIAN was sent hard to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the advantage along the rail early on the turn and stopped then was eased in
the stretch but walked off.

F F ROCKET coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy
yards from home, then edged away to the wire. FLAMINGO HAWK chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three to
four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HEIR PORT broke in at the start bumping WINNING DRIVE, came under coaxing and chased three
wide in closest aim of the leader before tucking to the two path into the turn, advanced on the front latching on to the outside at the three-eighths, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch heads apart for command, dug in under a drive getting fended off until able to
poke a nose in front a sixteenth out, then got collared with seventy yards to go and kept on to preserve the show honors on the line. AIR SHOW spurted
away early on while in the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and came under pressure midway, got placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat, dug in clinging to the front until headed a sixteenth out, then got out-finished in the late stages.
WINNING DRIVE got bumped at the start by HEIR PORT breaking in and lost his lane, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no headway while making some mild ground.
CAERUS coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered no response.

VICTORIOUS WAVE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, made a bid late on that bend,
battled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong urging. WIN FOR GOLD was away alertly from the inside post,
showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, dropped to near the rail under pressure at the quarter-pole, fought inside of
the winner into the final furlong then was overtaken while able to get the place. ZEEBEAR was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with good energy for the show. LORD GATLING dropped back to the rear of the field, saved
ground around the turn, came out four to five wide into upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE
chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the two path and came up empty. BIG
VENEZUELA was a bit slow into stride, moved up while urged along off the pace, saved ground around the turn and had nothing left. JOEY LOOSE LIPS
was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. MIDNIGHT WORKER was restless in the gate
then broke a bit slow, settled on the far outside, went five to six wide around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TEMPERMENTAL chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, closed well getting carried out very slightly just inside the eighth pole by ROYAL CURRENCY drifting out, continued to close outside the top pair and
was just up on the wire to prevail. TRY IT AGAIN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the three-eighths,
got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat from a pair and was nailed at the finish. ROYAL CURRENCY
stumbled at the start and recovered to chase four then three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and advanced into
contention spinning two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive and drifted out just inside the eighth pole, ran on loosely between foes nearing the
finish and missed at the end. FANCY FELINE chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BANKERS DAUGHTER chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, tired. FORTY SMOOTH bobbled at the break, came under coaxing and showed brief speed three wide, tucked to the two path through
the turn and faded under coaxing from midway, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. SARATOGA GAZE six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and made no
impact.

OLYMPIC DREAMS settled on the outside, gained to make a four wide bid midway through the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, responded
well to the challenge of the runner-up near the furlong marker, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth then moved clear under good handling. REFUAH
broke awkwardly and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, was urged early then moved up inside the three-quarter pole, was taken in hand at
that juncture, drafted three then four wide on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, gained to make an outside bid approaching the furlong marker,
fought with the winner to the sixteenth-pole then weakened but was clear for the place in a good effort. SQUID GAMER was hustled from the gate, tracked
the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the three path while between foes on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired while clear
for the show. MIRACLE MIKE broke out at the start, was urged early then taken in hand early on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path around the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. UNAFFECTED bumped with a foe at the start, tracked then chased the pace, made a bid in the two
path while between foes on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left. FERRIS MULER was carried out at the start then brushed with a
foe, settled off the pace, passed the five-eighths under urging, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. INDIAN MISCHIEF brushed with a rival at the
start, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter-pole and faded. BEAR'S CORRECT hit the inside of
the gate at the start then bobbled slightly and bumped with a foe, was taken in hand while in tight early then moved to the outside, rounded the turn in the
