BOSS NINE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was fully extended to hold
SARGE'S SERMON safe late. SARGE'S SERMON was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the 2nd turn, angled out in mid-stretch
and finished with a steady bid. TOUR THE WORLD was void of early speed, saved ground through the 2nd turn, angled out with a furlong to run and
finished willingly. BLUES RAPPER pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. HANKY PRANKY raced off the
pacesetters from between foes, moved three-wide through the 2nd turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. ARMAVEER raced
four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders throughout and failed to rally. GUARDSMAN PASS showed no early speed, raced off the rail through
the second turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

STREET HUMOR broke alertly then was hustled along to open a clear lead before going a quarter, drifted out into the stretch and held off the closing
FOREIGN INFLUENCE by the narrowest of margins. FOREIGN INFLUENCE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a
furlong to run, rallied and just missed. PRIME EXAMPLE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. ROYAL JOKER
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, split foes in mid-stretch and lacked the needed rally. KYSTONE raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TIME TO MEDDLE showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened.
RAMPATIOUS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DADDY'S GIRL lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew
clear. BREAKFAST BALL dueled for the lead from the inside with MIZZEN MILLIONS from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a
clear margin with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. LEMON DROP LADY was off slow and checked, raced unhurried early, saved ground
through the second turn, reached a striking position but could not get by BREAKFAST BALL. JEWEL AZUL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. MARGOT'S GIRL chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way
in the drive. HER PERFECT VISION was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. MIZZEN MILLIONS disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
