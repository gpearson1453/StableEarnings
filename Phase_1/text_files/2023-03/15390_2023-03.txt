Footnotes
R SERENGETI was off step slow, chased the top pair from the inside, angled in the stretch run, surged late and just got up under all out pressure. EXOTIC
GENTLEMAN showed good early speed to set the early pace, was well clear near the eighth pole and was wore to just miss. R VOO'S TABOO chased the
early leader, raced three wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. JAMAICA MISTAICA dropped back early, raced from the inside and had no
response. AFTER BURN lost his left iron soon after the start and never threatened.

NASTY EXAGGERATOR tracked the early leader from the inside, drifted a bit late and raced well clear under steady pressure. STREET N SOUR showed
good early foot to set the early pace while racing just off the inside but was no match for the winner the final quarter of a mile. PETE AND REPETE was off
slowly, saved ground and had no response. GIMME SPACE stalked the pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
TIZ BRIGHTER was quick to begin to cross over from the outside to set the early pace, dug in along the rail through the stretch run and prevailed under all
out pressure. J PS HARLEY GLIDER prompt the early leader from the outside while racing two wide and just missed in a game effort. LITTLEBIT DON
stalked the pace along the inside, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. LUCKWOULDHAVEIT broke
awkwardly, raced mid pack early on, moved up three wide in the lane and was slowly closing in on the top trio. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN raced off the
early going, was three to two wide and lacked a bid. SMILIN JOSIE settled off the early going and failed to respond. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT stalked the
pace along the inside and tired. WHISKEYSPENT failed to sustain a bid. PLAYER ONE READY was off slowly and trailed.
