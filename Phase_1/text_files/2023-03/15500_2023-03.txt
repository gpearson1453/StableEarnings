Footnotes
HAPPY SAILOR bid for the lead from the inside, gained command around the five eighths pole, was in a steady drive throughout the turn, then drew off in
the stretch and held on well to prevail. TURN ON THE BLING tracked the pace while three wide, then came out four wide on the turn to rally in the stretch
and was closing strong and was best for second. WAVING BYE stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then bid on the turn to menace in
the stretch and was closing well just missing the place prize in the end. PROUD VALENTINE bid for the lead from the three path down the early backstretch,
then pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was in a hard drive in the early stretch then gave way in the end. BLUSHING BELLE chased the pace
along the inside at one speed throughout the course and needed more in the end. TOOTIE broke outwardly and bumped rival then was unhurried early and
no menace. KELLEY SAID READY lead the way from the gate then settled back in the middle of the field while two wide, and had no final bid in the end.
KEEP THE BLING was unhurried early and needed rally.

unhurried early then raced on the inside down the backstretch, made a mild gain in the stretch but was no threat. DIAMOND GRAND stalked the pace while
three wide on the backstretch, made a bid then faltered in the drive. REASON OVER RICHES lunged at the start then was allowed to settled, raced three
wide in the stretch and failed to menace. CHA CHA DANCER was allowed to settled then raced two wide on the backstretch then faltered in the drive.
