Footnotes
MATH MAN broke out and was quickly corrected, easily galloped into the first turn, took the lead along the fence, was joined by the favorite just to his
outside, set reasonable fractions for the first half, began to pick up the pace after the half mile while still in company with another rival, was briefly
challenged by an inside foe at the three eighths, started to advance and shook that one, was asked to run at the quarter pole, was still challenged by the the
rival on the out side, battled until the last sixteenth and drew off late. COASTAL CHAOS sent with the leader into the first turn, rated just off the leader,
patiently matched strides down the backside, from the four path, stayed right with the leader through the turn and into the stretch, was asked after the
quarter, responded well, matched strides for more than a sixteenth of a mile but did not have enough to over come his rival. RONITHELIMODRIVER vied for
the lead early, causing him to be four wide early, settled for the second tier down the backside, in contention, lost ground in the second turn while racing
from the outside, ran flat in the lane. OGRE'S LION KING was bumped by an inner foe leaving the gates, settled along the rail off the pace, was resisting
being rated down the backside, relaxed into the second tier after the half, followed the top pair until the three eighths pole was given a looser rein to
advance but was not able to match pace with the leaders, continued to race up the rail but made no impact. MOSH PIT settled off the pace and saved
ground early, was placed just behind the leaders while racing in between horses from the four path, was given the cue after the three eighths pole but didn't
fire. EXCLAIM was off a step slow, took time to find his stride, started his momentum building run at the half mile pole from the five path, gained ground in
that path through the turn, seven wide after quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN cleared off around the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, and was driven home with an insurmountable lead through the
lane. EASY ACES broke slowly, trailed along the inside, gained in the four path around the far turn, came into the lane in the six path, lugged in slightly
before changing leads at the furlong grounds, and stayed on to gain place. REINA ACES settled off of the pace in the two path, commenced a gain
approaching the far turn, vied for place three wide around that bend, gained that advantage entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final
sixteenth. SWEET LITTLE ROSE tracked two wide, chased the very clear leader while inside of a place bidding foe around the far turn, lost that position
entering the lane, and tired. SHEEZA PRIORITY pursued from midpack three wide and between horses into the first turn, tucked behind foes around that
bend, then faded two wide around the far turn. SANGIOVESE made little impact from the three path. ZIPPITY ZOODA RED was antsy and on her toes in
the post parade, tracked along the inside, but weakened around the far turn. BLESS D'SOUTH raced in midpack in the four path while outside of rivals
around the first turn, but was guided outwardly while being eased approaching the far turn, and jogged home. BON CHANCE BET broke slowly, then bolted
into the first turn, raced far back before being eased with a half mile remaining, jogged through the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
CABERTOSS prompted the pace along the inside before deciding to shift outside of the leader approaching the backstretch, pressed two wide while
between horses soon after, vied among those foes around the far turn, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, inched clear in upper stretch, and
held sway from a group of chasers through the final furlong. TRIVISTA tracked along the inside while a bit off of the pace, chased under urging behind the
top trio around the far turn, tipped three wide for clear sailing entering the lane, took aim on the clearing leader from the four path in upper stretch, but failed
to progress in the final furlong while holding place from rivals on both sides. CHAOSMOS settled at the rear in the three to four paths around the first turn,
tugged four wide down the backstretch to a midpack position, tracked outside of the leaders around the far turn, got floated to the five path entering the lane,
and chased evenly thereafter to dead heat with an inner rival for show. MAD ADAM was last away, settled off of the pace in the three path, pursued from
between horses around the far turn, backed out from among rivals nearing the lane, yet regained stride in upper stretch, gained between foes in midstretch,
bid for minor rewards inside of chasers in the final sixteenth, and flattened out before dead-heating for show. GETCHA set the pace two wide, cleared an
inner rival approaching the backstretch, showed the way from a pair of outer vying rivals into the far turn, but was headed nearing the lane, and weakened
through the final furlong. RUN ROCKET lacked speed in the two to four paths, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. ROCKDALE
stalked three wide, moved to vie outside of the top pair at the half mile pole, but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
DUVEE broke sharply out of the gates, was able to clear his inner foes and take the rail through the first turn, was joined by a rival on his outside, but
continued to set consistent fractions as he waited for the cue to run, stayed with his rival on the outside until the eighth pole where he drew off on command
and won easily. ITS WILD AGAIN was off the pace going into the first turn, raced from the three and four path while being mid pack, patiently raced in the
same path until the half mile where he starting gaining ground , continued to quickly make up lengths while passing the three eighths, shifted into the two
path to save ground in the turn, shifted out and was four wide in the upper stretch, was kept to task, and pointed at the leaders but struggled to switch leads,
was pushed and encouraged strongly and was up for second. BIG BOO was strong early, rushed from the three path to catch the early leader in the first
turn, was asked to rate but was still pulling on the reins along the backside while pacing just off the leader, finally let go of the bit after the half mile pole,
continued on with the leader from the three path until the last sixteenth of a mile where he was not able to go with the eventual winner and ended up chasing
in hopes of a second place finish but was caught by an outside foe late. VIKING LEGACY raced off the pace early, was allowed to settle until the half mile
pole, started gaining ground from the rail, made one run and passed tired rivals. AMAVI was never involved. THEO D'OR had a troubled trip for the first half
mile of the race, was able to angle out and get clear after the half mile marker, finally found his stride and started gaining ground in the second turn but had
too much to overcome and tired late. MAKE YOUR DESTINY was in tight early, moved from lane to lane to find satisfactory racing room, settled along the
rail behind the leaders and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
NOT ON HERB veered outwardly at the start, dueled for the lead three wide, then two wide and between horses while in the three path around the turn,
shook free of an outer rival in upper stretch, inched clear, flopped back to his left lead when the rider changed to a left handed crop at the furlong grounds,
then flagged his tail in resentment when the rider changed back to a right handed stick soon after, yet held sway safely to the wire. COPTER vied for the
lead inside of a pair of dueling rivals early on, backed out of tight rail quarters at the half mile pole, tracked while saving ground around the turn, but was
blocked behind traffic entering the lane, altered course to the three path for clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, then surged between horses in the final
furlong, attempted a bid inside of the leader, but was fended off, then held place from an outer bidder late. MOR BIG LEE was bumped and bothered by an
inner rival just after breaking a touch slow, was slow to recover and spotted the rest multiple lengths in the aftermath, trailed in the three path around the
turn, swung to the six path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, bid for place in the closing stages, but narrowly came up
short. MARKS PROMISE took a brush from an inner rival soon after the start, stalked the leaders from the outside, inched closer to press in the four path
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and weakened while hanging on his left lead. EL DEAL ME ACES shied from an
inner rival and brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, moved between horses entering the turn, then only managed to chase in upper
stretch before tiring. HALF FULL dueled between a pair of rivals through the opening quarter mile, cleared an inner foe before sparring with a pair of outer
vying rivals around the turn, but yielded to them nearing the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
ALL WEST leaned inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked in the three path, split foes entering the far turn to bid for the lead outside of the leader at
the three furlong pole, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, and kicked clear in upper stretch. MY BARILEY settled at the rear along the inside,
moved closer down the backstretch, chased under urging while saving ground in midpack around the far turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, kept on
to bid for place approaching the sixteenth pole, then flopped to and from his left lead while securing that position leaving that juncture. FIRST GLIMPSE was
bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, rated at the rear three wide, trailed around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and
stayed on to claim show late. TRIGGER HAPPY was bumped between horses at the start, set the pace along the inside, shook clear briefly nearing the far
turn, but met the eventual winner's bid at the three furlong pole, got quickly headed at the five sixteenths marker, yielded in upper stretch, and weakened
through the final furlong. SPANKHURST leaned out and bumped a rival at th start, stalked behind the leading pair entering the first turn, but shifted outside
of them and to the four path while tugging forward entering the backstretch, got outmoved by an inner rival entering the far turn, chased from the four to five
paths around that bend, and faded. CARTIER CAT was bumped between horses while put to crowded quarters at the start, raced at the rear two wide and
between horses, improved to chase from midpack around the far turn, but tired through the lane. CO CONSPIRATOR pressed two wide, but faltered
between horses entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
TAKNTOTHECLEANERS set the pace along the inside, shook loose entering the backstretch, kicked clear entering the lane, drifted out many paths with an
open margin through midstretch, and held sway safely. FLATTER ME SILLY was allowed to settle at the rear two wide, pursued from off of the pace in the
four path around the far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and rallied between horses to gain place at the sixteenth pole. RUSSIAN MAFIA
rated at the rear along the inside, trailed in the three path around the far turn, fanned to the nine path entering the lane, and rallied mildly down the outer
part of the course in the final furlong. BHOMA laid off of the pace three wide, came into the lane in the six path, stayed on to bid for place leaving the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked by outer rivals soon after. HANNAH'S HAVEN stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened
through the final furlong. CLARA PEETERS (GB) tracked two wide to three wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and failed to menace between
horses. POSTNUP was prominent between a pair of foes early on, but got wrangled back approaching the wire for the first time, stalked along the inside,
then only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading. GET ON THE BUS prompted the pace along the inside early on, but checked and lost position
approaching the wire for the first time, got keen while off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE set the pace in the path, shook clear of a pressing rival leaving the quarter pole, drifted out in upper stretch before lugging
inwardly from right handed pressure approaching the furlong grounds, and was ridden out through the late stages. CHAD'S FLASH tracked the top pair from
the four path, gained place at the three sixteenths pole after the leader kicked away, and proved second best while hanging on his left lead. VALID EARLY
broke a step slowly before being floated in a touch by an outer rival at the start, was slow to recover, lagged behind the field in the three path around the
turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and offered a late rally to gain show in the final sixteenth. PAYOFF CYCLE pressed the leader from the three
path, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, and weakened. RUNAWAY JIM laid off of the pace in the five path, and failed to factor. ADMIRAL
AFLEET bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, raced far back in the two path, came into the lane three wide, inched between horses in midstretch,
but was stymied among rivals through the final furlong, and steadied along in the late stages. OCEAN KISS stalked along the inside, chased in upper
stretch, and faded. HALF CRAZY bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, and made little impact two wide.
