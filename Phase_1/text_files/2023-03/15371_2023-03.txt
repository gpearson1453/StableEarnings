advanced outside and narrowed the gap while no threat. ROYAL PARTY dropped back, saved ground throughout and rallied for the show. CIVIL NOTION
chased three wide down the backstretch, faded on the turn then came again. THEARCHERORTHEPREY pursued the pacesetters wide and gave way
readily. THENDARA'S LOST pressed the winner for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

outside past the furlong marker, wore down that rival and edged away for the win. OUCH OUCH OUCH vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the backside,
took over on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of the winner when challenged, then yielded grudgingly. VERBIER trailed the field, angled out entering the
stretch and closed belatedly outside. BUCKS ARE MOVING stalked four wide, chased four wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and
weakened. SOVEREIGN CHANGE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. ENFORCER vied inside for the lead, dueled,
chased inside on the far turn and faded.

JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL set the pace on the inside, responded when roused turning for home, remained clear under urging then coasted the final yards.
POOR NO MORE tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out for the drive, rallied and came up second best. VANISHING FAITH stalked close up
outside, chased between rivals on the turn and finished evenly. RANDOM LUCK was off slowly, trailed, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch
and gained belatedly outside. ONE PAIR OF HANDS stumbled at the start, raced three wide off the pace, bid three wide on the turn and weakened.
PROSPECTIVE CANDY raced off the pace with an inside trip and did not factor.

MAJESTIC CREED quickly took control with a clear lead, increased advantage without need of urging then continued to widen while ridden out. DANCING
ON MY OWN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, proved no match and just lasted for the place. HOP ON ME lagged far behind then rallied outside
just missing the place. SHAKING RAGS chased within range inside and flattened out in the stretch. PRECIOUS AVARY raced off the leaders three wide
and gave way after half a mile.

CROATIAN tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, took over and was kept clear under urging.
PARADISE PRIDE stalked close up outside, bid entering the far turn, dueled with SOCIAL GROUP, then dug in gamely in the stretch run, battled on but
second best. SOCIAL GROUP vied outside for the lead, gained command on the backside, dueled inside a rival on the far turn, dug in through the lane and
held for third. WILL TAKE CONTROL was reluctant to load, raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch, closed belatedly outside and got up
for fourth. INDOCTRINATE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, then ran up on the heels of a rival and stumbled badly at the quarter pole.
ORIGO raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole and weakened. JUST NOD AND SMILE vied inside for the
lead, then chased and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident at the quarter pole, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
AMATERASU hustled to the front inside, dueled, shook loose nearing the quarter pole and increased advantage under mild urging. MISS LOYALTY lagged
far behind then advanced along the inside for the place. SOLEMN OATH moved off the pace between rivals, bid wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
MOONCHILD dueled with the winner outside for three quarters and faltered. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD stalked the dueling leaders three wide and gave way
readily. CLASSY MISS dropped back after the start and raced far behind throughout. PEARLS AND HEELS was coaxed within range along the rail for half a
mile and stopped.

Footnotes
MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU tracked the leaders well placed, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with WINDSOR GOLD entering the stretch, gained a short
lead, dug in gamely and edged away for the win. WINDSOR GOLD raced three wide early, pressed the pace racing close up outside a rival, bid two wide
entering the far turn, dueled between rivals, then dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch drive and battled on to the end. DANCE CODE raced off
the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and closed well late outside. MARGIN OF AIR set a pressured pace on the inside,
dueled on the far turn, weakened, then finished evenly late. LOUIE'S LAW raced off the pace inside, tracked the leaders on the far turn, then gained mildly
inside. SCOOP DAWG lunged and then was away very awkwardly, caught up to the field entering the clubhouse turn, settled on the inside, then two wide
and failed to threaten. DEPLANE was off a bit slow, outrun early, moved up three wide on the backside, advanced on the far turn, then failed to threaten.
MISCHIEVOUS JONES raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
