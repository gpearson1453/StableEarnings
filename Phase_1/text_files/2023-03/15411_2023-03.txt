Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD COUNTY rated behind the leaders leaving the far turn, angled out to advance three to four wide into the lane, edged away a bit nearing
mid stretch, battled outside WATCH YOUR TONE through the final furlong and held sway under a drive. WATCH YOUR TONE , bumped at the break,
prompted the pace outside LEAN ON ME, moved to engage that one leaving the far turn, sparred between runners into the stretch, kept on gamely to the
inside of the winner through the final eighth but was kept at bay. LEAN ON E grabbed command early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined around
the turn, battled into the lane, failed to go on with the top pair nearing the furlong grounds and weakened. CHALK HILL , off the pace while saving ground,
angled out and lacked a rally. LADY MACHO , four wide, sustained an injury leaving the far turn, fell and was vanned off. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL steadied
at the break, rated off the pace and off the rail then fell after colliding with LADY MACHO leaving the far turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into the incident
leaving the far turn. No action was taken.

Footnotes
BORRACHO sped up to the inside of CEES GET DEGREES in the opening sixteenth and took command, set a pressured pace just off the rail, shook clear
soon into the lane, kept on under strong handling past mid stretch, wandered outward but dug in tenaciously to narrowly prevail. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY ,
four wide stalking the pace, was under pressure and fanned six wide into the lane, straightened away for the drive, made a game and grinding run and just
missed. CEES GET DEGREES broke on top then was rated just outside the winner, forced the pace around the turn, came three to four wide for the drive
and stayed on well between foes. GOING TO THE LEAD , urged along off the pace and outside a rival, gathered some steam three wide past the three
sixteenths, worked through between rivals leaving the sixteenth marker, altered in late and churned on. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , three wide tracking, came five
wide for the drive, gave hard chase past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. H P MOON steadied at the start, took to rating and to the inside of a rival
early, edged up two wide in upper stretch, lacked some room behind the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, shifted in and was out kicked. DOCTOR JEFF
rated off the leaders soon after the break, stalked inside, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, edged up a bit in mid stretch, flattened out then was
checked off heels inside the sixteenth pole. PRACTICAL WAY broke a step slow, raced off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride leaving the far
turn and failed to respond. KEEPING THE EDGE , four wide, was under asking mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BREEZY GUST rated four wide early on, steadily advanced four wide past the three eighths and took closer order of the three way duel, shifted in a path
soon into the lane, closed in determinedly under right handed asks, took command in deep stretch and drew clear. KENNY HAD A NOTION had speed
three deep then moved clear heading to the turn, remained off the rail and was hooked from both sides three furlongs out, dueled, ceded the lead past the
five sixteenths, came back to take over in upper stretch, edged away slightly leaving the eighth pole, kept on gamely but could not fend off the winner.
EASTERN BAY rated off the pace, saved ground advancing mid turn, eased out three wide into the lane, got hemmed in when the winner shifted down a bit,
remained in close quarters to the sixteenth marker, angled late and finished well. KARAN'S NOTION , away alertly, drafted back off the leaders, chased
between foes leaving the far turn, steadied briefly near the five sixteenths, altered out five wide and came back on through the final furlong. COASTAL
MISSION had speed between early, inherited the rail nearing the half, bid inside the leader leaving the far turn, dueled on a slim lead past the five
sixteenths, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. BRILLIANT ICE broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, swung out approaching the
stretch and had some belated action. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE bobbled inward at the break, regrouped and rushed up to the inside of a pair of rivals heading
to the five eighths, checked and hit the rail when in tight soon after, regrouped and angled out, bid three deep, vied between runners heading to the lane
then faltered through the final three sixteenths. An objection by the rider of EASTERN BAY against the winner for alleged interference in upper stretch was
not allowed. An objection by the rider of ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE against COASTAL MISSION for alleged interference through the backstretch run was not
allowed.

Footnotes
NIMITZ CLASS , confidently handled three wide around the turn, secured command entering the stretch and eagerly pulled away while kept to his business.
DOUBLE CROWN , forwardly placed in the two path between horses around the turn, had a mild rally along the inner rail. OURNATIONONPARADE raced
in the three path between horses on the turn, moved up turning for home and continued willingly. AMERICAN PATROL , four deep on the turn, chased the
pace to the stretch then gave way. ROUGH SEA , no factor, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. AMERICAN D'ORO raced along
the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and retreated. HELLO HOT ROD set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead turning for
home and faltered.

Footnotes
LADY LOWERY broke outward and brushed with HAPPY CLOUDS, quickly corrected and took control leaving the chute, set a rated pace towards the
inside, was guided three wide into the lane, straightened and responded when set down past the three sixteenths, kept on under solid right handed asks,
drifted out late and held firm. HAPPY CLOUDS , brushed at the break, rated outside a rival, took closer order mid turn, advanced between runners into the
stretch then angled four wide, gave hard chase as the closest pursuer in mid stretch, dropped in late and kept on well. CAIRO SUGAR , nudged from the
gate, prompted the pace outside the winner, was scrubbed on outside rivals approaching the stretch, failed to seriously kick on leaving mid stretch but
continued with some effort and earned the show. CATS INTHE TIMBER saved ground, edged up mid turn to have aim, saw the leaders get away leaving
the quarter pole, gave way grudgingly and was edged for the show. VOODOO MAMA JUJU settled in the clear, was under a ride mid turn and failed to
respond. WE'LL SEE , unhurried early while well off the pace, dropped further back leaving the far turn and could not make an impact.

COFFEEWITHCHRIS turning for home, was fanned seven wide in upper stretch, asserted himself in the drive, lugged in and drew clear.
COFFEEWITHCHRIS , four wide entering the first, moved up three deep leaving the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, gained the lead entering
the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, failed to match strides with the winner and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. CIRCLING THE DRAIN , briefly steadied
in traffic entering the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung out for the drive and lacked the needed rally. HOWGREATISNATE , steadied in
close quarters on the first turn, advanced in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch and gave way in the drive. FEELING WOOZY , steadied
and rank on the first turn, raced inside horses to the stretch, swung wide in upper stretch and was no factor. RICCIO raced outside horses throughout and
was no factor. REGISTER set the pace along the rail, gave way in upper stretch then was eased. MARTY'S MAGIC , fractious in the starting gate, steadied
entering the first turn, dropped back leaving the backstretch and was eased.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET AFFAIR dueled inside, checked out of a tight spot near the quarter pole, regrouped and swung out, came back relentlessly under a drive and
forged ahead outside rivals in deep stretch to prove best. QUEEN OF CLASS rated three wide off the embattled leaders, moved up and bid three deep
leaving the three eighths, held a short lead into the lane, emerged in a duel with PREPAREFORTAKEOFF, clung to command past the sixteenth pole then
gave way grudgingly. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF dueled two wide outside the winner early on, raced between foes mid turn, shifted in entering the lane,
sparred past mid stretch then faded late. RAISE YOUR GAME settled back off the contested pace, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked a bid.
NOTION INTERRUPTUS lagged back and failed to generate a run. SALAMINA gave early chase, came four wide for the drive and faded. DIAMONDS N
DENIM broke outward then steadied, saved ground off the pace and failed to respond.
