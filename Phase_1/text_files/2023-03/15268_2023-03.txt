Footnotes
MISTY VEIL forwardly placed early inside, in some traffic late first turn, moved out, advanced three wide to challenge on the outside turning for home,
gained the advantage under a single right handed crop stride, drew off under his own courage to win ridden out. PRETTI XTREME four wide into the first
turn, dropped in steadily, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, vied into the lane while remaining close to the inside, proved no match for
the winner in the drive, clear for the place. GOOD PENNY within striking distance just off the inside early, dropped to the rail for the middle half, steered out,
finished up best of the rest. BIG BAD DIVA prompted the pace while racing off the inside, challenged between the top two into the stretch, weakened in the
drive. BOBBIN TAIL off a step slow, steadied past the wire the first time, trailed throughout in failing to menace.

Footnotes
FORTIBUG pulled early while being outside, moved out, advanced four wide into contention by midway on the far turn, continued in the four path to
challenge into the stretch, long drive, wore down rival under steady handling. I GUESS NOT closest to the dueling leaders while just off the inside, moved
closer in the rail then two path second turn, challenged between foes into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker inside the winner, outkicked by that that
foe late while holding sway for the runner up spot late. ALTAR GIRL settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, switched
out when straightened for home, finished with good energy to be slowly getting to the top two late. I GOT A NAME broke in good order, dueled up front
closest to the inside, helped set some lively fractions, briefly clear, weakened when confronted into the stretch. BLUE COWGIRL four wide into the first turn,
continued off the inside, went evenly in lacking a closing response. PEACEFUL MOMENT void of speed, lacked a serious closing response. SWEET BABY
KATE finished early in falling back to trail, far back, jogged in. FANCY HILL moved up to duel through some lively splits while off the inside, stopped far turn,
well back, jogged in.

Footnotes
EMPIRE PASS with the pace from the start, dueled early turn, shook clear by midway on the bend in the two path, drew out through the lane while being
kept to task. BECKY'S TATTOO void of speed while between foes, angled out four wide when trailing into the lane, shifted out a bit more be widest past the
furlong marker, late run to be up for the place. SIMONA'S CHOICE last away, also was devoid of any early foot, three down to two path turn, steered in a bit
approaching the furlong marker, late interest while closest to the inside of the second flight, not enough for the place. LA MORENA in the second flight early
outside, continued four wide through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught for the place while between horses at the wire. CARPE
HORSESHOE in the second group while between horses, three wide into the lane,fell back upper stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late.
DISTORTED SECRETS with the early pace, dueled inside the winner along the rail early turn, could not keep up with that one and steadily faded through
the lane. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE lacked speed along the inside, saved ground to no avail. EMERALD PRINCESS forwardly placed for a half, moved out
three wide turning for home, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
CORONA BOLT away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside and under light restraint, held the runner up at bay in the run down
the lane under a firm right handed crop late. FAVORITE OUTLAW pressured the winner throughout from the two path, crept slightly closer into the lane,
could do little with that one through the lane, clearly second best. IGNITIS in the second group while racing in the two path, mild rally down the lane to prove
best of the top two while steering out a bit in midstretch. BEN'S LEGACY off a step slow, raced back early as a result, three to four wide turning for home,
improved a bid with some mild late interest. ROYAL KING forwardly placed while in the four path for a half, roused, lacked a closing punch. JOKING WAY
prompted the top two from the three path, had little left in weakening through the lane. COUNT DE MONET in the second flight along the inside behind the
winner, faded through the lane in having little left.

Footnotes
WHOOPING JAY sprinted clear into the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside under firm restraint, was let out a notch midway on
the final turn, continued to show the way by daylight into the stretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MAJOR KONG last away, trailed well back
along the inside, two to three wide through the second turn, rallied and was steadily getting to the winner well to that one's outside. BRAVO BRAVO
forwardly placed toward the inside, chased up the backstretch, crept closer in the two path turning for home, flattened out a bit in the drive to finish up best
of the rest. RYE HUMOR settled well off the pace while just off the inside, moved closer after a half, lacked a further advance to finish up evenly. MAKE
NOISE five wide with the main body into and through the first turn, remained well wide in the run up the backstretch, four wide through the second bend,
failed to muster a rally in the drive. LIVINGONTULSATIME chased the winner in the two path, came out a bit to be four wide when appearing to weaken
turning into the stretch, continued to tire to the wire. SPARK (PER) made little impact while saving ground. COOL RUNNINGS forwardly placed three wide
early, continued in the three path second turn, backed up. OPTIMUS KAT four wide through the turn, was always outrun. PADDY O'DINI in mid pack off the
rail, stopped late backstretch, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN MALIBU lacked speed, in the two path out of the turn, split foes upper stretch, bothered slightly by a lugging BET HE'S READY soon after,
dropped to the rail and finished full of run to win going away and ridden out. TOWN BRANCH within striking distance outside through the turn, rallied in
upper stretch as the winner was moving forward well to his inside, proved no match for that one, clear for the place. EE YAH broke early, soon clear, set the
pace in the two path, was still clear into the lane, faltered when confronted from inside and outside inside the furlong grounds. SWITZER lacked early foot,
three to four wide through the turn, went evenly the final furlong in lacking a late punch. LUCKY DUDE off a step slow, raced back while saving ground,
picked off a couple of tiring foes late after the issue had been decided. BET HE'S READY broke through the gate prior to the start, broke in good order,
closest to the leader in the three path, continued to chase turn, was giving way when he lugged in upper stretch bothering the winner a bit, continued to tire.
COMMANDER CARL forwardly placed in the second flight along the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SACRED WISH forwardly placed along the inside early, moved out three wide for the turn, challenged between horses past the furlong marker and kicked
clear. DIVINELY BOLT back off the pace and the inside, knifed through three wide and between foes into the stretch, mild bid approaching midstretch,
proved no match for the winner, edged clear. BOOGIE WOOGIE GAL sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to set the pace in the two path, briefly
responded briefly when challenged past the furlong marker then weakened a bit, comfortably saved the show. RATIFIED within striking distance outside,
floated out five wide into the lane while between horses, went evenly to the wire. PIVOSKY outside in mid pack, floated out six wide turning into the stretch,
also lacked a significant closing response. VALIANT PRAISE made little impact while racing in the two path. I'M SO FUNNY remained back while racing
three wide. CHARLIZE forwardly placed along the inside for a half, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. WREAKING HAVOC was
always outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PUNCHBOWL with the pace from the start, dueled closest to the inside, helped set a lively set of fractions, shrugged off the other speed exiting the final
turn, shaken up with a firm right handed crop when straightened for home then stayed well clear to the wire while geared down a bit late in a sharp effort.
SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY forwardly placed off the inside, stalked the two leaders in the three path into the far turn, proved no match for the winner in the
drive, clearly second best. TOUGH LEGACY off a step slow, lacked speed, two path through the second turn, staged a mild rally out in the strip, no threat to
the top pair. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL broke on top, raced closest to the dueling leaders, had little left for the stretch run. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD alternated up
front outside the winner through those lively fractions, first to blink exiting the final turn. STELLAR LADY four wide into the first turn, three wide through the
second bend, failed to rally. CORNINGSTONE in mid pack while four wide throughout, tired. SANTANGELO fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
CLASSY SOCKS with the pace up the backstretch three wide, dueled early turn, vied between into the lane, resumed his duel with the other speed through
the lane, proved best in a determined effort. DEBATER moved up to contest the pace early, dueled inside the winner early turn, fell slightly off that rival into
the lane, moved up to duel again the length of the stretch, outkicked late, clear of the others. KISSOFTHENILE in the second flight while four wide
backstretch and into the turn, three wide bid exiting, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. MADMARTIGAN forwardly placed in heading up the
second flight inside for a half, came up empty for the drive. SIR PEEL in mid pack toward the inside early, came three wide out of the turn, also found
lacking in the run to the wire to finish up evenly. RUDIANO broke in, rank and bothered at the break to begin slowly, remained back into the turn while
saving some ground, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position with some belated interest. WICKED PRINCE broke in helping set off a chain reaction
of interference, was straightened to race in mid pack outside, continued three wide out of the turn, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing response.
READY SHOES bothered and was bumped soundly at the break, raced well back, improved slightly while never posing a serious threat. FOUR DICE
bothered, bumped break, remained back. WILLIE WIN roughed, slammed both sides break, took up to fall far behind, lost all chance, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals. IKE WAZOWSKI broke out to make contact with outer foes, quickly recovered to contest the issue while between rivals up the backstretch and
into the turn, gave way and faded before a half. SCRIMSHIRE broke out, was finished early while four wide through the turn.
