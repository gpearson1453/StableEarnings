unhurried early, raced seven wide through the turn and flattened out. SHAME ON YOU was outrun early, raced nine wide out of the turn and offered no late

TRICAR MISS set a pressured early pace, raced four wide out of the turn, opened up and was best today. HOLOTTALUTE was up close early, raced along
the inside into the turn, angled out six wide through the turn, was no match late and finished second best. LEONAS GIRL pressed the early pace, angled out
through the turn, drifted in through the stretch and weakened late. SOCIAL CLUB was void of any speed, raced eight wide through the turn and passed tired
rivals. CASUAL ENCOUNTER was outrun early, went four wide into the turn and offered no late rally. MISS FLUFFY raced in mid pack early from between
rivals and flattened out. VIPERS PRINCESS was unhurried from the inside and never fired.

DEAN'S LIST was up close early, raced four wide into the turn, met the bid of BYE BYE BOBBY, dueled with that rival to the wire, held off TRUTH SEEKER
and prevailed for the win. TRUTH SEEKER was void of any speed, raced between rivals through the turn, angled in mid stretch, was closing fast and just
missed. BYE BYE BOBBY raced in mid pack early, ranged up six wide through the turn, made a bid on DEANS LIST, dueled with that rival to late stretch
and finished a game third. GODDARD was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide and offered no late rally. CLAYTON DELANEY was unhurried early,
angled in and never fired. MINISTER OF SOUL set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn and weakened. HOLLYWOOD HENRY pressed
the early pace, went five wide into the turn and faded.

WILD ON ICE tracked the early pace, advanced six wide through the second turn, took the lead in early stretch, drifted in, met the bid of LOW
EXPECTATIONS, kept that rival in tight, dueled to late stretch and edged clear late. LOW EXPECTATIONS was allowed to settle early, was eased back into
the backstretch, saved ground into the home turn, made a bid on the winner from the inside in mid stretch, dueled to late stretch and finished second best.
HENRY Q set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the second turn, met the bid of WILD ON ICE from the outside and LOW EXPECTATIONS from
the inside, eased out form between those two rivals, drifted out and weakened late. HOW DID HE DO THAT was void of any early speed, raced three wide
into the second turn and offered no late rally. ONE IN VERMILLION was fractious in the gate, was unhurried early, went seven wide into the second turn
and never fired. HARD TO FIGURE pressed the early pace, took a short lead into the home turn from between rivals and faded. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE FIRST QUARTER WAS NOT POSTED. QUARTER-MILE TIME PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM BULL pressed the early pace, raced along the inside, took up going into the turn, angled out to re-engage MARKED MONEY, drifted out through
the turn, kept on and edged clear late. MARKED MONEY set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turn, opened up, couldn't hold off the winner
and finished second best. TATAS JOE MARK tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn and was along for third. NOGAL CANYON was unhurried
early, raced six wide and offered no rally. PIP PIP raced in mid pack early, saved ground and was empty. ETHAN was allowed to settle early and was no
factor. ITSNOWTROUBLEATALL was always outrun.
