Footnotes
DOINITTHEHARDWAY quickly stepped to the front, dictated pace from along the rail, well in hand to second turn, shook free entering the stretch and
clerarly proved best under steady hand urging. CONQUISTAR prompted the pace into backstretch while two wide, continued on same path to final bend,
asked for bit more around that bend, lost contract with winner in upper stretch but edged away from rival for place honors. SWEET TROUBLE settled off the
pace, stalked three wide to the second turn, moved up slightly on that bend but weakened from off the rail in the lane. MONIQUE was off tardily and
dropped well back early, trailed from along the rail thereafter and failed top make any late impact.

Footnotes
SANGRE AZUL showed early foot then taken off the rail and was closest pursuer down backstretch, whittled gap on leader around last bend, reached front
a sixteenth out and inched away late. SHVERE ARBETER four deep into initial turn then turned keen foot into big lead on the backstretch, had that margin
dissolve around last bend, was finally collared passing sixteenth marker but gamely held second. SPRING SPINNING settled off the leaders while angling
over, launched rally while three then four wide on the last turn, came out further in the stretch and was along late for third. RIGHTEOUSLY three abreast
into first turn, in bit tight then squeezed back later on that turn, was three deep passing half-mile marker, closed on leader then four wide into stretch but lost
third
late.

Footnotes
SCATCHMEJAMIN sped clear from outside and angled over, showed the way along the rail through the turn, led clear under right handed urging into the
final furlong and held well. BOLD CHOICE came in and bumped rivals at the start, dropped back off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, four wide into
the stretch, rallied and got up for second. WHIMSICAL HEIR broke in and bumped SMILING AMY, chased behind the leader from between rivals, moved
over to the rail on the turn, tipped out into the lane, finished willingly but got edged for second. SMILING AMY took a bumped at the start, steadied briefly
while forwardly place from inside, lost ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back further on the turn, moved out and kept on in the drive and earned a
minor award. KISS MY KAT broke out and bumped with BOLD CHOICE, chased three deep then checked when losing her path behind the winner early,
rounded the bend two wide outside a rival, tipped out into the stretch taking aim at the winner but weakened in the furlong grounds. ASHLEYS
SANDCASTLE broke out, raced towards the rear off the rail, navigated the turn three then two wide and failed to make an impact. HAUTE CHAULKOLATTE
was off slow then stumbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the turn, moved off the rail around the bend and never got involved. ELUSIVE CLASS
got bumped and impeded leaving the gate, traveled near the back early on, angled in around the bend and was not a factor.

TOP OF MY GAME broke a step slow, got bothered from outside rival early, stalked the top trio in the two path, coaxed along leaving the backstretch, had
to pause off heels into the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, tipped out widest to challenge in upper stretch, kicked clear in midstretch and won going
away while coasting in late. LET HIM DO got bothered by inner rival then went up to vie three deep, carried a short lead into the stretch, yielded to the
winner past the eighth pole but stayed on to secure second. KRIXUS FLASH hustled to the front from the gate then ducked in and back out early, vied
between foes into and around the turn, fought to the eight pole, proved no match in the furlong grounds and churned on to save the show. IT'S SAUL

STAR PROSPECT rated near the inside then in the two path, pulled a bit early on the backstretch, bid outside the leader with three furlongs left to run, took
over at the five-sixteenths then kicked clear around the bend, urged a few times right handed entering the stretch and widened through the lane while
coasting in the final sixteenth. GHOSTLY ACT sped to the front from inside, cleared outer rivals around the clubhouse turn, showed the way to the second
bend, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the stretch and churned on down the lane to save the place. BRONKO NAGURSKI
pressed from outside into the clubhouse turn then was coaxed along when losing touch with the leader around the bend, remained closest in pursuit up the
backstretch while coaxed, asked two to three wide on the final turn, kept to task down the lane while moving to the inside and missed the place. J D'S RUDE
BOY stalked three deep early, three to four wide on the far turn and had little left for the drive. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY chased three to four wide at the
back on the clubhouse turn, went four wide into the second bend, came five wide into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off. HALF-MILE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

OUTRIGHT tracked along the three path early, moved out and took closer order four deep in the middle stages, bid four wide on the far turn, drew alongside
the leader while drifting inward and drove clear. NO HANG CHARLIE sped to the front and moved inward, was challenged from inside and dueled up the
backstretch, inched ahead nearing the far turn, showed the way into the final furlong, then yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth. LOOKIN FOR
REVENGE chased along the rail early then went up to challenge leaving the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, failed to keep up on the second bend,
continued to give chase within range through the drive and kept on to secure the show. PEPPERMAN unhurried in the beginning from inside, trailed to the
second bend, angled out with a quarter mile remaining and summoned a mild rally to complete the superfecta. BOTTLE OF SMOKE forwardly placed three
deep into the clubhouse turn, remained outside the top pair in the middle stages, chased three wide into the lane and flattened. KING OF SPEED raced up
close between rivals early then chased leaving the first turn, coaxed along up the backstretch, lost ground on the far turn, tired in the lane, bled following the
race and was vanned off.

NYVAN stepped to the front and moved inside, dueled with outer rival up the backstretch, inched ahead on the far turn then cleared past the quarter pole,
drew off under light coaxing in upper stretch and remained well clear in hand through the final sixteenth. CAROLE LOMBARD bumped with
UNCONTROLLABLE while chasing along the rail into the first turn, tipped out past the five-sixteenths pole and took aim three wide into the stretch, failed to
threaten the winner in the lane and settled for second best. UNCONTROLLABLE bobbled leaving the gate, chased between rivals and bumped into the first
turn, stalked the top pair from off the rail to the far turn, got floated four wide around the bend and lacked a late bid. GOLDEN AGAIN bobbled leaving the
gate, checked off heels three deep into the first turn, stayed outside rivals then got floated out on the second bend, entered the lane five wide and
weakened. TOOTUFFTOSWALLOW showed early speed two then three wide on the first turn while keen early, dueled outside NYVAN in the middles
stages, kept the pressure on that rival to the quarter pole, then lost touch nearing the stretch and gave way.

BOLD ENDEAVOR stalked two wide early then moved out on the backstretch, bid four deep with a quarter mile remaining, took over into the stretch, dueled
with CLUB ASPEN in the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. CLUB ASPEN pressed the leader from outside while in-hand early, chased three wide into
the far turn, challenged three deep late on the bend, dueled inside BOLD ENDEAVOR down the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. ROYAL ACT
bobbled leaving the gate, trailed three wide around the clubhouse turn then was taken out wider on the backstretch, rounded the far turn five wide, then
came with a late run and gained the show. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH showed keen early speed while being pressed from outside, dueled outside a rival in the
middle stages and lost command at the half-mile pole, vied between foes into the stretch, got put in a bit tight and shuffled in upper stretch and kept on for a
minor award. ORDER AND LAW raced near the back on the inside, angled four wide on the far turn, churned on down the lane but needed to find more late.
BALADI broke a step slow then lost his path shortly after and had to pause momentarily, chased two wide off the pace around the clubhouse turn, pulled the
rider along and went up to engage the leader on the backstretch, took over at the half-mile pole, cleared briefly on the far turn then fought with outside trio
into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
LOW EXPECTATIONS speed to the front in the two path then dueled inside POST FACTO, put away that rival on the far turn, met the bid from ZIO JO
nearing the stretch, battled down the stretch holding a slim advantage and dug in to prevail. ZIO JO steadied when put in a bit tight by LOW
EXPECTATIONS on the first turn, chased wo wide into the second bend, tipped out and bid three deep, fought outside LOW EXPECTATIONS through the
stretch and could not get by. POST FACTO got crowded between rivals shortly after the start, recovered quickly and went up to press the pace from outside
while in hand, dueled well off the rail outside LOW EXPECTATIONS up the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn, ailed to keep up approaching the
quarter pole and weakened in the lane. HACKING IT UP raced in tight along the rail into the first turn then moved off the inside, trailed three wide into the
second bend, moved into the two path then entered the lane three wide and was not a factor.
