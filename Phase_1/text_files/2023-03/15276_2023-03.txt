STARSHIP LAOBAN stalked three wide, chased on the turn, continued evenly in upper stretch, then rallied outside, surged in deep stretch and got up at the
wire. EMPRESS DEONA set the pace racing with a clear lead, pulled away on the turn, responed when roused, dug in, then weakened late and was caught
at the wire. BROAD JUMPER raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. CAUSE I SAID raced off the pace
inside, came three wide into the lane and gained mildly inside. OUR UPTOWN GIRL raced off the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, then lacked a
stretch rally. DARLING DONNA tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and tired. TIZ GRACIE stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and gave way.

pace, moved very wide and was up for place late. LONG GRAY LINE lacked speed near the inside then gained in the stretch while no threat. WILD UNION
raced in closest pursuit of the dueling leaders then weakened. KITTEN STREET engaged in a heated duel inside for three quarters and faltered. RONIN
WARRIOR vied outside for three quarters and weakened. LOAD UP MOE dropped far behind inside and was never a factor. AWE MUN lacked speed and

NO CONFESSION stalked the loose pacesetter, bid to the front midway on the turn and drew off while kept to urging. PROVE RIGHT hustled to a clear
advantage, was collared by the winner after quarter mile and yielded in the stretch. PRAETORIAN GUARD lagged far behind then offered some late energy
to gain the show. ALL EYES ON YOU prompted the pace along the inside and began fading on the turn. JOHN DUTTON raced off the leaders inside and
proved empty lacking rally. EL DE CHIMI chased off the pace outside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
TEXAS BASIN broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, angled out, rallied in the stretch, charged to the front past the
sixteenth marker and drew clear late. HEALY'S HOPE raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, closed well late outside and got the nod for
second on the wire. GO FOR THE KILL was sent along the rail in the early stages, then tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail in
the stretch run and just missed for the place spot. HOPE FOR GOLD stalked close up two wide, bid on the turn, dueled, took over, kicked clear, then dug in,
yielded to the winner and was outfinished late. MAHOMES MONEY set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and weakened in the stretch.
DANGNABBIT was a bit fractious in the post parade, chased two wide and had no rally. SPLITZVILLE trailed the field, moved up four wide on the turn, then
lacked a stretch rally. BOURBON MISSION raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the turn and failed to threaten. GUSHING OIL chased close up
outside, lugged out on the turn and gave way. MO READY raced three wide off the pace and did not factor.
