navigated the far turn from the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to hold the win. BELLA FACCIA saved ground around
the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the four path, launched a bid
approaching the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. SHE'S SO BEARRISH stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field
while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and was caught in the lane. VERIFIABLE

the four path and finished evenly. MOST DIVINE raced at the back of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn
in the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane. TIZ A TEMPEST raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between

Footnotes
GALLEY HEAD led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far bend and continued to
battle down the stretch, edging clear late. SINGALONG KAYLA raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, challenged from the three path headed into the far turn and dueled to the wire, getting outfinished late. I'M NERVOUS NOW raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend in the three path and improved position in the lane. SALIT saved
ground early, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and never threatened. JESS'S GYPSY
GIRL raced at the back of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in the two path and showed no kick.
HAPPY RIDE saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path
and made no bid. HERE'S PERFECTION saved ground around the first bend, tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. CHEM MAJOR trailed the field from the rail throughout and was never a factor.
