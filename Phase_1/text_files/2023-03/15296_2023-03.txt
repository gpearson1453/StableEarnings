Footnotes
IT'S GREEK TO ME set the pace inside facing some early pressured, edged away leaving the turn while coming off the fence a bit, drew away in the stretch
and was kept to the task with moderate hand-urging. OCEAN HONEY pressed the eventual winner from between runners two to three wide into the turn,
was no match for the top one but held the place. MUD HUT pursued from in behind the leading trio into the turn racing off the fence in about the three path,
moved out wider for the drive, kept on in the lane but missed second. SWEET FRAULEIN broke a half-step slowly and was forced in at the start, lacked
early speed despite some encouragement, moved out three to four deep before the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and ran on with mild late
interest. FROST WARRIOR broke inwardly, was forwardly-positioned briefly then chased while dropping back racing near the inside, failed to make a late
bid. CESSO pursued the leader just off that one's flank racing outside three to four wide, steadily weakened.

Footnotes
TAP N TWINE raced off the leading pair in about the three path into the turn, still had a bit to do by the top of the stretch but took aim, gained steadily then
surged pats late to get up in time under steady handling. SMILE AT THE STORM appeared to brush the gate lightly but was still close up attending the pace
from outside soon after racing two to three wide, took closer order to contest the issue late on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, was asked past the
three-sixteenths, responded by edging clear of dueling partner but was outkicked by the winner. NIFF was urged at the start and quickly took the lead to set
the pace, was pressured into the turn racing inside, dueled with a rival, yielded grudgingly late. IRISH HALO settled off the pace, raced outside a foe two
wide through the turn off the leaders, was never near enough to threaten. ZENCHUA SKY chased very briefly, dropped back inside and was unable to
threaten.

SILVER MOON ROAD broke on top to set the early pace inside, was pressured into the turn, asked for run at the three-sixteenths, maintained a narrow lead
to the wire holding off rivals while being kept to the task. DARK HEDGES was slightly fractious in the gate, bumped the inner rival lightly at the start, was
forwardly-positioned outside pressing three wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch and saved the place from PERFECT WAGER, who was outsprinted
early, raced between runners three wide at the rear through the turn, swung out five wide for the drive, was gaining too late and missed second. SOUPER
FORTUNE bobbled slightly and was lightly bumped into a rival at the start, moved forward between runners to press the leader through the turn, weakened
in the stretch. TRY TRY AGAIN was lightly bumped at the start, gave brief chase then dropped back racing in the two path through the turn, was unable to
menace. D'FEVER raced at the rear four wide on the turn, swung six to seven deep into upper stretch and failed to rally.

FEVER NATION broke inwardly just a bit, quickly moved clear under mild early coaxing, dictated terms on or just off the rail in the clear, was unasked till
mid-stretch then responded by drawing away. INSIDE THE CIRCLE got away alertly but was soon overtaken. chased the winner two to three wide, was no
match and just saved the place from DASH TO THE CASH, who was lightly brushed at the start, settled at the back racing off the inside, went about three
wide on the turn, kept on late but just missed second. NAGY AND DA BEARS chased briefly but soon steadily dropped back two wide, offered no late bid.
MAN ON ATTACK was ridden from the break, chased outside going three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. IRISH BRUTE lacked early speed racing
inside early, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HOPPESTRY raced off the leading pair into the turn, went in the three path on that bend, angled outside the leaders in upper stretch six deep, took aim and
drove past late under steady urging. FIRST SQUADRON was urged forward at the break, prompted the pace from outside three to four wide, dueled in
upper stretch, outbattled that rival late but was outkicked by the winner and just held second. FRIEND was mid-pack off the leaders and outside a rival four
deep into the turn, swung seven to eight wide for the drive, was gaining too late and missed the place. FOGGY KITTEN got away alertly, was challenged up
the backstretch, attended then dueled inside that rival, drifted out turning for home, was asked just past the quarter pole but outkicked. SINGING ALLI
chased briefly inside, dropped back a bit, saved ground through the turn gaining on the leaders into upper stretch then went evenly. WANNA HAVE FUN
broke awkwardly and a couple lengths slowly, raced at the back off the inside and was not a factor. GODSGIFT was outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
WAR ROOM stalked the loose leader three wide, advanced on that one leaving the turn and into upper stretch, was getting in badly through the stretch,
hooked up and dueled, exchanged a light bump late and edged past. ONASA sped clear under mild early coaxing, set the pace racing off the fence, was
asked in mid-stretch when engaged by an outside rival, was a bit crowded by that rival, exchanged a light bump late and was outfinished. LIGHTNING
CASHES was ridden at the break, chased inside, proved no match for the top pair. FITZEA raced outside a rival four to five wide through the turn and was
unable to menace. YOLO SANTIAGO lacked early speed, switched well off the inside early, raced inside a foe but in about the three path on the turn and
was never near enough to threaten. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF ONASA AGAINST WAR ROOM ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CAN MAN DO was in tight at the start, settled in to track the leader from inside, moved out beginning past the five-sixteenths, lugged out in mid-stretch, took
aim and surged past late. CINDY'S G MAN broke outwardly, set the pace in the clear racing just off the rail, was outkicked. PINBALLER was reluctant to
load, raced mid-pack four wide through the turn, came into upper stretch wider still and kept on evenly. C F V RED NOVA was in a bit tight at the start,
settled inside at the back, finished willingly to improve position. TALKTOEACHOTHER chased three wide through the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
EAST OF INDIA was in a bit tight at the start, raced at the back four to five wide through the turn, failed to rally. SHANGHAI SILVER was very hard to load,
dropped back racing off the inside and never rallied.
