Footnotes
CLOUD MUSIC sprinted clear soon after the break, was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail and was under
encouragement in the drive. OCCASIONAL MOON saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch, moved back
to the inner rail leaving the far turn and rallied inside horses. MARYLAND MOON , steadied approaching the first turn, was four wide around the turn, moved
up four wide leaving the backstretch, ranged up three wide approaching the stretch and flattened out. ASK HIM OAKEY , five deep the first turn, advanced
in the three path entering the far turn, steadied in traffic inside MARYLAND MOON near the three eighths pole, eased outside for the stretch run and faded.
SERGEANT SHERMAN was outrun. GAMING SOUL chased the pace two wide for six furlongs and gave way. TOAST TO COAST , three wide the first
turn, was no factor and angled five wide leaving the far turn. ALLIGATOR ARMS showed speed along the inner rail, chased the pace to the far turn, faltered
and was eased late. An objection by the rider of ASK HIM OAKEY against MARYLAND MOON for alleged interference near the three eighths pole was not
allowed.

Footnotes
TOP BOSS broke a step slow, hustled up between rivals soon after, took a short lead and secured the rail, dueled with GREAT GO through an honest clip,
lost the lead near mid stretch, battled back under left handed asks to regain command in deep stretch and grimly prevailed. GREAT GO GO broke on top,
was headed from his inside leaving the five eighths, sparred outside the winner from there, took a slim advantage in mid stretch, fought gamely but wasn't
quite good enough. THE CAIRO KID had speed to the inside of rivals then eased back and let the duelers go, was guided three wide and advanced into the
lane, took closer order with a furlong to go but came up empty through the final sixteenth. NASHVEGAS lagged back despite strong asks from the gate,
gathered some momentum three wide past the five sixteenths, angled four wide into the stretch, straightened away and closed steadily. DR. RUSTY
RAYMOND , sluggish from the gate, raced well back mid turn, swung five wide for the drive and had a belated run. HAGLER , in the clear while saving
ground and coaxed along, stayed inside for the drive and churned on. LOADED SNIPER gave early chase of the duelers, raced outside a rival leaving the
far turn and faded.

MASTERWORK stalked the pace under confident rating down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, secured command entering the stretch,
was kept under urging and drew off. DOVER BLUFF set a pressured pace along the inner rail, lacked the needed response when challenged turning for
home, gave way and held the place. VAX A NATION lightly bumped with MILLBANK MAN leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail down the
backstretch and on the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and had a slight rally. NORTH HIGHLAND unseated his rider and ran off a furlong going to
the starting gate, broke alertly, prompted the pace outside DOVER BLUFF and faded after six furlongs. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE , outrun, swung outside in
upper stretch and passed tired horses. HOME SCHOOL , outrun, raced four wide the first turn and three wide the far turn. MILLBANK MAN lightly bumped
with VAX A NATION at the start and dropped back on the far turn.

TATE broke inward putting BRILLIANT ICE in tight, corrected and prompted the three wide, took closer order of the duel mid turn, shifted four wide and
responded entering the lane, forged clear under a drive in mid stretch then widened while kept to task. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , between rivals while within range,
altered out four wide for the drive, kept on grinding and gained the place. MAILMAN'S A FLYER saved ground, eased out with pursuit near mid stretch and
continued with interest. UNION FLEET pulled his way forward from between rivals leaving the chute, disputed the pace along the rail, took over from
ABUELO PAPS mid turn, sparred to the inside of the winner from upper stretch past mid stretch then faded late. ABUELO PAPS dueled two wide outside
UNION FLEET, ceded the lead mid turn, stayed on to contest the issue between runners in upper stretch, shifted out near mid stretch and faded. BURGEE ,
three wide between rivals early, was pushed along mid turn, came four wide into the lane, dropped back in a bit but failed to rally. BRILLIANT ICE stumbled
when put in tight between rivals leaving the gate, recovered and was used four wide to reach a forward spot, chased five wide outside rivals nearing the lane
and gave way.

Footnotes
SHADY MUNNI bobbled at the break, recovered and vied outside TOTAL EFFORT early on, moved clear without much asking around the turn, opened
under a drive nearing mid stretch and proved much the best while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. BRANCO MARIA settled well back early,
saved ground leaving the far turn, edged up approaching the stretch, worked outward and to the center of the track in mid stretch and continued on willingly
to gain the place. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE bore out at the break, straightened and moved up to be forward towards the rail, eased out to advance into the
stretch, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds then flattened out late. NEVER CHANGE broke a step slow then steadied soon after, settled off the early
pace, was put to pressure between runners mid turn, angled out about five wide and made a mild run past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain.
TOTAL EFFORT vied inside the winner to the turn, chased from the three eighths, remained a presence to the three sixteenths and weakened. ONLY
CHILD , three to four wide, was ridden along mid turn, lacked a punch and gave way in upper stretch. NOTION TO TAPIT forced outward at the break,
pulled his way forward past the three quarter pole, raced four wide between rivals heading to the turn, dropped back and drifted outward. CAPTAIN CARDO
, between rivals early, dropped back. DIVINE PROPORTION , five wide outside rivals heading to the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
STRONG FINISH got locked in a battle to the inside of GREAT GOOGLYMOOGLY soon after the start, responded when put to serious asking in upper
stretch, wrested command past the three sixteenths, spurted clear under left handed encouragement soon after and drew away while kept to a drive.
BUBBA CHROME saved ground with pursuit of the embattled leaders, eased out then moved up behind rivals leaving mid stretch, altered in with a sixteenth
to go and kept on gamely to gain the place. STEP AHEAD , up in the air slightly at the break to be away last, regrouped and was taken wide, circled five into
the stretch and continued with interest. GREAT GOOGLYMOOGLY broke outward, corrected and sparred outside on a short lead, ceded command past the
three sixteenths, stayed on his left lead and weakened. SPUNKY IRISHMAN , fractious behind the gate, raced three deep pursuing, advanced four wide to
have aim on the duelers into the stretch, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. DUKE OF DOOLY , between rivals pursuing, gave way in upper
stretch. SHIP MASTER failed to menace. ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE dropped back early and failed to generate a run.
