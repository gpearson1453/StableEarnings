speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. GO LAKER GO was away in good order to dispute the pace from between rivals and
gave way through the final furlong. ATTORNEY LOUIS lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SANSOME vied for the lead
from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BELLE MY BELLE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. PLUM ROSE was away in
good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the quarter and gave way to the winner late. SHES A KILLA
QUEEN broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. PRECIOUS ONE lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and failed to threaten. KEEP IT ROLLIN settled off the leaders early, steadied through the turn and did not offer a bid. R HAPPY PLACE
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HAPI HAPI pressed the pace of ATOMIC CANDY while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin with a furlong to
run and drew off as a handy winner. PUSH THROUGH chased the leaders while racing five-wide, drifted in with a furlong to run and was up for the place.
ATOMIC CANDY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. OF GOOD REPORT lacked early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not menace. GOOD BYE PUTIN showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EL NOBLE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

DANNYBOB was away in good order to duel for the lead with WHERE'S FRANKIE from the inside, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held
off the closing ALBERTA SUN to prevail. ALBERTA SUN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, bumped with J T'S LA
NENA into the stretch and finished well when clear. J T'S LA NENA was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, bumped with ALBERTA SUN
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. HEART ON THE RUN lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a
belated bid. HOLY TUTTA BELLA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed late response. WHERE'S FRANKIE broke
sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MY KACEJJ settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was up in the closing yards. THE GOLDEN
EGG was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not match strides with the winner late but finished well to gain the
place. NAPOLEONIC CODE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. YANKEE TEA PARTY broke sharply
to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and gave way late. BRIGHT MIND was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DIXON TUFF lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. BATTLEOF
TRAFALGAR was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. RECONCILING FORCE was away in good order to dispute
the pace while racing four-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
