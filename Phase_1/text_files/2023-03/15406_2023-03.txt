Footnotes
WAIT ON ME broke well but gradually dropped back to trail the field after a furlong, starting moving at the half mile marker while still inside, waited for racing
room through the turn while smartly saving ground, shifted out at the quarter pole and spilt one set of rivals, shifted inside and split a second pair of rivals,
still being kept on point and encouraged, finally only had one more rival to pass nearing the wire, was ridden and encouraged, passed that foe and was up
just in time for the win. MALLY'S MONSOON was sent to the lead and set the pace, showed the way along the rail around the turn as an outer rival pressed,
drew clear of that one in upper stretch, but tired entering the final sixteenth, was collared in the last few strides and had to settle for second. UNBRIDLED
ANNSLEY was a step slow at the start, recovered to track the top pair from the three path around the turn, chased steadily while racing from the outside,
drifted slightly to the five path while losing show to an inner rival in upper stretch, was set down for the drive, and regained show from a tiring rival late.
CORONA DEL MAR vied for the early lead, decided to stalk right off of the leader from the four path, pressed from the two path through the turn, failed to
keep pace leaving the quarter pole, and steadily gVe way while hanging on her left lead. DAPHNE'S FIRE raced off the pace early from the outside, was
settled and rated until the half mile marker, was given rein and starting to advance from the outside, circled the field in the turn, was six wide in the upper
stretch, was still closing and being encouraged struggled to switch leads and tired. STOP THE MADNESS vied for the early lead from the one post position,
couldn't make the lead in time and had to check as the outside horses were angling down to the inside from the break, stayed in the second tier while
waiting for racing room, stayed tucked behind the leaders along the inside through the turn, shifted down to the rail at the quarter pole but didn't have
enough to make a difference today. PUTTIN' PRESLEY was in between foes early and was in close with horses on both sides, retreated to trail at the three
furlong pole, was never involved, tired and was eased the last furlong.

Footnotes
RICKY BOBBY laid off of the pace along the inside, tugged forward in the two path around the first turn, shifted out and tracked the leader from the four path
approaching the far turn, ranged up nearing the lane to produce a bid, drove clear in upper stretch, lugged in after flopping back to his left lead in the final
furlong, and was put to wraps late. FLAT OUT AMERICAN broke prominently, but was wrangled back between horses while rank from restraint entering the
first turn, tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on in the final sixteenth to catch tiring foes for place. PATH TO
SUCCESS set the pace inside of a vying foe while a path off of the rail, relinquished the advantage to that foe with nine sixteenths to go, chased behind the
leaders around the far turn, altered outside of a tiring par at the sixteenth pole to bid for place along with an outer rival, but got outfinished. HAROLD'S
CLOUD lunged inwardly and bumped an inner rival while breaking a step slow, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, pressed the new
leader from the three path around the far turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer rival loomed a danger, proved no match for that one in upper
stretch, chased while holding place to the sixteenth pole, but faltered late. SUMMER LOVER bumped with rivals on either side at the start, and made little
impact from the two path. VALE prompted the pace two wide early on, gained an advantage at the nine sixteenths pole, crossed over into the far turn as an
outer rival pressed on, got headed by that bidder and another outer rival nearing the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. SEEKING SPLENDOR leaned
out and bumped a rival at the start while breaking a beat slow, and trailed throughout while taking the turns in the four to five paths.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFULGUATEMALA stalked while tucking three to two wide while between horses into the turn, ranged up in the four path to bid in upper stretch,
sparred entering the final furlong, and drove clear. RUN DREAMING set the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path to embrace a pair of bidders
in upper stretch, but was bested while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and held place. BITSY PERFECTMATCH was urged along in the
two path in midpack around the turn, sustained a chase while aiming inside of the leading trio in the final furlong, and gained show leaving the sixteenth
pole. BEULAH K bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, race far back in the five path, checked mildly while shying from the loose horse into the turn,
raced at the rear in the four to five paths around the bend, then stayed on through the lane. DIVINE DEFENCE tracked in the five path, ranged up to attempt
a bid for the lead outside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but flattened out at the furlong grounds, drifted in slightly leaving that marker, and tired. GYPSY
JACKPOT lacked speed along the inside, shifted out gradually approaching midstretch, and moved up. DAISY DE ORO raced far back after tucking from
the three to two path into the turn, and failed to factor. TDZ CORRIENDA STAR broke slowly, raced at the rear outside of foes, checked behind BEAULAH K
into the turn, fanned from the five path to the eight path entering the lane, and made little impact. VALERIE LOUISE bumped with an outer rival at the start,
then had her hind heels clipped by a rival shortly after, laid off of the pace two wide, tucked to the rai entering the turn, altered course two wide at the three
sixteenths pole, but tired. NATURALBORNSENDER chased along the inside, but weakened and was eased through the late stages. SHARE THE DOE vied
in the four path briefly, but weakened into and around the turn, and was eased through the final furlong. OCEAN FLEET clipped heels after an outer rival
shifted across her path soon after the start, and lost her rider. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE EARLY STAGES RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
WUPKAR prompted the pace setter from the three path, gained an advantage entering the lane, inched an advantage in midstretch, and held firm from an
inner bidder through the late stages. SPEEDY DUDETTE stalked from the two path while behind the leaders, gained through a rail opening in upper stretch
to bid inside of the top pair, but was fended off through the final sixteenth. HEI HEI CUSTIVITY rushed forward after being last away from the gates, set the
pace inside of a vying foe while remaining a path off of the inside, got headed by that one entering the lane, fought on between horses through midstretch
as an inner rival also offered a bid, and yielded to those foes at the sixteenth pole. BOX OF PICTURES tracked in the six path while inching closer around
the turn, but leveled off in upper stretch. RUE LALA pursued from midpack in the five path while between horses, and chased among foes through the lane.
INAWIC was void of speed, took the turn in the four path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. SIENNA BREEZE stalked the top pair
from the four path, but weakened between horses leaving the quarter pole. OURS AND THEIRS trailed in the four path and never got involved. IRONIT laid
off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the two path, but failed to change leads before weakening in the late stages.

Footnotes
DESERT TEMPEST rated from the inside early on, stayed tucked inside a pocket behind the leaders and inside of other foes, patiently waited for racing
room, saved ground until the opportunity opened up at the quarter pole, spilt horses, shifted over to the rail was hustled down the lane, then drew off in the
last sixteenth of a mile. BOLTORO was three wide going into the first turn, was rated four wide from the middle of the field down the backside, was asked at
the half mile pole, started gaining ground, was asked for more at the three eighths pole, angled out six wide in the upper stretch, was pushed and
encouraged , continued to gain momentum and ground, with each stride, was game but had to settle for second best today. ARDEN'S ASSAULT was slow
into stride and racing far off the pace early, started to find his stride from the outside, at the gained momentum, continued to move closer the the lead from
the six and path, was asked at the three eighths pole and responded with a nice turn of foot, circled the field through the turn, stayed in the same path in the
stretch was kept to task, and closed well, but couldn't make up enough ground to run better than third today. URBAN FORCE was three wide racing into the
first turn, split a pair leaving the turn getting to the lead, rated just off of the leader and stalked from there, launched a bid at the five sixteenths pole, was on
even ground at the quarter pole, but then gave way at the three sixteenth pole. MISCHIEVOUS GAL stalked from off the pace early, moved up at the half to
join the leaders from the outside in the four path, matched strides with that pair until the quarter pole and tired after that. CAMELOT BEAUTY (IRE) had an
awkward start and trailed throughout, passed one tired rival. AMISFIELD vied for the early lead, set the pace for just over a half of a mile and faded after
that.

Footnotes
TWIRLING CAT broke in and bumped a foe at the start, stalked behind the leaders from the two path, looked to take aim outside of the top pair entering the
lane before splitting them at the three sixteenths pole, bumped an inner rival while sustaining a bid coming to midstretch, and edged clear. ANITA'S VISION
tracked in the three path, bid in hand between horses at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, drifted out subtly and briefly passing the quarter
pole, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds. FOR HARPER settled off of the pace two to three wide, fanned five wide entering the
lane, and stayed on while flopping to and from his left lead in the final furlong. T J'S FIRST was taken in hand leaving the gates and forced to trail, saved
ground, and sustained a rail rally through the lane. HIGHLY WICKED nudged the inner part of the gate upon leaving it, stalked behind the leaders two wide
and between horses, gained inside vying position with five furlongs to go, showed the way from outer pressers around the far turn, took a bump from the
bidding eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded to the top pair leaving the furlong grounds. LEAD ME laid off of the pace three wide, saved
ground around the far turn, and lacked a bid through the lane. DORGENOIS broke a step slow, raced far back in the five path, and moved up between
horses in midstretch. SHE TOLD YOU SO took a bump from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, failed to gain in the four path
around the far turn, and made little impact. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA vied along the inside around the first turn, but yielded at the five furlong pole.
HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT veered out soon after the start, recovered to stalk in the four path, moved forward to vie at the five furlong, pole, but yielded while
drifting out turning for home, and stopped through the lane. AGAMI broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three to five path around the first turn, then
fanned wide entering the lane, and made little impact. RUBY BEGONIA vied in the three path, then between horses down the backstretch, but wilted turning
for home, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
FIRST MISSION popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, stalked the clear leader from the two to three paths, bid in hand at the three furlong pole,
cleared from an outer presser entering the lane, drew off under light coaxing in upper stretch before the rider peeked for competition at the furlong grounds,
and continued to pull away with much more to give. ST. JOHN'S bumped with an inner rival at the star, tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path
while just behind the leaders around the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader before gaining place
leaving the furlong grounds. QUATERNION tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped three wide approaching the far turn, pressed the new leader turning
for home, but failed to keep pace leaving the quarter pole, lost place to an outer bidder while giving way at the furlong grounds, and lasted for show.
PURSUIT OF POWER lunged slightly leaving the gates, lacked speed along the inside, improved in the three path in upper stretch, then drifted out and
across rival's paths at the furlong grounds, and failed to gain show. EARL OF DASSEL broke slowly and was void of early speed along the inside, gained
ground five wide around the far turn, but flattened out while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds. GAMETIME GLADIATOR bumped with an
outer rival leaving the gates, settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to threaten between horses. RIGHT KARMA sped
clear around the first turn, but was headed passing the three furlong pole, and weakened. BIG COMMERCE trailed in the three path, and moved up.
NEIGHBOR was restless in the gates when an inner rival popped their stall open, then was bumped and forced outwardly by an inner foe upon breaking,
laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, and tired. WOLF HUNTER broke out and bumped a foe at the start, tracked in the three path, but weakened
between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER rated just off the pace while stalking the leader from the three path, pressed in the two path around the turn, failed to produce a
bid while being fended off through midstretch, yet determinedly inched closer to reel in the leader in the last sixteenth of a mile, and edged ahead late. OLD
HOMESTEAD shot to the lead and secured the rail position, set a soft pace while well in hand and staying on the fence, held sway from an outer chaser
through midstretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth, and gave in late. EXCESS MAGIC tracked from the second tier along the rail, but failed to
keep pace with the leading pair while sparring with outer rivals for minor rewards, gained show in midstretch, and held that position late. READY TO
POUNCE raced off the pace from the inside, trailed under light coaxing around the turn, took aim between horses in hopes of bidding for a minor share, but
lacked a split through midstretch, stayed on in the final sixteenth, but was fended off for show. JUST MIGHT fidgetted about just before the gates sprung
causing him to spot the rest of the field multiple lengths at the start, recovered to gain a three wide tracking position into the turn, but failed to keep pace with
the top two in upper stretch, and weakened.

BIG BELLA BROWN sped clear early on, maintained a clear margin while hanging on her left lead and flagging her tail in upper stretch, changed over at the
furlong grounds, dug in to resist an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole, and gamely held. EASY RUNNER tracked two wide and between horses into the
turn, moved forward to take aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to bid leaving the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay late.
GOLDEN PALACE laid off of the pace in the four path, spun into the lane in the six path, and stayed on willingly. OAK HILL SOLUTION bumped with an
outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, lacked a bid, but held fourth. ZION steadied out of tight quarters between horses early on, raced far back in
the two path, gradually shifted out approaching midstretch, and offered a late gain. IZZY'S BABY BOY chased from midpack in the three path, and failed to
menace. WIN YA WIN broke a step slow, trailed around the turn, and surpassed tired foes late. LILRASCALMAN bumped with an inner rival at the start,
checked when brushed between horses early on, saved ground off of the pace, but lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. GOLD MERRITT broke a
step slow, stalked in the three path, but weakened. AND FIFTY tracked four wide, but weakened. ANDIAMO GIACOMO lost his rider at the start. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
