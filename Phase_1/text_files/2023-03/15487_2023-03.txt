Footnotes
MELTING SNOW was hustled from the gate, contested the pace along the rail while inside of a foe, turned into upper stretch under pressure, passed the
three-sixteenths on even terms with the runner-up, fought inside that foe under the crop into the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under steady urging. ALARM CLOCK was urged along off the pace, gained three wide early on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run,
turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong then was turned back and outfinished while able to
get the place. MERAVIGLIOSO was hustled from the start then urged along at the rear, saved ground around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and finished willingly for the show. ICY REPLY was coaxed along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. TRIPLE P was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back five then six wide around the turn and had nothing left. QUALITY STONES
contested the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the the two then three path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
SILIPO coaxed from the gate, raced three wide outside the top pair before advancing to vie with those foes into the turn, took over narrow command at the
five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch and drew off under a drive to prevail. BOURBON BAY got bumped at the start by PRINTRACK,
who broke outwards and in turn bumped POPPY'S PRIDE, came under hustling and pressed the pace of that rival from the outside before vying between
foes into the turn, took over the front at the three-eighths, got headed with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the
top one while along clear of the rest and second best. SAILOR SPEED broke in at the start bumping POPPY'S PRIDE, chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
ICY STORM chased just off the inside under a ride from the midway on the turn, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure
the last major share. STANDUP coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got out-finished in the late stages. LIAM'S FIRE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered no response. PRINTRACK broke out at the start bumping BOURBON BAY into POPPY'S PRIDE,
showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from BOURBON BAY then vied inside a pair into the turn, conceded the front three furlongs
from home put to coaxing, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. DOUBLE SHOT chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
four wide for home, made no impact. POPPY'S PRIDE got bumped between foes at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

LIFE AND LIGHT dropped back under urging while showing no speed, angled in at the rear, saved ground around the turn, rallied near the inside in upper
stretch, closed well to get the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and held off the runner-up under strong urging. PAPI ON ICE was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, settled towards the rear, passed the five-eighths under urging, moved from three to six wide around the turn, rallied outside in upper
stretch and closed well but missed while clear for the place. PATRICK THE GREAT was well placed in third position, ranged up in the four path on the turn,
made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to
get the show. ROMANOATSEE settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, moved towards the outside, went five wide around the turn,
gained under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. B C GLORY DAYS set the pace under pressure from his outside,
moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, was asked while inside on the turn, came out while inside of a foe in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then gave
way. NINTH OF APRIL was hustled from the gate, settled under some urging, went two to three wide on the turn and faltered. BASIC TRUTH pressed the
pace on the outside, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and retreated.

LOCALLY OWNED raced in the three path on the first turn, settled comfortably down the backstretch, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn,
gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, took the lead coming to the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. GOOD SKATE came
outward while going to the front, showed the way near the inside, raced a touch off the rail around the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the winner near the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. TONAL IMPACT angled in down the opening straightaway,
was rated in the two path around the first turn, came under coaxing while well placed down the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the far turn,
kept on well in pursuit of the leaders in the stretch and missed the place while clear for the show. DATESFREEDOM was taken in hand early then rated
three then two wide around the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the far turn, pursued the leader under a
drive into the final furlong and weakened. HEALING was hustled from the gate, went five wide on the first turn, dropped back near the five-eighths, traveled
around the far turn in the five path, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered. CENTAVO was placed under a tight hold early then taken back nearing the
opening bend, dropped from six to four wide around that turn, settled at the back, saved ground on the far turn and also faltered. UNO moved out into the
first turn, traveled around that bend in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, fell further back
while four then three wide on the final turn and retreated. WILL E SUTTON stumbled at the start and unseated the rider.

Footnotes
ROMANTIC GAMBLE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong
then closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. EASY DAY was coaxed along just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, made a
bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead approaching the quarter-pole, responded well under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, drifted out some while
still in front coming to the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken while clear for the place. SALTO DE TIGRE dropped back early then moved out under urging,
went to to three wide around the turn and was along for the show. LOHENGRIN TWO went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, traveled
around the turn in the two path, was roused while being headed nearing the quarter-pole and weakened. SCILLY CAY lacked early speed, saved ground on
the turn and failed to threaten. ZERTZ was last to commence, moved up on the outside then chased the pace, went around the turn in the five path and
capitulated. CHARLIE FIVE O was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path, spun five wide into
the stretch and had nothing left.

LUNI SIMA four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, inched clear to the finish kept to task. O'TROUBLE five paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command near the
eighth pole, dug in under threat and was relieved of command a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors. GLORY ROAD chased just off the inside
until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to secure the show
honors. RUSSIAN TO WIN six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch launching a bid into contention on the outside a furlong out, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the
late going. RAGTIME BLUES stumbled at the start, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader advancing on that rival midway on the turn, took over
command at the five-sixteenths and came under coaxing when under challenge heading four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a
furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. ROYAL TRYST coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. DURKIN'S CALL chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide for
home, made no impact. QUICKFLASH broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, chased four wide down the backstretch and then two to
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, angled four to five wide for home and tired. BEZOS coaxed from the gate, established the front
and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure into the turn and was under coaxing nearing the three-eighths marker, yielded the front
readily with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide into upper stretch and gave way.

coaxing, showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from NO BURN to the outside, yielded the front near the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DADDY KNOWS chased just off the inside under a firm left grip head cocked to the infield down the
backstretch, got taken in hand briefly half a mile from home, then floated two then three wide when getting out nearing the midway point on the turn, went
eight wide into upper stretch under urging and weakened. BLACK BELT chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, tired. HAMMERIN AAMER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the
turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and tired. MOUNT TRAVERS chased along the inside under a ride from the
