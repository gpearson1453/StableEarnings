Footnotes
REDZILLA led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and kicked clear in
the stretch. RIPLEY EFFECT raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming around
the far turn and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home. TIPHARAH saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and kept on to the wire. FIRST FAITH raced in the three path early, settled in
the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. PATH
TO VICTORY raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up from the four path coming around the second
bend and was outkicked in the lane. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the stretch. BLACK KARMA raced in the two path around the first bend, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the second turn and was empty from there.

saving ground around the turn and kicked clear in the stretch. SUNSPOT stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a
bid from the three path coming around the bend and chased on in the lane. NOT A DANCE raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. RECTANGLE stumbled mildly leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. ANDY WALKS WITH
ME tracked the pace setters on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. DOC CARSON
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the bend from the four path and faded from there. RED JET trailed well behind the field up
the backstretch and while saving ground around the turn and made up some ground in the stretch but never threatened. HEAVY WEIGHT bumped lightly
with the horse to his inside at the start, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the

to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. SUNNY SAINT veered in leaving the gate, settled in the three path for the run around the first turn,
