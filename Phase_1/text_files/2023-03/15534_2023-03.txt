Footnotes
STOLEN KISSES had an awkward beginning appearing to veer in a bit at the gap, switched outside rivals up the backstretch settling at the rear, advanced
outside five wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch having taken command by the three-sixteenths, continued to get in through the lane and was
geared down late once safely ahead. MO ARETHA set the pace racing off the rail with moderate outside pressure, edged clear passing the half, was
overtaken at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but second best. ACELA EXPRESS pressed the early pace, encouraged along starting from
the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. BLOOMING HILLS raced off the inside going four wide on the turn, went evenly and made no
bid. SARA'S SAPPHIRE pursued from near inside in the two path, saved ground on the turn, lacked any late kick.

OUR DAVINA was forwardly-positioned between runners into the turn, vied from between, dueled outside a foe in mid-stretch then edged away in the final
sixteenth under stout urging. ELIZA ROSE attended the pace from inside, took a brief and narrow lead in upper stretch when asked for more, dueled inside
but was outkicked while second best. READY AT TWO attended the pace from outside, put a head in front early on the turn racing three wide on that bend,
was no match for the top two. COMPUTER VIRUS chased from outside going four wide on the turn, dropped back and faded.

TIME MACHINE set the pace off the rail with minor inside pressure, put that one away on the turn, was challenged at the top of the stretch, received some
moderate right-handed encouragement at that juncture and began to draw clear then was kept to task under vigorous hand urging. REVIVAL stalked off the
eventual winner, took closer order coming past the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn, drew nearly even making a brief bid at the top of the stretch
but was no match while second best. GRAND ROYALE stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, was asked for more past the quarter pole but failed
to rally. ABSAROKA moved forward to press the eventual winner from inside up the backstretch, began losing ground soon after and was asked to keep
pace at the five-sixteenths but failed to rally.

WILBERT pressed the pace from outside mostly two to three wide, drew even about midway on the far turn and was in command by the quarter pole, drew
off under steady handling. SWORD OF GOLD stalked from outside the second flight going three to four wide throughout, was no match for the winner but
captured the place. GRANDSONSAM tracked from inside the second flight, moved out a path in upper stretch looking for room and ran on. MAGNA TAP
stalked from between the second flight to the quarter pole, was forced to alter out for room three to four wide in upper stretch and ran on. WARRIOR'S
STAR set the pace inside, gave way. STOLEN GHOST chased from off the inside in the three or four path mostly and failed to menace. EURA BUNNY BOY
was off slowly, distanced, eased through the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FLY TO THE BANK stalked from outside, edged closer three wide on the turn, drew even about the five-sixteenths, had the lead at the quarter pole, drew off
under urging. MESA MOON bumped a rival very lightly after the start, settled inside that one racing at the rear and off the inside, went about in the two to
three path on the turn, was in tight in upper stretch, once clear ran on strongly to capture the place. TOMMYHAWK was bumped very lightly after the start,
settled outside a rival at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, needed more. SHANNON C moved straight to the fore setting the pace on a narrow
advantage racing inside, was challenged midway on the turn and headed by the quarter pole, was asked for more at that juncture, switched outside the new
leader in upper stretch, had no late kick. MISTER WAYSIDE pressed from between runners two deep, lugged out a bit in upper stretch while weakening and
faded.

Footnotes
RAINBOW SMILES stalked from outside, edged nearer on the turn going three wide on that bend engaging the leader, put a short head in front before the
top of the stretch, dueled with a narrow advantage to the wire and held that rival. GENUINE DRAFT moved forward to the lead up the backstretch with
outside pressure, was engaged nearing the quarter pole and asked for more at that juncture, was headed in upper stretch dueling the length of the stretch
but was only second best. TUATHA saved ground inside and improved position. QUICK OKIE showed brief early speed inside, steadily dropped back
leaving the backstretch, appeared to be getting out a bit into the turn, ran on three to four wide thereafter. STEPONTHEFOOTFEET bobbled slightly at the
break, switched out racing three to four wide on the turn off the pace, shifted in a bit turning for home and failed to rally. FLASHY GAIL was encouraged
forward from the break, vied between runners from about the half till midway on the turn when dropping back, switched out four wide leaving that bend and
continued to weaken. YANKEES MIRACLES was off slowly and in tight, outpaced thereafter.

Footnotes
HEPUTTHEACEINRACE moved to the fore to set the pace pursued by outside rivals, came off the fence and raced in the two path on the far turn and just
clear, put to steady urging by upper stretch and held sway. HIT ONE OUT was caught five wide racing between rivals on the first turn and up the
backstretch, edged closer four wide on the far turn to be within striking distance coming to the quarter pole but was only second best. MR OKLAHOMA CITY
raced outside a rival off the pace at the back three wide through the first turn, continued three to four wide on the far turn, was along for show. FROGGY
tracked from inside, was held up in behind the leaders up the backstretch, switched off the inside going two then three deep on the far turn and ran on.
SPARK (PER) was forwardly-positioned four wide and between runners racing three wide into the second turn, began to drop back and shifted nearer the
rail, continued to weaken. BOTTOMLESS broke in the air and a bit slowly, raced at the back inside on or just off the room, lacked room briefly nearing the
quarter pole, failed to rally. SMART CALL moved forward outside but was caught six wide through the first turn, was within range up the backstretch,
dropped back five wide through the far turn and faded. SELLING SHORT chased briefly three wide, steadily retreated.

HEROIC SONG stalked from outside, went four wide on the turn, drew even with the leader turning for home, took charge outside the eighth pole and edged
clear willingly late. ACE GILFORD set the pace inside on or just off the rail, dueled briefly inside the winner but was only second best. AFLEET SNIPER

start, was in pursuit of the pace three wide, moved out a path late on the turn, kept on evenly. SILVER PONZI bumped lightly with the aforementioned,
chased from inside that one two deep, kept on evenly. SPECTACTICAL went in the three path on the turn, fanned six wide for the stretch run and failed to
rally. PROUD MOMENTS broke a step slowly, was outpaced early, saved ground through the turn. OVER EZ failed to menace while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
WICKED STREET got away alertly, dictated terms racing off the rail, was clear into the stretch and held safe under steady handling.
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY raced well off the pace inside, came out leaving the turn, was four wide in upper stretch, no match for the winner but second best.
SMOKING GUITAR was outside off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, ran on to get up for show honors
over PEPPERMINT SISTER, who had a light bump after the break, switched out and chased three wide, lacked the needed late kick. NAUGHTY NATALIE
bumped with rivals at the start, raced off the inside up the backstretch before angling in about the seven-sixteenths, ran on evenly. HARPERS VISION
bumped a rival at the start then was bumped into a foe, trailed racing inside, was never near enough to threaten. MISS TYRO was bumped at the start,
chased four wide, dropped back, moved out further for the drive and continued to fade.

Footnotes
CHARM THE LADIES was loaded riderless, angled in soon after the start tracking in behind, went three wide into the turn, moved between foes past the
quarter pole with aim on the leader coming into upper stretch four wide, was carried out by that rival while engaged in a duel, edged away to prevail under
steady handling. KICK IT AGAIN BOB set the pace racing off the rail in the clear, was challenged in upper stretch, lugged out nearing the furlong marker,
continued to drift out a bit while dueling under stout urging, was second best. LUCKY MCCOY was forced to take the overland route circling past horses six
wide on the turn, was best of the rest. BLAKE FROM TISH settled well off the leaders near the inside two to three wide, came out a bit for the drive, rallied
between rivals four wide nearing the sixteenth to improve position. STAY STRONG chased the leader racing three to four wide, failed to produce the
needed late kick. PUPPY POWER was loaded riderless then forced out at the break, settled well back inside, saved ground and passed tired foes inside.
OCTAGON broke outwardly, tracked from inside, came out a bit for the drive and weakened. COMPUTATION chased four to five wide, weakened.
CRYPTO MINER tucked in behind the leaders tracking in the second flight, went four wide on the turn, moved in once in upper stretch, failed to rally.
EASTER JIM chased five to six wide, came up empty. CAT NAMED HERCULES was not a threat. ARCH OF SWORDS was in tight at the start and shuffled
back, was not a factor.
