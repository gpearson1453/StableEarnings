Footnotes
EL POTENTE tracked leaders while three wide into backstretch, moved up briskly on same path and swept past inside rivals on the second turn, quickly
shook frere and powered away under urging before gearing down in final yards. FIREMAN DAN settled off pace while bit off the rail, stalked on two path,
came out bit around final turn then four wide exiting the bend and cleared from others to prove next best. GOLDENEYE angled off the rail around the first
turn then contested the pace outside rivals, between foes and inside winner on second turn, had no resistance for winner, drifted out some in upper stretch
and held for the show. AMERICAN REFUGEE stumbled leaving the gate, trailed early, chased two or three wide and outside runner-up in middle stages,
chased four wide on the final turn, came out further into the lane and lacked needed rally. PAPA TIGER dueled or forced the pace from the inside, gained
slim lead on the far turn, was overtaken midway on the final bend and weakened from along the rail.

just past sixteenth marker and edged away late. FUN MONEY dueled from the inside into the turn, gained advantage and edged away into the lane,
continued bit off the rail and could not stave off the winner. CHOLLY broke a step slow, chased early from the outside, remained four wide into the bend,
moved up and loomed three deep midway on the bend, remained on same path and lost contact with top pair in the drive. LOV U MEAN IT was off step
slow, rushed up while pulling, forced to check off heels of NIGHT PARTY a half-mile out, was shuffled back then chased three and four wide to the stretch
while not menacing. NIGHT PARTY got bumped leaving the gate, prompted the pace while three wide to the far turn, traveled four wide around the bend,
angled in some in upper stretch and weakened. HOT THOUGHTS broke out and bumped rival but showed early foot and contested the pace outside rival,
between turns on the turn, lost contact with leaders entering the lane, angled in some and weakened.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF MAKENA taken off the early pace and content to track leader from off the rail, moved in on that pacesetter on the turn, reached the front at
three-sixteenths marker then pulled clear under steady handling while coming in slightly late. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM quickly stepped to the front, dictated
the pace from the inside, relinquished control passing three-sixteenths pole but kept on willingly from along the rail to safely hold the place. GET HER
NUMBER brushed with inside rival shortly after the start, settled well off the pace, chased four wide into the stretch, continued well off the rail through the
lane and just lasted for third. HOWBEIT raced four wide into the turn, came in slightly around the turn, chased in two path into the stretch, came out some
approaching the wire and just missed getting up for the show. HOLDEN THE LUTE was off a step slow, tracked pace from the inside, continued prominently
from along the rail around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and weakened from between rivals. CLEM LABINE bumped with outside rival early, settled
off the leaders and bit off the rail, saved ground chasing the pace into the stretch, swung out three wide in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
I DON'T GET IT settled off the pace while in two path early, advanced three wide, loomed three deep then engaged leader while four across, poked his
nose in front at eighth marker, inched ahead and fended off inside rival late. YELLOW BRICK was fractious in the gate, broke a step slow and got bumped,
chased two wide into backstretch, continued inside, found clear path along the rail in upper stretch, challenged passing eighth pole, battled to the wire but
could not collar the winner late. DAZZLEMESILVER attended the pace while outside lead into and through the backstretch, moved up between rivals and
bid three wide into the lane but weakened in late stages. EXCEL CALCULATOR reserved early from the inside then shifted off the rail, moved up three
wide, loomed four then five wide into the stretch but flattened in the drive. CASTLE ISLAND quickly stepped to the front, set pace under pressure from the
inside, tipped out to two path into the lane, was overtaken and weakened in the final sixteenth. BIG HAT WILLIE was close up from the inside, stalked the
pace while saving ground, came three wide into the stretch and lacked needed rally. RIVERBOAT RICHIE hesitated slightly and was off behind the field,
raced three wide in the middle stages then four wide, was asked for more around the final turn and also weakened.

Footnotes
A MO REAY forwardly placed early, tracked three wide into and through the backstretch, asked for more around the final turn, came four wide into the
stretch, responded to strong handling through the drive, whittled gap on FUN TO DREAM in the final sixteenth and finally collared that rival in the final
strides. FUN TO DREAM prompted the early pace outside leader into backstretch, was tugging some when pulled alongside that rival nearing second bend,
moved to the front early on that turn, edged away while three wide entering the stretch, dug in late when challenged but could not stave off the winner in the
final yards. MIDNIGHT MEMORIES unhurried early from the inside, remained along the rail, dropped back bit into and on the last turn, found seam along
the fence inside GANADORA then re-rallied under urging and finished strongly. DESERT DAWN reserved early while four wide, chased three wide,
continued outside into the second bend, advanced around that turn, was caught five then six wide into the stretch but flattened bit in the late stages.
KIRSTENBOSCH reserved along the rail, chased inside, angled out three then four wide around the last turn, continued outside in the lane and was no late
threat. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE was pulling a bit early while between rivals, continued on same path down the backstretch, was three wide around the second
turn and lacked late response. PAULINE'S PEARL settled bit off the rail, chased on two path or between rivals, came out bit around the last turn and into the
stretch and failed to reach contention. GANADORA quickly stepped to the front, set pace while under pressure from FUN TO DREAM, relinquished control
early on the second turn, dropped back later on that bend and faded from the inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
VERY SCARY set pace under pressure from the inside, disposed of rival around the second turn, came in slightly in the stretch and scored convincingly
while stretching margin and under light hand pressure. POP POP'S DREAM settled off the pace and off the rail, chased three wide on the final turn, came
out further entering the stretch and cleared away from foes to prove second best. BARRISTER'S RIDE unhurried while taken to the rail into first turn,
remained inside to the stretch, came out under left hand urging in upper stretch and weakened. IMPLOSION pressured the pacesetter into and through the
middle stages, dropped back around the second turn and faded in the stretch.
