Footnotes
OKUDAH was sent to the lead, controlled the pace from the inside, drew off on cue. F J'S GEM stalked from the four path, was asked after the half mile pole
while still wide, chased the leader through the turn from the outside, closed well. VALIANT DEFENDER was slow into stride early, allowed the field many
strides, decided to run at the half, saved ground and closed with a vengeance, drifted out in the stretch and continued to build momentum but ran out of
time. ANICLUDE was off a step slow settled along the rail well off the pace, was cued after the three eighths pole, started to gain ground, but had no rally.
MAX PANDOWDY stalked the early leader from the three path, resisted rating for the first half mile, settled in hands and faded late. BOSSHOG THEM
DUKES settled in hands along the rail early, moved up while saving ground to a stalking position, was cued at the quarter pole, but hung on his left lead and
faded.

Footnotes
MAGICAL STARDUST set the pace in the two path, rated well in hand as a group of outer foes applied pressure entering the backstretch, dueled with
ZEEROCK around the far turn, was briefly headed turning for home, yet reclaimed an advantage entering the lane, shook clear leaving the quarter pole, and
held sway before lasting safely late. BEAUTIFULANDWILD trailed along the inside, shifted out around the far turn, spun into the lane in the seven path, and
rallied willingly outside of foes to bid for place in the final sixteenth, and gained that position lat. LAKE RUNNER stalked along the inside, but failed to
sustain forward position entering the backstretch, pursued from off of the pace two wide around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, stayed
on to gain place approaching the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer rival for that position late. STAR'S DREAM tracked in the four path, tugged
between horses approaching the backstretch to vie three wide and among foes at the three quarter pole, sustained vying position two wide approaching the
far turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner and outer counterparts with three furlongs to go, and faded. I DONT KNOW EITHER tracked two wide,
retreated to the rear three wide and outside of foes around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and surpassed tired ones.
PSEUDOSCIENCE pressed the pace in the three path and between horses, but failed to keep pace among rivals despite rider's urging at the five furlongs
pole, chased from off of the pace along the inside around the far turn, and faded. ZEEROCK broke a step slow while last away, lacked speed in the five path
before tugging outside of foes approaching the backstretch, pressed four wide soon after, tucked to the three path while dueling outside of the eventual
winner entering the far turn, led narrowly and briefly turning for home, but caved leaving the quarter pole, and weakened on his left lead.

through out the turn from the three path, battled in the stretch, was picked up in the lane and hand rode in the bridle, was able to edge clear and get up for
the win. MARKSWOMAN vied for the early lead and was able to take the rail, was in company with another rival as the top pair, took advantage of the turns
and had the lead briefly was first into the stretch, but was quicky caught on even ground, battled gamely until deep in the stretch and tired late. FROSTY
DIVA settled into stride from the three path, comfortably followed the early speed into the turn, angled out a bit at the quarter pole, had her sights on the
winner and was with in striking distance but didn't finish. CHROME RACER raced up to the top pair from the outside, settled right off the pace, raced wide
through the turn and into the stretch and flattened out late. ZIGGZAPPA was off a step slow. was allowed to gather herself advanced along with in herself,

Footnotes
BALLINONABUDJET saved ground to a stalking position around the first turn, pursued from the two path down the backstretch, failed to secure position two
wide and between the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, checked mildly turning for home, chased while searching for racing room in upper stretch, shifted
outside of the embattled leading pair with multiple lengths to find in midstretch, yet offered a determined late kick to reel in those rivals in the shadow of the
wire. WISE VERDICT chased three wide and between horses around the first turn, got floated four wide at the five furlong pole, moved forward and crossed
over slightly o press the top pair into the far turn, got floated to the four path while ranging up turning for home, bid entering the lane, dueled with an inner
game SILVER GALAXY into deep stretch, but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. SILVER GALAXY set the pace along the inside, showed the way
from a group of outer bidder around the far turn, dug in to resist WISE VERDICT's challenge entering the lane, dueled gamely thereafter while headed, but
failed to regain even terms, and was outkicked late. UNANIMOUSLY laid off of the pace three to four wide, floated five wide down the backstretch, then six
wide entering the lane, and moved up. BAYOU JAM tracked two wide and between horses, shifted outside of the top pair at the five furlong pole, but
checked once outmoved by an outer presser into the far turn, shifted out five wide while pursuing between horses in upper stretch, and failed to menace.
LIKE MIKE stalked four wide, moved forward to prompt outside of the leader entering the backstretch, but gave way between horses after being floated
three wide turning for home.

for the drive, where she drew off easily . HAMMERDONHAPPINESS raced from the outside and off the pace, gained ground from the four path through the
turn was angled out in the stretch, closed, brought out a second time to avoid a foe while still closing, up for second. FEARLESS KRISTIE lost her rider
while being reluctant to load, was caught in between an outside foe and an inside foe, who both broke in a manner to put FEARLESS KRISTIE in tight right

Footnotes
SWOT ANALYSIS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of sternly pressing foes through a hot pace down the backstretch, disposed of those rivals with five
sixteenths to go, held sway and maintained a wide margin through midstretch, then lasted late from an outer quickly-charging challenger. LANGS DAY
broke half a step slow, spotted the leaders multiple lengths down the backstretch to take advantage of the fast pace, trailed along the inside, altered course
to the six path and between horses nearing the furlong grounds, then surged in hopes of reeling in the clear leader late, but just came up short. MIKE J
broke a touch outwardly, vied for the lead two wide and between horses through snappy fractions, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart while
turning for home in the three path, kept on while hanging on his left lead through the lane, but lost place to an outer rallying rival in the final sixteenth. OVA
CHARGED broke outwardly multiple paths at the start, prompted the leading pair and forced a quick pace down the backstretch, but took the turn in the five
path, yielded to her inner counterparts turning for home, and tired. WISE ANCHOR lacked speed three wide, came into the lane in the five path, but was
floated outwardly by inner foes nearing the furlong grounds, and lacked a bid. FIESTY FIST tracked the dueling trio from the two path, took the turn two wide
while further off of the pace, altered to the fie path leaving the three sixteenths pole, and offered no rally. FATHER GOOSE saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
MISTER MMMMM tracked two wide, tipped out to the four path to take aim on a newly leading MY PAL MATTIE, changed leads at the three sixteenths
pole, drove past that foe at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. TWIRLING ROSES was brushed by rivals on both sides before checking out of crowded
quarters in the opening stages, raced at the rear in the two path, rallied in the four path in upper stretch, surged between horses with a strong kick in the
final furlong, and reached place at the wire. ROBO saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail to bid for place in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked
at the wire. MY PAL MATTIE dueled for the lead three to two wide approaching the turn, wrestled an advantage entering the lane, but offered little
resistance to the eventual winner's bid while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, then got outkicked for place by rivals on both sides in the
closing stages. SPECTROLITE laid close up along the inside, stalked around the turn, shifted out many paths in upper stretch, and lacked a rally while
slightly giving way. SIERRA HOTEL bobbled at the start, trailed in the three path, and made little impact. SIGN OF WAR dueled between horses early on,
cleared an inner foe into the turn as his outer counterpart sustained vying pressure, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
CHROMPTON stalked along the inside, smoothly split foes while tipping off of the rail entering the lane, gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole,
and drove clear at the furlong grounds. REVERENT prompted the pace four wide, vied around the turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch
while hanging on his left lead, and held place from an outer rival late. GTUONE BUCK trailed in the three to four paths around the turn, fanned to the seven
path entering the lane, rallied willingly outside of foes in the final furlong, but was fended off for place late. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW tracked from the
three path, came into the lane in the five path before being floated out a path soon after, and lacked a bid. CHIEFWEAVE vied for the lead inside of a trio of
foes, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, and faded through the final sixteenth. BLUE RIDGE RED vied for the lead two wide and
between horses, but weakened entering the lane. CALL ME COLLECT dueled for the lead three wide and among foes, but yielded to those foes entering
the lane, shifted out at the quarter pole, and weakened.
