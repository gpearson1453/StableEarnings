Footnotes
MAY MAYS CASTLE settled in the three and four paths of the opening turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and took over between horses past
the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn, widened at the rail, was kept alert to deep stretch then taken in hand late yards. APPEALING ROAD
rated just off the pace in the four and five paths on the first turn, closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole but was met past the five sixteenths,
rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS stalked the earlier pace two deep, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. GOLDEN SALLY rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled out toward the eighth pole but showed little in the lane. WAGER WORTHY stalked three wide on the
first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. PHILMARY CASTLE set the early pace inside, was met approaching
the three eighths pole and faded past the five sixteenths. HOOK THE CHAIN saved ground on the first turn, eased outward past the half mile pole but
showed little response.

BOBBYS CASE LOAD chased through the backstretch and raced close in the five path on the turn, dueled from the head of the lane and took over later
yards. JUST A FLIRT chased the pace, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. WINDSOR'S STAR
pressured the pace inside and took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the
rail on the turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. KING KJARTAN raced with the pace while tapering toward the inside, dueled at even terms
from the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. DE'S CASTLE gave
chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly to pass rivals. ALLEGHENY HERO chased inside, raced off the rail on the turn, lacked an
opening and altered course near mid-stretch and finished well. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, eased outward into the
lane then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. CURB THAT TIGER chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the
lane. JUBAY gave chase outside and never factored. SWEET T gave early chase outside then saved some ground on the turn. The remainder of tonights'
card was cancelled due to inclement weather and poor track conditions.
