Footnotes
APACHE took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, pressed around the turn, bid entering the lane, cleared at the furlong
grounds, and held off an outer challenger late. FRISCO LINE settled at the rear two wide, fanned four wide in upper stretch, rallied with a clear APACHE to
catch in the final furlong, but was fended off late. GRAND HIDEAWAY broke out and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival, got
headed at the quarter pole, gave way in the final furlong, and held show between horses late. SAMURAI SAINT raced at the rear along the inside, and
improved. RAF was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, vied for the lead two wide, led turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. CAPTAIN MAD JACK laid off of the pace in the three path, floated to the six
path entering the lane, and made little impact. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) shied and steadied from an inner rival soon after the start, tracked the top trio
from the two path, chased them entering the lane, and faded. HIDING THE BRICK lacked speed in the five path, bore out to the eight path nearing the lane,
and tired.

THREE MILE LIMIT dueled for the lead along the inside, drew clear turning for home, and held sway. MR CLINE chased the top pair from the four path,
sustained a grinding charge through the lane, but was only second best. HESTON laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, gained show from an
outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, and held that position late. SONGWRITER lacked speed three wide, and moved up. SENSE SHINES broke half a
beat slow, dueled for the lead outside of a rival while remaining a path away from that foe, but gave way turning for home, and weakened between horses in
the late stages. KOBE BEACH lagged behind in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact while hanging on his left
lead. MAQAMAT chased from midpack along the inside, and weakened.

OFF THE CHARTS settle far back along the inside, moved up outside of foes down teh backstretch, pursued the top flight while tucking from the five path to
the two path entering the lane, sustained a rail chare to bid in the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. HONEYCOMB tugged clear around the first turn, met a
bid turning for home, repelled that foe in upper stretch, but was caught by an inner rival in the late stages, and saved place. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER tracked
from midpack four wide, was urged to chase the top trio around the far turn, sustained a grind while on her left lead, and missed place. IF YOU PLEASE
stalked in the three path, was urged to bid two wide around the far turn, bid turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch. HALAGA was hung in the five
path around the first turn, tracked three wide around the far turn, but only managed to chase evenly. LUMINIST trailed two wide, the took the far turn in the
four path, and moved up. SPIRITCATCHER raced at the rear three wide, improved in the five to six paths around the far turn, yet failed to threaten
thereafter. FOXY DIVA failed to factor two wide. LONG BLACK VEIL pursued from midpack along the inside, and faded. DRE ME LESS stalked in the two
path, but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
KILMOREY trailed, gained in the six to seven paths while circling inner rivals around the turn, then sustained her charge while hanging on her left lead, and
reeled in the leader late. ALLINTHECALL stalked four wide, vied outside of a pair of foes from the four path around the turn, led entering the lane, held sway
through midstretch, but was caught by an outer bidder late. SHACKLED BY LUST vied for the lead two wide, tucked from the four path to the three path
while sparring between horses into the turn, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart entering the lane, fought on, but was bested. URBAN COWGIRL set
the pace inside of a pair of vying foes around the turn, but steadily yielded. CHICAGO TYPHOON raced forwardly two wide and between horses, then
chased the main group while holding a minor reward. MIDNIGHT MEGHAN raced far back in the five path, and moved up in the seven path in midstretch.
VIVI BRASS brushed the gate upon leaving it, lacked speed in the five path, and failed to factor. OBRIGADA laid off of the pace along the inside, but
retreated entering the turn. CINDERELLA STORY raced far back in the two path, but was shuffled behind a tiring foe at the three furlong pole. TEXAS
PRINCESS chased along the inside and weakened. RECITE was brushed by an outer rival at the start, and got outrun in the two to three paths.
SEVENTEENSEVITYSIX broke in, stalked three wide and between horses, but weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
CHANTRY FLATS set the pace from the outset, raced off the rail into the lane then drew clear late in the stretch under a brisk drive. RONDURE raced back
early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung in the late stages. BEAR OAK chased the pace early, raced in the three path
into the lane, made a bid in the stretch near the rail but weakened late in the drive. TARTUFO was bumped while between horses into the first turn, raced in
the six path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. BE HERE was well placed early while near the rail, stayed on the inside entering the lane and
flattened out late in the stretch drive. HILLIARD raced in the six path into the lane and improved position down the lane. COOL RAGS was never a threat.
BEAVER HAT tracked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and faded in the stretch run. VIOLENT CITY stalked the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane and empty late in the drive. FLAGS UP was never a factor. EL AHIJADO was through early.

early on, was in the three path into the lane and improved position down the lane. CRYSTAL SNOW tracked the pace early on three wide, was in the three
path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. LADY LOVE ME was never a factor. CORTADO was done early. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE was bumped at
