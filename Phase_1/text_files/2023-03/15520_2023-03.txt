VANCOUGAR tracked three deep then three wide on the turn, bid four deep in upper stretch, took over with a furlong remaining and inched away from the
runner-up. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) stalked two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend, bid between rivals in upper stretch but got
outkicked by the winner. BOLT SUPREMACY took a light bump from outside at the start, bumped with same rival crossing the dirt early, trailed into the turn,
angled out and raced four deep into the lane, put in a late run and gained the show. ACQUIRED CLASS stalked on the inside into the turn, got put in tight
along the rail around the bend, looked for room behind rivals in upper stretch, gained a clear path and kept on to earn a minor award. HABEAS set the pace
under pressure from DON CORLEONE early, inched away from that rival into the turn, led along the rail into the stretch, lost command outside the eighth
pole and weakened. DON CORLEONE showed early speed and pressure HABEAS in the early going, chased that rival in the two path through the turn and
three deep in upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. YOGI BOY stumbled and bumped inner rival leaving the gate, bumped again crossing
the dirt, ran up on heels up the backstretch, got boxed in on the turn, chased two wide into the drive, altered out from behind DON CORELONE in the
stretch and was ridden out. SAN ANTON (IRE) was off slow to begin, traveled three wide outside foes on the bend and weakened.

BUTKUS well placed behind the speed battle up front, raced two wide then along the inside on the turn, moved off the fence to launch a bid with a furlong
remaining, quickly took over in midstretch and drew away. STRIKE THAT bobbled leaving the gate, went up to vie for the lead from inside, cleared briefly at
the top of the stretch but was soon challenged by BUTKUS at the eighth pole, failed to offer much resistance and relinquished the lead midstretch but
stayed on for a clear second. HANDSOME GARY chased widest early then went up to vie five deep, fought four deep into the stretch, lost touch with the
leader at the top of the lane and churned on to hold the show. CAJUN TREASURE off alertly in the beginning and went to the front, vied between rivals up
the backstretch, fought to the quarter pole, then weakened in the lane. ITALIANO raced up close outside rivals then fought four deep for the lead, vied three
deep past the five-sixteenths pole, could not go on with the STRIKE that into the stretch and weakened in the drive. JACKS OUTLAW vied three deep

XMAS SURPRISE dropped back and angled inside then moved into range, saved ground under a patient ride on the turn, roused entering the stretch,
tipped outside the leader and drew alongside, put a head in front at the eighth pole and drove clear. SECRETS TOLD sped to the front from inside,
maintained a clear lead through the turn, challenged by the winner in upper stretch, was overtaken at the eight pole and stayed on to hold second.
UNBRIDLED MARY broke alertly, got crowded a bit between rivals then settled in a stalking position off the rail, rounded the bend two wide, tipped at the
top of the stretch and kept on willingly in deep stretch but could not get up for second. PAMMY'S READY bumped with LADY GWEN leaving the gate, was
closest in pursuit off the rail, chased two wide through the turn and lacked the needed response in the drive. LADY GWEN bumped with inner rival at the
start, trailed three wide into the turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and weakened.

A LITTLE BIT CRAZY set the pace inside SUGAR SUGAR early on, inched away on the backstretch, challenged early on the far turn before clearing again
from SUGAR SUGAR around the bend, responded when tested from both sides in the final furlong and held gamely. HOT ROD MAMA was reserved in the
early going along the inside, closed in through the far turn while continuing to save ground, rallied inside the top pair and headed A LITTLE BIT CRAZY
outside the sixteenth pole, took a bad step late and finished gamely to the wire. SUGAR SUGAR pressed the pace from outside early, lost contact with the
leader up the backstretch, challenged into the far turn but lost touch with the leader past the eighth pole, launched another bid three wide into the lane,
fought to the sixteenth and faltered. PRESTIGIOUS bobbled leaving the gate, chased four deep around the first turn, lost ground in the middle stages,
dropped back to last while four wide on the second bend and failed to rally. SUPERCENTS broke a step slow, chased three deep to the far turn, continued
three wide around the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
SHEZMISBEHAVING was off slow to start, unhurried three wide early, lacked room at the three-eighths pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, drew
alongside the top pair in the final furlong and drove clear. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE brushed the gate, took back early and trailed inside, moved out in the
middle stages, rallied four wide on the far turn, vied four deep with a quarter mile remaining, took a short lead while drifting in and bumping LOVE OUR
FAMILY in upper stretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and held the place. CANDY ON TOP broke well then settled in the two path outside a rival,
found traffic on the far turn and steered to the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. LOVE OUR FAMILY showed keen early
foot then chased in the two path, moved up to apply pressure from outside, got bumped by DEL MAR WOMAN three times midway around the far turn,
fought three deep late on the bend, got bumped from outside in upper stretch, battled to the sixteenth pole and faltered. ELEGANCE CODE stalked from
inside early, launched a bid from the fence at the five-sixteenth pole, vied with outer rivals to the stretch and flattened in the lane. YVETT'S SURPRISE
steadied and pulled hard early, settled inside off the pace, trailed while angling four wide leaving the far turn and could not threaten. TAPIT ROCKS pulled
and steadied behind the top pair prior to the first turn, stalked between rivals early, outside a foe into the far turn, got blocked behind trouble rivals and
checked at the quarter pole and could not rally once in the clear. DEL MAR WOMAN dueled early from inside then took control from LOVE OUR FAMILY,
got pressured from that rival in the middle stages, drifted out and bumped repeatedly midway on the far turn and faded down the lane. CEE MINUS stalked
three deep early on, raced in mid-pack outside a rival into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and weakened.

SHE'S RESILIENT broke out a bit to bother CORNELIA FORT, showed speed from inside to take the front with NIGHT PARTY to the outside, inched away
on the turn, shifted two wide into the stretch and was challenged by HIALEASH HOTTIE, lugged out from the left hand in upper stretch, switched to
right-handed urging in the final furlong while holding a short lead and gamely prevailed. HIALEAH HOTTIE chased three deep early, bid three wide into the
stretch, got floated out by SHE'S RESILIENT in upper stretch, stayed on gamely through furlong grounds but could not get by. CORNELIA FORT broke a
step slow and was bothered from inside, chased outside a rival at the back into the turn, angled in while inching closer around the bend and showed a mild
response to earn the show honors. THE REIGN SONG settled on the inside, got boxed in entering the turn, lost ground and had to angle out around the
bend, came four wide into the drive and kept on to improve position. NIGHT PARTY raced up close then applied pressure to the outside. IT'S SAUL RIGHT
was off a bit slow in the beginning, chased on the inside under coaxing around the bend, tipped two wide nearing the stretch and weakened. THERE WAS A
RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ABOARD HIALEAH HOTTIE AGAINST SHE'S RESILIENT ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INOVLING THE SAME MATTER AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE'S
RESILIENT DID LUG OUT IN UPPER STRETCH IT DID NOT COST HILEAH HOTTIE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

FAST AND SHINY set the pace outside TEENA ELLA early, cleared that rival and crossed over to the inside into the turn, came off the rail crossing the dirt
and showed the way into the lane, put to right-handed urging in upper stretch and held well over the runner-up. TEENA ELLA pressed from inside early then
ceded command nearing the turn, shifted to the two path to give chase from outside, came out crossing the dirt, took aim in the final furlong, drew alongside
FAST AND SHINY late but ran out of time. MANHATTAN JUNGLE (IRE) was off alertly from inside, stalked the top pair early, traveled two wide around the
turn, had to alter out from behind TEENA ELLA crossing the dirt, continued to give chase within range into the final furlong, could not summon the needed
late kick and held the show. BROADWAY GIRLS tracked from inside around the turn, drifted out crossing surfaces and failed to respond when called upon.
RAGTIME ROSE settled off the pace, rounded the bend two to three wide, drifted out over the dirt and could not rally. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT ALTHOUGH TEENA ELLA DUCKED OUT CROSSING THE DIRT IT DID NOT COST MANHATTAN
JUNGLE (IRE) A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING. HALF-MILE FRACTION HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
KRISTI'S TIGER settled off the pace near the inside, tipped out and closed in on the leader on the turn, drew alongside and quickly took over at the quarter
pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and remained comfortably in front to the wire. BOWL OF CHERRIES trailed early and moved off the rail, tipped four wide
into the turn, remained wide into the stretch, finished determinedly in the drive, could not threaten the winner but was clearly second best. MISS FIA was
fractious in the gate, got floated into inner rival early, chased four deep between rivals, continued between on the turn then angled down to the two path,
steered out in the lane and churned on to gain the show. ISSA COURT was rank momentarily then drifted in early, chased five deep up the backstretch,
rounded the bend five then four wide and weakened down the lane. PROFESSORS' PRIDE got bumped lightly leaving the gate, steadied briefly behind the
leader early, chased between rivals then got shuffled past the three-eighths pole, angled to the inside and lacked a rally. SCATCHMEJAMIN fractious in the
gate, sprinted clear and crossed over to the inside, held a comfortable lead into the turn, carried a diminishing lead to the five-sixteenths pole, lost command
at the quarter pole and gave way. LADYWEARSTHERING bumped leaving the gate and got bumped again early, raced between rivals then got shuffled
back into the turn, dropped back around the bend, trailed three wide into the drive, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
THIRTY FOUR COUPE prominent early then allowed BELMONT BILL to take the front, switched to the outside leaving the first turn, took aim two wide into
the stretch, drew alongside the leader and dueled down the lane, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and proved best in the end. BELMONT BILL showed
speed outside a pair of rivals then cleared and crossed over early, kicked away from THIRTY FOUR COUPE on the backstretch, led clear through the far
turn and into the stretch, met the challenge from THIRTY FOUR COUPE in the stretch and yielded grudgingly. UPRIGHT showed speed between rivals
early then ceded command crossing the finish line for the first time, tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly to regain
the show honors. THE KEY IS UNITY got brushed from inside at the start, chased between rivals, three then two wide on the first turn, move inside on the
backstretch, tipped two wide around the far turn, moved out further in the drive and got edged for the show. SHADOW CREEK (IRE) was reserved in the
early going on the inside, stayed along the fence through the far turn, raced a bit off the rail into the drive, moved out in the stretch and failed to threaten.
CHURCHMEISTER was a bit rank in the beginning while losing his path, trailed on the inside into the first turn, got blocked through the second turn, moved
out to a clear path and kept on to improve placings. ANTICIPATED sat off the pace two wide early then between rivals, saved ground on the inside around
the far turn and lacked a rally. DEEP RIVER brushed outer rival at the start, checked between rivals then pulled early in the three path, trailed four wide into
the far turn, moved into the three path around that bend, angled out in the drive and failed to make an impact. TENTH STREET DON was off a bit slow in
the beginning, chased three, four, then five wide around the first turn, chased four deep up the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, drifted in and
failed to menace. DONTTESTYOURLUCK stumbled at the start, chased three to four wide off the pace, got blocked past the three-eighths pole, raced three
deep at the quarter pole, two wide into the stretch and failed to rally. REIGN OVER ME pulled a bit when reserved near the inside, moved into the two path
on the clubhouse turn, angled out to the five path around the second bend and was not a factor. TIZACRAFTYMINISTER climbed in the early stages,
chased outside a rival into the far turn, started to climb again on the far turn and dropped back, then faded in the drive. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION
THE THREE-QUARTER AND SEVEN-EIGHTHS FRACTIONS WERE HAND-TIMED.
