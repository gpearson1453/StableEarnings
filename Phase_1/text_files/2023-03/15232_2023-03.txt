Footnotes
DESPITE ODDS brushed with DR RAGS leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced two wide leaving the turn, bid for the
lead outside JEBSTER approaching the eighth pole, dueled with that one and prevailed in an extended drive. JEBSTER sprinted clear in hand mid way
down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dueled the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. SUPERSTITIEUX , three wide around the turn, failed
to rally in an even effort. DR RAGS brushed with the winner at the start, raced in the two path on the turn and failed to be a factor. SCORCHED BY FIRE
raced along the inner rail throughout and trailed.

Footnotes
ANTIPOISON prompted the pace three to four wide outside the leader, moved up under a ride to challenge mid turn, had that initial bid denied, kept on
doggedly under right handed pressure to re engage past in mid stretch, wrested command soon past the sixteenth pole and drew clear. PEPE AND
HEYWOOD sped clear early, set a rated pace off the rail, turned away the first threat from ANTIPOISON nearing the quarter pole, was roused back clear in
upper stretch, duck back in when taken on again in mid stretch, dueled then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. HONOR THE FLEET rushed up
between rivals early and gained a forward spot, stalked to the inside of the winner, eased back and shifted out for the run around the turn, circled five wide
under asking into the stretch and continued on with effort. TOM TERRIFIC , pulled his way along behind rivals heading to the five eigthhs, angled out,
chased five wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. VINNY sped up to contention leaving the chute, saved ground chasing the leaders, remained a
presence to mid stretch then faded. SHOULDA HAD IT , off the pace while saving some ground, eased out for the drive but lacked a bid. JIMMY THE KID ,
off several lengths behind the field after having his head turned when the gates sprung, was taken well wide soon after, circled six wide into the stretch but
failed to recover. OUR HOISTED MAST , four wide in range heading to the half mile marker, failed to kick on soon after and retreated between foes.

CRIMSON , away in good order, rated off the leaders leaving the chute and stalked, edged up into the far turn, leaned in a bit and bumped with SWEET
SHUGS when working three wide between runners in upper stretch, straightened and bid to the inside of the leader a sixteenth late, spurted clear under
right handed asks in mid stretch then steadily widened while kept to task. BROOKLYN GIRL broke inward and a bit sluggishly, lagged well back early on,
saved ground into the lane, moved up towards the rail leaving mid stretch and kept on willingly to be second best. SOLVING PROGRESS , a bit tough to
settle heading to the five eighths, edged up off the rail mid turn, shifted out for the final turn and churned on. SIX THE HARD WAY stalked three to four wide,
moved up to engage from the outside mid turn, moved clear and was guided four wide into the lane, failed to resist the inside bid from the winner and gave
way. MISS ANTIETAM edged up while saving ground past the five eighths, checked when in tight near the turn, regrouped and angled out, made a
menacing run four wide into the stretch, gave willing chase past the three sixteenths then faded. BOUNTY KILLAH lagged back, raced four wide mid turn
and failed to menace. SWEET SHUGS pulled her way clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined mid turn, ceded soon after, was bumped in
upper stretch, drifted out and tired. There was a stewards inquiry into the run into the turn as well as an objection by the rider of MISS ANTIETAM against
the winner for alleged interference into the turn. No action was taken.

A GIRL NAMED JAC tracked inside, shifted out past the three sixteenths and was put to a right handed asks, switched back to her correct lead near the
sixteenth marker, closed determinedly and surged outside THAT'S SOME KISS to prove best. THAT'S SOME KISS prompted the two to three wide outside
the leader, moved to engage after a half mile, took over in upper stretch, was roused clear in mid stretch, dug in when collared leaving the sixteenth pole
then ceded grudgingly through the final yards. LA FAMILIA sped to the front, set a rated pace about two wide, was joined near the quarter pole, fought on
past mid stretch and faded very late. CHARMING WAY was steadied back off foes soon after the break, circled four wide with a bit of run into the stretch but
failed to follow through in the final three sixteenths. FLASHY CHARGE broke a step slow, was steadied along early while saving ground, eased out and
lacked a bid.

ICESTORMING saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, found room along the inner rail to take command inside horses approaching the eighth pole
then drew off under steady urging. NAUGHTY NAN , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and weakened in
the drive. AUNT BERRA bore out leaving the starting gate, set the pace in the two path around the turn and gave way through the stretch run. OUT OF
LUCK , forced out leaving the starting gate, steadied on the heels of STEPHANIE MY LOVE entering the turn, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. LADY LANCER raced in the two path on the turn and was not a threat. IMAGINETHEODDS , three wide on
the turn, weakened. STEPHANIE MY LOVE drifted out entering the turn, was very wide approaching the stretch and was never a factor. PRINCESS LEXI
hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
IRISH CORK broke a step slow, recovered and edged up outside to join PLOT THE DOTS around the first turn, relaxed prompting the pace, moved to near
even terms after six furlongs, responded when set down and kicked clear three wide in upper stretch, kept on under right handed asks leaving mid stretch
and held firm. EXCELLORATOR , covered up while saving ground and just off the pace, was pushed along to maintain position leaving the three eighths,
swung out for room entering the lane, straightened away to be about four wide, ranged up while on his left lead to loom in mid stretch, switched over to his
correct lead a sixteenth out, continued gamely but was kept at bay. TORCH OF TRUTH , four wide the first turn, rated in range while three deep through the
backstretch run, came under a ride leaving the far turn, was fanned four wide nearing the lane and came up empty. BOBBY G rated along between rivals
and in range, failed to kick on approaching the stretch and faded. PLOT THE DOTS broke on top and secured the lead and the inside, was joined by the
winner into the first turn, set a slower pace while under pressure, dueled past the five sixteenths and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BONDED , in hand lacking room along the inner rail entering the turn, remained behind foes, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside
horses and was up approaching the finish. THTWASTHENTHISISNW set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn and in the stretch but was not quite
good enought. SMART AND FAST , three wide around the turn, chased the pace throughout. STEELE MONEY , in the two path between horses on the
turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. DART hugged the inner rail throughout, chased the pace and weakened. OROCOVIX , three
wide on the turn, was taken to the five path in mid stretch and was never a factor. HE'S ON FIRE dropped back.
