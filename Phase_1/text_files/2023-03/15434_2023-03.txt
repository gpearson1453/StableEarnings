Footnotes
LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN Broke on top and led on the rail into the first turn, handled pressure from the outside with ease, shook off challengers at the
quarter pole, drew clear on the turn, came home well in control. OJO FELIZ Travelled three wide into the first turn in the second flight, maintained position
until moving up five wide at the five-sixteenths pole, moved in the four path on the turn, vied three deep outside of rivals down the stretch, edged rivals for
place honors. CANDIED JOULE Moved three wide into the first turn pressing the lead, backed out of line of four at the seven-sixteenths, swung out to the
four path into the turn, moved to the three path on the turn, fought between horses through the stretch, evenly approaching and through the wire.
MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE Was forced four wide into the first turn, moved three wide up backstretch, cleared to the rail in the run to the stretch, battled inside
of rivals, had nothing left at the end. LUCKY CHAMP Broke a touch sluggishly and was a detached trailer, commenced fully six wide at the quarter pole in a
move that flattened out through the stretch. WITCHES DANCE Took back into the first turn along the rail in the second flight, stayed within touch up the
backstretch, asked at the quarter pole while on the rail but never improved. IGO Let an outer rival clear to the lead and switched to the two path for first turn,
pressed the leader up until the quarter pole where he presumably plummeted through the field and was not asked hard in the run home.

Footnotes
BRON AND THE BROW Hustled from his inside draw to duel inside for the lead, kept to ask up to the eighth pole when a line of three challengers came to
join, fended off the threats and opened up around the sixteenth, held off final pushes from placegetters. MANY AMBITIONS Stalked the pace four wide in
the run to the turn, sustained the widest rally in a line of four into the lane, grinded away towards the leader down the stretch, could not muster enough. A
BIT MUCH Pushed up after a slightly delayed break to duel outside of rival, tried to keep pace but was shook off by the eventual winner at the eighth pole,
re-engaged at the sixteenth and finished with interest between horses. KIND BUT SHE LIES Pressed the dueling leaders three wide up to the turn, fully
threatened in the same path at the three-sixteenths pole, backed out into the lane at the eighth pole and flattened out down the stretch. W. WHITEHOUSE
Was well outrun early and traveled far off the pace, moved into the turn in the five path, hard asked at the quarter pole, finished up well but way too
belatedly, only passed tiring. TOSSAPENNYDOWN Moved up the backstretch off the pace in the five path, called upon at the quarter pole but dropped back
and dropped out when the running got going. MEXICAN DREAM Let inner rivals go on, tucked in behind the top flight on the inside paths, fully asked at the
three-sixteenths but showed no response.

Footnotes
DRAW THE FOUL Pressed forward to dispute the lead into the first turn, opened up in a duel up the backside, drew clear at the three-sixteenths in a
dominant performance. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY Stalked in the pocket into the first turn, maintain position up backstretch, swung to the five path for the
stretch run, flew home late on the wrong lead. ROYAL JESTER Between in the first turn, backed out of top lane into the backside, moved three wide into the
turn, tried determinedly down the lane but gave way late and was caught for place. FIRST COUNT Moved three wide into the first, progressed to duel
outside for the lead, traveled in the two path at the quarter pole, had nothing left. EL CHUMELITO Missed the break, moved forward to sit between rivals in
the second flight, switched to the six path on the turn, gained mildly through the late stretch. FULL DRAW Was a touch slow to break and trailed early,
maintained position but presented a bold rail rally at the quarter pole, never really threatened beyond then. CAPTAIN RED Traveled in the five path on the
first turn, moved well out towards the outer rail into the stretch and never menaced. BLUE CHIP BETTY Was forwardly placed in the four path on the first
turn, moved two wide up the backside in the second flight, backed out at the three-eighths and was eased from the quarter pole to the wire.

Footnotes
SPEEDING STYLE Tracked inside in the second rung of runners, maintained position while ridden with confidence, swung to the six path at the
three-sixteenths pole to come and threaten, found full gear one-hundred fifty yards from home, kept finding to get up in the final jumps. DEFENSE WINS
Dueled two wide into the first turn, made full lead at the eighth pole and kept on through the stretch before being caught in the final strides. WE ALL AGREE
Sent hard from the rail draw, dueled inside of rival throughout, dug in when collared at the eighth pole but could not find enough to place better. SANTALUZ
DREAMIN Moved three wide into the first turn while stalking the lead, stayed in the same path into the second turn, switched a path further out for clean air
into the lane, ran evenly on the wrong lead through the stretch. FANTASTIC DAY Settled well off the pace two wide, did not improve until being asked at the
three-eighths pole while having the widest bid, showed far too belated headway. MINISTERSDON'TLIE Forced four wide into the first turn and had to track
off the lead, advanced up the backstretch when splitting rivals in the two path at the five-sixteenths pole, switched down to the rail at the quarter pole for a
continued rally which was mitigated by better-finishing competitors. BLUE AZUL Had no run early and traveled far off the pace along the rail, asked for more
by rider at the three-eighths but failed to improve. BOTERO Settled well off the pace in the rear and never became involved.

Footnotes
RINGS OF SATURN Broke to the lead and led inside, left the rail open up the backstretch which allowed OMACHE KID through, thwarted off that challenge
at the three-sixteenth pole and drew off to a decisive score. OMACHE KID Traveled along the rail in the second flight on the first turn, made a middle move
up the rail at the three-eighths pole to threaten for the lead, was fought off into the turn and was a clear second best in the run home. BULLY RIDE Bobbled
at the break, moved up the backstretch off the pace along the rail, advanced up the rail at the quarter pole and bested the rest. BIGGER THAN YOU Dueled
outside of rival, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, evenly in the run home. EPIC ADVENTURE Moved between in the second flight throughout, never
improved. SASSY EDIE Ran into the first turn three wide well in touch of the lead, contended to the quarter pole, gave way. BAJA BRIDGE Settled on the
inner off the pace, failed to gain traction. CURRENTLY KRAZY Ran off the pace in the four path, widest both turns, never gained.
