Footnotes
BOWS N LACE settled back behind the field while saving ground on the backstretch, then was moving up on the far turn to rally from the four path down the
stretch and was able to close the fastest to prevail in the end. NORA'S LEGACY chased the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was in a steady drive
heading into the far turn to rally from the three path in the early stretch and closed well for the place prize. PAINTBRUSH stalked the pace down the
backstretch while three wide, then vied for the lead on the far turn, shook free from the battling trio to lead the way into the stretch, but was out bid by outer
rivals and was best for third place. SHESMYBROKER lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, faded throughout the far turn,
then re bid again in the late stretch but came up empty. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then continued to
move up to vie for the lead throughout the far turn, was used up and weakened in the late stretch. HIGH VALUE TARGET chased the pace under a steady
drive down the backstretch and into the far turn to make a mild bid in the stretch then flattened out in the end. SUFFRAGETTE was unhurried early while
four wide on the backstretch, then bid on the far turn and was no threat.

JOSH'S DREAM broke inwardly at the start, then pressed the pace from the inside, settled back throughout the turn, then came out three wide to surge
down the stretch and was up just in time to prevail. WILL THE THRILL lead the way from the start and into the turn, was in a hard drive down the lane but
was caught in the late stretch and was second best. VILLAGE WAY pressed the pace from the three path into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch then
gave way in the end. LUCKY PROMISE was forced in at the start and bumped rival then chased the pace from the inside into the turn to rally in the stretch
and was closing well but it was not enough. EUROROCKSTAR was bumped by an outer rival at the start then chased the pace from the inside in the middle
of the field, bid on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. STANS HOME RUN chased the pace while four wide then made a mild bid on the turn and
