Footnotes
SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) set pace under pressure from the inside, resisted when challenged nearing the stretch, responded along the rail to regain control
and kicked cleared under strong hand urging. GIOVINAZZO pressured the pacesetter while outside that rival, moved alongside leader passing quarter
marker but could not match the winner in the drive. LASMUIGH (GB) was off a step slop then rushed up inside to gain forward position, under urging to
remain close on the turn, had rider lost his stick in upper stretch but kept on to hold show. ANTICIPATED broke in and bumped rival twice, angled over
early, chased outside rival into and around the turn, came in nearing sixteenth marker and brushed foe and finished evenly. SIPPIN WHISKEY climbed
crossing the dirt portion and settled inside, saved ground chasing the p[ace, was brushed by rival nearing sixteenth pole and lacked needed late punch.
CRYPTOHOLIC stalked from off the rail, raced three wide on the turn and four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten late./. THE SLAP chased from
between rivals then three wide early, angled inward on the turn, tipped out into the stretch and weakened. SPEED OF THE NILE bumped by outside rival
twice in opening strides, chased thrfee or four wide to the stretch, later angled over and weakened from the inside.

Footnotes
FROST ALERT broke inward but quickly recovered and sped well clear, extended cushion on the backstretch, had that lead dissolve around the final bend,
dug in when challenged entering the stretch, held sway under left hand urging and inched away late to prove best. BATUKHAN (IRE) angled out early on
the backstretch then moved up steadily, took aim three wide passing quarter marker, battled outside winner in the lane but was turned back. STORMING
CHROME was out in tight quarters in opening stride then settled off the pace, chased outside rival, also closed in on pacesetter on second turn, loomed
nearing quarter marker but failed to sustain effort in the lane. WHISKEY VISION reserved from the inside, trailed into and through the backstretch, split foes
around the final bend but did not menace. NAUGHTY NIKO saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back around the second turn and weakened in the
stretch. VALIENTE was off slow and bit awkward to be off behind the behind, raced four wide into the first turn, continued well off the rail then three wide
into the stretch and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
SEATTLE BREAKOUT tucked in behind dueling leaders down backstretch, swung out four wide for room approaching the stretch, rallied strongly from the
outside, inhaled inside rivals past sixteenth marker and surged clear. DIVINE RASCAL was hustled to the front, resisted when challenged early on the turn,
hooked up in prolonged duel with GIANT'S BRITE EYE, continued along the rail through the lane and out gamed rival for second. GIANT'S BRITE EYE
forced the early issue then engaged rival early on the turn, battled outside that foe into and through the stretch and was edged for the place. AMERICAN
CAT stalked from the outside then three wide on the turn and into the stretch, was inside winner in upper stretch, lost contact with that rival and drifted out
late. BIG SPLASH chased from the inside around the turn and into the stretch, angled out through the drive and finished willingly. QUICK INTRO broke
alertly but was taken off the pace, tracked leaders from the outside, remained four wide around the bend and weakened. DIVINE FEMININE between rivals
early, continued on two path into and around the turn and lacked needed response. DUTCH BUS reserved early, chased three deep then three wide on the
turn and made no late impact.

flattened in the late stages. VEGAN reserved early, came out and lightly bumped rival, stalked three then four wide into the stretch and weakened. LA

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT JOSTAR stumbled then bumped from both sides at the start, settled bit off the rail, moved up three wide into final bend then four wide into the
stretch, rallied under right handed urging, collared leader past sixteenth marker and edged away late. SEVEN WONDERS broke in and bumped rival,
stepped to the front early, rated on lead from the inside, edged away in upper stretch but could not stave off the winner. ALIGATO close up from along the
rail early, tracked leading pair while two wide, between foes and three wide into the stretch and gained minor award. GENERAL MATHIS bumped from both
sides in opening strides, checked off heels early then taken off the rail, chased two, three then four wide to last turn, came five wide into the stretch and
finished willingly. BEE CATCHER angled over early and stalked from the inside, hugged the rail into the lane and finished evenly from the inside. FOOTHILL
pulled his way to the front early then pressed the pacesetter from the inside, angled back out on the backstretch, came two wide into the stretch and
weakened bit. AGATINO (IRE) settled two then three wide, continued off the rail, dropped back some heading into last turn, came three wide into the lane
and weakened. AJAAWEED bumped at the start, was pulling and rank early from just off the rail, finally settled past the wire the first time, chased along the
rail and lacked any rally. BENDER dropped well back in early going, saved ground while trailing, was eventually eased and walked off.

Footnotes
STORM D'ORO broke out but quickly straightened and came in bit early, angled back out into bend, rolled past leading duo nearing quarter marker then
powered away to score convincingly under steady handling. TURQUOISE BIKINI moved up from the inside, dueled along the rail into and on the turn, had
no answer for the winner a quarter-mile out but pulled clear of rival to finish second. SWEET HELLO close up early between foes, contested the pace
outside rival into and on the turn, also had no resistance for the winner, lost contact with rival in the drive but held for third. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM showed
brief early foot then dropped back into the bend, chased outside rival around the turn, was four wide into the stretch, came in some and passed tiring rivals.
DEL MAR WOMAN chased from the inside then along the rail, continued inside but made no late impact. LA CHISPA hopped slightly in reaction to inside
rival breaking out, was close up from off the rail early, came in bit on the turn, angled back out four wide leaving the bend and weakened.
SMOKEMONTHECLIFF stumbled slightly, chased four wide to the turn then outside rival around the bend and weakened from between foes.
