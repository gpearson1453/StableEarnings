Footnotes
TWEAQUED set the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue passing the quarter pole, and opened up from the five path in upper stretch, began
to shorten stride just past the eighth pole, and just held on. MITESSE prompted the pace in the four path, was under urging in the six path going into the
lane, kept on for place, and just missed getting up for the win. SOUTH PACIFIC stalked in the five path and brushed with an outer foe near the nine
sixteenths pole, was roused midway around the turn and swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. SHE'S OUTTA HERE
chased in the two path and was coaxed into the turn, was cued right handed while floating out to the four path into the stretch, but flattened. RANSOMS
REWARD trailed along the inside and was under a ride while tipping out to the three path around the turn, shifted out to the seven path while under urging
into the stretch, but did not threaten. LADY OCEAN tracked in the six path and brushed with an inner foe near the nine sixteenths pole, was under a drive in
the four path rounding the turn, but empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
CRICKET WEST settled off the early pace inside, angled out midway around the first turn, was bumped early on the backstretch, advanced outside, bid four
wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under moderate urging. SCENIC VIEW advanced three wide around the first turn,
cleared off early on the backstretch, set the pace in the two path from there to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on well for the place.
BLONDEONAMISSION saved ground off the pace, angled out in the lane, lightly brushed KESTENNA late and was along for the show. KESTENNA (GB)
raced in range two wide, was forced out by the winner midway around the first turn, dropped back inside around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, was
lightly brushed late and lacked the needed rally. SWEET ACTRESS set the early pace along the rail, angled out and bumped MIA'S AUTHORITY into the
winner early on the backstretch, pressed the pace in the three path around the far turn and weakened in the lane. NOVELERA was outrun inside. MIA'S
AUTHORITY stalked the pace two wide, was bumped early on the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and was vanned off. A CLAIM OF FOUL
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF KESTENNA AGAINST BLONDEONAMISSION WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BENGALA JOY was in the three path around the first turn and raced prominently in the four path down the backside, was roused in three path around the
far turn and tipped out to the five path under left handed cues into the stretch, and ran on to inch past the inner pacesetter in the final strides. TREASURED
GEM set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path nearing the quarter pole and opened up slightly into the lane, and stayed on but was
caught by an outer foe late to place. LADY EMILY KATHRYN trailed in the two path, tipped out to the five path and was ridden around the far turn, got
floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on while tipping inwards for show. WRITTENINTHESTARS tracked in the four path, ranged up under
coaxing around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly. JUST MY OWN stalked in the two path, was under urging in
the three path turning into the lane, but faded. AHA MOMENT rated along the inside but never threatened. KARA AND COLLEEN raced in the two path
around the first turn and was wellback in the four path down the backside, moved up under rousing around the far turn and was in the five path at the top of
the lane, but weakened. SELDOM SEEN raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed between rivals into the far turn, but was no menace in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUIET OUT EAST stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, seized command in midstretch and drew clear under a
drive. STORMY SOUL set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch and lasted for the place. CATATUMBO raced off the pace three wide around the first
turn and five wide around the far turn, rallied outside and just missed second. WICKED GENIUS exchanged multiple light bumps with MALIBU UPROAR in
the early yards, saved ground in midpack, bid at the clear rail in upper stretch and flattened out late. RESTORED ORDER stalked the pace three and four
wide and lacked the needed rally. EXUMA (IRE) was off a step slow, saved ground off the pace and improved position inside in the lane. MY BOY BLUE
saved ground and failed to menace. MALIBU UPROAR was lightly bumped early, raced two and three wide and never threatened. CHESS'S DREAM hit the
starting gate, chased the pace four wide and faded after a half. COURTLY MANNER was outrun while racing two and three wide. RUNAWAY HARRY
pressed the pace two wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SALS DREAM GIRL brushed with an inner foe at the start and had to steady into the first turn, chased in the three path, was under rousing into the far turn
and advanced between rivals while in the four path, took aim while swinging out to the eight path into the lane, rallied past an inner duo passing the
sixteenth pole, and held off a late surging outer rival late to win. DONTMESSWITHTESS checked shortly after the start, trailed in the three path, was roused
in the four path around the far turn, got stymied slightly while looking for room passing the quarter pole and was under a drive in the four path at the top of
the lane, tipped out to the seven path in the final furlong, and ran on for place. HERINGTON ROCKET stalked in the three path, was ridden along to bid
around the far turn, had a brief lead passing the quarter pole but was quickly overtaken by an outer foe into the stretch, but fought on from the three path to
hold show. THE CLUB tracked in the four path, bid passing the quarter pole and took the lead around the five into the lane, but evened out in the final
furlong to miss minor rewards. PILLBOX brushed between foes at the start, was nudged along in midflight around the two path, cued along the inside
midway around the far turn, but flattened form the two path in the stretch. BIG BEE raced in midpack around the five path but never factored from around
the six path in the stretch. ECONOMIC HANGOVER steadied slightly around the three path into the first turn, was unhurried in the five path down the
backside, coaxed into the far turn, but never threatened from out in the seven path down the lane. ROYAL BLUSH broke out an brushed an outer foe, rated
in the two path early but was no menace. LAMASCO set the pace in the three path but gaveway along the rail rounding the far turn.

BE HERE NOW set a pressured pace in the two path, was headed near the quarter pole, battled on inside on a slight disadvantage through the stretch and
got her nose down in front on the wire. IMONRA pressed the winner in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, dueled through the lane and just
missed. HOLLYWOODLAND stalked the top two finishers while racing in the four path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held the show. OCEAN
GATEWAY raced in range two wide, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. NOTHING BUT PUMPS hit the starting gate, raced far back early,
advanced five wide around the far turn but lacked a closing bid. A J'S MEMORY chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. SHE'S MAGIC
was outrun inside. CYMBAL COURT played no factor while racing four wide. MO TOWN MADISON raced in range four wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CONTEMPORARY ART settled off the pace in the three path, moved up under a ride in the two path around the far turn and bid inside of rivals from the two
path into the stretch, took the lead into the final furlong, and held sway. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) stalked between foes in the three path, ranged up passing
the quarter pole and floated out to the seven path after a left handed cue into the lane, and ran on while tipping inwards for place. TOWSER rated in the two
path, was coaxed in the three path around the far turn, floated out to the nine path and was under left handed urging into the stretch, and kept on for show.
MARIA'S HONOR ducked outwards at the start and trailed along the inside into the backstretch, was cued along the rail into the far turn, fanned out and
was in the nine path at the top of the lane, and passed tired foes. BLUE TIMES got bumped between foes at the start, set the pace inside, was headed
turning into the stretch and tipped out to the four path, but yielded passing the eighth pole. ON ALERT raced wellback in the two path and never factored
from the five path in the stretch. IMPROVISE (FR) broke out and brushed an outer foe, was unhurried in the four path, coaxed into the far turn, but did not
threaten. WISH YOU WELL bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the two path, bid from the five path into the stretch, but gaveway.
CUSTOMER DRIVEN tracked along the inside but was no menace from the three path in the stretch. CHOCOLATEADDICTION chased in the four path but
backed up around the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS KRISTY travelled in the three path around the first turn and chased in the four path down the backside, was driven around the far turn and received a
right handed cue while tipping out to the six path at the top of the lane, rallied while tipping further out under left handed urging into the final furlong, and got
up just before the wire to win. GOODBETTERBEST set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the far turn and opened up turning into the
lane, stayed on but drifted out in the final furlong, and was nailed just before the wire to place. COCO rated inside of foes in the two path, was under a ride
midway around the far turn, and kept on inside of rivals through the stretch for show. WAND was held up off the pace in the four path, received a right
handed cue and tipped into the three path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path after a left handed cue into the lane, and finished evenly.
KITTENZEN was a bit keen around the first turn and raced prominently under a hold in the three path down the backside, was coaxed midway around the
far turn and urged right handed from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. AMOR SALVAJE stalked around the three path, was roused into the far turn
and tipped out to the five path turning into the lane, but faded. BRETON GIRL raced wellback in the three path and was never involved around the five path
in the stretch. IRISH UNION trailed throughout.
