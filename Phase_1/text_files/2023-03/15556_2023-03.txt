Footnotes
TAKE THE TWO TEN was allowed to settle early on, trailed into the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, made a sustained rally in the lane,
came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker, assumed command in deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. MIQUEAS dictated terms in
the early going, was well handled through modest fractions to the half-mile marker, was confronted by AFRICAN PRINCE nearing the quarter marker and
battled with that rival to mid-stretch, shook free inside of the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and held on in the end for
the place. SHANAGOLDEN was allowed to settle while not far back, saved ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, remained
boxed in to the furlong pole, found room inside of the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and just missed for the place, while clear of
the others for the show. AFRICAN PRINCE was forwardly placed through the backstretch run, attended to the modest fractions to the far turn, confronted
the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, battled with MIQUEAS to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. KID STOLE A KISS tracked the early
pace, mounted a three wide to come within aim on the far turn, continued that gain and vied for the lead to mid-stretch, steadied in tight quarters at the
sixteenth-marker and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) tracked the moderate early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, was roused
three wide into the stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker, took command inside of the furlong pole and drove clear under steady urging in the late
stages. DANCE LADY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions to the second turn, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the top
of the lane, vied for the lead to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong and ran on to secure the place. BIG FAME tracked the
moderate early pace, was well positioned into the far turn, raced two wide into the stretch, offered a mild late bid but lacked the needed late response and
held safely in the end for the show. MISS EVER READY was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
showed good late interest but was unable to reel in the leaders in deep stretch. LAST INNING broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate
fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

MISS IVES tracked the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command approaching the
furlong pole and was kept to task while pulling away in the final stages. ANNA'S MUSIC was prominent in the early stages while on a hold, pressed the
moderate pace to the quarter marker, could not match strides with the winner in the stretch run and outfinished GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA in deep stretch
to secure the place. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA broke alertly and dictated terms in the early stages, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, drifted out
a path in upper stretch, was not able to keep pace with MISS IVES in the final furlong and was outfinished for the place, while well clear of the rest for the
show. SURFLINE chased the early pace, raced two deep to the quarter marker and lacked a response in the stretch. DIVINE PASSAGE chased the decent
early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
LIGHT UP threw her head at the start but was away in good order, was unhurried in the early going, raced four wide into the far turn, was roused five wide
into the stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker, took command at mid-stretch, kept to task in the late stages over the stubborn runner-up and held safely
in a drive to prevail. INDIAN DANCER assumed command in the early stages and set the pace along the first turn, was well rated through moderate
fractions to the half-mile marker, raced on the left lead while under pressure nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with LIGHT UP in the final
furlong and stubbornly stayed on in deep stretch to hold for the place. REMEMBER SUE was allowed to settle early on while not far back, was well
positioned into the second turn, mounted a two wide bid into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response and held
for third in the end. GRIGORO stalked the moderate early pace, was well positioned into the second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came three
wide into the stretch and did not offer a late response. CLASS CODE was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was asked for run four wide into the stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied in the
late stages but did not offer the needed late response. NORTHERN ROSE lacked early speed, made a middle move while a bit keen nearing the half-mile
marker, saved ground into the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
RIVKA (IRE) broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was pressed into the far turn by SWEET
BLUSH, jumped a shadow nearing the three-furlong marker, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, was kept to firm urging through
the late stages and remained clear to the wire. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE was carried a bit wide into the first turn, tucked in and tracked the moderate early
pace into the backstretch run, inched closer nearing the half-mile marker, raced three wide along the far turn, lost ground to RIVKA in upper stretch, was
able to close into the winner's margin in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and bested the rest. SWEET BLUSH was prominent in the early stages,
was a bit hard to place heading into the first turn and carried out PRINCESA DEL TIGRE, remained keen while wide into the backstretch run, settled and
prompted the moderate pace to the far turn, could not keep pace in the drive and was clear for third in the end. GIANT KID was unhurried in the early going,
raced three wide into the far turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the stretch and passed tired rivals in the late stages.
ROSE ROSE ROSE chased the moderate early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, ran two wide into the far turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and weakened in the drive. SPARKLE SWEETLY was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
CANDY'S CLONE pressed the solid early pace, raced close to the pacesetter while three deep on the turn, confronted CRYSTAL PROOF nearing the
furlong marker, overtook that rival, kept to task to deep stretch and held safely over her oncoming stablemate. TAMARA MINE rated off of the solid early
pace, tracked from the second flight into the turn, advanced while three wide nearing the quarter marker, continued to gain to mid-stretch, could not reel in
her stablemate in deep stretch and was best of the rest. MY LEGAL BET lost her path then took up at the start and was away slowly, trailed heading to the
turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not catch the top two in the late stages and was up in time to
secure the show. AMANDA ROSE chased the fast early pace, advanced while four wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground while still within aim at
mid-stretch, lacked a late response in deep stretch and was outfinished for third. CRYSTAL PROOF broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a
pressured pace to the turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken at mid-stretch and faded
in the final stages. LILA AT THE BEACH was prominent in the early going, pressed the solid early pace while between runners, lost a bit of ground to the
pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. GRAZEN DEB was crowded at the start and was off
a step slowly, rushed up and chased the quick fractions from the inside, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABU DHABI was unhurried in the early running, improved position along the backstretch run, was roused three wide approaching the top of the
stretch, came within aim of the lead nearing the furlong pole, drew to even terms with MOTHER'S PRAYER nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that
foe to the final stages and determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail. MOTHER'S PRAYER was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the
moderate pace through the backstretch run, advanced to confront the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, was set down
for the drive, met the bid of PRINCE ABU DHABI inside of the furlong marker, dueled with that rival to deep stretch and was gamely bested on the wire,
while holding safely for the place. HARCYN took back off of the moderate early pace, was well positioned while saving ground into the second turn, shifted
out in upper stretch and came four wide into the drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly while on the left lead in the final stages but could not
reel in the top two and was clear of the rest for third. SMOKIN' HOT was hustled leaving the break and established the early lead, was well rated through
moderate fractions to the second turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and
gave way in the final stages. HAPPY DOES was allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, was carried out a bit by PRINCE ABU DHABI at the
five-furlong marker, trailed while three wide into the second turn, swung five wide into the drive and did not threaten in the stretch run. ROUSING JEWEL
tracked the moderate early pace, gained ground along the backstretch run, lost position while two deep on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ZAZEN broke well and was always prominent while rating kindly, saved ground through the turn then responded when asked to go through an opening to
bid for the lead near the quarter pole, gained the lead at the three-sixteenths and finished with determination to prevail. BLUE WILDCAT broke out at the
start and bumped slightly with QUEEN MOLOTOV, raced up close and four wide through the early stages, made a sweeping move on the turn while still
wide, was on the outside of a three-way battle down the stretch and finished up well only to come up a bit short. QUEEN MOLOTOV bumped at the break
and forced outward by BLUE WILD CAT, recovered quickly then showed good early speed to put some pressure on the pacesetter, backed off a into a
tracking position before forcing the issue near the three furlong marker, was going well at the top of the stretch when challenged to the inside by ZAZEN and
to the outside by BLUE WILDCAT then weakened with a furlong to run. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN broke a step slow then was outrun to the turn, kept to task
while racing three wide and was slowly making up ground in the stretch. OCTANE (BRZ) showed no speed from the gate and lagged behind the field, made
a belated rally in the stretch and managed to pass a few in the final furlong. PACIFIC ZIP got a decent break from the gate, was well placed in mid-pack
while saving ground early, began to lose ground from the half-mile pole going into the turn, was put under pressure to keep up but was unable to muster a
rally and finished one-paced. PRESKITT showed good early speed, led the field to the turn while being pressed by QUEEN MOLOTOV, had several
challengers at the quarter pole, showed no resistance, tired badly and was not persevered with late. MARILYN'S SMILE unhurried early, remained near the
rear of the field while saving ground through the turn, was asked to pick up the pace passing the three furlong pole but did not have a response and was not
pressured late.
