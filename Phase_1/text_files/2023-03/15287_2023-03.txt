Footnotes
LARRY'S ANGEL set the pace with a clear lead, led throughout and widened late under mild urging. DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT was allowed to settle early,
rallied four wide and was second best. SEEYOUINMOTOWN raced wide early, angled in stretch and was best of the rest. MY PINK BUNNY TALE chased
the winner and weakened in the stretch. OHIO LADY raced close up for a half, then faded. PRONTO CHARLI raced three wide and was no menace.
BONNIE'S BEST contended on the inside and was through after a half. LADYBUGGIN was no menace. INCREDIBLE MARINI showed little and trailed.
