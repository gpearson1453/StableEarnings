Footnotes
MR JACK led the way from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second bend in the two path and drew off in the
lane, much the best. GRAPHENE CASSOCK raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn from the three path and kept on to the wire but was no match for the winner. GINETTES ON FIRE trailed the field while saving ground through the
opening quarter of a mile, moved up to race in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and
finished evenly. FUNNY MAN raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the second turn in the four path and was not
a threat. CAJUN OCCASION raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn still in
the two path and never fired. SCHOOLMASTER (GER) raced in the two path around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the three path around the turn, dueled in the stretch
and just held for the win after drifting mildly late. STRAIGHT SHOT chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
bend from the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, dueled down the lane and narrowly missed after his rider lost the whip near the wire. LORD
BERRIER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the four path and finished evenly. SOUTH SEA hit his head hard on
the gate leaving it, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. OCEAN
RIDE tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and faded in the lane. MOONSHINE NOW
raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. PER RULING FROM THE
FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, ISLE OF SKYE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

HAD RIGHT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, launched a bid
approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear late. POSEIDONS MYTH raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the second bend, dueled in upper stretch and kept on to the finish. BLACK LIMO led the field
from the four path around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and in upper stretch,
was caught late and kept on to the wire. CALZONE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the four path
and improved position mildly in the lane. J T'S MY BOY broke through the gate prior to the race, was reloaded and raced in the two path around the first
turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and weakened from there. TAPINTOYOURBEER
saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two and
three path and flattened out in the lane. CLEAR TO CLOSE trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the far turn and was never a factor.
