Footnotes
JANISTHEBEAUTY cleared and crossed over in the early stages, showed the way inside of a pressing pair into the turn, dug in to meet her outermost
challenger's bid turning for home, shrugged her off at the furlong grounds, and shook clear. B B GUN BULLSEYE stalked three wide into the turn, moved
forward to press before bidding two wide turning for home, but was turned away in midstretch, and held place. PARAMOUR bobbled slightly at the start, laid
towards the rear along the inside early on, commenced a rally into the turn, split rivals two wide at the three furlong pole, gained between horses in the three
to four paths to claim show turning for home, but leveled off through the lane while hanging on her left lead. ASHLEY'S GIRL steadied when squeezed in
tight quarters among rivals leaving the nine sixteenths pole, pursued from midpack outside of rivals, was urged along to gain in the four to five paths around
the turn, but only managed to chase while flopping leads through the final furlong. MRS. NECAISE shifted out and brushed a foe at the nine sixteenths pole,
shared blame in causing trouble for multiple outer foes leaving that marker, tracked along the inside from the two path around the turn, faded while shifting
out turning for home, yet sustained stride in the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. TENPINS TEMPEST lunged outwardly and spotted the
leaders a pair of lengths at the start, trailed while saving ground, yet failed to factor. KATIE'S C pressed two wide and between horses into the turn, but
yielded at the five sixteenths pole, and tired. MO DIXIE DIVA was restless in the starting gate, then was pinched back while put to crowded quarters passing
the nine sixteenths pole, chased from off of the pace in the three path, and was outrun turning for home.

Footnotes
TAPISTAR broke half a step behind and ended up getting pinched back while staying on his feet, was able to regather himself and travel up the on his own
to the lead, he controlled the race there after and drew away without being contested. GOLDUSTER broke out and bumped with another foe, quickly shot to
the front and took the lead, led from the two path for a few furlongs, was challenged by a rival coming up the rail, let that rival go and stalked through the
turn, was cued at the quarter pole but had no answer for the leader but was second best. PREMIUM broke inward and bumped within another rival, was
quickly corrected, was allowed to stay off the pace and settle in hands, stayed in the three path down the backside was gaining ground and moving up
through out the turn, was put to task at the quarter pole and out finished the rest. BOXSTER vied for the early lead, smartly settled in the middle of the field,
from the fence, continued to save ground around the turn and then tired in the lane. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT broke slow, raced from the five path near the
back of the field, angled over to the rail at the three eighths pole, save ground and raced up the rail in the stretch but had no rally.

Footnotes
DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE sped clear early on, met a mild outer challenge whilst taking the far turn in the two path, repelled that rival and shook free in upper
stretch, but tired in the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead, and desperately lasted to the wire. JEFFROW broke just over a length slow, settled off
of the pace along the inside, progressed two wide and between horses around the far turn before fanning to the four, then five, path in upper stretch, then
sustained a grinding charge while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong, produced a late bid in hopes of reeling in the tiring leader on the wire, but
narrowly came up short. QUARTER RAT stalked the clear leader from the two path, ranged up in the three path to bid outside of that one around the far
turn, but was turned away while subtly drifting out in upper stretch, straightened and kept on in pursuit of the tiring leader in the final furlong along with an
outer rival, but got outfinished while failing to regain place. MR ELVIN tracked in the three path, shifted in to advance along the rail with a half mile to go, but
only managed to chase the leaders while saving ground around the far turn before yielding. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF laid off of the pace in the three to four
paths, spun into the lane in the five path, but lugged in severely at the furlong grounds while lacking a bid. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS tracked along the
inside, but faded at the half mile pole, and was done early. BATTLE OF WILL bobbled and broke slowly leaving the gates, raced off of the pace in the four to
five paths, and tired.

Footnotes
FATHER RED was allowed to settle in hands early from the three path, coasted up the back stretch with a horse just to his outside, moved in between
horses as he caught the early leader, shook the one on the outside, continued on to the quarter pole with the rival on his inside, was sat down for the drive,
got alone on the front end, but was caught by a rival racing on the outside of him, was angled out to this rival, battled to the end and FATHER RED got a
nose in front. MIDNIGHT OIL raced off the pace from the rail, saved and gained ground slowly but surely, maintained momentum, was full of run late, caught
the early leader late stretch, battled but just missed by a nose. LET'S GO RANDOM was three wide traveling through the first turn, was allowed to settle and
race off the pace until the half mile pole, started to gain ground from the two path, was within striking distance at the three eighths pole, starting closing with
conviction, then hung and faded late. SPINSTRAWINTO GOLD broke the fastest, traveled three wide through the first turn while taking the lead, managed
the pace down the backside, was caught by an outside foe after the half mile pole, raced through the turn from the inside, and fell short in the stretch. ICE
AXE was back early, raced four and five with no impact. CLASSIC RUNNER was mid pack early in between early, stopped after the half pole.

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM set the pace in the two path, met a challenge from a hard to handle outer rival around the turn, repelled that foe and drove clear in
upper stretch, and inched further away through the final furlong. LT. BONURA stalked outside of the leader and from the three path into the turn, got
outmoved by an outer bidder coming to the five sixteenths pole, cut the corner while tucking behind the top pair nearing the lane, then rebid for place while
chasing the clearing eventual winner into the final furlong, and secured that position while not threatening the winner. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU shifted
across an inner rival's path after half a furlong while achieving an inside forward position, stalked from the two path around the turn, altered course outside
of a tucking foe and to the three path entering the lane, tipped further out nearing the furlong grounds, and stayed on willingly to prevail for show. MUCHO
MARVIN tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turn, then sustained a rail chase to vie for show in the final sixteenth, but got outfinished.
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER checked behind a troubled BORN AGAIN GEORGE passing the five furlong pole, shifted out soon after, pulled four wide and
outside of the leaders approaching the turn, sustained progress to bid outside of the leader and in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but was turned
away in upper stretch, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. CRUSADER EXPRESS broke a step slow, rushed to a tracking position in the
three path in the opening stages, but was floated to the four path entering the lane, and tired while hanging on his left lead. BORN AGAIN GEORGE
steadied when LOVEU AND PROUDOFU shifted across his path at the five furlong pole, laid off of the pace in the four to five paths around the turn, spun in
to the lane in the six path, and lacked a rally while hanging on his left lead. MR. PRIORITY bobbled leaving the gates, raced at the rear in the three path,
and moved up nearing midstretch. MR. NASTY TIME broke a step slow, also lacked speed towards the rear while taking the turn in the five path, and failed
to factor. FLASHY BREW leaned outwardly and broke a length slow, laid off of the pace while hung in the five path, and weakened.

Footnotes
MICHELLES LIL STAR raced three wide while stalking the leader, was asked to improve at the half mile pole, started gaining ground, improved position
though the turn while still racing three wide, caught the early leader at the quarter pole, was driven with horses closing in on her, was caught by an outside
stalker and battled late in the furlong ground and prevailed. BANDIT'S PRIDE settled off the pace from the four path, raced mid pack early, stalked the
eventual winner down the back side and through the turn, from the four path, was closing in on the leader at the quarter pole, was battling late in the stretch
but came up short. SHES A LUCKY REBEL was off the pace early, raced in between horses through out, moved into contention nearing the quarter pole,
angled into the two path and was set down for the drive and did not have enough to catch the first two but ran a game third. A RUNNIN AFLEET was
shuffled back early on, raced four and five wide down the backside, advanced at the three eighths pole and moved up in between horses, shifted out at the
quarter pole and was six wide upper stretch, was encouraged down the lane but to no avail. DON'TCALLMEPATSY stalked the the early leaders from the
inside, maintained that position through the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter pole after shifted to the rail and ran flat. COOL HOT CHIC vied
and sent for the early lead, showed the way from the inside through the turn, was well placed at the quarter pole, then faltered. PRAY FOR US raced off the
pace early while being inside in the two path, saved ground, shifted out six wide upper stretch but had nothing late. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY was slow into
stride, advanced wide, and was never involved.

Footnotes
VALE MALE pressed outside of the pace setter, bid turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drove clear through the final furlong.
MEDLEY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's bid turning for home, got headed in upper
stretch, failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, and held place. COURTLY DOC stalked along the inside, chased the leaders around the far turn, dueled
for show through the final furlong, and prevailed. EILEEN ALEXANDRA was briefly antsy just before the gates sprung, stalked three wide, chased from
between horses around the far turn, sustained stride to spar for show through the late stages, but missed. WHOLELOTTAMO broke a step slow at the start
while last away, settled far back three wide, gained five wide and outside of foes approaching the far turn, progressed to vie for show turning for home, but
tired in midstretch. TINCANDANCE laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path, and lacked a rally. SHE'S GONE D'WILD lacked
speed two wide, inched closer four wide along with an outer rival entering the far turn, contended for minor rewards among foes turning for home, but
weakened entering the lane. GATOR PROUD was restless awaiting the start, then allowed to settle at the rear, saved ground while trailing, but to no avail.
OUR LITTLE GIRL leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, fanned to the five path entering the backstretch, and was outrun in
the six path around the far turn.

Footnotes
HEARTYCONSTITUTION stalked the run-away leader from the inside, made first run around the far turn to bid along with an outer rival nearing the lane, led
from that one in upper stretch, dueled to midstretch, inched clear leaving that station, flopped back to his left lead in the final sixteenth, yet held sway from
an outer bidder late. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE tracked in the three path, tipped outside of the new leading pair in upper stretch, and sustained a grinding
charge to gain place at the sixteenth pole, but was fended off by the leader through the late stages. PRECURSORY stalked two wide, closed in from the
four path around the far turn along with an inner rival, bid with that foe entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace leaving the
furlong grounds, and lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. LIVY B laid off of the pace in the three to two paths, fanned to the six path in upper
stretch, and stayed on. AIN'T BROKE broke in and gracefully avoided bumping the inner rail, trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the two to three
paths, and failed to menace. CHATON ROUGE raced at the rear two wide, and made little impact. MONEY WELL SPENT opened up into the first turn, saw
his margin diminish as a pair of rivals closed in around the far turn, got overhauled by them nearing the lane, and readily stopped. MY ALIBI dropped her
rider momentarily upon approaching the turf course, then saved ground off of the pace, but weakened into the far turn, felt vigorous right handed crops
entering the lane while well outrun, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BUNKIE'S SONG tracked along the inside, split foes through narrow quarters four wide in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to reel in the stopping
leader leaving the sixteenth pole, dueled with an outer rival through the closing stages, and held. NOSY BANKER broke in and squarely and bumped a rival
at the start, chased in the three path, got floated five wide entering the lane by an inner rival, grinded away along with that foe while hanging on his left lead,
bid in the final sixteenth, dueled to the wire, but was fended off. SMOOTH COLLIERY laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering
the lane, then stayed on in the six path while hanging on his left lead through the late stages, and gained show nearing the wire. QUEST FOR AVETTE set
the pace two wide, cleared her inner counterpart while tucking entering the turn, showed the way from an outer presser around the bend, inched away from
that foe in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but gave in to a pair of outer bidders leaving the sixteenth pole, and faltered late.
FULL POWER laid close up along the inside, but steadied as the leader crossed over nearing the turn, chased around the bend, took aim two wide in upper
stretch, but lacked a punch. SCHNELL broke out and severely bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack while hung in the five path around
the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to menace. ZONG TOUGH laid off of the pace in the three path, but made little impact.
GRACIDA was reluctant to load, finally did so rider-less, then broke as step slow, took the turn in the three path and between horses while far back, and
failed to factor. C'MON VE chased the top pair early on, moved to press the leader two wide around the turn, but weakened between horses after being
floated three wide at the quarter pole. TACTICAL PRIORITY tracked in the four path, and faded. PAT ME DOWN was slammed by an outer rival and jostled
between horses at the start costing him all chance, then made little impact from the four path. CHIMNEY ROCK broke a step slow before being viciously
bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe leaving the gates, and trailed throughout.
