Footnotes
SEE SASSY RUN rated far back in the three path, gained without urging in the two path around the far turn, produced a bold bid inside of the lugging leader
leaving the three sixteenths pole, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off well in hand. LACIS JEWEL trailed along the inside, awaited racing
room while following the eventual winner's gain turning for home, fanned five wide in upper stretch after that foe got a jump, and rallied to gain place late.
KEHRON'S CREED set the pace while a path of two off of the inner railing, required a tight left rein to keep from bearing outwardly down the backstretch
and around the far turn, but drifted to the three to four paths while offering little resistance to an inner rival's bid in upper stretch, then was caught for place in
the closing stages. MISSGREELEY'SSONG tucked behind the top flight to track along the inside around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, but
was outkicked by the eventual winner entering the lane, and lacked a bid. CAJUN SHOTS laid off of the pace in the two path, retreated to trail approaching
the far turn, and passed tired rivals. STORIED TRIP stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, chased that foe around the far turn, but weakened
nearing the lane, and was eased through the final furlong. BE A BANDIT tracked the top pair from the four path, but faded in the five path around the far
turn.

Footnotes
BAND BOSS tracked two wide and between horses, gained an inside stalking position approaching the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of the leader
entering the lane, bid and sparked a duel in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS set the pace
along the inside, dug in to resist BAND BOSS's bid in upper stretch, dueled gamely thereafter, but was bested. JUJU NINETEEN brushed the outer part of
the gate while breaking a step slow, bumped an outer rival soon after, tracked four to three wide around the first turn, chased around the far turn, then failed
to keep pace with the top two in upper stretch, yet held show while hanging on his left lead. HOPE FOR CHANGE stalked along the inside, but faded at the
half mile pole, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, yet kept on along the rail to surpass tired foes and regain a minor reward. ROCK STAR
ALEX pressed outside of the leader, chased from between horses around the far turn, but yielded three wide entering the lane. TOTALLY ADDICTED laid
off of the pace three to two wide and between horses, and failed to menace. FOOLISH DREAMS lunged out and bumped the outer part of the gate while off
slow, lacked speed five to four wide around the first turn, came into the backstretch between horses, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to factor.
MY HEAVY SON laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four to five paths, shifted inwardly leaving the three sixteenths pole, and made
no impact between horses. CHAPEL OF DREAMS stumbled leaving the gates, was awkward to regain balance while bumping with an inner rival soon after,
raced far back while hung five wide, took the far turn in the four path, and tired while hanging on his left lead. SIR POKERFACE tossed his head while
uncomfortable between horses approaching the first turn, lacked speed two wide and between horses, trailed in the five to six paths around the far turn and
was outrun.

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN vied for the early lead, settled off the leaders hip form the three path within himself, briefly lost ground in the beginning of the turn and
then was cued and made up that ground entering the stretch, during the stretch drive he was challenged by an inside foe, who he battled determinedly
against and had and outside foe closing in close tot he wire but he raced gamely and got up for the win by a nose. DE SAIX vied for the early lead, set the
pace from the rail, made a bold moving at the quarter pole by sneaking up the rail, challenging an outside foe, slightly brushed outward in the lane meeting
his outside rival during the stretch battle, keep driving and racing until the wire. DE SAIX failed to switch leads but still raced a gutsy race and gave great
effort even though he just missed today. MONEY RUN broke into the second tier along the inside, saved ground the entire trip from the two and three path,
was in a good stalking position at the quarter pole, was closing but still behind the leaders at the eighth mile marker, angled out a bit was kept on point, and
kept closing racing a close third. WESTERN COMMAND was in the 2nd tier of horses in the four path, raced wide, held that position and made no impact. F
J'S FLACO was forced to check early as the horses moved out of the gates and gained position on the track, was shifted out wide but was never involved
after that.

Footnotes
DEER CROSSING settled off of the pace in the three path, pursued in the four path around the far turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, sustained a
grinding charge to steadily inch closer to the leader in the final furlong, produced a bid in the late stages, and edged ahead. COFFEE COUNTY tracked in
the two path, loomed a danger while aiming between the leading pair around the far turn, bid turning for home, gained an advantage at the quarter pole,
drove clear approaching midstretch, but was worn down by an outer rival in the closing stages. PERRINS trailed in the three path, spun into the lane four
wide, stayed on between horses to bid for show inside of MANGELSEN in the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed for that position. MANGELSEN prompted
the pace while intentionally remaining in the six path for better footing in the center of the course tucked down to the four path while vying into the far turn,
sparred with an inner bidder nearing the lane, but was headed by that one at the quarter pole, yielded between horses approaching midstretch, and lost
show to an inner rival in the late stages. MAGA MAN stalked in the three path, chased from between horses around the far turn, but gave way nearing
midstretch. BIND FAITH saved ground off of the pace, retreated to trail the field turning for home, altered course outwardly in upper stretch, and surpassed
tired rivals. MR. FOUR SEVENS hopped at the start and was rank to recover, settled off of the pace in the two path, tugged between horses down the
backstretch, but then tired through the lane. LAURI'S WISH set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals turning for home, and
weakened through the lane.

WISE ANCHOR settled into a stalking position from the four path early on, was angled out a bit at the half mile pole where he started to gain ground,
continued gaining ground and building momentum at the three eighths pole, was asked and responded gamely with a long consistent drive down the stretch,
responding to every cue and willingly closing and gaining with every stride, he was able to take the lead at the eighth pole and was up for the win.
CRYPTOZONIC was pinched back at the start as rivals from both sides broke into his path, was far of the pace early while saving ground along the rail, was
able to find his stride and started coming on at he three eighths pole, was in contention at the five eighths pole, angled out at the quarter pole, responded to
strong encouragement, down the lane while gaining ground on the eventual winner but had to settle for second as there was too much ground to make up
today. FIERY PLAYBOY vied for the early lead from the five and six paths, matched strides with an inside foe for much of the early part of the race, shook
the inside competitor in the turn, was on the lead at the quarter pole, shifted into the rail after the three sixteenth pole, and tired late. CREOLE CHARLIE
vied for the early lead, matched strides early with an outside competitor down the back side, continued on the lead with the outside competitor until the five
sixteenth pole, started to weaken a bit, but raced gamely near the end. BINDING AGREEMENT raced mid pack early on while staying wide, raced from the
four and five paths, and made no impact in the stretch. WRONGWAYHIGHWAY was off slow, aced wide throughout and never got involved. YOUNG
TUSCAN vied for the early lead from the rail position, settled back a bit through the turn was shifted out three wide into the stretch was within striking
distance at the quarter pole, then faded late.

Footnotes
PEACOCK ALLEY stalked outside of the top pair, pressed within striking range around the turn, bid turning for home, dueled with an inner THE PRINCESS
SAYS through upper stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear in the final sixteeth. THE PRINCESS SAYS prompted the pace
two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer PEACOCK ALLEY turning for home, sparred with that one while under confident handling in upper stretch, but
was finally asked while getting headed at the furlong grounds, and proved no match for her outer counterpart in the final sixteenth. DIAL TONI broke a step
slow, saved ground off of the pace, fanned to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on to gain show late. CRIMALDI was held by the assistant starter
when the gates opened and broke multiple lengths slow as a result, raced far back in the two path, improved inside of foes in upper stretch, and sustained
stride to reach fourth at the wire. EXPECT A DANCER set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids turning for home, got headed at the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened through the lane. LADY HUXLEY pursued from midpack in the four to five paths around the turn, appeared to be easing under rider's
restraint in upper stretch, yet shifted out before coming under mild coaxing in midstretch to surpass tiring rivals. TIME TO CLOSE tracked from midpack
along the inside, but lugged out to the three to four paths around the turn, and tried. MARMO MOON bobbled while breaking outwardly and slowly at the
start, trailed in the two path, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ON YOUR MARK laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the eleven path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner
MINNESOTA READY thereafter, and prevailed. MINNESOTA READY settled off of the pace in the three path, rallied between horses in the five path in
upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds along with outer rivals, dueled with ON YOUR MARK through the closing stages but was bested. FORTUITY
tracked in the four path, spun into upper stretch in the ten path while between horses, got outkicked by the eventual winner in midstretch, but offered a late
rally in the closing stages, to gain show. ROBO dueled for the lead with an inner rival while taking the turn in the four path, shifted out to the six path
entering the lane, but was outkicked by bidders on both sides at the furlong pole, and yielded. SKY AND SAND stalked along the inside while a path off of
the rail, and chased in the three path through the lane while lacking a bid. SIMPLY WICKED dueled for the lead inside of a rival while a bit off of the rail, and
gave way in midstretch. THERIDEOFALIFETIME chased in the three path while between horses around the turn, shifted out to the nine path in upper
stretch, but faded. SUTHERLAND broke slowly while bobbling at the start, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MADISON'S SCREEN vied two wide, led in the two path around the turn, drew off under driving pressure through upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead
in the final furlong, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. CONTINENTAL RED took contact from an outer rival at the start, then steadied hard
when put to tight rail quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, recovered to chase the leaders in the three to four paths around the turn, gained place at the three
sixteenths pole after the leader kicked away, and stayed on to prove second best. GRACE'S SOLDIER broke slowly, saved ground far back, fanned to the
six path entering the lane, and stayed on late to narrowly gain show at the wire. LOVE CREED checked subtly pursuing a troubled rival at the nine
sixteenths pole, shifted out and gained in the six path around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch without reaching contention, and was caught at the
wire for show. PERIPHERAL VISION checked and shied outwardly while following a troubled rival leaving the nine sixteenths pole, raced off of the pace in
the three path, and failed to menace. RUN AWAY SAMARI bobbled at the start, recovered to stalk outside of the top pair into the turn, pressed from the
three path turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and weakened along the rail. DREAMED I AM FAST
bumped an inner rival upon leaving the gates, vied along the inside, backed off to stalk entering the turn, altered course outside of a lugging foe at the three
sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid thereafter. ALL AMERICAN PAT tracked four wide, but faded in the five path around the turn. AMYS CANDY was briefly
put to tight quarters between a pair of rivals early on, and trailed thereafter.
