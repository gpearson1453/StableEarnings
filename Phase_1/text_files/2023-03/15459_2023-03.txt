Footnotes
MELODY ROSE was a half step tardy leaving the starting gates, was allowed to find her stride from the three path early, raced unhurried until the half mile
marker, was in contention moving into the second turn but still last, started running at the the three eighths pole spilt a pair leaving the turn, angled out six
wide upper stretch, was encouraged and willingly responded and was bale to clear the rest of the field and get up in time for the win. IZEONPOINT was off
the pace and matched strides with the eventual winner early on, started gaining ground and build momentum from the four path, as she inched up closer to
the lead, moved to the rail and saved ground from there, was in the two path upper stretch and put down for the drive, split a pair of rivals at the eighth pole,
had aim on the wire and closed gamely but just missed today. BIND ON EARTH was fast out of the starting gate and vied for the early lead, matched strides
with rival from the three path for most of the race, faded in the last sixteenth of a mile. NEW YEAR'S PARTY was racing in the middle of the pack from the
four path early on, maintained that position through the three eighths pole, was last at the quarter pole, angled eight wide down the lane, closed and was
good enough for third place honors today. BECCA'S BOUQUET raced three off the pace from the three path, gained ground in the turn and was well placed
at the quarter pole, raced three wide in the stretch but made no impact. QUEEN'S MISSION vied for the early lead, matched strides with another rival on the
outside for most of the race, was first tot he quarter pole from the fence, and stopped at the eighths mile pole.

Footnotes
ROYAL UNLIMITED set a clear and uncontested pace in the two path, and widened his margin under moderate handling. REVERENT bumped an outer
rival at the start, tracked two wide, kept his inner counterpart in tight quarters through upper stretch, then produced a grinding rail rally in the final furlong to
gain place in the late stages. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW stalked the clear leader from the four path, chased that foe as his main pursuer entering the
lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, yielded, and lost place to an inner rival in the final sixteenth. CHIEFWEAVE failed to match pace-setting
strides with an outer rival after a furlong, chased that foe in the three path while inside of another rival around the turn, but gave way turning for home, and
weakened. WAR TROLLEY broke a step slowly just before taking a bump from an inner rival at the start, lagged behind around the turn, and moved up
between horses in the final furlong. MAGNOLIA RIDGE chased from midpack under moderate coaxing, then was put to tight quarters by an outer competitor
in upper stretch, and made little impact thereafter. OLE STUD MUFFIN broke a beat slow, lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the
lane, but was outrun.

Footnotes
SUMITUP was the quickest out of the gates today, cleared the rest of the field in a few strides, angled down to the rail, set the fractions from the rail and
was never contested. WHAT CAN I SAY was widest down the backside as she was racing in the middle of the field from the six path, was unhurried until the
three eighths pole where she was given the cue, she responded willing and was able to get up for second. PAT HAND GIRL was well off the pace early,
allowed to race at her own speed in the four path until the three eights pole, was asked for run and gained ground but still trailed at the quarter pole, was
raced seven wide in the stretch and was up for third. SUGAR STAR was off the pace racing from the three path, raced the same pace and position until the
quarter pole, found her speed, caught up to the field by the three sixteenth pole, shifted out to continue momentum, closed willingly, but had too much
ground to make up and settled for fourth today. WENDY WILECAT broke out, raced in the second flight in between horses early, shifted to the rail at the
half, saved ground the rest of the way and had no finish. THE MISSING PIECE broke out , raced a ground saving race from the ail rail throughout, had no
impact. SUNSHINE STAR raced four wide in the second tier, in between horses at the five sixteenth pole, had no rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT PATOOTIE took a brush from an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, emerged as the top pair's closes pursuer into
the turn, stalked those rivals from the two to three paths, tipped back in to take aim inside of those rivals in upper stretch, offered a bid at the furlong
grounds, and gradually edged ahead. BOSTON MILLIE dueled for the lead outside of a rival while kept in the three path by that foe around the turn, led in
the four path entering the lane, but drifted about subtly while unable to kick clear of her inner counterpart in upper stretch, sparred three wide into the final
furlong as an inner rival joined the fray, got outkicked by that foe entering the final sixteenth, then saved place from an outer on-charging bidder late. REINA
ACES was void of early speed, took the turn far back in the three path, came into the lane in the two path, then gradually altered course to the six path and
between horses approaching the furlong grounds, and offered a belated surge to just miss reaching place. WHORL GIRL broke out and brushed a rival at
the start, dueled for the lead inside of a foe while remaining a path off of the rail, got headed by that one while spinning into the lane in the three path, fought
on between horses into midstretch while hanging on her left lead as an inner rival produced a bid, but yielded to those foes in the closing stages. ZIPPITY
ZOODA RED tracked along the inside, chased through the final furlong while attempting to shift out, decided to tip back in in the final sixteenth to offer a
show bid, but flattened out late. MINT JULIUS broke out towards empty space at the start, tracked three wide, then chased evenly through the lane while
lacking a bid. GOTTEMINABIND pursued the top flight from the four to five paths, then tired after being floated to the seven path in midstretch.
SANGIOVESE lagged behind in the four path, and never got involved. CHARMING KAT was outrun along the inside, then eased through the final furlong

Footnotes
A. K. A. GRAMS brushed an inner rival in the opening furlong, dueled with an outer foe into and around the turn, finally shook free of that one leaving the
furlong grounds, edged clear, and held safely from a pair of belated outer rivals late. THEBOYZGALAXY broke out at the start, laid off of the pace in the two
path, shifted out and split foes in the four path at the furlong grounds, offered a belated rally to gain place in the closing stages, and fended off an outer foe
for that position late. COMMERCIAL FLASH saved ground while trailing, darted out to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole, and offered a belated
kick. FORTY NINE MODEL dueled outside of the eventual winner around the turn, failed to keep pace with that one leaving the furlong pole, tired, and was
outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. ROSE CROWN took a brush from an outer rival in the opening furlong, chased along the inside,
shifted outside of the embattled leading pair to take aim from multiple lengths off entering the lane, but lacked progress through midstretch, and was
outkicked for minor rewards at the sixteenth pole. PRAYERS SAVED broke slowly before bobbling soon after the start, saved ground while chasing the main
group, but to no avail. PEACEFUL VISION was brushed by an outer rival into an inner rival in the opening furlong, recovered to stalk the top pair from the
three path, but gave way in the four path nearing the lane. POINT OF VICTORY tracked in the five path, and tired. KASEN'S SISTER was outrun in the four
path. AMERICAN REBEL was urged along to chase from midpack in the three to four paths around the turn, but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
MYSTIC STORM was slow into stride, raced from the four path and off the pace, advanced into mid pack by the three eighths pole, was a half of a length off
of the leader at the quarter pole, launched a bid at the eighth mile pole, battled with the early leader until the last few strides when MYSTIC STORM drew off
late. MIDSUMMER SOIREE vied for the early lead, attended the pace willingly from the two path, was challenged at the quarter pole by an outer foe, then
was joined by a second challenger on the outside of the first challenger, was able to shake the first rival, was brought out to meet he second outside
challenger, battled hard and was not able to shake this one as easily, was coming to meet challenging rival for a second and third time,, moved away from
the rail and let it open up, then had a third challenger charging from the rail, could do nothing about the second challenger but watch him draw off for the win
but held off the third challenger and scored second place money. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF was mid pack after the break, four wide and in between rivals , in
the four path, was pulling hard at the half mile pole, was kept under wraps through the turn, angled out five wide at the three sixteenth pole, had clear racing
room, put in a bid and was kept on point while closing and racing willingly,, kept driving and hustling and was up for third. DE' ANS EIGHTY stalked the early
leaders from the path, drew along the side of one of the early leaders at the three eighths pole, saved ground and chased from that position into the stretch,
waited for a hole to open up and while doing so faded. TATTERED HEART race near the back along the rail early, held that position through out and made
no impact. THE RAGE OF ART vied for the early lead from the five path, settled on stalking from the outside, joined on of the early leaders at the half mile
marker, matched strides in company through the turn, angled out at the eighth pole for clear racing room, but then had no rally. KISS ME ON OCONEE
trailed through out.

Footnotes
CLEAR AS A BELE broke slowly, yet pulled himself into the race by advancing up a rail opening approaching the turn, sustained progress to reach an inside
stalking position just behind the pace setters by the three furlong pole, smoothly tipped outside of the clearing leader entering the lane, ranged up after
changing leads passing the three sixteenths pole, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. HOOSIER settled off of the pace along the
inside, rallied in the three path and between horses in upper stretch, progressed with an inner LORDY LADY to bid for place along with that one in the final
sixteenth, and narrowly prevailed at the wire. LORDY LORDY chased from midpack in the four path, tucked to the two path at the three furlong pole, cut the
corner entering the lane, improved past outer rivals to vie for show in midstretch, stayed on to bid for place along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth,
reached that position nearing the wire, but got nailed on it. COMANCHE WARRIOR was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, rushed
forward to vie for the lead along the inside by the half mile pole, led from a group of outer pressers around the turn, shook free entering the lane before an
outer rival loomed a danger, proved no match for that bidder crossing the furlong pole, and weakened in the final sixteenth. CALICOCO was bumped
between horses at the start, raced forwardly in the two path among foes, shifted to the four path at the three furlong pole, fanned to the five path while
getting outkicked by an inner rival entering the lane, and slowly gave way. LIFEASWEKNOWIT bumped an inner rival at the start, raced far back in the four
path, and moved up between horses in midstretch. SONO pressed in the five path, but was floated to the seven path entering the lane, and weakened. RAP
ARTIST tracked in the five to six path around the turn, and tired. ALL OF US was briefly forward in the three path and between horses, but faltered entering
the turn. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE leaned out and bumped a foe at the start, sped clear in the three path, vied outside of a inner bidder into the turn, but
slopped after being floated to the four path entering the lane.

Footnotes
ODDSONTONY tracked four wide, grinded away through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, sustained a bid passing the furlong pole, forged an
advantage while changing to his right lead at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. MO MOVES bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, vied outside of a
rival while taking the turn in the three path, led turning for home, but failed to kick away from his inner counterpart through midstretch, got outkicked by an
outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, then lasted for place late. BIG POPPER bumped the inner part of the gate while breaking slow, lagged behind the field
while saving ground around the turn, shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and offered a belated surge outside of foes in the closing stages, but ran out of
ground to reach place. KNOCK'EM OUT JERRY vied for the lead inside of a rival while a bit off of the inner rail, got headed turning for home, fought back to
regain vying position in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but yielded after being outkicked approaching the sixteenth pole. OLE CRAZY BONE
was fractious and dropped his rider in the post parade, ran back to the paddock while loose in the aftermath, yet was remounted without further incident,
tracked three wide and between horses, but lacked a bid through the lane. FREE RAMBLING MAN chased along the inside, but lacked a bid before tiring
late. BLUEGRASS LUTE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, chased through upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
PALACEIN set the pace, built a clear margin entering the turn, then widened it under moderate hand urging through the lane. CARSON'S PRINCESS
tracked along the inside, came under coaxing while shifting out turning for home, spun into the lane in the five to six path, rallied outside of foes to gain
place at the furlong grounds, and failed to threaten the leader thereafter. CAVE CREEK raced at the rear two wide, rallied inside of foes to gain show
passing the furlong pole, and was best of the rest. TOTAL MALICE pursued the top group from the four path, tipped a bit out at the furlong grounds, and ran
on to gain a minor share. BEAUXS ARTES chased the pace setter from the two path while inside of a rival around the turn, then weakened between horses
in midstretch. MA CHERIE saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. DANCE IT stalked three wide, but faded between horses in upper stretch. LOVE
OF MY LIFE broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four path, retreated to trail the field at the quarter pole, and was outrun from there.

Footnotes
CUSTOMIZED TWIN quickly sped clear leaving the gates, opened up an insurmountable lead around the turn, and was ridden out while never threatened.
PRISSY JADEN stalked the clear leader two wide, and held place while proving no match. CALLING laid off of the pace three wide, took the turn in the four
path, fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on. SWEET LITTLE ROSE laid off of the pace in the two path, improved between horses in
midstretch, and flattened out. SILK NOT SATIN broke a beat slow, chased from midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two path, shifted three wide
and between horses entering the lane, and lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead. SADIE'S PORT was void of speed along the inside, and made little
impact. ZIPPING MOLLY pursued from midpack in the three path, spun into the lane four wide and between horses, and weakened. TALENTS HOT DEAL
chased along the inside, but weakened through the lane. PENNIE'S MAGIC broke slowly and showed little.
