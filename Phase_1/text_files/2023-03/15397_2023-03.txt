KAZ PALACE was away alertly and quickly showed to the front, was well handled on the front end and drew clear on the turn, then drew off in the final
furlong while being ridden out. HIGH STRIKE was well placed early, chased the winner on the turn but could not gain on that rival, no match for that rival
while clearly second best. MACHO HONCHO was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside and then lacked a late rally, bested rest. DON'T BLAME
FREDDY was reserved early and failed to menace. TRUE QUEEN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace four wide and tired. SPELLED WELL was not
a factor.
