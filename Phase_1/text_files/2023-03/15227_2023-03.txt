Footnotes
BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL broke in and brushed a foe at the start, straightened momentarily before being asked to cross over while clearing, yet caused
slight hinderance to a group of foes behind him while doing so, showed the way with a clear margin around the turn, and held sway from a chasing rival
under driving pressure. STEALING APRIORITY bumped with rivals on both sides soon after the start, then brushed an inner foe when herded down by an
outer rival in the early stages, chased the clear leader from the two path, but failed to progress through the lane while hanging on his left lead, and was
second best. CREME DE BALI was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, then got put to crowded quarters among those foes a few strides
later, pursued from midpack, tucked to the inside entering the turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase while hanging on his
left lead into the final furlong, changed over leaving that station, and held show. GENIUS was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, brushed
with those foes in the incident soon after, tracked along the inside under snug restraint, but was wrangled back to shift out nearing the turn, tipped four wide
at the three furlong pole, then lacked a bid through the lane while hanging on his left lead. SPEEDY G bumped with rivals on both sides soon after the start,
raced at the rear in the two to three paths, and moved up. COURAGEOUS TIMMY leaned out a touch at the start, chased three wide, but faded through the
lane while remaining on his left lead. AFIKOMAN broke out and bumped a foe at the start, then was keen when brushed to tight rail quarters by outer rivals
in the early stages, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. DA GOLD ROOM took a brush from an outer rival before bumping with an
inner foe soon after, raced far back in the four to five paths, and was outrun. THE RIDER OFSTEALING APRIORITY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE OPENING STAGES, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

well off the pace early, saved ground the entire trip and passed tiring rivals. D TWO was off the pace from the outside, matched strides with another rival

Footnotes
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL raced forwardly in the three path, emerged from between horses to be the clear leader's main pursuer around the turn, chased
that foe while unable to progress through upper stretch, yet inched closer nearing the final sixteenth as the leader tired, and gained an advantage
approaching the wire. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER set the pace via a clear margin while a path off of the rail around the turn, held sway through midstretch,
but began to tire entering the final sixteenth, and gave in late before saving place. MILTONTOWN laid off of the pace three wide and between horses,
handled crowded quarters well leaving the half mile pole, gained four wide and between horses around the bend, then stayed on outside of foes after
changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, but ran out of ground to reach place. MAINTAINANCE MATT pursued from midpack along the inside, faltered
while buried inside of rivals into the turn, raced towards the rear around the bend, then sustained a rail chase through the lane, vied for show late, but got
outfinished while altering course around traffic nearing the wire, and dead-heated for fourth. DREWZANO was last away while off a step slow, raced at the
rear in the two path while tugging behind foes down the backstretch, moved between horses nearing the turn, knifed through three wide at the five
sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase among foes through the lane while lacking a bid, then dead-heated for fourth. SUN SQUALL chased in the two
path and lacked a bid. FRANK THE MAYOR chased five wide and outside of foes from midpack briefly, but retreated to trail the field entering the turn, and
never got involved. COMPLEX SYSTEM tracked four wide, but faded in the six path around the turn.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOA KID was racing from the four path early, continued gaining ground from the outside through the turn, shifted in a bit in the lane was driven
and kept to task while chasing the early leader, slightly drifted out and and was brought back in allowing CALIBRACHOA KID to switch leads again and
lengthen his stride with less than ten strides left to go, he was able to catch the early leader and pass him for the win. AZTEC GEM sent for the lead, was
able to attend to the pace for most of the race, looked like the winner until deep in the stretch where he was collared late with not enough time to battle back,
but had done enough work to hold on to second. MALAKI EMPIRE was off slow, settled far off the pace early was asked and responded well, made one
long run from the outside and closed well. MACHO BEANIE was in the second tier in the three path early, drifted down closer to the rail in the turn slightly
brushing an inside rival, traveled along the rail in the lane but tired late. ZINGING BAYOU was racing in the second tier from the rail, shifted out in the turn,
was four wide in the lane and tired while still one his left lead. OURPERFECTPRINCE was racing with determination from in between foes in the second tier
down the backside, dropped over to the rail through the turn, was in tight briefly and hit the rail, regained his stride and closed in the lane before tiring.
MADELYN'S SOLDIER never involved. THERER WAS A JOCKEY CLAIM OF FOUL. THE JOCKEY ON OURPERFECTPRINCE CALIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MACHO BEANIE FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERNCE IN THE SECOND TURN. AFTER A STEWART'S REVIEW NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MA CHERIE chased the leading trio from the two path, encountered traffic behind those rivals in upper stretch, split them entering the final sixteenth, and
edged an advantage late. THE RAGE OF ART broke a bit outwardly at the start, vied two wide and between horses, led narrowly through the final furlong,
but was outkicked by an inner bidder late. SWEET BEAUTY shied out from an inner rival at the start, pressed three wide, vied around the turn, sustained the
battle while four wide through midstretch, but yielded late. TATTERED HEART tracked in the three path, fanned five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a bid
outside of the leaders. AGGIE DOCTOR bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, lacked speed along the inside, and made little impact. SWEET
SLEW bumped with an inner foe a few strides after the break, set the pace inside of a pair of sternly vying rivals around the turn, got headed in upper
stretch, and weakened approaching the final sixteenth. PLANTS AND BIRDS was slow early, trailed in the five path around the turn, and got outrun.

Footnotes
HOME VISIT dueled for the lead inside of a rival, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn as an outer KINGOFBROKENHEARTS bid, got headed by
that one entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, reclaimed an advantage in the final sixteenth, and lasted from an outer on-charging foe late.
SUNDAY BREEZE broke a step slow while while bumping with an inner rival and brushing with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path, gained in
the path around the far turn, fanned to the four path in upper stretch with multiple lengths to find on the top pair, surged outside of them in the closing
stages, but narrowly came up short. KINGOFBROKENHEARTS laid off of the pace along the inside, improved with nine sixteenths to go to gain show
before tipping three wide to stalk outside of the top pair, bid into the far turn, vied three wide around that bend, led entering the lane, but failed to kick on
leaving the furlong grounds, lost the advantage to her inner counterpart in the final sixteenth, and was outkicked for place late. MARTINIZED stalked outside
of the top pair, got floated four wide by an inner moving foe at the nine sixteenths pole, chased under urging around the far turn, and lacked a bid while
hanging on his left lead. JEFFROW broke a beat slow while bumping an outer rival at the start, laid unhurried in the two path, took the far turn two wide, and
failed to factor. FORTY THREE dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses into the far turn, but gave way turning for home, and weakened
through the lane. TOUCHDOWN JOE pursued from midpack four to five wide, but faded into the far turn. CALCULATED stumbled badly before propping at
the start, pulled after shifting out to the three path around the first turn, tugged between horses nearing the backstretch, but steadied out from that spot
entering it, then faded along the inside around the far turn.

Footnotes
OH MY ACHING ARCH bumped with an inner rival at the start, then steadied while in tight quarters between horses approaching the wire for the first time,
clipped heels with an inner rival in the aftermath, settled at the rear along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, rallied between horses to bid
inside of the leader in the final furlong, and edged an advantage late. MR. FOUR SEVENS stalked in the three path, advanced to the fore entering the
backstretch, cleared approaching the five furlong pole, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, shifted out to the three to four paths while
resisting outer bids in upper stretch, but met a pair of inner bids leaving the furlong grounds, and got bested in the final sixteenth. GUITARTUITION PLZZ
stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, produced a rail bid along with an outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, got outkicked by
that foe in the final sixteenth, and was staved off for place. HUDSON'S TURN broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, fanned to the
eight path entering the lane, shifted out to the eleven path in midstretch to remain outside of a drifting foe, and stayed on late. COFFEE COUNTY bumped
with rivals on both sides at the start, then shied from an inner rival causing him to clip heels with an outer foe nearing the wire for the first time, settled off of
the pace in the two to three paths, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and chased. REAL CITY SPEED bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in
the two path, inched closer three wide around the far turn, but fanned to the six path entering the lane, drifted outwardly through upper stretch, and tired.
JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT set the pace in the two path, but got headed by an outer rival entering the backstretch, stalked outside of that foe entering the far turn,
but floated to the five path entering the lane, and yielded in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER broke half a beat slow,
raced at the rear two wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ROSIE SPRIT rushed forward after breaking a bit inwardly, set the pace, met HOT PATOOTIE's challenge entering the lane, and held sway. HOT
PATOOTIE tracked four wide, inched closer around the turn to take dead aim entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader home. ZIPPING
MOLLY pressed two wide and between horses early on, failed to sustain that position into the turn, chased from behind the leaders around the bend, split
foes to regain show at the three sixteenths pole, and ran on while hanging on her left lead. DREAMED I AM FAST lacked speed in the five path, and moved
up. ONECALLTHATSALL stalked three wide, then from between horses around the turn, but weakened entering the lane. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY tracked
along the inside, but faded. KEEP ON DREAMING was antsy and unsettled in the post parade, then made little impact along the inside. BEANIE was
outrun, pulled in upper stretch, and got vanned off.
