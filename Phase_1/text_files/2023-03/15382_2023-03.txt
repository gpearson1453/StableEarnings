drew clear on the far turn and widened in the stretch under firm handling. GOOD IDEA pressed the winner three wide, could not challenge late but was up
for place. WISE KHOZAN pressed the winner on the inside and went evenly late. ROSAS WAY never far back early, lacked a late response. OPEN OUT
allowed to settle, failed to menace. IMTHEPRINCE showed little and trailed.

LOADED ONCE MORE was never far back, rallied on the turn three wide, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. SQUID dueled on the lead for
a half, shook clear in the stretch and was caught in the last jumps. SOMUCHSUGAR was allowed to settle early, swung four wide in the stretch and finished
well. POLISHED GEM dueled on the inside and weakened in the stretch. FLAT DISCOUNT was well placed on the rail and faded in the stretch. SUSHI Q
had brief foot and was through early. AUJARA stumbled at the start and lost her rider. The stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action
