Footnotes
TWO ROOM SCHOOL broke clear while tapering in and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn but dueled
clear in later yards. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE pressured the pace inside and raced at nearly even terms nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady
stretch encouragement and just lasted for second. BOBBYS CASE LOAD gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn about the four path, finished well
and just missed second. ALLEGHENY HERO chased the pace, raced in the five path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BOO TOO ducked in and made
contact with Irish fire leaving the gate, took a brief early lead then pressured the winner nearing the five sixteenths pole, but dropped back off the rail midway
on the turn and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. FRANK THE BULL chased the pace, raced in the four path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane.
CHARTERED COURSE gave chase through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn and finished evenly. IRISH FIRE came away a step slow and was
bumped leaving the gate, picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened in the lane.

under steady stretch handling. SHOULDA HAD IT raced well off the early pace toward the inside, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and improved in
the five path of the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up for second late yards. HAPPY CHAMP stalked off the rail, challenged the winner nearing the
three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. RIDICULOUS tapered in and stalked the early
pace from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in range in the four path and ran evenly in the stretch.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR stalked inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, though, flattened the final
sixteenth. JUNGLE WARRIOR settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed
little in the lane. TOP HAT TREASON raced inside and showed little response through the backstretch. NOVA BOY raced well off the pace in the three and
four paths, left the first turn outside and showed little response. CAYENNE CREEK rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the seven

Footnotes
BORN TO SIN pressured the pace then showed the way from the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the turn, dug in to recover the advantage past
the eighth pole and dueled clear later yards. EL PACHO raced with a contentious pace three wide, kept the edge through the turn and dueled at even terms
in the upper stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. COURT TUDOR gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled
through later yards for third. DR RENDEZVOUS chased the pace, rounded the turn about the three path and was outfinished in a later duel for third. MAKIN'
GOLD bore in on the chute and raced with the pace, contested between horses on the turn then flattened leaving the eighth pole. O'RIGSBY gave chase,
raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. ONE CANDY CASTLE was shuffled back on the chute, gave chase outside and rounded the turn
about the five path. J. WICK became a bit anxious in the gate and gave chase, but never factored.

between horses late and dueled for second. FATHER WALSH ducked out leaving the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and was
outfinished for second the final yards. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. SETTLEMENT DATE chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the five path leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. STRETCH
THE TRUTH had a brief early lead then gave chase outside, raced in the seven path of the turn and showed little in the lane. COWBOY AT HEART chased
