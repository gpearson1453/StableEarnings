Footnotes
LEVY settled off the pace while three wide through the first turn, continued in the three path when asked midway on the second bend, firm handling, late
surge to be up in the final strides. FIVE O FOX cleared toward the inside early in the first turn after breaking alertly, dueled in the run into the far turn,
disposed of that rival to be well clear into the lane, caved late to be caught in the waning strides. RIANTE SKY off a step slow, remained void of speed for
five furlongs, advanced three to four wide turning for home, continued a mild rally while not a threat to the top two. LOBO IRISH in the main group while four
wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again through most of the second bend, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. OTHER
TIMES well back, trailed second turn, picked off a couple of tiring horses while not a threat. DABOOGEYMAN rank while between horses first turn,
advanced to duel up the backstretch, began to give way far turn, continued to tire through the stretch. BLAME IT pulled early along the inside when
forwardly placed, stopped after a half, far back.

Footnotes
HAPPY BOY ROCKET last away, outrun for five furlongs off the inside, began to advance four wide far turn, lost some ground to the leader into the lane,
got to that one late and wore him down under firm handling. LIARS CLUB took command after the start, rated in the run up the backstretch just off the
inside, continued to show the way by daylight into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late while remaining clear for the second spot. ROUNDER
within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground the middle half when creeping a bit closer, lacked a closing punch will called on for the
drive. MAJOR CONTENDER broke alertly, pressed the runner up to that one's outside, asked along second turn, also found lacking in the run to the wire.
CROW'S NEST went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. IMMORAL in the second flight early off the inside, four wide into the far turn
when beginning to weaken, continued to falter in the drive. FETCHS BRAHM trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
INFILTRATOR within striking distance along the inside early, advanced inside to challenge along the rail midway on the turn, showed the way into the turn,
drew out through the lane under steady handling. KING DOODLE off the early pace while racing outside four wide into the turn, steered in a bit midway on
the bend to overtake an outside rival, moved out out to the four path late in the turn, rallied well out in the strip to earn the place, not a threat to the winner.
DANCIN ROCKET closest to the early leader, challenged three wide and on the outside midway on the turn, could not keep up with the winner through
upper stretch, caught late for the place. JOE BILL settled off the pace just off the inside, continued in the two path turn, improved position while not a serious
threat. MATTFOLEYVANMAN broke alertly, showed the way clear up the backstretch and into the turn, allowed the winner the rail midway on the bend,
began to weaken when headed by the two challengers in the turn. NATORADE off a step slow, raced back, passed tiring rivals. R R EMPIRE was never a
threat while racing outside. TEXAS PHAROAH tired while racing four wide. ANDREW'S VISION balked at loading, dwelt at the start, fell further and further
back, distanced after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
COLTONS DREAM away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear nearing the furlong furlong marker,
drifted out despite a right handed crop, held the runner up safe late under continued firm handling. VIOLENT GIGI void of speed while out in the strip, three
to four wide by midway on the turn, swung out further to be in the six path and widest into the lane losing considerable ground to the winner, getting to that
one steadily in the late going under brisk handling. FREUDIAN FATE broke alertly, fell back off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn,
displayed a mild amount of late interest. CHAPEL BARN settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, finished up evenly in lacking a
closing kick. MYSTERY MAN within striking distance outside, four to five wide by late in the turn, came up empty when called on for the drive. DILETTANTE
last away, trailed most of the way and was never a factor. SIDETOWN dueled up front for a half outside the winner, gave way.

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS CAPPEN forwardly placed along the inside, patiently handled when covered up in traffic with three furlongs to run, asked along when
having room midway on the bend while continuing inside, rail bid nearing the furlong ground, put a head in front late and proved game with holding off the
runner up. COROMANDEL forwardly placed up the backstretch while three wide, vied into the stretch, dueled late outside the winner, outkicked by that one
late while holding sway for the place. HONEYCAMP broke alertly, got clear before a furlongs, continued to hold a slight advantage through the turn and
upper stretch, gave ground stubbornly to the top two while between them inside the furlong marker. DRIVING dropped inside when lacking speed, continued
to save ground through the turn, improved position to the wire while not a serious threat to the top three. ELMO'S SECRET void of speed, remained back
through, asked in the two path entering the stretch, mild rally to improve position. MY MOONLIGHT LADY in the second fight while off the inside, came
three wide for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a kick. BOOTLEGGING GIRL in the second group while racing outside, four wide for the drive,
failed to muster a rally. BROOKE'S ALL IN racked in mid pack while along the inside, had little for the drive. RELENTLESS ROCKET hesitated at the break,
raced well back early, four wide through the turn, made little impact through the stretch. EBBI BLU was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
MENDELSSOHNS MARCH behind the first flight along the inside first turn, continued behind the pace into the far bend, traffic while continuing along the
rail, briefly waited approaching the furlong ground, got through, bid, edged clear. EL TOMATE off a step slow, void of speed in trailing, advanced three down
to the two path second turn, traffic, bothered a furlong out, finished willingly after recovering to annex the place. SILVER HEIST off a step slow, raced
between rivals in mid pack, came three wide for the drive, came out to lightly bump FUNNY UNCLE, lugged in past the furlong marker to tighten up inner
rivals, was straightened, finished clear of the others while outkicked for the place. B MINOR four wide and forwardly placed into the first turn, continued
within striking distance while toward the inside second turn, was idling when forced to steady when in tight between horses with a furlong to run, continued
evenly to the finish. JUDO prompted the leader while racing off the inside for five furlongs, crept a bit closer in the second turn, was beginning to tire when
he drifted in past the furlong marker, bumped in tight soon after and continued to weaken to the wire. HEROIC MOVE too, command after the start, set a
moderate pace toward, clear of trouble with a furlong to run, caved late to lose several positions. LINE TO GAIN lacked speed while racing outside, roused
when four wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing kick. FUNNY UNCLE within striking distance while four wide first turn, continued outside, was floated
out four wide by SILVER HEIST turning for home, lightly bumped with that one, had nothing left. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HEART RHYTHM in the second flight off the inside, steered out slightly to be three wide when moving closer turning for home, split foes past the furlong
marker and finished strongly to prove best. PAYNE last away, trailed early, in traffic turning into the stretch, got through, bid, gained the advantage from
between horses, could not contain the winner late. KAVOD away in good order, narrowly set the pace while between rivals, continued to hold a narrow
advantage when straightened for home, gave ground grudgingly to the top two while between them at the end. FULL AUTHORITY with the pace along the
inside, continued to vie through upper stretch, gradually weakened the final furlong. SEVEN NATION ARMY with the pace outside, came four wide for the
drive, weakened in the run to the wire. ONE FOR RICHIE back off the pace, raced four to five wide through the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
DARK AFTERNOON broke alertly, showed the way off the inside up the backstretch, shook clear late in the turn under a moderate hand ride, roused briskly
when straightened for home and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under continued firm handling. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL lacked early foot
toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive, rallied from between foes to be clear for the second spot, not a serious threat to the winner. GONE
AGAIN back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, finished well clear of the rest while slowly getting to the runner up late. SIX WHIPS forwardly
placed while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch drive. CHARLIE WHISKEY forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back into the turn and was
not a threat while going evenly through the stretch. TAP THAT DIAL void of early foot, lacked a response through the lane. SHOTGUN BILLIE in mid pack
while racing outside, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. WINDTAPPER WIN last to leave, was never a factor out in the strip. WELLWRIT
forwardly placed early while between rivals, gave way in the turn.
