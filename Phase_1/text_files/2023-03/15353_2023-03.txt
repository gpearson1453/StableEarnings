Footnotes
ALTO ROAD stalked the pace from the inside, then settled back throughout the turn to menace from the four path in the early stretch, then closed fastest to
be up just in time to prevail. BOHEMIAN BO broke outwardly and bumped rival, then was in a long drive to lead the way into the home stretch, bid gamely
down the lane but was caught in the end and was second best. PERFECT PRANK chased the pace from the inside into the turn, menaced gamely in the
early stretch and was able to hold onto the show prize in the end. TRES SOLES broke inwardly at the start and bumped rival, then raced in the middle of the
field while three wide down the backstretch and into the turn, made a mild rally in the early stretch to close well in the end. CAJUN EDDIE pressed the pace
from the three path into the turn, was in a hard drive on the turn to bid in the stretch then gave way in the end. BIG TICKET shuffled back at the start, was
unhurried early, then was moving along the inside throughout the turn to bid from the four path in the stretch. MISSIN CURFEW hopped at the start then
chased the pace while two wide, then slowly faded throughout the turn and had no final bid in the stretch. AARON'S SPIRIT settled along the inside and was
no menace.
