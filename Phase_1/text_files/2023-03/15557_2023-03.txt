Footnotes
RAMADHAAN (IRE) prompted the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm. LOVE UNLIMITED
tracked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was turned back in upper stretch, kept trying outside and was gaining
late. CONNECTING FLIGHT raced up close inside, swung four wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. DIXIE
GROOVE raced three wide in midpack and improved position without threatening in the lane. KATZ THAT GAL raced two and three wide between foes,
angled out in midstretch and never threatened. ANTRIM saved ground in range, tipped two wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. GRATIA played no
factor while racing five wide. MAGIC CALL failed to menace while racing four wide. REACHING STRIDE was outrun inside. OUR LA DOLCE VITA set the
pace along the rail and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
MISCREANT got bumped between rivals leaving the gate and rated around the three path, tipped out and ranged up from the six path around the far turn,
was cued passing the quarter and bid into the stretch, took the lead into the final furlong, and inched away under right handed encouragement. GOLDEN
BELIEF set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an outer foe into the far turn and was driven from the three path into the stretch, lost
the lead in upper stretch, but kept on to hold place. NEVER BEEN WRONG stalked in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn and
urged right handed while floating out to the seven path entering the lane, and ran on for show. DOWNBURST prompted the pace in the four path, bid under
right handed urging around the far turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. BALLROOM EYES broke out and
bumped an outer foe, trailed around the three path, tipped out to the five path passing the five eighths pole and was coaxed into the far turn, but never
threatened. BACK OFF ME bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
GAYELETTE prompted the pace in the three path, dueled between foes in the lane and narrowly prevailed. HOT FOOT SUSIE raced off the early pace,
advanced four wide around the turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner in upper stretch, dueled to the wire and just missed. ACE UP HER
SLEEVE set the pace in the two path, fought on inside of the top two to deep stretch and held on for the show. GET BY saved ground off the pace, angled
out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. PREEMPTION was off a bit slowly, rushed up inside while appearing to try to lug in throughout and weakened in
the lane. OUR LIBERTY BELLE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. MARILYN was outrun while racing four wide. LITTLE GIA pressed the
pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
READ ON set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an outer rival early around the far turn, floated out to the three path entering the
stretch, ran on and turned away that challenger passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. ELUSIVE EMPIRE prompted the pace in the four path, bid from the
three path under rousing around the far turn and received a right handed cue while tipping back out to the four path at the top of the stretch, kept on under
left handed urging in upper stretch, but was repelled by the inner winning pacesetter passing the eighth pole to finish with place. PROVISION stalked around
the three path, tipped out under a drive around the far turn and was under from around the six path at the top of the lane, and was one paced for show.
MEHLEK hit the outer side of the gate leaving, trailed in the four path around the first turn and tipped inwards to the two path down the backside, was under
rousing while shifting out to the five path rounding the far turn, but was no factor while fanning out to the eight path into the lane. ENGLISH BOB rated in the
four path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, but never threatened. MAXIMO raced off the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the three path
into the far turn, but was empty while floating out to the eight path entering the lane.

RADIANT GEM settled off the early pace while racing in the four path, advanced in the four path around the far turn, steadily gained outside and drove clear
late. BASILIA raced closest to the runaway pacesetter in the three path, advanced in that path around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch but was
outkicked by the winner. WINNING AT EASE sprinted clear in the three path around the first turn, extended the advantage while racing at the rail down the
backstretch, remained clear in the two path rounding the far turn, was collared in upper stretch but fought on inside to hold the show. TIZ IMPRESSIVE
raced off the pace three wide, advanced around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. STRONG EMBRACE failed to menace while racing three wide.
TAKE THE PODIUM trailed inside for a half, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. KAEKO was outrun inside. LA COSTA chased the
pace in the two path, was through early and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MORE THAN LOOKS steadied between foes early around the first turn and trailed from the three path into the backstretch, was ridden in the four path
midway around the far turn and began to rally while swinging out to the seven path at the top of the lane, angled in after a right handed cue into the final
furlong, and was up in the final strides. HIDDEN PATH set the pace in the two path, was roused while tipping inside early around the far turn, opened up
from the two path into the stretch, stayed on under a heavy drive through the stretch, but was caught late by a surging outer foe to place. ONE FAST
DREAM stalked in the three path, was coaxed from the two path into the far turn and was under right hand urging while tipping out to the four path into the
lane, and kept on for show. SGT. PEPPER rated in the three path, was ridden around the far turn and tipped into the two path entering the stretch, but
finished evenly. MAIN LINE CIPHER raced off the pace in the four path, received a right handed cue in the five path early around the far turn and was in the
six path at the top of the lane, but was no factor. CURLINS INCHARGE tracked in the four path, was asked early around the far turn, but did not threaten
from around the five path in the stretch. CONTINUE APACE (IRE) was fractious in the gate but broke well and prompted the pace in the four path, bid under
coaxing in the three path around the far turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, but gaveway.

Footnotes
SPIRIT WIND set the pace in the two path, angled well out in upper stretch, dug in inside of BLUEFIELD when that foe reached ever terms in upper stretch,
battled to the wire and prevailed. BLUEFIELD stalked the winner in the three path, reached even terms outside of that foe in upper stretch, dueled to the
wire and just missed. YOU LOOK COLD settled off the pace while saving ground and ran on inside of the top two. STARSHIP NALA had her head turned at
the start and was never in contention while racing two wide. CHOOSE JOY chased the top two finishers in the four path and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
YAMATO travelled off the pace under a hold in the three path, was cued right handed while tipping out early around the far turn and was in the seven path
at the top of the lane, rallied under left handed urging and surged past an inner quartet in the final furlong to win. KINENOS broke slowly and was behind in
the three path rounding the first turn, tipped out to the five path and moved up to track the pace into the backstretch, was roused from the four path early
around the far turn and floated out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. KYGO (GER) raced up close in the three path and was keen
between foes early into the backside, was under a light nudge while waiting for room rounding the far turn, shifted inside at the top of the lane, and kept on
for show. MEGACITY was fractious in the gate, set the pace in the two path, was roused when headed midway around the far turn and was in the three path
entering the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. PALAZZI rated in the two path, was cued right handed into the far turn, but failed to threaten while angling
out in the stretch. CUPID'S CLAWS prompted the pace in the four path, was cued to bid in the three path into the far turn, headed the leader passing the
quarter pole and was in the four path at the top of the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole.
