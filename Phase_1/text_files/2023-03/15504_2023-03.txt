BIGFOOT CITY sprinted clear at once, opened a long lead before going three-quarters, responded when challenged in mid-stretch and held gamely to the
wire. SHINNY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch but could not get by the winner in the drive. MYOPIC was never
far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. BAROSSA was void of early speed, saved ground through the second
turn and did not menace. THIRD WHEEL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. UNMACHABLE showed no
early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LUNAR UNIT sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch, drifted out late to bump M
G BIG MARIA and gamely prevailed. M G BIG MARIA stalked the winner while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive, was pushed out
and bumped late by the winner and finished willingly. GEEJAYTEE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with good
energy. SENT BY ANGELS raced four-wide through the first turn, was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to rally.
SKEDADDLE'S LEGACY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. THRILL TOWN raced five-wide through the
first turn, showed brief speed and weakened. STELLAR POINT showed no early speed, was pulled up into the lane and vanned off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY CONCERNING THE BUMPING BETWEEN LUNAR UNIT AND M G BIG MARIA NEARING THE WIRE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS CONDLUDED THAT LUNAR UNIT HAD COME OUT TO BUMP MG MARIA CAUSING THE INCIDENT AND WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

WILLOW settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. D K'S CROWN tracked the leaders from the
inside, checked nearing the sixteenth pole, angled out and finished willingy. CAPTAIN N. BARRON was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. SOLEROCKER was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. GOT
EVEN SMARTER lagged throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE STEADYING OF D K'S CROWN AT THE

Footnotes
RIVER ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with
complete authority. ARIZONA JEREMY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
angled out late and rallied. CHEST CANDY raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the leaders nearing the
quarter, vied and gave way through the final furlong. LOYALTY SPIRIT was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way late. MO
GEE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin soon after the opening quarter and gave way in the drive. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE
showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. WILLTOBELUCKY raced off the pacesetters early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. OSTINI lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MY CALL
was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. PISTOL POWER pressed the pace while racing four-wide and
weakened after going six furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
