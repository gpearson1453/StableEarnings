Footnotes
COMANCHE WARRIOR broke out towards open space at the start, dueled for the lead outside of a rival around the turn, assumed command entering the
lane, and drew off under driving urging. CATCHIN DRAMA broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer rival at the start, saved ground far off of the
pace, then split foes two wide in midstretch, to gain place in the final furlong. PARTY LITTLE BOY brushed the inner part of the gate while breaking over a
length slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, spun in to the lane in the four path, sustained stride to bid for place coming to the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by an inner rival leaving that station. FATHER MARK dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that one entering
the lane, and weakened. CHECK ME OUT bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked the embattled leading pair from the two path, came into the lane
between horses before shifting to the three path in upper stretch, and yielded among foes in the. CREOLE REB shook his head just before the start and
broke slowly, lagged behind in the two path, and got outrun. HEZA SEXY ZONG chased from midpack in the four path, then tired in the six path through the
lane.

Footnotes
GEM COLLECTION set the pace along the inside, drew away from an outer presser with nine sixteenths to go, opened up to a wide margin approaching the
far turn, then padded his lead under vigorous hand urging in upper stretch before being put to wraps in the final sixteenth. SIMPLY WOW lagged well behind
the rest in the two path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to gain place in the closing stages. HUMOR ME PLEASE tracked from the
two path, gained place approaching the far turn, chased the clear leader around that bend, then weakened through the lane while hanging on his left lead,
and was caught approaching the wire. HONEY'S HOPE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. COOL SPIRIT bashed his head against the gate upon
rushing it pre-race, then splayed his front feet and stumbled when the gates opened, recovered to press the pace setter around the first turn, but failed to
keep pace with nine sixteenths to go, and weakened.

Footnotes
CLEVER JOKE tracked along the inside while racing well in the git, was buried behind a wall of traffic while in the two path turning for home, smoothly
shifted to the five path for clear sailing entering the lane, offered a good kick to bid leaving the furlong grounds, and drove clear in the final sixteenth.
TIANA'S STAR (GB) tracked two wide, gained in the four path around the far turn to bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, dug in to
resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked at the sixteenth pole. SUPER COOL STORM set the pace along the inside, showed the
way around the far turn, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way to the top pair through the final furlong. JAYLA stalked along the inside, but failed to
keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch while shifting ground outwardly, and grudgingly held fourth late under an all out drive. LAYLA'S SONG tossed
her head just before the start, then reared when the gates opened and spotted the leaders many lengths, trailed, fanned from the four path to the six path
entering the lane, moved up in upper stretch, but was denied reaching fourth late. ACTING pressed the leader two wide, but failed to sustain pressure
despite coming under strong urging around the second turn, chased between horses turning for home, and weakened entering the lane. JU JU VIP lacked
speed along the inside, shifted three wide entering the backstretch, then yielded in the five path entering the lane, shied mildly from an inner rival in upper
stretch, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BUTLER CABIN broke sharply and was first into the turn, angled down into the three path, had another rival along the rail to the inside of him, stayed off his
inside rival a bit while still being a threat, committed at the half mile pole and began to start the battle, move closer to the rail while being pressured from
horses on the outside, was matching strides at the quarter pole, exchanging punches into the lane, in the last three stride the whip was put up and a hand
ride, pushing on Butler Cabin, pushing on his neck, ensued which gave him enough to stretch out and get to the wire first. WOLF HUNTER vied for the early
lead, set the pace from the rail, showed the way with pressure on the outside through out, brushed at the quarter pole with rival, fought gamely, matching
strides down the entire lane, and just missed while giving a winning effort. GHOST BIKE was slow getting into his stride, was in no hurry early, was given
the cue at the half, gained momentum slowly but surely from the rail, was in contact with the field through the turn passed up the rail after the quarter pole
was able to capture the third place rewards. REMASTERED was off the pace through out, saved ground racing along the rail, in contention after the quarter
pole, but finished flat. COAL BOSS was in the second tier early on, split horses and advanced to challenge at the three eights pole from the five path,
traveled wide through out the turn and into the lane, was still in contention at the three sixteenth pole, then faltered late. BRITE OUTLOOK raced from the
outside in the second tier just off the pace, went seven wide onto the turn, lost ground while in the turn from being caught wide, raced to make up lost
ground willingly, angled into the five path after the quarter pole but tired. BOOSTER SHOT broke fresh, went into the first turn four wide, advanced while
racing wide in the turn and onto the backside, managed to be outside in the second tier, right behind the leader down the backside, continued to chase from
that position through the second turn turn, was eight wide after the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
LUMINOUS FLIGHT bounced off an inner rival and made contact with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, cleared
an inner rival and tucked to the rail entering the turn as an outer foe sustained pressure, yet shook free of that rival entering the lane, and held sway under a
drive thereafter. BLESSED ASSURANCE prompted the pace along the inside early on, chased an outer pair of leaders into the turn, smoothly tipped outside
of the newly clear leader at the quarter pole, but lacked the needed kick to produce a bid, and held place while chasing evenly. GRACE HAZEL bumped
with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the two to three paths and between horses around the turn, got floated to the five path entering the lane while
ranging up, and chased the leader home before fending off an outer rival for show. MUCHMORETHANREADY lacked speed three wide, shifted out to the
seven path in upper stretch, rallied well as the pace held together in the final furlong, but missed reaching show at the wire. VISIONISTA laid off of the pace,
and grinded away from behind the leader through the lane, but failed to reach contention. LOUISIANA COWGIRL tracked in the four path, fanned to the six
path entering the lane, but gave way in upper stretch. BEAUTIFULGUATEMALA laid off of the pace along the inside, spun into the lane in the three path
before shifting back to the fence in upper stretch, but made little impact. MIA ANTONIA trailed and got outrun. EVERYLITTLESINGH took a bump from an
inner rival soon after the start, prompted the pace from the three path, pressed the leader from the two path around the turn, but drifted to the four path
entering the lane, and caved between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
NATIVE THUNDER settled off of the pace three wide, retreated to trail with nine sixteenths to go, regained stride turning for home, fanned to the eight path
approaching midstretch, and rallied in the outer part of the course to gain an advantage late. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) settled at the rear along the inside,
patiently awaited racing room in the two path around the far turn, surpassed an outer rival leaving the quarter pole to be behind the leading group in upper
stretch, aimed to split the leaders two wide coming to midstretch, tipped three wide at the furlong grounds for clearer sailing, split foes in the final sixteenth
to produce a bid along with an outer rival, but was outkicked in the shadow of the wire. SAILING SOLO stalked outside of the leader and from the three
path, pressed that foe from the two path around the far turn before bidding turning for home, wrestled an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by a pair of outer bidders in the final sixteenth, and saved show at the wire. FIREWATER JAKE settled off of the pace in the two path, attempted
to gain four wide around the far turn before spinning into the lane in the six path, offered a grinding charge through midstretch, but flattened out while getting
outkicked by the eventual winner entering the final sixteenth, and missed reaching show. BEAVER HAT leaned in at the start, tracked four wide, pursued
three wide and between horses around the far turn, then chased evenly among foes through the lane while hanging on his left lead. MY ROMEO LIMA set
the pace along the inside, was confronted turning for home, relinquished the advantage nearing the furlong grounds, and yielded late. HARD LOVE tracked
two wide and between horses, chased around the far turn, but faded at the three sixteenths pole. NEPOTISM was restless in the gates while awaiting the
start, tracked along the inside while a bit keen racing through the lane for the first time, settled around the first turn, but weakened around the far bend, and
was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
GIANNIS set the pace inside of a pair of pressers early on, met another foes outer bid turning for home, repelled him entering the lane, and held sway from
a rallying rival late. DIALED A DAME broke slowly, raced far back two wide, picked up stride in the three to four paths around the turn, fanned to the seven
path at the quarter pole, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but was fended off. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE pursued the main group
from the two to three paths, spun into the lane in the four path, and chased thereafter to gain show at the wire. IRONMAN RICHIE tracked along the inside,
gained outside of the top trio at the three furlong pole to bid turning for home, but was turned away upon entering the lane, and tired. MASQUERADE BALL
lacked speed along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and moved up. BUCKY BIK COIN chased two wide and between horses, but weakened
through the lane. WHISKEY GENT pressed three wide, then from between horses around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch before being eased
through the final furlong. MIDNIGHT DREAMING broke slowly and showed little.
