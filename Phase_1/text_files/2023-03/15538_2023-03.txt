DESTIN'S MISSION quickly took control, remained clear, widened in the stretch and was kept to a drive while extending his advantage. SECRET
THUNDER sluggish early, advanced wide on the turn and was just up for the place. UNION REWARD raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and finished
willingly. STORMY FIRE saved ground close up and continued well to the finish. BLACKWATER FALLS saved ground off the pace, angled wide on the turn
then flattened out. BRANDON'S SMILE chased inside and gradually weakened. BUBBY PAPERMAKER lagged far behind and was always outrun. E T'S
CODE RED trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
DEVOTED KITTEN raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn, came wide, rallied outside in the final furlong,
closed well in deep stretch and was just up for a narrow victory on the wire. CURLIN'S THRILL raced off the pace, moved up on the far turn, went four wide
past the quarter pole, rallied outside rivals to a short lead, then dug in gamely between horses in the final sixteenth and just missed. RUNNINGFORHOME
tracked the leaders racing close up on the inside, angled out on the backside, chased on the far turn, rallied into the stretch, dueled through the final furlong
and dug in gamely inside to the finish. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the backside, took over, drew clear and
weakened in the lane. LOOK OUT LAMBO vied inside for the lead, dueled on far turn and tired. MISSISSIPPI raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on
the far turn and lacked a rally. OUTRAGEOUS BET raced off the pace inside and did not factor. JUST NOD AND SMILE vied two wide for the lead, dueled
between rivals on the far turn, dropped back, was steadied at the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
FAST INTENTIONS pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn, took over soon after, pulled away, widened under urging in the stretch and
was under confident handling in the final yards. JUST STAY HOME raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside, finished well and
was closing the gap in deep stretch. LIL MISS HOTSHOT set a pressured pace on the inside, dueled with the winner entering the far turn, weakened and
then held well for third. MARIANNA QUEEN raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and had no rally.
PENANCE raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, then failed to threaten. LONDONDERRY raced off the pace on the inside, chased along
the rail on the far turn and failed to respond.

LUCK led under pressure inside, repelled challenges but was nailed nearing the wire. MAARTY'S DILEMMA trailed far behind then narrowed the gap with
good late energy. NANA'S BOOPA made a menacing outside bid on the turn, swung very wide in the stretch and finished willingly. QUEEN LUCKY outrun
early, rallied very wide then offered a mild late gain. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL chased inside and continued well without menacing. AMERICA'S PRIDE
stalked the pacesetters three wide for half a mile and faltered. DIVINE TWIST forced the pace to the stretch then weakened. FRIEDER FANATIC chased
wide and was never in contention. COLETTE'S SPIRIT dropped back after the start and raced far behind throughout.
