stretch, closed outside and was up late. TAPSASIONAL vied two wide around the first turn, cleared and angled in down the backstretch, dueled inside
around the far turn, was headed near the quarter pole, regained command in upper stretch and led until the final strides. MY MAN FLINT trailed in the two
path, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied. URBAN MYTH was keen under a hold while disputing the pace from the rail early, rated back down the
backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. JACK THE CAT saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally at
the rail. GHOST GIANT stalked the pace three wide, bid around the far turn, took a short lead near the quarter pole then weakened a bit in the lane.
DIGITAL SOFTWARE saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threated. SELFMADE raced in range three wide, advanced
three wide around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch, was eased in midstretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FIRST TEAM prompted the pace in the four path, was cued in the three path rounding the turn, bid passing the quarter pole, and floated out to the five path
at the top of the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear while tipping inwards in the final furlong. BOBBY'S CANDY brushed the outer
side of the gate at the start, rated in the three path, was roused between rivals passing the three eighths pole and under a drive while tipping out to the five
path in upper stretch, and ran on to get up for place in final strides. CHIEF ROCKA set the pace in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn and
was challenged by an outer foe while in the three path entering the lane, lost the lead nearing the eighth pole, and evened out in the final furlong to finish
with show. ANTILLEAN had an awkward start and was hustled along off the pace from the six path into the turn, was under urging from the five path into the
stretch, but was one paced. CAPT COMPLICATED tracked along the inside, was ridden from the rail turning into the lane, but faded. POKER NITE AT
TOMS chased from the five path into the turn, was asked for more around the turn, but failed to respond and did not threaten. KEYSER raced off the pace in
the five path early but failed to menace.

Footnotes
POUNCIVAL raced prominently outside of dueling rivals in the five path into the turn, took command while confidently handled from the three path passing
the three eighths pole, was cued from the four path into the lane, stayed on and opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, began to shorten stride in the
final sixteenth, and just held on under steady right handed urging for the win. MORSTACHY'S trailed in the four path and was under coaxing into the turn,
circled inner foes in the five path around the turn and took aim while floating outt o the eight path into the stretch, ran on down the center under left handed
urging for place, and just missed getting up for the win. BIG JOHN broke out and bumped an outer foe, dueled for the lead inside of foes, was coaxed along
the rail midway around the turn while losing the lead to an outer foe, shifted out to the six path into the lane, and kept on between foes for show. MCMONEY
chased in the three path, was urged between foes around the turn and angled out to the center in upper stretch, but was one paced. STUBBORN STREAK
bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was under rousing from said position around the turn, but flattened from the six path in the
stretch. SMOKIN CLOUD got pinballed between foes at the start, dueled for the early lead in the three path, was roused between while losing the lead in the
two path passing the three eighths pole, and yielded turning into the lane. NIKKI NOOTS prompted the pace along the rail, was ridden in the two path
around the turn, but did not threaten. HELLO JACK rated from the six path into the turn but was no menace.

PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) had her head turned at the start and was off two lengths slow, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far
turn, rallied outside and was up late. SMART SPENDING stalked the pace from the rail, got through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, struck the front
near the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the winner late. ROSEBUD'S HOPE set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on
between foes to the wire. MIDNIGHT BELLA prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole and was outfinished. WICKED MERCURY threw
her head just prior to the start and was off at least four lengths slow, trailed inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper
stretch and lacked a further rally. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT steadied entering the first turn, raced between foes in midpack and lacked a rally. PASSION
PLUS steadied midway around the first turn, saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. FRANKIE'S GIRL steadied
entering the first turn, chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED
THAT WICKED MERCURY WAS ACCORDED A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO START.

DREAMING OF AUDREY brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was under a drive in the four path around the turn and floated out to
the seven path into the lane, ran on to take the lead inside the final furlong, drifted out in the final sixteenth after a left handed cue and may have brushed an
outer foe, and held on. FEDALIA raced off the pace inside of foes, tipped out under rousing around the turn and was cued left handed in the eighth path at
the top of the stretch, rallied down the center, but got herded outward and was brushed by an inner foe late to finish with place. ISLAND MAGIC tracked in
the two path, was ridden from said position around the turn, and kept on from the three path in the stretch for show. CHASING JOY bumped with an inner
foe and brushed with an outer foe just after at the start, stalked in the four path, bid from the two path passing the quarter pole and took the lead while
roused in the four path at the top of the lane, but yielded inside the final furlong. SHE'S CLASSY chased in the four path, was in the three path around the
turn and under urging while shifting out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. CHECK THE GRADE bumped with an outer foe at the start, set
the pace in the two path, was roused when headed along the rail passing the quarter pole, but gaveway in upper stretch. FRANKLY MY DEAR trailed in the
five path early and never threatened. IT CAN raced from wellback in the six path and was no menace. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF FEDALIA, DREAMING OF AUDREY WAS DISQULIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT IN THE STRETCH AND
IMPEDING THE PROGRESS OF FEDALIA IN THE FINAL FURLONG COSTING A CHANCE FOR THE WIN

GLYNN COUNTY raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn but faded in the lane. NEWSWORTHY was rank early, raced wo
wide and never threatened. GRAND DAVID dueled inside a foe in the two path and faltered in the lane. MANNIX (IRE) chased the pace inside and retreated

Footnotes
TALKIN TIPSY bumped with an inner foe twice leaving the gate but recovered well to be prominent in the four path, bid while floating out to the seven path
at the top of the lane, and edged past the inner pacesetter under right handed encouragement in the final furlong for the win. GUNESH bumped with an
outer foe twice at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged passing the quarter pole and floated out to the six path in upper
stretch to meet the bid of that challenger, dug in under steady urging through the stretch, but was edged out late to finish with place. FRENCH KISSING
rated in the four path, was coaxed in the three path around the turn, moved up between foes passing the quarter and was cued while angling out to the eight
path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. PEACH COBBLER bumped with an outer foe just after the start, tracked in the two path, waited for room
rounding the turn, was coaxed while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, and stayed on. MISS SAKAMOTO stalked in the three path, was roused in
the four path entering the stretch, stayed on while tipping inwards in upper stretch, but evened out late. PARCHITA prompted the pace along the rail but
yielded turning into the stretch. DAISY BEE broke thru the gate before the start, chased in the five path, was asked rounding the turn, but failed to respond.
BABY'S DIALED IN bumped with an inner foe after the start and trailed throughout around the three to five paths.
