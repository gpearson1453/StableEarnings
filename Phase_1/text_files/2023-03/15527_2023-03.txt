NASHVILLE SKYLINE set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole but could not resist the winner late. BIG CREED was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, came out to bump PASSION OF JOE'S late and finished willingly. PASSION OF
JOE'S pressed the pace while racing four-wide, was bumped by BIG CREED late and finished evenly. CONRADO settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and weakened. FLASHIN ACES lost footing and steadied soon after the start, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE BUMPING BETWEEN BIG CREED AND PASSION OF JOE'S LATE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

SHE SAID MY WAY lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards. WHAT A WAY TO GO
lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, rallied late and just missed. PAULINA'S STAR dueled for the lead while racing five-wide and gave way
through the final sixteenth. EXTRA SAUCE was away in good order to dispute the pace with PAULINA'S STAR from the inside and gave way late.
PRINCESS JAYLEEN was off slow, checked nearing the half, moved three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. BOOSICAL LADY settled off
the leaders early, checked nearing the half-mile pole and was eased. SENSUOUS KITTY pressed the pace from between foes, clipped heels and lost jock
nearing the half and was walked off. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

CHICAGO CAT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. SASSY TINKERBELL
broke sharply to press the pace of STAR FINALITY from the inside, moved up to take command inside the quarter, opened a clear lead into the stretch but
could not match strides with the winner late. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady
bid. HERSABIGGIRL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. BEAUTIFUL MESS lacked early foot, saved
ground through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. LUTE'S DIAMOND raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through
the turn and weakened. STAR FINALITY set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BIG BARREL sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane as a
handy winner. VICTORY BOULEVARD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. PASSED BY PAUL broke sharply to chase the winner
while racing five-wide, dropped back into the stretch and showed some late run. ITS BIG lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly. STALKING SHADOW chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. KICK IT showed no early speed,
saved ground through the second turn and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
INESPERADO tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off. SWEET
SAVANT lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. BIG BROTHER
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. AMERICAN GRIT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while
setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. NEXT JOURNEY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, checked in
mid-stretch and was not a factor. FAST GALLITO raced just off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. LITTLE RED RIFLE chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. NOTACRY was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. RENEW was off
slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
