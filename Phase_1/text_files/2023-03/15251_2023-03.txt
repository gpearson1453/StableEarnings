Footnotes
ACEHIGH ROYAL with the early pace closest to the inside, fell back off the dueling leaders early in the turn, roused for the drive while continuing to save
ground, rebid up the rail, gained the nod. LAMUTANAATTY away well from the outside, pressed the issue from the four path in the run up the backstretch,
moved in a bit when dueling through the turn, put a head in front past the furlong marker, slightly larger lead late, responded when the winner challenged
from the inside late, missed the nod. SCHMOOZE away in good order, narrowly set the pace just off the inside, dueled through the turn while remaining in
the two path, first to blink late while between the top two. STILL ON THE BOOKS broke a bit slowly, steered out to be four wide by late in the turn, displayed
a mild amount of late interest. COLE SPUR off a step slow, lacked speed toward the inside early, moved out be three wide by late in the turn, lost whip into
the lane, failed to muster a rally. G T THREE FIFTY forwardly placed up the backstretch while between horses, fell back into the turn, continued to fade
down the lane.

Footnotes
WOBBERJOD broke sharp, was joined from the inside and dueled up the backstretch and through the turn, shook that rival off entering the stretch, well
clear until late, enough left to just last. FIRERY TALE broke out, was straightened to race near the back in lacking speed, came three wide out of the turn,
roused, late run to finish up willingly, narrowly missed. CARL G off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, waited behind horses early in the turn, moved
out, four wide into the lane, continued widest down the lane, also was going well at the end to be closing the gap on the winner. HOME BASE broke well,
moved up to duel inside the winner, fell back off that one turning for home, moved out, was trying to come back on that same foe while unable to contain the
next two. HEZA WILD RIDE in the second flight along the inside, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. BAKER'S MAN off a step slow,
trailed early, raced in the two path out of the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. CABOT in the second flight while racing
off the inside, had little for the drive. BAYOU SARGE lacked early foot, for wide out of the turn, faded further down the lane.

Footnotes
LITTLE FRAPPUCINO with the pace after an alert beginning, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, edged away a bid when straightened for home,
extended drive to the wire, proved best in a determined effort. ALPHA WHISKEY broke on top, pressed the issue up front outside the winner in the run up
the backstretch, moved up to join that one in dueling through the turn and into the lane, outkicked for the win late, fully extended to hold the place while
between horses at the wire. KENTUCKY BOURBON hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back, split foes three wide late in the
turn when beginning to advance, steered out a bit more to be outside the top two late, not in time. PIZZA CHARLIE lacked early foot, four wide through the
turn, improved position with some mild interest, no threat to the top three. EL GEMAR settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked
a closing kick to finish up evenly.. BOURBON ON FIRE broke back, saved ground into the lane, failed to muster a rally when called on. FAST LANE
forwardly placed early along the inside, came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
HOPING FOR A RING with the early pace off the inside, allowed the other speed to go onto the backstretch, advanced and challenged between horses
exiting the final turn, gained the advantage and drove clear. CARELESS HEIRESS with the pace while between horses early, dueled up the backstretch
closest to the inside, put the other speed away far turn to garner a larger advantage, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch the proved
no match, held sway for the second spot. CLOSE TO ME last to leave, lacked speed while saving ground, continued inside through the second bend,
finished willingly up rail to be getting to the top two at the end. LIL'S TURN settled off the pace inside, moved out and was three wide around a tiring foe
second turn, lacked a serious kick through the lane. HOUSE WRECKER forwardly placed while three wide, moved slightly closer in the second turn while
continuing in the three path, drifted stretch and flattened out. GP'S AMAZING GRACE in mid pack and outside, four wide turning for home, failed to muster
a rally through the lane. A GIRL LIKE ME failed to menace. DORITA'S HEART remained always back. HAVE I EVER contested the pace four wide into the
first turn, dueled up the backstretch outside the runner up, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
JEWELSTOWN close from the start off the inside, pressed the middle half, called on for run to take over midway on the final turn, gained the advantage,
turned back a brief bid from RACHEL'S CAPER past midstretch then held the runner up safe late under firm handling. ITWASTHISBIG forwardly placed for
five furlongs along the inside, fell back far turn, moved out turning into the stretch, roused, getting to the winner late. THE HEIGHTS void of speed while four
wide into and through the first turn, continued well wide up the backstretch, four to five wide in the second bend, rallied for the show to finish up willingly.
RACHEL'S CAPER in the second flight early three wide, continued in the second group and was once again three wide in the second bend, moved to
challenge the winner from the outside in upper stretch, failed to sustain that bid in the run to the wire. BREAD WINNER off a step slow, moved up to race in
the second flight through the first turn while saving ground, three wide into the stretch, improved a bit while not a serious threat. DARYL'S BOLT in the
second group while along the inside, moved closer in the two path in the second turn, flattened out through the stretch. DISCOVERY PEAK off a step slow,
trailed for five furlongs, two path second bend, improved position by picking off mostly tiring rivals. HARD TO COME BY remained back in failing to menace.
THE BOOKKEEPER in mid pack much of the way, gave way in the drive. PROPELLANT narrowly set the pace along the inside, stopped when headed by
the winner midway on the final turn.

Footnotes
LET'S DUET dropped inside to save some ground into the first turn, continued to race inside into the far bend, steered out three wide when beginning to
advance with a quarter remaining, angled in and finished full of run to win going away. I FEEL THE NEED last away, trailed while racing outside the winner,
carried out four wide when advancing with that one out of the final turn, remained widest through the lane and while unable to match strides with that same
foe, finished up willingly to be clear for the place. TOO PRETTY away well from the outside, narrowly set the pace in the two path, shook clear in the final
turn, continued to hold daylight past the furlong marker, proved no match for the top two late, saved the show. SHELL SHOCK a bit rank early in the first
turn when slow to settle, pressed the pacesetter from along the inside for three quarters, had little left for the drive. LADY COMMANDER back off the pace
and the inside, four wide far turn, dropped inside for the drive, failed to respond in the run to the wire. WHISKEY BLUE in the second flight while off the
inside for three quarters, gave way in the drive. MCMANSION was finished after five furlongs.

Footnotes
SUMMER SHOES broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, cleared early in the bend, moved to the rail, bit of a breather when clear entering
the stretch, held the runner up safe late under a right handed crop. KABOOM BABY broke back, raced three wide when advancing late in the turn, lost some
ground to the winner into the stretch, steadily getting to that one in the late going to finish up willingly. CONNIE K broke well, dueled up front inside the
winner, fell back off that one early in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, could not get back to that rival or contain the runner up late, remained clear of
the others. CHAI TEA void of early foot, raced three wide out of the turn, improved position down the middle of the strip, never really dangerous.
UNBRIDLED TWISTER in mid pack while racing off the inside, dropped inside late in the turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a response. RUN
FEARLESS void of speed, four down to three wide through the turn, failed to rally. HOT SPRINGS BLING forwardly placed while three wide early, began a
steady retreat before a half while remaining off the inside. HEATED ARGUMENT tired while racing along the inside.

Footnotes
FULL CHARGE settled behind the pace while off the inside, moved into a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid, took over when
straightened for home, responded when confronted by the runner up late, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. DECISION MAKER lacked early foot out in
the strip, continued unhurried into the far turn, rallied three into the lane, challenged outside the winner in deep stretch, could not get by. ZOOMER vied
early inside, prompted the issue up the backstretch, remained inside through the second turn, came back for the show while not a serious threat to the top
two in the late going. ANTIGRAVITY off a step slow, raced back and inside early, moved out, three wide into the far turn, displayed a mild amount of late
interest to improve position. MAJOR GENERAL four wide when with the pace into the first turn, continued to vie onto the backstretch, dueled, weakened in
the drive. EASTSIDE COOL broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into the lane, faltered when headed by
the winner with just over a furlong to run. DEVIL VISION hesitated at the break, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

GAR HOLE broke sharp, quickly got clear and toward the inside, showed the way through the turn in hand, rider busily checked behind him past the furlong
marker, right handed crop late, held. TWISTED DIXIE in the second flight behind the winner, continued to save ground through the turn, set down when
straightened for home, shifted out a bit approaching the furlong grounds, steadily closing the gap late. BANDIT POINT void of speed toward the inside,
shifted out when straightened for home, finished willingly while widest down the lane to be in time for the show. MRS. BEANS raced in the second flight
while racing in the two path, came up empty the final furlong. ONE TEN STADIUM raced three wide and off the pace, lacked a closing punch. BIG

Footnotes
TIVY broke sharp from the outside, pressed the early issue from the outside and three wide, dueled into the lane under confident handling, shook off the
other speed and drew out under steady handling. MY UNCLE LEON in tight to be off a bit slowly, moved up behind the pace toward the inside, came three
wide into the lane, rallied from between rivals into the lane, up for the place, no threat to the winner. BOLD D'ORO lacked early foot outside, four wide
through the turn when beginning to advance, continued a moderate rally outside to be along for the show. DARIO in mid pack and along the inside, two path
in some traffic late in the bend, dropped to the rail for the drive, improved a bit without making a major impact. HUNTSVILLE broke back, made a four wide
middle move into contention late in the turn, failed to follow through with that advance down the stretch. SHARP STICK void of speed off the inside, three
down to the two path turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve a bit while also not posing a serious threat. APRIL FOOLS ANDY in the main group
while racing off the inside, waited briefly in some traffic into the turn, went evenly down the lane when clear. VIOLENT RIVER broke out to be off a step
slow, trailed in the run up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, passed some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. BLUES ADMIRAL broke
alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, dueled turn while continuing along the inside, backed up steadily down the lane.
SWIFT CUSTOM broke in to be away tardily, remained back in failing to threaten. BEN DREAMING fell back while well wide, five wide into and through the
turn, was never a factor. RUNNINGFORCASH vied up front between horses for three furlongs and began to give way, continued to fade through the stretch.
