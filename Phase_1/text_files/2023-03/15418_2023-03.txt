Footnotes
NOT NOW tracked the speed from off the rail, coaxed around the turn in the two path, lacked room behind the leaders in upper stretch, steered out into the
clear, surged and got up in time. HEART OF THE NIGHT broke in and bumped twice, stalked two wide through the turn, drew alongside the leader in upper
stretch, took over outside the eighth pole, held a short lead over HAYLEY LEVADE into the final sixteenth and was overtaken by the winner in the closing
moments. JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT got bumped twice in the beginning, tracked two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend, steered out in
the stretch, rallied outside three rivals and missed second. HAYLEY LEVADE stalked four then three deep up the backstretch, traveled three wide through
the turn, launched a bid three deep in upper stretch, fought with HEART OF THE NIGHT into deep stretch and failed to find the needed late kick. LUNAR
IMPACT (GB) bumped inner rival leaving the gate, chased along the inside into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room behind the leaders in
upper stretch, tipped out and finished evenly late. HOT TEA settled off the pace, raced widest into the turn, angled into the three path then back out into the
lane, moved out further in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more late. STRIKINGLY also raced off the pace, angled down to
the inside, eased off the fence around the bend and entered the stretch three wide and could not rally. LULU LEMON DROP shook off a bump at the start
and sped to the front from inside, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, was overtaken nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the final
sixteenth. EMPIRE D'ORO was unhurried when lagging behind early, saved ground through the turn and never made an impact.

Footnotes
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH settled inside off the pace, moved off the rail and was ridden along through the far turn, entered the lane four wide, launched a late
bid and overtook TROUVILLE at the wire. TROUVILLE stalked two wide outside a rival then got moved out to the four path around the first turn, went three
wide into the backstretch, closed in on the leader on the far turn, bid outside into the stretch, took over with a sixteenth to go but got nailed on the line.
YOUTEYOURHONOR sped clear early then became rank on the first turn and again early on the backstretch, showed the way in the two path to the far
turn, led near the rail around that bend, met the challenge from TROUVILLE entering the stretch, resisted to the sixteenth pole then yielded late.
WHISTLER'S STYLE raced three then two wide at the back early, rounded the far tur three then four wide and weakened. MONGOLIAN PANTHER stalked
the pace along the inside then moved out three wide before angling back in some on the first turn, raced along the rail into the far turn, went three wide into
the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
VAROMA settled inside, angled out around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed fast and inhaled the runner-up in the final sixteenth and won
going away. ALOHA KITTEN stalked in the two path, bid from outside on the far turn, took over then cleared in upper stretch but was no match for the
winner in deep stretch. HARPER'S GALLOP came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, pulled and was rank early chasing off the rail, entered the lane two
wide, moved out late and finished willingly for the show honors. FEATHERS (IRE) got bumped by HARPER'S GALLOP in the beginning, tracked on the
inside early, traveled two wide and between rivals on the far turn, came in a bit in upper stretch and needed to find more while earning a minor award. LA
VIKINA cleared early and crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged around that bend and relinquished the lead to ALOHA
KITTEN stayed on to upper stretch before weakening in the furlong grounds. LADY JAE raced outside a rival at the back, got moved out by that foe and
came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SOARING SKY (IRE) broke a bit slow and lost her path at the start, began pull in the early stages,
went two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, raced in those paths again on the far turn and lacked a rally. INVINCIBELLA (GB) stalked the pace
from inside early, dropped back on the second bend and weakened.

TAHOE SUNRISE set the pace under pressure from NEIMAN to the outside, maintained a short lead along the rail through the turn and into the stretch, put
away NEIMAN at the top of the stretch, then fought with DILLINGER in the furlong grounds and held gamely to the wire. DILLINGER stalked the to pair up
the backstretch, had to steady behind the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the turn then tipped three wide and bid outside the top pair
into the stretch, kept the pressure on TAHOE SUNRISE in the late stages but could not get by. NEIMAN broke alertly then pressed the winner from outside
into and around the turn, could not kick on with TAHOE SUNRISE in upper stretch and flattened to third. MYSTIFICATION was off slow to begin then moved
up from inside, steadied along the rail at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. BLOCKED
chased four wide into the turn, moved in a bit then came four wide into the stretch and weakened. BEVERLY VISTA broke a step slow, chased three deep
into the turn, sustained an injury at the five-sixteenths pole and walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
PRINCESS BETTINA cleared and led two wide in hand early, showed the way to the far turn, pressured a bit by HAVANA ANGEL (IRE) midway around the
far turn before moving clear again near the quarter pole, spurted away when roused and urged right-handed in upper stretch, remained well clear into the
final sixteenth and coasted in nearing the wire. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) trailed two wide into the clubhouse turn, raced outside a rival up the
backstretch, swung four wide into the lane and bested the rest. TEA N CONVERSATION settled in the two path outside a rival, roused three wide on the far
turn, kept on through the lane and held the show. PARIS SECRET (IRE) was off slow and inward at the start, traveled near the back on the inside, got
boxed in near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide leaving the bend and could not rally. HAVANA ANGEL (IRE) was off slow and bumped leaving the
gate, rushed up while pulling and tossing her head early, was closest in pursuit into the far turn, put in a mild bid around the bend but could not keep up with
the winner approaching the quarter pole, then weakened through the lane. THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) was fractious behind the starting gate, broke in and
bumped rival then became rank shortly after, settled off the pace on the inside, moved closer in the middle stages, hugged the rail into the drive and
weakened.

Footnotes
CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY showed early speed two wide into the first turn, moved up to duel from outside on the backstretch, inched ahead into the far turn,
cleared inner rival with a quarter mile remaining, opened up in upper stretch and padded the lead late. TAKE CHARGE CURLY raced up close four deep
early, remained outside the top trio to the far turn, lost ground around the bend and chased three wide into the lane, kept on through the drive and was
clearly second best. EXTRA INNINGS showed early speed and moved inside, dueled with the winner up the backstretch, fought to the midway point on the
far turn then lost touch nearing the quarter pole, flattened in the lane but held the show. TRUSTY RUSTY trailed on the inside into the first turn then moved
off the rail around the bend, rounded the far turn two then three wide and failed to threaten while improving placings. TAPIT DOWN brushed with outer rival
on the first turn, stalked on the inside through the second bend and weakened. MOON TIME pressed the pace three deep, could not keep up with the
winner on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. DO IT FOR DAVE broke a step slow, brushed with rival three wide on
the first turn then had to pause when running up behind a rival around that bend, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SHE'S GOT A WAY got crowded between rivals early, checked into the turn, saved ground along the inside, rallied up the fence and drove past TOPOLINA
late. AN AGENT MISTAKE tracked off the rail, went two to three wide on the bend, moved out in the lane, surged late but was outclosed by the winner.
TOPOLINA sped clear early, challenged by AVENTAPP on the turn, cleared that rival into the stretch, led through the final sixteenth but got run down by the
top pair. AVENTAPP stalked two wide into the turn, bid outside around the bend, lost touch with TOPOLINA into the stretch but stayed on willingly to round
out the superfecta. QUICKLIKEABUNNY settled inside, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the lane, lacked room behind AVENTAPP in the final
sixteenth and could not regain momentum. PALEO'S PRINCESS stalked off the rail and was a bit rank up the backstretch, tossed her head again on the far
turn while three deep and could not launch a bid in the drive. AWESOME TAYLOR broke a step slow and dropped back, trailed three then two wide on the
turn and failed to menace. BIG BEAUTY came away slow, traveled three deep off the pace into the turn, went three to four wide around the bend and lacked
a rally. ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

PLEASANT bumped leaving the gate, pressed or dueled from outside early, fought in the two path through the turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, put
away VIRASANA in upper stretch, then fought with RUBY NELL and inched away in deep stretch. RUBY NELL stalked the top pair from outside, bid three
deep around the turn, kept the pressure on PLEASANT to midstretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. ENCLOSURE chased along the inside into the turn,
entered the lane two wide, moved out in the stretch and gained the show. VIRASANA showed speed and set the pace inside PLEASANT early, dueled into
and around the bend, was no match in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. THREE STRANDS dropped back early, raced off the rail, angled
to the rail around the bend then back out past the quarter pole and failed to threaten. MAGAZINE broke out and bumped rival, coaxed along chasing
between rivals, traveled two then three wide on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and had little left for the drive. MAHINA got pinballed leaving the gate,
chased three deep off the pace into the turn, exited the bend four wide, got floated out by MAGAZINE in the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MINISTER SHANE tracked along the inside into the turn, eased off the rail around the bend, tipped out in the stretch, rallied seven wide and proved best
late. OUBABE stalked off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, went six wide into the lane, moved out further and rallied eight wide but got outkicked by
the winner. MAMBA COOL settled off the pace, went two wide around the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied six wide but was
outclosed by the top pair. LEYAS CANDY raced along the inside near the back into the turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, looked to rally but had
to wait for room from upper to midstretch, gained a clear path and launched a late bid but was not enough. SHORTMAN was off a bit slow to begin, lagged
behind early, went three wide into the turn, came six wide into the stretch, steered out widest and rallied nine wide but was too late. ATOMIC DROP stalked
the pacesetter from outside, got floated out by the leader crossing the dirt, took over at the top of the stretch, led into the final sixteenth and yielded late.
MOOSE MITCHELL rated early behind the leader, chased outside a rival on the turn, angled out across the dirt and came six wide into the stretch,
commence a bid in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. FRANKLIN ONE STAR stalked the pace on the inside and weakened.
WHO'S CANDY sped to the front, led clear through the turn, jumped crossing on the turn and drifted out, relinquished the lead entering the drive, got
crowded between rivals in midstretch and weakened.
