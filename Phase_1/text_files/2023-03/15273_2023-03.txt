CHARGE IT JENN tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, dueled in the lane in tight quarters and
edged clear late. LADY TEUFLESBERG raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the
turn, drifted in and brushed with CHARGE IT JENN in upper stretch and dueled to the wire from there to narrowly miss. FANCYSOUL dueled on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, led the way from the two path coming around the bend and dug in the lane, giving way in the final strides. MA
MEATLOAF dueled on the inside early, raced in the four path around the turn and weakened in the lane. LOVIN LIVIN raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the five path and finished evenly. LYRICAL raced off the pace on the inside through the opening stages,
swung out to the six path for the run around the bend and never threatened. MELANCHOLY BLUES raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. SNACKSTER was reluctant to load, broke sharply and dueled between horses up the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
DISTORTED TIMES raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far
turn and dueled to the wire to just hold the win. TAKEOVER KASH bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first
bend, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second turn and dueled to the
finish, just missing. LORD OF THE NILE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far bend and
gained ground late while never threatening the top two. URBAN BEACH bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, trailed the field while saving
ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up while racing on the rail around the far bend and continued to improve position in the lane.
TRAVEL GUIDE saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and showed
no kick. FROSTY WARRIOR was bumped hard and squeezed back leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half
mile, swung out to the five path for the run around the second bend and never threatened. THE POINT ROAD raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path and made no bid. MOTANAAFER raced at the back of the
pack in the two path through the opening half mile, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the far turn and was empty from there.
WILLWORKFORFOOD saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and tired quickly in the
stretch.

Footnotes
KUHL STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn, gained ground in the
lane and kicked clear late. ALL FOOLS DAY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, continued
to show the way from the two path coming around turn, dug in in the lane and was caught late. JACKSON STRONG stumbled and bumped with the horse to
his outside at the break, moved up to stalk the leaders in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and kept on to the finish. FREELANCE
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the two path and improved position in the
lane. GOT EM THINKING raced off the pace up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the five path around the turn and continued to improve
position mildly in the stretch. THEJIGISUP raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, came around the bend in the three path and improved position
mildly in the stretch while drifting significantly and never truly threatening. ANY MINUTE chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three path and faded in the lane. TEN MILES HIGH bumped with the horse to his inside and was forced back leaving the gate, recovered to
track the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the bend and tired from there. AS DE ORO COCO veered in and
bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses early, came around the turn in the three path and was
empty in the stretch. BRONX chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and tired in the lane.
JAMA DILLON raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, navigated the bend from the four path, swung wide into the stretch
and was never a factor.

around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the wire. THE SKIPSTER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and gained ground in late stretch. ALYANAABI dueled on the inside
around the firs turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home.

passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. HEREBY raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, continued around
the second turn still in the three path and finished evenly. EXUMA (IRE) raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the

on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the four path and never threatened. REBEL EMPIRE raced in the two path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, came around the second bend still in the two path and weakened from
there. SILENT SONATA saved ground early, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the four path and made no bid.
