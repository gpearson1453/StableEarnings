Footnotes
JAYCEE broke alertly and was sent to dictate terms in the early stages, set moderate fractions while extending the lead approaching the quarter marker,
held safely to mid-stretch and kept to task in the final sixteenth to prevail. TIZ A TIGER chased the moderate pace from the inside, ran evenly to the furlong
marker, closed well in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held for the place. CLOCHARD STREET hopped at the start and was
away a step slowly, stalked the moderate pace while three deep on the turn, could not match strides with the top pair in the stretch run and held for the show
in the final stages. SMILIN EVIE raced close to the early pace, lost position while two wide on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and gave way in the final
furlong. MISTICAL SURPRISE bobbled a bit at the start, lacked early speed and did not threaten.

Footnotes
DR WYSONG unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, rallied along the inside in mid-stretch, confronted SHERILINDA inside of
the furlong marker, made a late push to get by that rival and held in a drive to prevail. SHERILINDA sent after a good beginning, was well rated through
moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the lead heading to mid-stretch, was confronted inside of the furlong marker by DR WYSONG, met that
bid to deep stretch and was outfinished in the final strides, while besting the rest. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) raced in the second flight into the first turn,
advanced along the backstretch run and stalked the pace from the rail into the far turn, continued to gain heading to the quarter marker, was outkicked in the
stretch run and just held for the show in the final strides. ZABAVA allowed to settle in the early stages, was well placed into the second turn, raced three
then four wide into the stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker, made a mild late bid but lacked the needed late response and just missed for the
show spot. SECRET SQUARE was forwardly placed into the first turn, advanced to keep close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped
back leaving the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
POLACCO broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, was well handled through moderate fractions to the second turn, drew to a clear lead in
upper stretch and was ridden out in the final furlong as much the best. HEAT N REHEAT took back off of the early pace, stalked the moderate pace through
the backstretch run, raced two then three wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive and closed to secure the place. BROOKYS TAPIT
was allowed to settle, raced in the second flight while not far back through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch, re-rallied in the final furlong and was clear for the show. ROARING TIGER was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions to
the half-mile marker, lost ground to the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, chased POLACCO to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages. THE
CALABRESE KID was a bit keen in the early stages, settled along the backstretch run, lost ground heading to the far turn and gave way in the stretch. SKY
DINSKI lacked early speed, raced two wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST was allowed to settle early on, improved position while five wide on the second turn, overtook the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker
and held sway in deep stretch over the oncoming runner-up. MISS EVER READY unhurried in the early stages, was roused along the far turn, mounted a
six wide bid into the stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final sixteenth but finished well and bested the rest. DANCE LADY raced four wide into the
first turn, tracked the moderate pace while three wide through the backstretch run, came three wide to the quarter marker, weakened in the drive and just
held for third. DRESS REHEARSAL chased the moderate fractions, was well placed into the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, did not offer a late
rally and just missed for third. LIGHT UP was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate fractions to the quarter marker, lost position at
mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. APPLAUD THE BENCH hustled from the inside leaving the break and established the early lead, set moderate
fractions through the backstretch run, was well handled to the top of the lane, could not hold off SHANGHAI MIST nearing the furlong marker and tired in the
late stages.

Footnotes
IDIOT'S GOLD tracked the decent early pace, advanced while two wide on the turn, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, switched leads inside of the furlong
marker, was kept to firm urging to deep stretch, responded in the final stages and determinedly prevailed. KERRY GOLD chased the decent early pace,
advanced while three wide on the turn, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, vied between runners to deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while
holding on for the place. GALLAND DE BESOS broke in at the start and crowded DAZZLE THE COMMAND, chased the decent pace to the turn, gained
ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch, vied for the lead in mid-stretch and took a narrow advantage into the final
furlong, hung in deep stretch and was outfinished for the top two positions, while clear of the rest for the show. STANFORD GRAD showed good early
speed and dictated terms to the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DAZZLE THE COMMAND was crowded at the start by GALLAND DE BESOS and was off a step slowly, rushed up to chase the early pace, saved ground
to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TWO TWELVE broke a half-step slowly but recovered nicely and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions to the turn while opening a clear lead, drew to
a long advantage nearing the quarter marker, drew off in the stretch run, was given a few reminder taps in mid-stretch, was hand urged in the final sixteenth
and was geared down in the late stages as much the best. DADDYS NINA chased the solid pace from the inside, closed in the final furlong, was no match
for the winner in deep stretch and kept on to be best of the rest. ZAKKIYYAH broke alertly, lost the early lead to TWO TWELVE and chased that rival
through solid early fractions, ran two wide into the stretch, was outfinished for place in the final stages and held on for the show. PETE'S INFERNO chased
the fast pace while outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide into the stretch run, improved position late but could not muster the needed late response.
DIZZY DAZMURA was shuffled back at the start and off a step slowly, chased from the second flight, raced three wide to the quarter marker and did not
threaten in the stretch run. LADY BLACKBIRD lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker and was not a factor. TYCHE AWAITS YOU was
unhurried in the early going and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST forced in at the start, bothering ANNA'S MUSIC, raced near the rear of the field through the early stages, made gradual forward progress
down the backstretch and built momentum through the far turn, emerged from the stretch on the outside of a three horse battle for the lead, quickly overtook
those rivals and drew off in the final furlong while being taken in hand in the final yards. POUR ON THE COLE broke in at the start, forcing ECOLOGIST into
the path of ANNA'S MUSIC, tracked the pacesetter in the two path around the first turn and down the backstretch, came under a ride with three furlongs to
run, had a share of the lead turning for home and ran on well to the wire but could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth. ON RAGLAN
ROAD hustled from the outside and allowed to grab the early lead and set slow fractions to the far turn, responded to challenges at the top of the stretch
and ran on well to the furlong grounds and gave way. BABY FRANKIE tracked the slow pace close up while under a bit of a hold, moved closer passing the
half-mile pole, made a challenge for the lead at the head of the stretch, battled on in the middle of a trio of contenders then gave way with a furlong to run.
IMPLICITLY was not asked for speed from the break, raced mid-pack and two wide down the backstretch, maintained position to the far turn, was asked for
more three furlongs out, loomed a threat to the furlong marker then could not keep up late. AWE hit the gate at the break then had to steady when ANNA'S
MUSIC came over from the outside, trailed the field throughout, ran on the wrong lead down the stretch and was never a factor. ORCZY (IRE) broke in and
steadied slightly when ABBEY OOPS came over from the inside, lacked any early speed, saved ground to the far turn, came under a hard ride from the
three-eighths marker, swung to the three path on the turn for home and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PACIFIC ZIP broke alertly then took back off of the decent early pace, was roused leaving the three-quarters marker and mounted a four wide bid into the
stretch, assumed command in upper stretch, ran on the left lead to the sixteenth-marker, was engaged in deep stretch by the runner-up and just lasted for
the win. MISS IVES chased the decent early fractions, advanced while two wide on the turn, waited a bit for racing room heading into the stretch, slipped to
the inside for the drive, closed well inside of the furlong marker, confronted PACIFIC ZIP in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest.
ANNA'S MUSIC was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the decent pace while between runners on the turn, chased PACIFIC ZIP to mid-stretch,
could not keep pace with the top pair in the final stages and held safely for the show. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA lacked early speed, advanced three wide
on the turn, made a steady gain in the stretch run and closed willingly in the late stages. KOKO'S MOM was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved
position while three wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and offered a mild late rally. LINGER unhurried in the early
going, tipped two wide for the drive, improved position in the stretch and made a mild late bid. CHEATER'S WALTZ raced close to the decent early pace,
disputed the decent fractions while three wide nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. ABBEY OOPS
showed speed in the early going and set the pace to the turn, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faltered in
the final furlong.
