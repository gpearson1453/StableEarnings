RIVERBOAT BANDIT was well rated early, made a four wide move on the turn, then dueled for command and had a long drive and slowly edged clear to
prove best, driving. DR GREENTHUMB was well placed early two wide, made a bid between rivals on the turn three wide, then dueled to the inside of the
winner by the quarter pole but was out kicked in a game try. DON'T QUESTION ME was reserved early, advanced four wide on the turn and then had a mild
late rally to best the rest. BARN SWALLOW pressed the pace and was on the inside on the backstretch and tired. TAKING WHAT'S MINE set a pressured
pace two wide and gave way on the turn. QUINCY ADAMS showed little.

UPSTATE AND BACK was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and advanced, then closed well up the inside under strong handling to get up in time to
prove best. ORGANIZED CHAOS set a fast pace and drew off on the turn while in the two path, then remained clear by the furlong marker but was caught
late, good effort. KAZ PALACE was climbing early, then shifted to the outside and was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and then
finished well late. NEON SIGN chased the early pace in between rivals, then made a mild bid two wide on the turn and faded in the drive. SUPER ROCKER
was off slowly, came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. MY BLUE EYES stalked the early pace three wide and in between rivals, then steadied
leaving the three eighths and weakened. STRAWBERRY TREAT failed to menace. MOBEER bobbled at the start, then chased the pace four wide, made a
mild bid three wide on the turn and then was empty. EDWARD MADDEN tracked the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
DESI'S REWARD was well placed early, then advanced two wide on the turn and made a three wide bid off the turn, hit the front nearing the furlong marker,
then drew off smartly in the furlong grounds to prove much the best while being ridden out. LITTLE MOOJI was away alertly to set the pace while clear, then
was headed nearing the furlong marker and proved to be no match for the winner, saved place award. TRAJEC HOLIDAY chased the pace four wide,
angled in leaving the five sixteenths to be on the inside by the quarter pole, then shifted off the inside in the lane and missed the place award, bested rest.
FINISHING TOUCH stalked the pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and weakened. LITTLEMISSKNOCKOUT was reserved early, advanced
four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had no late rally. OBER DARE lacked a rally. SCARLET WARRIOR failed to menace. SHUL
bumped at the start, showed some early lick in between rivals and then stopped.

and gained a short lead by the furlong marrker and slowly edged clear to prove best, driving. PLATINUM PROMISE was away alertly to set the pace while
clear, was headed by the quarter pole, then ran on gamely but was outfinished by the winner, second best. TROPICALDEPRESSION broke in the air at the
start and was far back early, advanced four to fiver wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally to gain the show award. UNION
RALLY steadied after the start, chased the pace and came three wide into the lane and needed a rally, missed show award. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE stalked
