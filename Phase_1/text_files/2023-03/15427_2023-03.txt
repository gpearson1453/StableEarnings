Footnotes
SAXON SAGA rated off of the decent early fractions, raced three wide into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, made a bit of headway nearing
mid-stretch, closed fast in the final stages, caught MR. FIGHTER inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. MR. FIGHTER
hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, was sent to contest the early pace and dueled for the lead into the turn, assumed command along the bend
and set decent fractions to the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong marker, was confronted inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not hold
off SAXON SAGA in the final stages and held for second. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early stages while outside of rivals, tracked
the decent pace while three wide on the turn, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, made a mild late rally but lacked the needed late response and was
clear in the end for third. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, was not able to impact the leaders in the final
stages but showed good late interest. CHILLY WILLY was prominent in the early going and contested the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter
marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way. BIG DIFFERENCE chased the early pace from the inside, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the
final furlong.

LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM broke alertly, ceded the early lead to HONEYMOONZ OVER and stalked that rival into the turn, advanced to press nearing the
quarter marker, battled with HONEYMOONZ OVER to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong pole, kept to task to deep stretch, was confronted
inside of the sixteenth-marker and dug in in the final stages to prevail in a blanket finish. LARRY'S LEGEND chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost
position approaching the quarter marker, advanced along the rail in upper stretch, came in tight at the furlong marker, shifted out inside of the furlong
grounds, closed fast in deep stretch, vied between rivals in the final stages and just missed for the win, while winning the nod for second. TERRY'S BOY
chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, improved position while three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
pole, finished well in the late stages and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. HONEYMOONZ OVER showed good early
speed and dictated terms into the turn, set fast fractions while pressured to the quarter pole, battled for the lead with LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM to mid-stretch
and weakened in the final furlong. FOREIGN PROTOCOL lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, showed good late interest but was unable to impact the leaders in the final stages.

SUPERMAZEL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, dictated terms while off of the rail into the
second turn, drifted out in upper stretch and raced four wide to the furlong grounds, continued to drift out in deep stretch, felt pressure in the final stages
from the runner-up, met that bid and quickened in the final strides to hold on for the win. CAISSON was allowed to settle in the early stages, maintained
position through the backstretch run, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch and brushed with TEX HANLEY,
gained ground nearing the furlong pole, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. TEX HANLEY took back off of the
moderate early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, drifted out in upper stretch and brushed with
CAISSON, came three wide into the drive, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, was outfinished by the top pair in the final stages and held safely for the
show. EL JOY was unhurried in the early stages, trailed through the backstretch run, raced four wide into the far turn, swung six wide for the drive, was
gaining in the final furlong but could not reel in the top three in the late stages. GROSS PROFIT tracked the moderate early pace, raced three wide into the
backstretch run, maintained position to the quarter marker, came five wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. YOU KIDDING ME was forwardly
placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, pressured the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, swung four
wide into the stretch run and gave way in the drive.

PERSUASIVE LIPS tracked the solid early pace while closest to the loose pacesetter, came within aim of SO MUCH HAPPY nearing the quarter marker
then overtook that foe in upper stretch, was set down for the drive and held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, was confronted in deep stretch by GETTIN
SIDEWAYS, was kept to firm urging and determinedly prevailed over the runner-up in the final stages. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was unhurried in the early
going, improved position while three wide entering the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied in the drive, came within aim of
PERSUASIVE LIPS nearing the furlong pole, drew to even terms with that rival in deep stretch and was denied for the win in the final strides, while besting
the rest. A NEW PEACE settled in the second flight in the early stages, saved ground into the far turn, was not able to impact the top two in the stretch and
offered a mild late bid to secure the show. ZELAIA rated off of the solid early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the
second turn, came three wide into the drive, finished evenly in the final furlong and just missed for the show. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU was allowed to settle,
raced four wide into the second turn, slipped to the rail heading into the stretch and did not threaten. SO MUCH HAPPY broke alertly and dictated terms in
the early stages, set solid fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in
upper stretch and faded in the drive.

TRIPOLI broke well then ceded the lead and was content to track a few lengths behind the leading pair, was always traveling well while saving ground to the
far turn, asked to go after the leaders approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, launched a rally and
chased a game LAMMAS (GB) the length of the stretch and got up by the narrowest of margins. LAMMAS (GB) away well, seized the early lead into the first
turn, led the field through reasonable fractions while being pressed by LONG LANCE, fended off a bid by that one at the top of the stretch, opened up a
clear lead mid-stretch, was challenged to the outside by TRIPOLI, finished with determination but came up just short. LONG LANCE off a step slow, went
three wide into the first turn while pulling the rider to the front, pressed the pacesetter LAMMAS (GB) to the far turn, made a bid for the lead with three
furlongs to run, could not keep up with the top pair in the stretch but held third. HARMON outrun to the first turn, raced close to the leading pair while
alongside TRIPOLI down the back stretch, was being ridden a bit to keep up from the five furlong marker then came under a hard ride inside the three
furlong pole, swung four wide into the stretch and was unable to make any headway in the stretch.

MUCHA WOMAN broke out at the start and crowded O'NEILL'S LEGACY, recovered to show good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set decent
fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch and kept to task while remaining clear to the finish. TIGER QUEEN
chased the decent early fractions from the inside, made up a bit of ground along the turn, advanced in upper stretch while remaining on the rail, was not
able to make headway on the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. KITTY'S CANDY chased the early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the
turn, swung three wide for the stretch run, was gaining in the final furlong and was up for third in the final strides. GOING TO SHABOOMS was crowded at
the start by O'NEILL'S LEGACY, chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the
stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied in deep stretch and missed for third. O'NEILL'S LEGACY was crowded at the start by MUCHA
WOMAN, tracked that rival through solid early fractions to the turn, ran two wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and weakened in the
drive. MIRACLE IN MOTION chased from the rear, raced three wide into the turn, swung five into the stretch and lacked a late rally.

LOOKOUT POINT broke alertly then took back off of the early pace, settled in the second flight through the backstretch run, made a steady advance to the
quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, came within aim of MACHO CHROME nearing the furlong marker, continued to advance nearing the
sixteenth-marker, vied between rivals in the final stages and determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail. ASANO'S BACK settled in the second flight in
the early going, was well placed through the backstretch run, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was steered four wide into the stretch, made up a bit of
ground nearing the furlong marker, rallied in deep stretch, matched strides with LOOKOUT POINT to the wire and just missed for the win, while earning the
nod for second. MACHO CHROME was asked to show early speed and led the way into the first turn, was well rated through the backstretch run while
setting moderate fractions, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker while under firm
urging, met the bid of oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was gamely bested on the wire, while clear of the rest for third. HICKORY WIND was forwardly
placed in the early stages, prompted the moderate pace to the far turn, confronted MACHO CHROME nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in
the drive, chased to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. RULER OF ANGELS settled in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run,
was well positioned into the second turn, was hard to place and tried to get out nearing the quarter marker, recovered in the the stretch run and offered a
mild late bid, while unable to threaten. BARHOPSKY chased the moderate pace from a ground saving position to the quarter marker, swung out for the drive
and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
BANDERA AZTECA chased the quick early pace from the inside, made a steady gain along the turn, continued that advance to mid-stretch, came within
aim of AUTISM BLUE nearing the furlong marker, responded to steady urging and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. AUTISM BLUE showed
early speed and was prominent in the opening stages, pressed the fast pace to the turn, dueled from the inside to the quarter marker, shook free in upper
stretch, kept to task to deep stretch, was all out inside of the sixteenth-marker and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while holding safely for second.
GRIT AND CURIOSITY was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, loomed nearing the furlong marker, came in tight and waited
for racing room at mid-stretch, found room inside of the eighth pole, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and held
safely in the end for third. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL chased the fast early pace, gained ground on the turn while four wide, swung five wide into the stretch, lost
position nearing the furlong marker and could not muster a late response. SIERRA MELODY contested the quick early pace, pressed the fast pace on the
turn while between runners, lost position approaching the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages. AWESOME DUDE lost his path at the start, took
up and was off slowly, rushed up to chase the pace to the turn, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker, came six wide into the stretch and did not
threaten in the late going. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke alertly, showed good early speed and set a pressured pace to the turn, dueled through quick
fractions to the quarter marker, dropped back leaving the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES ducked in after the break, bothering STARSHIP CHEWBACCA, emerged from the messy start to the inside in good position down the
backstretch run, moved closer to the pacesetter through the turn then responded to a strong ride through the stretch and gained the upper hand inside the
sixteenth. EVENEREVENWORSE broke out and mutually brushed with I'M A LUCKY MAN who had broke in, quickly set out for the early lead and opened
up a clear advantage, was taken in hand for the run through the turn, responded when asked to quicken passing the quarter pole, ran on well to the wire but
could not hold off the winner. THUNDER OF ZION last away from the gate, lagged behind the field down the backstretch, switched to the inside for the run
through the turn, got a clean run into the stretch and finished up well, improving position to the wire. FAST PER SE broke well, tracked the leader through
the turn, took a clear path on the rail into the stretch and ran on well under a strong ride but was unable to crack the top three. ENOS SLAUGHTER came
away from the gate in good order, did not show any early speed, raced near the rear of the field while four or five wide down the backstretch and through the
turn, ran on well down the stretch and was gaining ground at the wire. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA shied away from SAINT IVES at the break causing a chain
reaction with HANDR'SDREAM and EVENREVENWORSE, got in good position early then was forced to alter course near the half-mile pole when FAST
PER SE took the path, raced four wide around the turn then came under a hard ride from the quarter pole and did not have much left. I'M A LUCKY MAN
broke in and brushed with EVENREVENWORSE at the break then steadied off heels, recovered and rushed up the rail into contention then steadied again
just past the five furlong pole, came under a hard ride from the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. HANDR'SDREAM broke out, then steadied
after bumping with STARSHIP CHEWBACCA, spotted the field a head start then gradually moved into contention on the turn while racing three wide, floated
out to the five or six path entering the stretch and finished evenly while unable to improve position.
