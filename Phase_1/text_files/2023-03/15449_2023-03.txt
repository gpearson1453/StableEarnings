GOLDBRIDGE settled in behind to track saving ground through the first turn, moved out while advancing on the leader on the far turn coming up to that one
three wide, struck the lead outside the eighth pole, inched away and was kept to the task. TREASURE COAST set the pace racing off the rail into the first
turn, was pressured leaving that bend and up the backstretch before edging clear before the far turn, was challenged at the top of the stretch, overtaken,
kept on willingly but was no match for the winner while second best. STAPLETON SONG rated in behind the leaders racing off the inside, moved out four
wide coming to the quarter pole and gaining to within striking distance but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. CLINTON QUARINTINO stalked
from outside racing mostly three to four wide, failed to rally. BARN SHARK pressed the pace outside three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
EURO TRACKING bobbled slightly at the start but went forward to set the pace racing off the rail, faced pressure from an inside rival, dispatched that foe
then faced pressure from an outside rival late on the turn, turned back that one and kicked clear. FORT NECESSITY moved up inside heading to the turn,
shifted out to go three wide on that bend, drew along the flank of the eventual winner but was no match. SWORD OF GOLD raced near the inside off the
pace and improved position. ROWDY GALE was off the inside part of the track and needed more. TOMMY TSUNAMI stalked from outside four wide,
weakened. MISTER TYRO was encouraged forward, pressed the winner from inside, came up empty. HORNS DOWN was reluctant to load, got away
slowly, lacked early speed, lost the irons at some point and was distanced, crossed the wire and walked off.

RAINBOWS ARE FREE tracked in behind racing off the rail, moved out to commence a rally four then five wide on the far turn, struck the lead outside the
three-sixteenths, drifted in a tad in upper stretch and edged clear under steady handling. NORDIC QUEEN vied two to three wide between runners, dueled
inside a rival but off the fence drifting out a bit turning for home, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on to preserve the place. SPELL FREEDOM
contended outside three to four wide, was carried out a bit leaving the far turn and in a bit tight in upper stretch while beginning to weaken, lacked the
needed late kick. TOSH settled inside, came off the rail and passed tired rivals. MISS ARKANSAS was strongly urged at the break but lacking speed, raced
several paths removed from the rail, advanced some on the far turn but faded thereafter. SPLITSECONDECISION was in range early pursuing from outside
four to five wide, moved out further on the far turn and weakened. MISS CARMEN CIBO prompted the pace from inside the opening three furlongs, steadily
weakened. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SPELL FREEDOM AGAINST NORDIC QUEEN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

CASINO QUEEN set the pace in the clear racing off the rail into the turn, was challenged turning for home and through upper- to mid-stretch but dug in
under urging to turn back that rival. EXCETERA stalked from outside, was encouraged a bit midway on the turn going four wide on that bend, drew even by
the top of the stretch, dueled but was repelled. TAYLOR'S VISION settled off the pace, fanned six wide into upper stretch and improved position while no
match for the top pair. ACERTIVE MISS raced off the pace near the inside early, came out for the stretch run and kicked on mildly. STRONG WOMAN
chased from between runners into the turn, moved out from three to five wide late on that bend, failed to rally. WIREWIREWIRE brushed the gate and got
away slowly, raced toward the back outside, failed to menace. DAKAMO ROSE chased from inside foes but off the rail, began to weaken at the
seven-sixteenths. CUPIDS LOVE was outsprinted racing inside, came out six wide for the stretch run and was unable to threaten.

DANCING DEVIL moved forward inside the early leader to take command while racing off the inside part of the track nearing the half, edged clear on the
turn, widened in the stretch under moderate urging. BLUEGRASS BREEZE set the early pace racing wide, continued to shadow the leader then chase three
wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to maintain the place. AQUIMINE switched out in the early going, stalked from well off the inside, went four to five
wide on the turn and in range coming past the quarter pole but had no late kick. RACE DAY REBAL switched out racing quite wide in the early going, shifted
in and failed to rally.

MAJESTIC LIAISON, who was very hard to load, forced out and veered at the break, settled well outside, advanced four then five wide on the turn, was
gaining too late and just missed. BABY LIAISON bumped the outer rival at the start, switched out off the inside, went two wide on the turn, advanced into
upper stretch then moved out four wide and evened out in the lane. HAMMER DOWN prompted the pace from outside three wide into the turn, weakened in
the stretch. TRUE DOMINUS was bumped hard at the start, outpaced early, swung eight wide for the drive and improved position. C C'S LEGACY was in
range mid-pack into the turn going three to four wide on that bend, weakened thereafter. AWESOME OUTLAW showed early speed inside, steadily dropped
back and faded.

NOTARY was urged at the break and at the fore inside rivals heading to the first turn, came out early on that bend bumping a rival and steadying slightly
dropping back to mid-pack, continued inside foes up the backstretch but just off the rail, sought room leaving the far turn, came out at the three-sixteenths
for room, took aim and struck the lead a furlong from home and edged clear under steady handling. THOUGHT was caught four wide and
forwardly-positioned into the first turn, pressed the pace dueling outside a rival on the far turn going three wide on that bend, took a narrow and brief lead
while drifting out a bit turning for home and in upper stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch and second best. HAPPY ROMANCE tracked just in behind the
early leaders, moved up inside foes about the nine-sixteenths, dueled on the far turn, was outkicked in the stretch. GOSPEL MUSKETEER was in a bit tight
at the start, settled off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, came out a bit for the stretch and improved. INCA EMPIRE was within range stalking from
the second flight between runners up the backstretch and going three then four wide on the far turn, kept on evenly in the stretch. POKER PLAY stalked
from outside mostly five wide, failed to rally. SMOKING GUN pursued from outside the second flight travelling mostly four to five wide, failed to menace.

in a bit tight at the start and failed to threaten. BIG SKIPPER was bumped at the seven-eighths, pressed the pace from inside but off the rail, came up

Footnotes
ROMANCER was forced out at the start, settled well off the leaders in the back half of the field, swung six wide beginning an advance turning for home,
drove past late. FREER was forwardly-positioned, dueled inside a rival from the nine-sixteenths, continued that duel till late stretch, edged the dueling
partner but was outkicked by the winner. ROBERT'S GHOST dueled outside, was outkicked by sparring partner and the winner. ELUSIVE FREUD stalked
from off the inside going three to four wide on the turn, kicked on evenly. MAJOR GRIFFIN was forced out a bit at the start, raced off the inside in the three
to four path on the turn, moved out further for the stretch run and needed more. RUNQUIETLY was very reluctant to load, broke a half-step slowly, switched
off the inside, failed to menace. PISSARRO'S MANDATE broke outwardly, tracked from inside just off the dueling pair into the turn, came out for the drive
and weakened. WHO'S BIG DADDY steadied at the start, was outpaced and distanced.

Footnotes
MIRANDEN was quick to the lead to set the pace racing off the rail, responded when asked and drew off in upper- to mid-stretch then held safe. HOPGUN
pursued from between runners two wide up the backstretch, asked for more about the five-sixteenths, advanced inside a foe in upper stretch then came out
a path, was gaining but too late. JUST OKIE chased between runners, went three then four wide on the turn, kept on for show honors. GOSPEL TRUTH
pursued from outside four to five wide, went evenly and made no bids. MINGUS chased from inside, failed to rally. CRAZY LOVER was in pursuit four to five
wide and failed to rally. BIG CITY BOY moved forward up the backstretch, was within range three wide on the turn but came up empty. FURIOUS
AVENGER shifted in, saved ground but failed to threaten. PRAIRIE DOLLAR raced outside a foe at the back and was not a factor.
