Footnotes
CRYSTAL CRESCENT broke with the field, stalked the leader from the outside, advanced and took over outside the leader turning for home, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. BAD OUTLOOK outrun in the early going, came four wide out of the turn, set down, finished
willingly to be up for the place in the final strides. MO SILVER broke out, with the early pace along the inside, fell back off the two leaders turn, moved out a
bit for the drive, chased the winner past the furlong, caught late for the place. AIN'TNOSWEETIE back off the pace, three path into the lane, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing kick. G MONEY LIV with the pace outside, briefly shook clear early in the turn, raced on equal terms with the winner
into the stretch then faltered. JERI DAWN void of speed while racing three wide, failed to muster a rally for the drive. ADELE'S BLING flashed some brief
early foot along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
UNDECODED prompted the issue early off the inside, advanced and dueled the middle half mile, came three wide out of the final turn, slightly larger
advantage inside the furlong marker, just enough to hold off the runner up in the final jump. XYLOPHONE off a step slow, showed no early foot off the
inside, four wide when asked out of the second turn, finished with good resolve to narrowly miss. IPSUM GRATUS in the second flight for over five furlongs
outside, crept closer and challenged on the outside midway on the final bend,, floated out to the four path by the winner when vying with that one into the
stretch, weakened a bit the final furlong, saved the show. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL behind the pace while just off the inside, continued in the two path through the
final bend, split foes in upper stretch to get closest, flattened out in the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. MUMBLEBEE away best of all, set or
forced the pace four six furlongs closest to the inside, faltered when the real running began turning for home. DUCHESS BUBBLES forwardly placed for a
half along the inside, backed up. EVERYOTHERWON lacked speed, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
UNDER THE GUN bumped with EASY BIG BOY just after the start, sat behind that same rival in the second flight, in traffic late in the turn, steered out for
room entering the stretch, set down, drifted in when rallying, up in time. VICTORY MARCH in the second flight early inside the winner along the rail, traffic
late backstretch, continued to save ground turn, got through along the rail nearing midstretch to challenge, lugged out to tighten BLOW TORCH and
MASTER OF ARMS, could not contain the winner late while outkicking the next two in the waning strides. BLOW TORCH broke well, narrowly set the pace
up the backstretch and through the turn inside, allowed the runner up the rail entering the stretch, tightened up by late one late, bumped, narrowly held the
show. MASTER OF ARMS pressed the issue from the outside for half, continued to vie past the furlong marker in the three path, also put in tight late,
outfinished for the show. FAMILY TRADITION lacked early foot, three to four wide through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. EASY BIG BOY
bumped with the winner just after the break, vied up front while between horses, faltered in the late going. TOUCH CODE trailed while racing four wide
throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GOZILLA dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear into the stretch, maintained daylight while being kept to task. SLAM DUNK
SERMON in the second flight while between horses, tipped out a bit to be three wide into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker while out in
the strip, could do little with that one the final furlong while proving clearly second best. LAKE RADIO in the second flight inside, came in the two path for the
drive, proved no match for the top pair. BIG NICK dueled up front while along the inside, weakened in the drive. MOJO MAN moved outside, raced four out
to five wide into the stretch, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. WINDCRACKER in the second group while racing outside, four wide midway
on the turn, tired. TOTALIZER off a step slow, remained back while saving ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BLACK APPLE lacked early foot, three wide into the far turn, made a strong four to five wide move into contention late final turn, outside bid approaching
midstretch, drew clear under pressure. STORM STRATEGY off a step slow, three wide into the first turn, made a four wide gain to challenge into the stretch,
briefly raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker then could not keep up while well clear of the others. JIM NED washy early when
prompting the leader, settled in he middle half inside, moved out two wide to overtake a tiring rival late in the final turn, came back for the show, not a threat
to the top two. BOLIVER bothered and carried out by the leader in the first turn, challenged that one and put a head in front midway on the second turn, held
a slim advantage in upper stretch, faltered when confronted by the top pair a furlong out. SEEKING CHROME fell back to trail after the start, picked off a few
tiring rivals to improve position while not a serious threat. OUTLAW RUN carried to be four wide in the first turn, continued forward and outside, faltered in
the drive. SINGING GROOM fell back to trail after the start, came three wide into the stretch, was never dangerous. ALL IN GOOD TIME broke on top, got
out in the first turn, gave way when headed. LAKE HAMILTON settled in mid pack, gave way after five furlongs.

PIONEERING PAPA vied up the backstretch while between horses, in tight then steadied into the turn to lose some position, steered out three wide after
recovering, challenged past the furlong marker, proved best in a determined effort. SPEND BENJAMINS off a step slow, raced back, came three wide for
the drive, late run to gain the nod for the place, slowly getting to winner. SHADY EMPIRE vied early three wide, briefly clear in the turn while dropped to the
inside turning into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to narrowly miss the place. BOAT SONG within striking distance off the
inside, came four wide into the lane, roused, went evenly the final furlong. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE lacked early foot while off the inside, also lacked a
serious closing response. LUCKY BOSS prompted the pace along the inside, began to fade after a half.

SECRET FIX broke forwardly, dueled in the two path into the turn, edged away from the other speed a bit inside the furlong marker, enough left to withstand
the runner up in the late going. KNOWING GLANCE chased the dueling leaders in the three path, lost some ground to that pair into the lane, roused when
straightened for home, slowly getting to the winner late while clearly second best. DREAM STREAK broke alertly, alternated up front in dueling up the
backstretch, continued on equal terms with the winner through the turn inside of that one, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. BERRY GOOD
hesitated at the break, moved up while outside, raced five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response.
LADY ASTRID broke out then steadied to be away slowly, raced back and well out in the strip, came four wide for the drive and .improved slightly. MI

Footnotes
MOZINGO broke out to bother GUEST IN MY HEART, settled in the the second flight outside, four wide through most of the turn, challenged on the outside
when straightened for home, late duel outside the runner up, bested that foe under brisk handling. GRAMERCY PARK moved up on her own to duel soon
after the start, alternated up front through the turn closest to the inside, cut the corner to garner a slightly larger advantage into the lane, was joined by the
winner a furlong out, dueled inside that one to the wire and narrowly missed in a solid effort. HAMAZING DEBATE back off the pace while along the inside,
continued to save ground turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, could do little with the top pair the final furlong, remained well clear of the others. EARLY
DISMISSAL broke back, trailed in the two path turn, steered out a bit for the drive, improved with some mild, belated interest. SHE'S STORMING also
devoid of any early speed, inside late turn, moved out and improved through traffic while also too late. PATTERN BET broke with the field, in the second
flight while racing three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. MS CARROLL COUNTY dueled up front outside the runner up, began to weaken into the
lane, dropped to the inside and continued to back up. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER in the second flight while racing off the inside, had little for the drive.
GUEST IN MY HEART bothered when the winner broke out to be away a step slow, raced three wide while remaining always back. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE in
mid pace and three wide, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
SINGING EMMA behind the pace along the inside, patiently handled while continuing to save ground turn, asked along and got through along the rail into
the stretch, challenged soon after and drove well clear. I'M BETH DUTTON broke on top, showed the way when clear up the backstretch off the inside,
continued in the two path through the turn, allowed the winner the inside upper stretch, proved no match for that one the final furlong, held sway for the
place. TIZ SWEET CANDY in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick while saving the show late. THORN
CROWN pressed the runner up from the three path for a half, had little left for the stretch drive. HER NAME WAS LOLA fell back to trail, three wide into the
turn, two wide exiting, improved position a bit while never dangerous. NELLY LARKIN last to leave, raced in mid pack toward the inside, steered out to be
four wide into the lane, drifted out further and went evenly to the finish. MRS. MACOMBER was finished after a half while three wide late in the turn.
