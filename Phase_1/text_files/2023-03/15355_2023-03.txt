Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turns, met the bid of BARBIERE, dueled with that rival to the wire and prevailed for
the win. BARBIERE tracked the early pace, raced five wide into the second turn, drifted out in early stretch, made a bid on the winner, dueled to late stretch
and finished second best. PIRATE JUNCTION pressed the early, advanced between rivals into the final turn, angled out late and weakened late. FORT
STANTON SCOUT was void of any early speed, advanced seven wide through the second turn and never fired. TOTALLY TIGER was unhurried early,
raced four wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. MISS RULES was allowed to settle early, went six wide into the second turn and flattened out.
LOOKING FOR BULL stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the final turn and was empty.
