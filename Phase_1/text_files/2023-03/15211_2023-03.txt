MY BROTHER CAM tracked four wide, rallied on the far turn with a quick move, drew off in the stretch under firm handling. PATIO PARTY was away alertly
and quickly made the lead, was hooked at the top of the stretch by the winner, could not match strides late but was clearly second best. MONEY FOR
MISCHIEF was unhurried early, angled out five wide in the stretch and had a mild bid. BIG FRANK raced mid pack and went evenly. FIGHTVILLE pressed
the pace for three quarters, then weakened. MASTER OF WAR was outrun. WINWITHJIMMY contended early and was through after a half.
