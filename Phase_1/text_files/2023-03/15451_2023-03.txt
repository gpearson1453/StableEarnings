Footnotes
MOUNT KENYA settled far back two wide, gained along the inside down the backstretch, sustained progress while shifting three wide turning for home, took
aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, failed to change leads while slowly grinding away at the leader's margin in the final furlong, produced a bid along
with an outer foe nearing the wire, and narrowly prevailed. KIDYOUNOT set a clear pace, maintained a margin through midstretch, but was confronted by a
pair of rivals approaching the wire, and got nailed. SILENT POWER settled off of the pace along the inside, was outmoved by an inner rival down the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, steadily shifted ground outwardly while searching for racing room approaching midstretch, surged outside of
the top pair in the final sixteenth, but just ran out of ground. MAD ADAM stalked the clear leader from the two path, chased under urging as that foe's closest
pursuer around the far turn, but lacked the needed punch to produce a bid. WHITAKER trailed along the inside, saved ground around the far turn before
awaiting racing room behind a rival turning for home, shifted out through upper stretch, but offered no rally once clear. STOCKPILER lacked speed in the
four to five paths around the turns, and made little impact. CRIMINAL DEFENSE stalked along the inside early on, yet decided to shift outside of an outer
counterpart to be between horses at the five furlong pole, then chased into the far turn, and faded after being floated four wide turning for home. NATE'S
REVENGE pursued from midpack in the three to four paths, and faded between horses at the three furlong pole.

PALATIAL TIMES was sent for the lead racing from the two path in the first turn, settled intot he second flight leaving that turn, raced from in between two
other competitors down the back side from the three path, shook the outside competitor at the three eights pole, continued to match strides with the inside
horse heading for home, these two battled stride for stride, tit for tat, nearly the entire lane, in the last sixteenth another challenger raced up on the outside,
PALATIAL TIMES dug in deep and out finished both of these challengers and got the hard earned win. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN was bumped leaving the
gates, was off a step slow, raced four wide early, started advancing at the five furlong pole, was mid pack by the half mile marker, was in full stride and
gaining ground after the three eighths, angled into the three path at the quarter and closed gamely, but just missed for the win was up for second.
SERMONONTHEMOUNT followed the early leader into the first turn while racing two wide, split horses at the six furlong pole and race in between down the
back side, shook the inside foe at the half mile marker , shifted down to the rail and saved ground the rest of the trip, while still matching strides with an
outside challenger, continued to battle aggressively throughout the stretch drive, came out to eyeball his rival several times, struggling to put the eventual
winner away, was joined by a far outside rival in the last few strides and had to settle for third today. KEYS INCLUDED galloped behind the early leaders
from the three path in the first turn, maintained that position until the quarter pole, where he was angled in towards the rail and raced two wide, launched a
bid but showed little. MIAS MOONBEAM was slow into stride, enjoyed a comfortable pace while saving ground for the first half of a mile, moved out to the
four path after the half mile pole and started to rally, raced wide through the second bend then went seven wide into the stretch to avoid traffic but to no
avail. THE GRAY BLUR went to the lead early, rated at the six furlong pole from the rail, shifted into the two and three path at the five furlong pole, shuffled
back and chased the remainder of the way, but was able to pass on tired foe late. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was three wide and in the second tier early,
angled out five wide leaving the turn, joined the leaders and completed a set of four on the lead from the five path at the five eighths pole, continued to
pressure form the outside until the seven sixteenths pole and then faded.

Footnotes
RUNNINGINTHEMONEY set the pace along the inside, showed the way in the two path while well in hand around the far turn, met an outer challenge
turning for home, shook free of that bidder in upper stretch, and held sway thereafter. SUNDAY BREEZE saved ground off of the pace, tracked behind the
leaders around the far turn, but only managed to chase the clear leader while battling for place with an outer rival through the final furlong, and prevailed for
that position. KINGOFBROKENHEARTS stalked outside of the top pair, ranged up to the leader in the four path around the far turn to attempt a bid at
turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, sparred with an inner rival for place through the final furlong, but got outfinished. GUITARTUITION PLZZ
pressed the leader two wide and between horses, came under coaxing in the three path nearing the far turn to sustain that position, but gave way under a
stiff drive passing the five sixteenths pole. HEZA PICKLE broke a step slow while last away, raced at the rear in the two to three paths around the first turn,
failed to gain in the four to five paths around the far turn, and tired. CHEERFOR MSHAWISH leaned out a touch at the start while off half a beat slow, lacked
speed two wide and between horses, trailed at the three furlong pole, and faded.

Footnotes
SAILOR'S RETURN leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, advanced along the rail to claim place at the seven sixteenths
pole, then easily slipped through a wide rail seam inside of the leader entering the lane, and drew clear approaching midstretch. CONRAD THE RED
brushed with an outer rival before exchanging a solid bump with an inner rival at the start, stalked from the two path, got outmoved by a rail advancer in to
the far turn, sustained a chase thereafter, bid for place inside of the tiring early-pace setter in the final furlong, and gained that position with a sixteenth to
go. KISLOVODSK set the pace in the two path, cleared off down the backstretch, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's rail bid entering the
lane, and lost place to another inner foe at the sixteenth pole. GOLDEN FLASH brushed an inner foe leaving the gates, tracked in the four path, but failed to
gain under a drive around the far turn, and chased evenly through the lane. HUMOR ME PLEASE raced at the rear in the three path before saving ground
around the far turn, but made little impact. CHILI RED broke a step slow at the start, raced at the rear in the four path, then in the two path between horses
around the far turn, and got outrun. LA BOUCANE pressed the leader from the three path, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole, and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
UNIFIED DREAMS was hot in the post parade and loaded into the gate with lather on his neck, broke sharp and went to the lead from the rail, opened up by
six and then eight lengths despite his rider, accepted his bit and relaxed at the half, went into the second turn with a diminishingly lead, started to feel the
pressure of the field closing in on him at the five sixteenth pole, rider took command and launched a bid at the quarter pole, responded well and battled in
the lane, drifted out in the last few strides to meet outside rival and through a tremendous display of heart came out with the win. OPEN ROAD chased the
early leader from the four path, was joined by an inside rival at the half mile pole, launched a bit at the three eighths pole from the outside, was within a half
of a length of the leader at the quarter pole, was encouraged and driven but just couldn't get within that half a length and settled for second. FIELDSTONE
raced off the pace three wide, advanced into the second tier at the four and one half marker, chased after the eventual winner down the lane, was almost
close enough to move in between the winner and the other rival in the lead, but just couldn't get there and settled for third. EYE DEE KAY raced five wide
through the first turn and down the back side, advanced into the second tier near the half mile marker, was five wide in the stretch but ran flat. RUSSIAN
TANK rail trip mid pack early, no impact. BONUS APPRECIATION checked out of crowded quarters at the start, and was never involved.

Footnotes
PESO PESADO broke a beat slow, tracked from midpack in the three path and between horses around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied to
bid along with an inner foe in the closing stages, sparred with that rival nearing the wire, and narrowly prevailed. RUN CARLOS broke outwardly, chased
along the inside, smoothly tipped two wide in upper stretch for clear sailing, slowly closed in to produce a bid in the final furlong, led as an outer rival
menaced in the closing stages, and got nailed at the wire. SYVESTAR was last away while only off a step slow, laid off of the pace two wide, then between
horses around the turn, shifted in and sustained a rail grind in the final furlong, and gained show in the late stages. STARPORT broke in at the start, sped
clear soon after, held sway through midstretch, but was collared entering the final sixteenth, and yielded between horses. TRUE CRIMSON stalked outside
of the leader, got floated three wide in upper stretch, and faded between horses at the furlong grounds. MY PAL SWEET broke a beat slow, saved ground
off of the pace, but to no avail. MAIN DUDE lacked speed, was driven for run in the four path around the turn, failed to respond before fanning to the seven
path entering the lane, and made little impact. BUCK'S GLORY was outrun. SETTLE ON SOMETHIN tracked three wide, gave way four wide entering the
lane, and lugged about on his left lead while faltering.

Footnotes
KYLE BEAUTY prompted outside of the pace setter through a quick opening quarter, vied into the turn, led in the three path at the three furlong pole,
assumed command in the four path entering the lane, kicked clear, and held sway under a mild drive through the final furlong. SWEET VIDALIA laid off of
the pace in the three path, rallied steadily through the final furlong, and reached place at the wire. CUTE DINERO QUEEN stalked the top pair from the two
path, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch before surpassing an inner rival to gain place at the furlong grounds, but lugged inwardly
after flopping back to her left lead soon after, and got caught at the wire for that position. VIOLA STAR trailed two wide, shifted out to the six path in upper
stretch, and offered a late kick for a minor reward. SHELLI'S ANGEL broke slowly, saved ground towards the rear, and moved up between horses in the
final furlong. SERIOUSLY SAM saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CAJUN GUMBOW set a quick pace inside of a sternly pressing outer foe, got
headed by that one at the three furlong pole, gave way entering the lane, and faltered in the late stages. DREAM ON IT tracked in the three path, but faded.
JACKS RUN WILD hopped slightly while off slow, chased from midpack after tucking to the two path, but weakened entering the turn before bearing to the
five path at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
BUTTON BOY bumped with rivals while being put to crowded quarters between horses soon after the start, tracked from midpack in the three path, inched
closer before fanning five wide entering the lane, rallied while shifting inwardly, bid and sparked a duel with the leader at the furlong grounds, and edged an
advantage in the final sixteenth. ZIPPIN GIGI broke out at the start, set the pace inside of a trio of vying rivals down the backstretch, then only inside a
single presser around the turn, inched free of that one entering the lane, dug in while meeting BUTTON BOY's bid at the furlong grounds, and was
grudgingly bested in the late stages. GREYS THE BOY was bumped between horses while getting pinched a few stride after the start, lacked speed in the
three path, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to claim show at the sixteenth pole. UNDERHILL'S TAB raced at the rear two wide, chased behind
rivals while inching closer, and gained fourth at the wire. SUPREMELY stalked behind the leaders and from the two path around the turn, took aim two wide
and between horses leaving the quarter pole, but lacked a bid before tiring late. TWIRLING ROSES broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path,
shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. TRIGGER HAPPY brushed an inner rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, but to no
avail. OUR FREDDIE MAC vied two wide and between horses, pressed in the three path around the turn, but weakened between horses at the three
sixteenths pole. FATHER GOOSE vied three wide and between horses early on, but chased inner foes from the four path around the turn, and weakened in
upper stretch. HE'S A BOMB broke a step slowly, yet recovered to prompt the pace four wide approaching the turn, but weakened in the five path around
the bend.

Footnotes
INSPECTOR ED set a clear pace, opened up down the backstretch, and lasted safely as an outer foe slowly closed in late. JOEY'S GAME was rank
entering the first turn, tracked from midpack in the two path, split foes in the three path while advancing turning for home, and stayed on well to cut into the
clear leader's margin the final furlong. MINE YOUR BIZ pursued from midpack two to three wide and between horses, gained show from rivals at the furlong
grounds, and held an outer bidder off late. VERO CAMPIONE raced at the rear while hung in the six path around the first turn, inched closer in the four path
around the far turn, fanned back to the six path entering the lane, rallied, but was denied show. ST PIERRE leaned out at the start, tracked from midpack
three to four wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, and gave way. R T'S IRON MAN bumped with an outer rival the start, laid off of the pace in
the three path, and failed to menace. ELIEZER bumped with an inner rival at the start, and failed to threaten from the four to three paths. HARD KINGS
tracked along the inside, but tired turning for home. UNCLE JETT broke in while off a step slow, recovered to press the leader from the three path, chased
that clear foe around the far turn, and weakened along the inside turning for home. VALID EARLY broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, and made little
impact. ADMIRAL AFLEET brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked while tucking from the four path to the two path around the first turn, then weakened
along the inside around the far turn. TSURIS brushed with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the five path, and was done early.
