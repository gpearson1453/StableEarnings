Footnotes
PERFECT SENORITA dueled three then two wide with BABY SOX to her inside, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, continued the duel
taking narrow command just inside the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish to score. BABY SOX led early on before being engaged in a duel with the
aforementioned foe while along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, continued to knock heads
through to the eighth pole, relented just inside that station and ran on well clear of the rest for the place honors. GIGGLING GHOST broke open the stall
door prior to the start, then bobbled at the start and was taken hold of, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. BOUNTY KILLAH broke in at the start forcing EXTESSA to steady off her heels, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. JERSEY COAST chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.
EXTESSA broke a half a beat slow and was forced to steady off the heels of BOUNTY KILLAH, who broke inwards, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. INDYAN PENNY chased just off the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, tired.

steadily shook off his main rival near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, drew off under a drive to
prevail. DRINK THE WIND dueled four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under

the place honors. TURNSANDCONDITIONS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. CHARGER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path just
inside the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. COUSIN ANDREW coaxed from the start, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, made no impact. HOLEY MATRIMONY hustled from the start,

Footnotes
FREUDIAN coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide advancing from midway on the turn into contention to take command with five-sixteenths to
run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. APRIL ANTICS got bumped at the start by IN TRAFFIC due to pressure
from WICKED LADY breaking outwards, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick. IN TRAFFIC got bumped at the start by WICKED LADY breaking outwards and in turn bumped APRIL ANTICS, came under coaxing and tipped
out to chase five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a three
wide bid at the quarter pole, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. SWEET SENSATION took the
overland route chasing eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved
position to the finish. BRAVO REGINA chased five then four wide, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, went three to four wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. CARIBBEAN BREEZE vied three wide outside a pair coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when overhauled in
tandem with her main pace rivals by the eventual winner, spun three wide for home and tired. CRYSTAL ORB coaxed from the gate, vied inside a pair
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. WICKED LADY broke out a step at the start bumping
IN TRAFFIC into APRIL ANTICS, vied just off the inside between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch
and folded. RAINING CANDY chased three wide down the backstretch until tucked inside half a mile from home, angled out four wide into upper stretch,
gave way.

Footnotes
SURPRISE BOSS away in good order, grabbed a slim advantage, showed the way hounded by a pair of opponents to the outside for the opening half,
settled into upper stretch with MAJORITY PARTNER in hot pursuit before being switched over to stronger handling, saw the second place finisher make it a
three-way battle for the lead soon afterwards, dug in gamely to preserve the score. JOEY FRESHWATER corrected after breaking to the outside with its
initial step, moved onto the inside route coming up to the half mile pole after being primarily two wide prior, was still on hold slithering out four wide from the
five-sixteenths pole to the head of the stretch, got given his cue, latched onto the ones to catch deep into the furlong grounds, fought as the outermost of a
threesome from that point to the end, failed to get by. MAJORITY PARTNER off the rail throughout, loosely drafted three wide for much of the run around
the bend, tipped out a bit to issue a challenge in the vicinity of the quarter pole, turned for home and was set down, was forced to vie for command from
between rivals shortly down the road, kept up its quest for the lead in earnest but was denied. PRISONER contended for the lead two wide from between
foes for approximately a half, got roused late on the bend, stayed in contention for a few more strides then steadily backed away. HANDSOME CAT off a
half length the tardiest, was quickly spotted along the rail, was ridden four wide for the stretch, failed to fire appreciably. RYAN'S CAT perched three wide on
the turn, got steered towards the five path for the stretch run to no avail. TRASH TALKER pressed the pace three wide for nearly a half, gave way then
finished the final furlong under his own poweer.

to the finish and gamely prevailed at the end. ROL AGAIN DANCER dueled three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, dug in gamely dueling to the finish but was ultimately bested at the wire. THUNDERIAN coaxed from the gate, chased inside early on before
tipping briefly four wide, then chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and improved position for the show
honors while never a match for the top pair. OUTLAW COUNTRY chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, passed tired rivals. STAR ATTITUDE chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
