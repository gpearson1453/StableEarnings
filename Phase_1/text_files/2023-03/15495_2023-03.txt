CARTEL KISSES away best, drifted out a lane the first hundred yards, asked left handed approaching the gap, asked lightly again midway, and prevailed in
a tight photo. CANDYS SPECIAL POWER away cleanly, asked steadily right handed early, dueled with CARTEL KISSES throughout and just missed in a
strong effort. MID KNIGHT FLASH away cleanly, under hand shove early, asked right handed past the gap, responded and managed to get up for third in a
tight photo. AJ BORN RUNNIN had head pushed to the side of the gate, hit the gate when leaving, drifted in a path and a half early, kept under a drive
thereafter in a solid try to just miss third. STREAKS OF POWER broke out and bumped rival at the start, asked right handed early, kept under a drive and
switched leads in the final sixteenth while being outkicked. BUDDER OFF FRIENDS bobbled leaving, kept under a strong drive throughout while running
straight as a string, kept to task late in a even effort. FEARLESS MOON away cleanly, asked once passing the gap and failed to respond well enough, kept
under a drive for an even finish. AJ RUN FOR CASH broke a beat slow, put into a strong drive early, asked past the gap and failed to show a kick well
enough to make up any ground. BF LIZZIERAGEOUS knocked into rival start, and hand ridden to wire after losing all chance. QUIRKY BITTY JESS broke
head high, off slow and bumped out four lanes at the start, had a couple green strides while being well outside on the track passing the eighth pole, and
