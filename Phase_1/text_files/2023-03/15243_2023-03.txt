Footnotes
STONE ALLIANCE was sent out for the early lead, was able to secure a rail trip and control the pace, was briefly challenged after the half, but had a lot left
in the tank and was able to draw clear, was driven into the stretch and kept to task, and wrapped up after the eighth mile pole. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT was
slow into stride, unhurried along the backside, was cued around the half mile pole, responded well making one run along the rail, gaining ground through the
turn angled out in the stretch, continued to close was able to get up for second. OLE STUD MUFFIN was rated off the pace shuffled back early, started
gaining ground after the half and past the three eighths poles, saved ground through the turn angled out three wide in the stretch and was caught by another
foe, battled late, held on for third. DEMON HUNTER was off the pace the pace early, traveled four wide along the backside, hooked company in the lane but
didn't finish. R T'S D'ORO was anxious to make the lead early was hung seven wide through the first turn and along the back side, battled in the lane with
another competitor but had no rally. FORGED IN STEEL no factor.

Footnotes
MYFRIENDSAWINNER was squarely bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe's path at the start, stalked three wide and outside of the embattled leading
pair, ranged up to bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, inched away to a clear margin in the final sixteenth, and held off an outer
bidder late. ZYDECO MUSIC broke a beat slow before taking contact from rivals on both sides at the start, recovered to midpack exiting the opening stages,
tucked to the rail entering the turn while inching closer to a stalking position, pursued from the pocket turning for home, shifted out four wide in upper stretch
after MYFRIENDISAWINNER got a jump, chased that foe through midstretch, closed in in the final sixteenth to attempt a late bid, but was fended off.
OURPERFECTPRINCESS crossed over while striking the front early on, dueled with an outer presser around the turn, got headed by a wider bidder in
upper stretch, fought on through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. GALAXY THIRTYSIX was pinched back when put to tight quarters soon after
the start, laid far back in the three path, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. NEW YEAR'S PARTY lacked speed in the two
path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and mildly closed in between horses. SHADES OF TRUTH broke outwardly and bumped a rival into
other foes at the start, vied two wide around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. COMMERCIAL FLASH brushed an inner rival at the
start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
FORT POLK eased back from a bit of tight quarters in the early stages, settled off of the pace four wide, inched closer around the far turn, sustained a rally
to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled before gaining an advantage in the final sixteenth as an inner A G'S CHARLOTTE menaced, and fended off that foe to
the wire. A G'S CHARLOTTE settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted three wide around the far turn, dove inwardly while launching a rally in upper
stretch, advanced along the rail to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, but was denied. WHOLELOTTAMO trailed around both turns, swung from the three path
to the five path around the far turn, drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, flopped to and from her left lead while spinning her wheels approaching
midstretch, but straightened and offered a belated kick in the outer part of the course in the closing stages, but ran out of ground. CHEAPSKATE DIVA set
the pace in the two path, built a clear margin turning for home, dug in to resist an outer challenge in midstretch, and yielded between bidders in the final
sixteenth. BLESSED ANNA stalked three wide, pressed down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with the leader around the far turn, and tired between
horses at the three sixteenths pole. FREE LIKE A GIRL bobbled at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, but required coaxing to sustain position
down the backstretch, and gave way around the far turn. EVE'S DELIGHT stalked along the inside, and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
SMOKEY HARBOR stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the first turn, ranged up to vie at the half mile pole, gained an advantage
two wide around the far turn, cleared in four path in upper stretch, drifted out in the closing stages as TAPAGE produced a rail challenge, and narrowly
lasted. TAPAGE bobbled slightly at the start, tracked along the inside while just a bit off of the rail, rallied in upper stretch, surpassed an inner rival before
bidding inside of the leader in the final sixteenth, but narrowly missed. OTTOTHELEGEND dueled for the lead along the inside, but failed to keep pace with
a pair of outer rivals leaving the half mile pole, chased the top pair from the three path around the far turn, lost show to an inner rival in upper stretch, and
kept on to regain that position at the wire. SUPER WISE dueled for the lead two wide, cleared an inner rival as an outer foe vied into the far turn, got headed
by that rival in upper stretch, and weakened entering the final sixteenth. PAYNT BATTLE pulled while rank in the four to three paths and between horses
around the first turn, settled before taking the far turn in the four path and between horses around the far turn, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and
failed to factor. VIM AND VIGOR lacked speed in the six to five paths, was outrun in the three path around the far turn, and got eased in upper stretch.
CLASSIC KING laid off of the pace in the five to four paths and between horses around the far turn, chased in the five path around the far turn, and was
eased in upper stretch.

Footnotes
READY FOR CHANGE settled off the pace early, stalked from the inside through the turn, angled out into the stretch, got clear, was driven hard and closed
well, caught the leader late and scored the win. BELEOUT broke a bit behind today, was settled into the second tier from the inside, was rushed after the
half to catch the early leader, angled to the outside going into the turn, took command turning for home was angled in and out trying to control the race, but
was caught late in deep stretch and tired. MISTY DAY was the quickest out of the gates today, took the early lead and attended the pace from the rail, was
challenged by the favorite after the three eighths pole, relinquished the lead and faltered in the stretch. ROOKERY settled early, made a brief run into the
turn while being five wide, struggled to switch leads in the stretch and tired. DONYA KNOW IT was never able to get involved today.

Footnotes
BIG CHOPPER tracked two wide, then from between horses while just off of the pace around the far turn, patiently bided time turning for home, split foes
through a wide opening in the four path in upper stretch, bid, led entering the final furlong, sparred with an outer rival thereafter, and tenaciously held to the
wire. WHO TOOK THE MONEY got antsy in the gate while his most immediate inner rival acted up, then brushed the inner half of the gate upon leaving it,
laid unhurried in the three path around both turns shifted out to the eight path at the three sixteenths pole, rallied with a good kick in the final furlong to take
aim on the top pair nearing the wire, but was too late while gaining place via a head-bob. BUDRO TALKING laid off of the pace three wide, tracked in the
four path and outside of the main group around the far turn, spun into the lane in the seven path, offered a grinding charge to bid in midstretch, dueled
through the final furlong, but was gamely fended off before getting nailed for place by an outer bidder at the wire. SMARTY ALEX saved ground off of the
pace, was patiently handled around the far turn, vacated the inside in upper stretch, and chased in the three path and between horses in the final furlong.
WICKED ROSE was fractious in the starting gate causing the need to be backed out and reloaded , trailed in the two to three paths, swung to the seven
path entering the lane, and moved up in the outer part of the course in the closing stages. MAGA MAN pressed the leader from the three path, but drifted to
the five path entering the lane, sustained a chase between horses in upper stretch, but gave way approaching the furlong grounds. MANGELSEN set the
pace in the two path, but was headed in upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. HIGHLAND CREEK stalked along the inside, pursued from
the pocket around the far turn, and faded.

BO CRUZ was quickest out of the gates, took the rail trip while attending the pace, was able set comfortable fractions while still on the rail, was challenged
by another competitor briefly coming out of the turn, was cued to go and responded by drawing off and was allowed to drift out a bit late, but easily won.
DUAL MONARCHY challenged and wanted to match strides with the early leader from the two path, was cued to take the lead after the five sixteenths pole
but wasn't able to take or stay with the leader but was able to hold on for second. RULE BREAKER was off a bit tardy, settled behind the leaders from the
rail, was patient while waiting for room, was given room to move out coming out of the turn, was given the cue to go on but ran flat. PRESIDER was right
behind the leaders saving ground early, moved up in between foes in the four path after the half, chased down the lane and tired. GATLINBURG was six
wide going into and through the first turn, traveled four wide down the backstretch from mid pack, was still wide into the second turn and into the stretch,
where he faded late. SILVER BULL races four wide and was through after the half.

Footnotes
WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) bobbled a touch while bumping with an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide, took aim on the clear leader from the four
path in upper stretch, grinded away in midstretch to bid entering the final sixteenth, wrestled an advantage in the closing stages, and lasted from an outer
oncharging rival to the wire. MYREDWHITEANDBLUE rated at the rear two wide, lagged turning for home, fanned out to the outer part of the course in
upper stretch, and offered a stout late kick to miss reeling in the leader at the wire. RECKONING FORCE set the pace along the inside, cleared off to an
open advantage with five furlongs to go, maintained that margin turning for home, held sway through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but drifted out
while getting collared entering the final sixteenth, and gave in late. ANDTHEWINNERIS was squarely bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of
the pace along the inside, split foes while shifting out turning for home, took aim from the seven path in upper stretch, rallied into midstretch, but flattened
out entering the final sixteenth, and got outkicked for a minor placing late. MAZING MARK broke out and bumped a foe at the start before being pushed
back inwardly in the after math, settled far back along the inside, produced a grinding charge two wide in upper stretch in hopes of bidding inside of the
leaders in the late stages, but flattened out. LORD DONEGAL leaned in and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, attempted to gain four
to five wide around the far turn, but failed to menace through the lane. WINTERS LION bobbled at the start, tracked three wide, but faltered between horses
nearing the lane. TAPIO bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn, and caved.

Footnotes
SECRET VISTA stalked the clear leader from the two path, bid turning for home, took over in upper stretch, and drew off under a drive. BIG BELLA BROWN
cleared off early on, but offered little resistance to an outer rival's bid entering the lane, and was second best. IZZY'S BABY BOY chased the top pair from
the three path, and safely managed show. STEAL IT BACK saved ground far back, and improved inside of rivals in the final furlong for a minor share. MR.
PRIORITY lacked speed in the four path, and made little impact. RIFLE MAN tossed his head at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, and never got
involved. AFLEET ASCENT laid off of the pace while off of the rail, and tired between horses entering the final sixteenth.
