Footnotes
CONCLUDE set the pace under pressure from outer rival, maintained a short lead through the turn and into the stretch, shook free past the eighth pole and
drew off. FLEET FEET away well in the beginning, chased briefly before going up to force the pace from outside, stayed alongside through the turn, could
not keep up with a furlong remaining but stayed on to prove second best. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, tracked
between rivals then went two wide around the turn and could not threaten in the stretch run. BALTHAZAR broke a step slow, tracked two wide into the turn,
moved over to the rail after clearing inner rival and failed to summon the needed bid in the lane. BOLT SUPREMACY settled three deep early, suffered a
mild shuffle two wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. LIFT OFF showed brief speed then chased the top pair on the inside, lost
ground on the turn along the rail, steered out in the lane and could not rally. PRECISION STRIKE took a bumped from outside at the start, coaxed along
from inside then settled in mid-pack, dropped back on the turn and failed to menace. SAM MALONE came in and bumped rival at the start, lost his path
early and dropped back, took the turn two wide and could not make an impact. SEVENTEEN BLACK dropped back early, trailed into the turn, went three
then two wide around the bend and was not a factor. VEGAS BURNER raced in mid-pack four deep early, traveled three deep on the turn, moved out in the
drive and weakened. ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE coaxed clear from inside early, remained unchallenged through the turn, inched away under hand urging in the drive and stayed clear
to the wire. EVERLYS GIRL closest in pursuit from outside up the backstretch, chased two wide outside a rival on the turn, finished willingly in tandem with
CHARLOTTE HARBOR through the drive and edged that rival for second. CHARLOTTE HARBOR stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the
turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch, kept on determinedly in the furlong grounds but got edged for the place honors. MISS FIA chased three deep between
foes early, went two wide around the bend, angled out in the lane and offered a mild response. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN tracked two wide into the turn,
moved over to the rail to save ground around the bend, remained inside in the drive but needed to find more late. TAKE A LEAP dropped back to trail early,
went two wide into the turn, swung widest into the stretch and failed to menace. FLAT OUT JOY settled four deep early, continued four wide to the stretch,
moved out and lacked a rally. YOUR RINGER forwardly placed three deep, driven three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KING APOLLO stalked the dueling leaders three deep into and around the turn, got floated out into the lane, rallied from outside and got up late.
CHERUBIC FACTOR chased the top pair from inside, lacked room through the turn, tipped out to a clear path into the lane, reached the front with a
sixteenth to go but got outkicked by the winner. BRUTTO hopped slightly at the start but recovered quickly to go up and challenge from outside, dueled with
STOTLAND while two to three wide around the bend, put that rival away approaching the eighth pole but was overtaken at the sixteenth pole and yielded to
the top pair. CREW DRAGON stalked between rivals into and around the turn, tipped out into the stretch, put in a mild bid nearing the furlong grounds but
faltered in the late stages. STORMY SAMURAI settled off the pace, raced outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the drive and lacked further
response. KIMMER saved ground at the back, cut the corner into the lane, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. STOTLAND dueled for command
from inside, fought through the turn and into the stretch, could not kick on with the BRUTTO entering the furlong grounds and weakened. ORIGINALLY
HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
KANGAROO COURT stalked the leader early then went up challenge at the half-mile pole, raced on even terms with a quarter mile remaining, took over
into the stretch, battled BUS BUZZ into the final sixteenth then dug in to clear late. BUS BUZZ sprinted clear early then set the pace inside KANGAROO
COURT past the half-mile pole, headed approaching the quarter pole, lost command into the stretch, fought back gamely to the sixteenth then faltered late
but was clearly second best. DEVIL AMONG US stalked up close then tugged early behind BIG BUZZ, saved ground while coaxing along on the turn, asked
right handed leaving the bend, flattened in the furlong grounds but was able to hold the show. STAY IN THE GAME broke well then dropped back to last,
passed a rival and took the turn two then three wide, failed to threaten in the lane but earned a minor award. CATALINA EDDY tracked the top pair off the
inside, raced outside a rival in the two path around the bend and weakened. PALACSINTA sat off the pace early, dropped back to trail on the turn while on
the inside and tired in the drive.

QUATTROELLE (IRE) settled off the pace in the two path early, took closer order three deep in the middle stages, moved out late on the far turn and spun
four wide into the lane, rallied five deep in the drive and outkicked MACADAMIA (BRZ) in the final sixteenth. MACADAMIA (BRZ) rated along the inside in a
stalking position, lacked room behind TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped to the two path, rallied between in upper stretch, reached
the front with a sixteenth to go but got outkicked by the winner in the end. CLOSING REMARKS unhurried in the beginning on the inside, got blocked a rival
leaving the first turn, advanced from the fence up the backstretch, got blocked and had to check when KITTY KITANA (GB) pulled up at the
seven-sixteenths pole, swung out leaving the far turn and rallied to gain the show. SCHOOL DANCE stalked outside a rival early on, challenged the leader
at the five-sixteenths, took over past the quarter pole, lost command at the eighth pole, stayed on through the final furlong and missed third. NADETTE (FR)
was off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the first turn, pulled outside rivals on the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn, took over at the eighth pole
but faltered in the final sixteenth. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) pressed the pace from outside in hand, moved leaving the backstretch, challenged on the far turn
and relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. KITTY KITANA (GB) quickly took control and moved inside, set the pace
under pressure from TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB), pulled up at the seven-sixteenths pole and walked off.

PRACTICAL MOVE hit the gate and brushed with inner rival at the start, stalked the pace while keen early, waited behind HEJAZI on the far turn then
engaged that rival along the rail nearing the quarter pole, took over and cleared in upper stretch, then drew away under right handed encouragement.
GEAUX ROCKET RIDE prominent early to the outside of HEJAZI, chased three wide through the far turn and into the lane, steered to the inside at the top
of the stretch, finished determinedly through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. SKINNER broke a step slow, trailed three wide early, was on
the move four then five wide on the far turn and gained the show. HEJAZI away quickly to take the front and moved inside, showed the way off the rail up
the backstretch, led two wide around the far turn, challenged by the winner approaching the quarter pole, lost command at the top of the stretch and
flattened to fourth. FORT BRAGG was forwardly placed three deep then pulled leaving the clubhouse turn, continued to tug on the backstretch, took aim
four wide into the stretch but weakened in the late stages. MR FISK broke well then settled in the three path off the pace, moved out wider on the
backstretch, went four wide into the second bend then angled to the inside around the bend and failed to menace. CHASE THE CHAOS brushed the winner
leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside, coaxed along on the far turn, entered the stretch two wide and never got involved. GENIUS JIMMY
bumped leaving the gate, tracked outside a pair of rivals early, asked two to three wide on the far turn and faded. BLUEGRASS GO GO bumped with
GENIUS JIMMY at the start, pulled and became rank early and on the clubhouse turn, tracked between rivals up the backstretch, dropped back around that
bend and was eased into the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CASH EQUITY (FR) bumped with inner rival at the start, went up to press the pace from outside, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, moved clear with a
furlong to go and remained unchallenged to the wire. TARANTINO bumped with the winner at the start, stalked from inside, roused at the quarter pole,
entered the lane two wide, finished willingly through the final furlong and gained the place. FLASHIEST reserved in the early stages in the two path, moved
into range on the far turn, angled out leaving the bend and got up for third. TIME TO PARTY steadied briefly and started to pull early first time through the
stretch, settled outside a rival, moved closer while tipping three wide on the far turn, bid in upper stretch but faltered and lost the show. LINCOLN HAWK
(IRE) broke out a bit then traveled two wide near the back into the first turn, traveled outside a rival into the far turn, angled out leaving the bend, kept on
through the lane but failed to threaten. DEAN MARTINI took control early outside a rival then cleared inner rival and moved to the inside nearing the
clubhouse turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, maintained a short advantage through the second bend, lost command in upper stretch and
flattened out. CARMELITA'S MAN trailed from inside early, looked to move closer but lacked room behind a rival leaving the backstretch and far turn, trailed
on the inside into the stretch, tried to rally up the fence but again lacked room through the final sixteenth. RED ROAD settled inside, eased off the rail on the
far turn and came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MENDEZ MILE dueled for command from outside then cleared past the half-mile pole, opened up a comfortable lead on the turn and stayed well clear to the
wire under urging. SNAPP DADDY was off slow and lost his path at the start, advanced up the backstretch off the rail, was closest in aim three wide into the
lane, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but bested the rest. PACIFIC STATES chased between then moved into the two path, entered the
lane three wide and kept on to earn the show honors. TRUSTY RUSTY bumped leaving the gate, raced on the inside then moved out on the turn, spun four
wide into the drive and improved position. SMOOSE chased four wide into and around the turn and weakened in the lane. STOP AND A TRES chased
between off the pace then lost his path and had to steady early, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace. MY AMIGO brushed inner rival
at the start, got blocked from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, tipped out around weakening rival to a clear path, cut the corner into the
stretch and weakened. TAKE CHARGE CURLY brushed leaving the gate, started to climb while at the back, went two wide into the turn, came four wide into
the drive and was not a factor. PAT CAN'T COUNT broke a step slow, chased between then off the rail, raced at the back under asking two wide on the turn
and had little left for the drive. SUBMISSION was fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped rival, went up to duel for command then lost touch past the
half-mile pole, dropped back on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
HONEY JAR prompted the pace from outside, kept the pressure on to the top of the stretch, gained the advantage at the eighth pole, moved clear and held
safely in the end. RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ stalked the pace from inside, angled out in upper stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong and gained
the place. CARMEN MIRANDA set the pace under pressure from outside rival, led along the rail through the turn, lost command with a furlong remaining
and saved the show. ULTIMATE HY got shuffled back at the start, raced along the inside at the back into the turn, remained inside then moved out while
producing a mild late bid and rounded out the superfecta. LADY JAE was taken back early, raced under a hold on the turn, got floated out crossing the dirt
and failed to threaten while improving position. ROSE BARTON (IRE) was off slow to start, raced outside at the back into the turn, traveled three wide into
the lane, steered out in the lane and lacked a rally. REBEL GIRL settled inside, moved out across the dirt and lacked further response. EMPIRE GAL drifted
out and bumped rival early, stalked three deep then three wide on the turn, moved out crossing the dirt and faded. URBAN FAIRYTALE tracked between
rivals and got bumped early, tracked two wide into the turn out of range, drifted out crossing surfaces and weakened in the lane. PEARL GLORY (IRE) sat
off the pace, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JOE DON LOONEY sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, remained unchallenged into the final furlong and
held well in the end. MANITOWISH broke well, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, took aim two wide into the lane, finished determinedly through the
stretch run but had to settle for second best. HIGH HEATER raced off the pace in the early going, rounded the bend four wide and gained the show. NEXT
REVOLT bumped with inner rival twice at the start, took up with balking at an object on the track, took up again between rivals on the backstretch, angled to
the inside to save ground and got outkicked for third. SELF TAUGHT got bumped and crowded at the start, saved ground at the back around the turn and
passed tired rivals. SITTIN ON GO was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace wide up the backstretch, traveled five then four wide around the bend and
failed to menace. ZIMBA WARRIOR got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked off the rail, went three wide through the turn and weakened.

STILLETO BOY was prominent early inside the leader passing the finish line for the first time then dropped back a bit to chase, moved off the rail in the
middle stages, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane, raced within striking distance through the stretch, then launched a bid in
the final sixteenth to get up late. PROXY traveled two to three wide near the back early, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the lane,
drifted out while closing under left-handed urging but could not get by the winner. DEFUNDED bumped leaving the gate, led between rival early then
showed the way in the two path around the clubhouse turn, dueled with HOPPER up the backstretch, battled through the far turn, cleared approaching the
eighth pole, led into the final sixteenth and got run down late. HOPPER hit the gate then broke in to bump HEYWOODS BEACH, raced up close three deep
then dueled outside DEFUNDED, fought two wide through the far turn and into the stretch, lost touch with the leader entering the final furlong and flattened
to fourth. THERE GOES HARVARD was forced in a bit leaving the gate, settled inside, steadied briefly behind NEWGRANGE on the first turn, moved closer
inside a pair of rivals in the middle stages, ridden along through the far turn while tipped off the rail, moved in to the two path in the lane and could not rally.
TISQUANTUM trailed off the rail early, angled in and went inside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and could not rally.
NEWGRANGE broke in, got put in tight between rivals on the first turn, angled out into the backstretch, lost ground three then two wide on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. WARRANT got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then steadied briefly between on the clubhouse turn,
remained close up while outside a rival, raced three deep leaving the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and faded. HEYWOODS BEACH got
bumped on both sides in the beginning, raced towards the rear in the early going, moved out on the backstretch, raced between foes into the far turn, got
blocked past the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the drive and had little left.
