Footnotes
CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) stalked inside of rivals around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was under light rousing while
waiting for an opening around the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, bid going into the final furlong, and drew past the inner pacesetter in
the final sixteenth to win. RUN FOR COVER brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused while floating out to the four
path turning into the stretch, and stayed on through the stretch but was caught by an outer foe late to finish with place. ALHAAN got bumped between foes
leaving the gate, was in the two path around the first turn and rated in the three path down the backstretch, was driven in the four path around the far turn,
and tipped in to the three path after a right handed cue at the top of the lane, and kept on down the lane inside of foes to get up for show late. OOPSIE
DOOPSIE was up close while in range in the four path around the first turn and was in the five path down the backside, received a right handed cue while
tipping out to the six path into the stretch, and finished evenly. GREY PRINCESS race in midpack under a hold in the four path, was ridden in the five path
around the far turn and angled out to the eighth path for the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong. IRISH UNION traveled off the pace in three path
around the first turn and trailed in the four path down the backstretch, was driven around the far turn and swung out to the nine path into the stretch, passed
tired rivals down the center but was no factor. MAGIC CALL was unhurried in the two path, under coaxing around the far turn while floating out to the five
path into the lane, and never threatened. SING SCAT prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, was roused into the far turn, shifted out to
the seven path while under a ride into the lane, but flattened. D CITY GIRL brushed with an outer foe just after the start, race in midfield around the two path
but faded turning into the stretch. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY bumped with an outer foe at the start and checked into the first turn, raced wellback along the
inside and was never involved. JAZZY JAS raced off the pace in the four path early and was never a menace.

Footnotes
ARTICO settled off the pace in the three path, advanced in the two path around the far turn, smoothly split rivals in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
BLUE SOLDIER had early speed outside, was forced five wide entering the first turn, raced mostly in the three path around the bend, was rated back when
SPY TOWN rushed to the front early on the backstretch, raced between foes down much of the backstretch, angled out nearing the far turn, re-bid two wide
between foes around that bend, took the lead near the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to secure the place.
NETWORKING raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. PARADISE DRIVE rated inside
early, angled four wide nearing the far turn, bid outside nearing the quarter pole but faded through the stretch. SPY TOWN became quite keyed up and
unratable around the first turn, rushed to the lead outside early on the backstretch, vied outside, cleared and angled in nearing the far turn, led to the quarter
pole and tired. FLORIDA STAR bore out entering the first turn, disputed the early pace inside, angled three wide nearing the far turn, re-bid between foes
midway around the bend, faltered in the lane, was eased, was pulled up a stride short of the wire and walked off. MAXX MAGIC hesitated at the start, raced
far back, was pulled up midway down the backstretch and vanned off.

JUST CALL RAY dueled for the lead in the four path, was roused to take over from the five path passing the three eighths pole and led into the stretch, was
cued to open up into the final furlong, drifted out after a left handed cue late, but held sway. ONE AMERICA dueled for the lead in the three path,
surrendered the lead to the outer eventual winner and was coaxed passing the three eighths pole, tipped out to the five path under left handed urging into
the stretch, and chased home the winner to hold place. AGARRAMESIPUEDES traveled off the pace under prompting along the inside, was under urging in
the three path around the turn and into the stretch, and drifted out in the final furlong while getting up for show. ALEXIS N NIKO stalked along the inside,
was roused from the rail around the turn and under a drive from the two path into the lane, but evened out while drifting out late. KING ALFREDO tracked in
the five path, was driven from the six path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. DREAM OF BLESSINGS hit the outer side of the gate at the start,
rated in the five path, was in the seven path rounding the turn, and never threatened in the stretch. SOLAR TAP broke slow and was behind while between
foes in the three path early, but was no menace.

FROSTED FAITH set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled in the three path rounding the turn and was cued to open up from the four path into
the stretch, and tipped inwards through the final furlong while holding clear. LUNAR ROCKET stalked along the inside, was in the two path around the turn
and cued passing the quarter pole, and kept on around the three path in the stretch for place. BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN prompted the pace in the three path,
was in the four path around the turn and floated out to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on for show. MODAZZLE chased between rivals in the
three path, was under right handed urging turning into the stretch but did not threaten. ROMAN POET tracked in the five path but was no menace.

CAHUILLA set a clear pace along the rail and held safe under a drive. NAA DUDETTE saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn, angled
seven wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. GOMOMISCHIEF steadied nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace, weaved through traffic in the
lane and rallied for the show. SPUN OATS settled off the pace while racing three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes but was
outkicked. OUR FLAG FLYING tracked the pace three wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn and flattened out in the lane. STUCK IN MALIBU raced off
the pace two and three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch, was in a bit tight in the lane and never threatened. GREEK MOJO was pulling inside early
and faded in the lane. YAMILE'S stalked the winner two wide and tired in the drive.

three path rounding the turn and bid midway around the turn, took the lead and was in the four path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on but was caught
by a pair of outer foes in the final furlong to finish with show. PEPPERMINT CLASS tracked along the inside, was ridden from the rail around the turn, tipped
out to the three path into the lane, but was one paced. QUALY set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside around the turn, and yielded

midstretch and drew off while ridden out. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) advanced three wide around the first turn to the lead, cleared and and angled in down the
backstretch, set the pace along the rail from there to midstretch, had no answers for the winner but held on for the place. STARTING OVER had his head

pace two wide, angled out turning for home, bumped with SPEAKING nearing the eighth pole and rallied between foes late. SKY'S NOT FALLING broke
outwardly, raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and went evenly. CALL ME HARRY stalked the pace two and three
wide and faded in the lane. EAMONN raced off the pace two wide, came in and bumped HOT BLOODED into the rail near the seven-sixteenths pole and
offered no bids. SPEAKING led at the rail early, stalked inside down the backstretch and around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, was bumped

Footnotes
RED HURRICANE set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled around the far turn and roused while floating out to the four path into the stretch,
opened up slightly in upper stretch, and held safe under steady encouragement. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced
prominently in the four path, was roused to bid in the three path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the lane, and kept on to just hold
place. STARSHIP WIZARD broke out and brushed an outer foe leaving the gate and was unhurried along the inside, was cued from the rail around the far
turn and urged left handed while shifting out to the four path into the stretch, tipped further out passing the eighth pole, ran on for show and just missed
getting up for place. READYSEEKGO got brushed by an inner foe leaving the gate, stalked in the three path, was cued between rivals in the two path
around the far turn, and shifted out to the six path while under a drive entering the lane, but was one paced. TAPATERM trailed in the four path, was ridden
around the far turn and angled out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. QUANTUM THEORY was held up off the pace in the three path,
tipped outwards into the far turn and was under rousing in the six path at the top of the lane, but was tired. EUPHORIA STAR rated in the six path down the
backstretch, was under urging in the five path around the far turn, and never threatened. MATEO bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five
path but backed up while shifting inwards around the far turn.
