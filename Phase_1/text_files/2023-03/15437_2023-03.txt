Footnotes
K P KWEST was up close, ranged up five wide through the turn, dueled with WHAT AN IDEA to late stretch and surged clear. WHAT AN IDEA set a
pressured early pace, raced four wide, met the bid of the winner, dueled to late stretch, was no match and finished second best. GREY STORM raced in
mid pack early, went six wide and was along for third. HA HA FOR YOU was off slow, was void of speed, went four wide into the turn, angled in and offered
no late rally. RAPID EXPANSION was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide and was empty. I'M A COOL CAT was unhurried early from the inside and
was never a threat. MONEY LENDER was outrun early, went eight wide and was no factor. SNOWMEN forced the early pace, went three wide into the turn
and finished early.
