Footnotes
KHOZANDO bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and kicked clear in the lane. SEA SPLENDOR bumped with the horse to his inside at the
start, raced in the three path early, chased the leaders from the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the second turn in the four path, began a
bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. LOUD N PROUD bumped with the horse to inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way between
horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and kept on in the stretch. LAST PROMISE saved ground
around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and weakened in the lane. MACHO REAL brushed with the horse
to his inside at the break, raced in the four and five path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
WINTER'S GHOST saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend,
began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in the lane. ASSERT DOMINANCE chased the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the second turn still in the three path and kept on in the stretch. JUST PLAIN ORNERY raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the far turn and weakened late. LIVEFORTHESONG raced in the five path
early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and improved position mildly in the stretch
while never threatening the top three. HAD RIGHT raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside,
navigated the second turn from the five path and showed no kick. EIGHT WEEKS LONG trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. PAPA JIMMY raced in the four path around the first
bend, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

SCHOCHOH led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire.
GRAINGER COUNTY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
gained ground late. BAM BAM BLU tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the
finish. PREFERRED OUTCOME raced in the middle of the pack early, came around the bend in the two path and finished evenly. HE'S ON THE FLY raced
off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CHAOS KID stalked the leader on the outside through the opening stages,
navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the lane. DIAMOND LUCKIE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
made no bid.

NIGHT JUMPER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path headed into
the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch, and held that margin to the finish while drifting. OBIWAN saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. HARPOON HARRY saved
ground around the first bend, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and kept on to the wire.
RHUMJAR raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, raced in the three path
around the far turn and finished evenly. DRIFTWOOD saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far
bend and faded in the lane. OHANA EMPIRE raced in the three path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
navigated the second turn still in the three path and made no bid.
