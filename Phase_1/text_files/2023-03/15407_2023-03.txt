GENOMIC stalked the pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced four to five wide into the lane to challenge and edged clear late under strong
handling. KEARNEY rated along to race in hand down the backstretch, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the
wire. LEVEL pressed the early leader half way down the backstretch, raced four deep near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. ASHWINS ORB showed
good early foot along the inside and weakened. BULL RING was void of early speed and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
MEDICINE TAIL showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under all out pressure. SARCASTIC TONE was unhurried early
on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely to the wire. BROADWAY PETE raced mid pack early on, moved up five to six wide and
made a good late rally. BRAINSTORM rated along early, took aim nearing the upper stretch racing four wide and flattened out. PREACHER was coaxed
along and weakened while racing along the inside. ROME chased the early pace and weakened while racing between rivals. NORTH ARM BAY failed to
respond. SCOOTER'S BOY was bumped at the break, raced four wide and never was a factor. KID'S INHERITANCE bobbled at the break and never was a
factor. RICKEY B failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BARTENDERS MISTAKE showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. LITTLE
BITOTHUNDER raced off the early going, moved up along the rail in the lane and rallied gamely for the place position. NAME THE PRICE was off slowly,
stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. MR. BIG SHOT raced mid pack early on and moved up while
racing six wide in the stretch run. JUDGE'S BRIBE was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced six wide near the nine
sixteenths pole and had no late bid after the troubled beginning. B T'S BAD BOY vied for the early lead between horses and weakened. J TRAIN stalked the
pace and weakened. PICKLES N ME saved ground and never menaced. WANT TO BE COWBOY pressed the pace from the outside and gave way.
REPORT TO DUTY was getting out early and never menaced.
