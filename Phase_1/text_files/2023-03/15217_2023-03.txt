Footnotes
HEARTTHROB HALO stalked the leader from the second tier in the three path, stayed right off the leaders hip throughout the turn waiting, launched his bid
at the quarter pole, hooked the early leader, battled gamely down the lane and came away victorious. INTHEALY broke sharply, set the pace, was hooked
by another competitor down the lane, matched strides gamely until the end, but just missed. BANKROLL was strong early and was under restraints with
horses on the outside, was given the cue after the quarter pole and faded deep stretch. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU was off a step slow, rallied from mid
pack after the half mile pole, split horses at the seven sixteenth pole from the three path, started closing in on the early leaders after the quarter pole, was
within striking distance but fell short after the eighth mile pole. SIR POKERFACE was in between horses early from the four path, shuffled back a little, was
encouraged at the half mile pole, responded but stopped in the lane. NOCOMET trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COURTMAN broke inwardly and bumped and put an inner rival to tight quarters at the start, pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, vied
around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch, came in and bumped his counterpart approaching the furlong grounds, sustained the battle before becoming the
victim of bumps and brushes from his inner rival entering the final sixteenth, yet prevailed in the long duel. COUYONS CAUSE mildly bumped with an outer
rival shortly after the start, set the pace inside of a rival while in the two path, dueled with that foe around the turn, took a bump while gamely sparring
approaching midstretch, but drifted out and bumped his counterpart entering the final sixteenth, continued brushes leaving that juncture, and was bested.
DUDE DROP KID tracked in the three path entering the backstretch, took aim on the embattled leading pair nearing the lane, but failed to progress
thereafter while chasing them home. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN steadied after taking a bump from an outer rival while being put to tight quarters between
horses at the start, saved ground while trailing, and improved entering the lane. J B GRAY stalked along the inside, but faded. LONE STAR MAX bumped
the outer part of the gate while off slowly, lacked speed in the four path, and faded in the three path around the far turn. THE THREE QUARTER FRACTION
WAS AMMENDED VIA HAND DUE TO AN OBSTRUCTED BEAM.

Footnotes
F T W SLAM bumped with an outer rival at the start, yet was hustled to the fore soon after, cleared off in the two path into the turn, drew further away under
driving pressure through midstretch, and was put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. INSPECTOR ED trailed in the five path around the turn, drifted out to
the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied willingly to reach place in the final sixteenth. STARPORT vied two wide, chased his clearing counterpart from the
three path while failing to keep pace around the turn, held place through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over nearing the final sixteenth,
but was caught for place late. RACY BILLE broke a step slow before being floated outwardly by an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the three
to four paths, and lacked a bid. MAIN DUDE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, and made little impact. APRIORITY ROCKET broke outwardly,
stalked outside of the top pair early on, tucked to the rail entering the turn, saved ground while stalking, but lacked a kick to bid for place inside of a rival in
upper stretch, and tired. MIDNIGHT CROWN bumped with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside despite being urged along, and made no
impact while hanging on his left lead and lugging about in midstretch.

Footnotes
MICROPHONE (IRE) tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, bid turning for home, dueled in the five path with the game early-pace setter
through upper stretch, sustained the long battle while striving for even terms in the final furlong, and prevailed late. C FALLS set the pace in the two path,
got confronted by a pair of outer rivals turning for home, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, dueled gamely inside of the eventual winner through the
final furlong, but was nailed late. MAASAI WARRIOR settled at the rear along the inside, pursued from the two path while multiple lengths to find around the
far turn, rallied two wide into midstretch while taking aim inside of the embattled leading pair, closed in late, but came up a few strides short. SOLID
COUNTRY GOLD stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, and kept on. UNLEASH THE POWER laid off of the pace two wide
while under firm restraint around the first turn, retreated to trail at the nine sixteenths pole, and improved in midstretch. COURAGEOUSLY pressed outside
of the leader and from the three path, inched closer along with an outer rival around the far turn, and weakened entering the lane. MONARCH MAN laid off
of the pace while hung in the five path around the first turn, chased the top trio from the three path around the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
MAGEEZ was bumped by an inner foe leaving the gates, was unhurried while saving ground early, started moving up and shifting out after the half,
continued to gain ground and maneuvered through traffic through the turn, slightly brushed another rival coming out of the turn, cut the corner and drew off,
was challenged by an outside foe who closed late and had to battle to the wire, where MAGEEZ crossed the wire first by a head bob.
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT settled far off the pace early from the five path, started to move at the half mile pole from the outside, moved and matched strides
from the outside with the eventual winner along the backside and throughout the turn, was slightly brushed by the eventual winner coming out of the turn,
chased down the lane and closed with tremendous force, almost caused the upset with this huge effort but missed by a head bob. HOT LE ROY settled off
the pace mid pack from the four path, starting inching closer to the lead after the five eighths pole, was gaining ground from the outside after the half,
launched a bid coming out of the turn, made the lead for a second then was caught by a pair on the outside and had to settle for third today.
LUCKENBACHER tracked the pace setters from mid pack while racing from the four path, was urged around the five eighths pole to move up closer, was
gaining ground after the half from the outside, was within striking distance of the eventual winner leaving the turn, was driven hard but came up short.
C'MON VE was up for the early lead from the outside while matching strides with another competitor throughout the race then tired after the quarter pole.
SOCIAL AFLEET tracked from the inside, saved ground and had no finish. GALLANT STAR passed tired rivals. UNWANTED INTRUDER raced off the pace
from the outside, gained ground through the turn while still on the far outside, closed down the lane but had no late kick. PRAY IDE SING took the early
lead, matched strides a with rival from the inside until after the quarter mile pole and tired late. THERE WAS A TRAINERS OBJECTION. THE TRAINER OF
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT RAISED AN OBJECTION AGAINST MAGEEZ FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE SECOND TURN. AFTER A STEWARD'S REVIEW
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ZOZOS tracked three wide around the first turn, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, improved inside of a rival before stalking the clear leader
around the far turn, inched closer while patiently handled turning for home, took dead aim on the leader in upper stretch, ranged up at the furlong grounds,
gained an advantage under a drive approaching the final sixteenth, and drew clear. FIVE STAR GENERAL set the pace, spurted clear with eleven
sixteenths to go and opened up a wide margin, maintained a clear advantage as ZOZOS crept closer entering the lane, but was collared at the furlong
grounds, and gave in at the sixteenth pole. MAILMAN MONEY broke outwardly at the start, tracked four wide, tucked down to the three path entering the
backstretch, improved inside of a rival before chasing the top pair around the far turn, and proved best of the rest. OLLIEMYBOY saved ground while
trailing, and improved turning for home. RIGHTANDJUST stalked outside of the pace setter, but shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, which
allowed for a pair of inner rivals to improve inside of him approaching the far turn, and weakened in the four path around that bend.

Footnotes
MO SHIRO set the pace along the inside while a bit off of the rail, shifted out to the three path entering the backstretch, showed the way while well in hand
around the far turn, drew clear at the quarter pole, and inched away under a drive thereafter. FLOWERDEW saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the
rail in upper stretch to claim place inside the three sixteenths pole, and narrowly lasted from an outer rival for that position. GYPSY QUEEN broke out while
off a step slow, laid off of the pace in three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on in the final furlong to just miss reaching place.
SUMMEROSA tracked in the two path, patiently pursued from the pocket around the far turn, but failed to keep pace while chasing the clearing leader
leaving the quarter pole, then was outkicked for place by a rival on either side in midstretch. MAGNIFICENT CODE steadied when put to crowded quarters
between horses in the early stages, settled at the rear in the three to two paths, and moved up in midstretch. SALSALITA VERDE bumped with an inner
rival at the start, rated at the rear along the inside, and surpassed tiring outer rivals late. PRIZE DEBATE tracked in the four to five path around the first turn,
and weakened in uppers tretch. SMART IZZY bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked the leader from the three path, was coaxed along in the four
path to sustain that position down the backstretch, chased between horses around the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SQUIRE CREEK dueled for the lead two wide, took charge leaving the quarter pole, drew off under moderate hand urging, and was put to wraps entering
the final sixteenth. WICKED AGAIN dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that one leaving the quarter pole, resisted an
outer challenger's place bid in the final sixteenth, and held. WILD THINKER brushed an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three four paths around the
turn, gained show entering the lane, chased while refusing a lead change in upper stretch, did so leaving the furlong grounds, sustained stride to bid for
place in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. GUN COLLECTOR tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position at the half mile pole, faltered
to the rear of the field into the turn, yet regained stride nearing the lane, improved to gain fourth in upper stretch, and held that position late. RUSH CENTER
laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, and ran on mildly while lacking a bid. JULIA'S WARRIOR was brushed by an outer rival into an inner foe after
breaking half a beat slow, raced far back while hung in the five path around the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, and delayed a lead change
to midstretch while lacking a rally. RIVER RAFT broke slowly before being bumped by an outer rival while put to tight quarters at the start, lacked speed in
the four path and between horses, and failed to factor. NO TAKE BACKS broke slowly, trailed in the three path, and never got involved. CHITWOOD broke
outwardly, chased the embattled pair from the two to three paths into the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
DEBBIES PASSAGE set the pace in the three path, and held sway through the lane. THEBOYZGALAXY settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out
to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied to gain place late. A. K. A. GRAMS stalked the leader from the four path, took aim entering the lane, but only
managed to chase before flattening out in the final furlong, and was outkicked for place late. PEACEFUL VISION raced forwardly in the five path and
between horses early on, settled and tucked to the rail entering the turn, stalked around the bend, but only managed to chase through the lane. POINT OF
VICTORY bumped with an outer rival at the start before making contact with an inner foe in the aftermath, lacked speed in the three to two paths, and
improved entering the lane. KASEN'S SISTER laid off of the pace in the three path, and gave way. BLONDIE LOX BABE lacked speed in the two path,
fanned wider entering the lane, and failed to factor. KICK N KISS took a bump from an outer rival soon after the start, and never got involved. SILK
SHAKER chased from the six to five paths while outside of the top flight, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane.
