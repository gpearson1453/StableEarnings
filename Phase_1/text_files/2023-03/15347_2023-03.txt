PO BOY set the early pace off the inside, three wide off the turn while clear, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive.
SHACKLEFORD STRONG stalked the winner three to four wide, made a bid but could not get to the winner while second best. HINK'S PALADIN was
settled early on the outside on the turn, came wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. TAPIT SAM chased the pace three wide,
shifted out nearing the furlong marker and had no late kick. DEORA STORE was rated along the inside and had no rally. VALLEY VISTA was well placed
early on the inside, angled out in the lane and weakened.

LORRAINE'S LEGACY stalked the early pace, split rivals nearing the half mile marker to assume command, then drew off in the lane to prove much the
best, driving. JOYZELLA was bumped at the start, chased the pace on the inside, made a three wide bid on the far turn, but could not sustain that bid while
staying on to be clearly second ebst. SUFFICE chased the early pace three wide, then made a mild bid on the inside on the far turn, but weakened, held
show award. LIL CARRIE D set the early pace, then got out on the backstretch, continued wide on the turn and weakened, missed show award. TAVERN
tried to settle early, then saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT set the pace on the inside and was well handled, then roused at the furlong marker and drew off to prove much the best. MY GUITAR
tracked the early pace on the inside, shifted out and came four wide into the lane, then was up for the place award late. TROY OUNCE stalked the early
pace and made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out the final furlong, bested rest. BEHAVIN MYSELF was off slowly, chased the pace four wide
and came five wide into the lane and weakened. IRISH MAJOR was settled early, saved ground on the turn and tired in the drive. WILLING TO SPEED was
reserved early and then never factored.

Footnotes
FROSTED ECLAIR was rated along early, shifted out and made a five wide sweep on the turn, continued that move off the turn and took over, then drew
clear to prove best, driving. BE MY BESTIE was reluctant to load, tracked the pace on the inside, then lacked room leaving the turn, shifted out and split
rivals at the sixteenth marker and got the nod for the place award. WILDWOOD TRIPLE tracked the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and
finished willingly, lost bob for place award. FREEDOM ATTACK stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but faded late. TU ROYAL set the
early pace and got down to the inside, headed on the turn and faded in the drive. CANTOO was slammed at the start and then checked after the start, far
back on the turn, angled out wide and closed the gap late. MISS MIA chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, angled out late but needed more.
DOMINIQUE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. AIR GERRI was settled on the inside, swung out six wide leaving the turn and had no rally.
