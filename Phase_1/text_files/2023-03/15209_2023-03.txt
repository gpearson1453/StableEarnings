JAYJAYDEE stalked the early pace then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep passing the quarter pole, drew clear nearing
the head of the lane and drew off under a vigorous hand ride. RAISE A SPEIGHTS rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, was met at even terms nearing the quarter and gave up the nod, dropped back toward the head of the lane and settled for second best.
SHANGHAI CANDY rated close off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for
third. CANTAKEITANYMORE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and showed little more. JAMMIN JIMTOWN rated close to the early pace in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. GOLDEN APPEAL rated close for about a half mile then faded through the backstretch.

IT'S A REAL HONOR was bumped shortly after the start then gave chase, contested a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dueled for the lead past
the eighth pole, lugged in through the upper stretch but drew clear a sixteenth away and held on well. KNOBIESMAGICSONDE was jostled then forced
outward and into Far More shortly after the break, gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path, bore out into the lane but dug in to
take second the final strides. LAS VEGAS BLVD quickly cleared her rivals and angled to the inside, rounded the turn near the rail, was met leaving the
eighth pole and flattened inside the sixteenth. SHY BELLA chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. TAPTAP gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, eased out toward the head of the lane and showed little further. FAR MORE broke in and
made contact with Knobiesmagicsonde, was then forced outward and into It's A Real Honor then chased outside, raced in the five path of the turn and
weakened in the lane. LAURA'S GRAND broke outward and into Knobiesmagicsonde then gave chase and saved ground on the turn. The Stewards
reviewed, then dismissed claims of foul against the rider of It's A Real Honor for alleged interference at the start, lodged by the riders of Knobiesmagicsonde
and Far More.

GANDHI'S ORION bobbled at the break then took over and moved to the inside midway on the opening turn, came under pressure toward the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. WICKOSITY was bumped at the break and settled off the pace about the three
path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but drifted into the lane and settled for second best. OBOY settled
off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved near the rail on the far turn, but showed little more. D'LUCCI BOY exchanged contact with
Positraction leaving the gate then stalked the early pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and faded off the rail on the far turn.
POSITRACTION ran loose in the post parade and saved ground. FLAT BUSTED broke outward and made contact with Wickosity then settled off the early
pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. LIGHT WORK saved ground off the early pace, eased out with a bid into the
backstretch and rounded the far turn about the three path.

STEAL THE CASH saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the
three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. OVERLY CRITICAL stalked the early pace from the three path, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took a slim lead three wide passing the quarter, but was met toward mid-stretch and settled for second. SEAN
THE HAMMER closed to even terms two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated with the pace, dueled Bubba G leaving the three eighths, was met past
the quarter and continued close at the rail on the far turn, though, flattened the final sixteenth. MIMS HAT TRICK was forced outward leaving the gate then
saved early ground, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane and flattened in the lane.
ROCKIN THE PALACE rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on
the far turn and showed little more. BUBBA G veered out leaving the gate then set the early pace inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and rated with

Footnotes
GRANDIOSELY was shuffled back shortly after the start and settled off the early pace, started a bid between horses leaving the three eighths pole, took the
nod two deep midway on the turn and dug in determinedly to inch further ahead of UNLOCK in later strides, while the latter gave chase toward the inside,
steadied between horses while at a slim disadvantage midway on the turn and dueled gamely before yielding; grudgingly. DIAMONDS N DENIM chased the
early pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in from the head of the lane to clear third in later yards and was gaining on the top
two. SHANIA SEA set a pressured pace, contested the advantage off the rail on the turn, angled out leaving the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
FEAR THE DIVA steadied between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little further. DISTORTED
SPLENDOR gave chase through the backstretch and saved ground on the turn. LECTRIC ROD gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on
the turn and weakened in the lane. LADY LICIOUS gave chase well off the rail and rounded the turn about the five path.
