Footnotes
HIGH CRUISE sped clear early on, maintained a margin turning for home as BEVERLY PARK attempted a bid, but drew away from that foe in upper
stretch, and held sway under a drive. BEVERLY PARK stalked the clear leader from the inside, shifted out and closed in to take aim outside of that foe
turning for home, but lacked a bid before failing to keep pace in upper stretch, then held place through the final furlong. OPTIMAL COURAGE chased the
clear leader two wide, lost place to an inner rival while floated to the three path at the three furlong pole, and ran on in pursuit of the top pair through the final
furlong to prove best of the rest. HERD IMMUNITY broke a step slow, trailed while hung in the five to six paths around the turn, and moved up without
threatening. POPULIST saved ground towards the rear around the turn, but to no avail. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG chased from midpack in the three to four
paths around the turn, and made little impact. CRIMSON STORM pursued in the four to five paths around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
LILY'S CREED broke sharp, took her spot on the rail, was passed at the six furlong pole by another competitor, shifted over and stalked from the two and
three path, launched a bit at the three eighths pole, easily took command, showed the way from there, took the win easily today. SALSALITA VERDE broke
into the one path, was quickly corrected, raced forward along the rail four off the lead, maintained that position until the quarter pole, angled four wide into
the upper stretch, was closing gamely, fell behind a tiring foe, zigged out to avoid traffic and drifted in a bit while chasing the leader, was unable to catch the
leader today but was able to run a nice second. ZIGGZAPPA bobbled at the start, caught her balance, settled into the the back of the field, was allowed to
find her stride while racing comfortably in the four path along the outside. was put into gear at the half mile pole where she started gaining ground and
passing rivals, raced wide through the second turn, angled out the five wide in the upper stretch, drifted back into the four path as she was racing down the
lane, got up for third. CATHERINE BLAZE broke into the middle of the pack where she settled along the rail, raced a ground saving trip through out, weaved
in and out of traffic in the stretch drive, never breaking her momentum enabling her to run fourth. FROSTY DIVA vied for the early lead, was in between
rivals leaving the first turn, took back and stalked, shuffled back a few lengths down the back side, was cued at the three eighths pole and responded well,
was two wide at the quarter pole and within striking distance but tired in the stretch while weaving through traffic. PRIZE DEBATE vied for the lead, took
command at the six furlong pole, set the pace from the rail, saved ground through out, tired in the lane. CAPELLA RED was never involved.

Footnotes
COUYONS CAUSE set the pace outside of a prompting foe, led in the two path entering the backstretch before that rival applied outer pressure, shook clear
of him while in the three path approaching the quarter pole, spun into the lane in the four path, and held sway. DUDE DROP KID laid off of the pace two
wide and between horses, then three wide around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to gain place in
the final sixteenth. C. F. CONGRESS took a bump from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, was urged to gain two wide
around the far turn, gained place three wide in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer rival for that position late. SEEHOSS settled off of pace three to
four wide, then stayed on between horses. INFINITESIMAL leaned inwardly, bumped a rival, and checked from between horses at the start, saved ground
off of the pace, took a bump while slipping inside of rival in upper stretch, and lacked a bid through the final furlong. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN saved ground
at the rear, then moved up. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, chased between horses entering the lane, bumped an
inner rival in upper stretch, and faltered. GTUONE BUCK prompted along the inside early on, backed off to shift outside of the pace setter approaching the
backstretch, pressed approaching the far turn, but weakened in the four path nearing the quarter pole. UNBRIDLED PULPIT got rank while heavily
restrained at the start, and was well outrun in the four path. CIGAR VAN tracked in the three path, but wilted in the six path around the far turn, and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
JULIA'S WARRIOR stalked four wide, pressed the top pair around the turn, sustained a bid while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds, changed
over while sparring entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed. ALILNALOT set the pace two wide and between horses, cleared their inner counterpart before
dueling inside of a pair of foes around the turn, shook free momentarily entering the lane, dug in to resist JULIA'S WARRIOR's bid in midstretch, dueled
gamely through the late stages, but was grudgingly bested. POWER ALLEY laid off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turn, altered course to
the six path to be outside of rivals at the furlong grounds, and offered a late kick to gain show. ATTACHE laid off of the pace, tracked while ranging closer in
the three path around the turn to loom a danger behind the leader trio nearing the lane, but flattened out in midtretch. RATE CONFIRMATION prompted the
pace three wide, dueled two wide and between horses around the turn, but yielded entering the lane, and gave way. SAVAGE KISS lacked speed along the
inside, trailed around the turn, and failed to factor. PAPA D L was sent early, failed to sustain vying position inside of foes after a quarter mile, chased
around the turn, then weakened on his left lead through the lane, and dropped his rider after galloping out, but was remounted without further incident.
STAYINYOURLANE was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
ALL THE DIAMONDS tracked along the inside, smoothly shifted outside of the clear leader entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, drove
clear leaving that juncture, and lasted from an outer on-charger late. GALLANT STAR bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide
and between horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and offered a belated rally, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. MILTONTOWN laid off of the
pace three wide and between horses, encountered traffic entering the lane, rallied once clear, split foes three wide at the sixteenth pole, and gained show.
THE FEATURE broke a step slow at the start, gained from midpack three wide around the turn, spun into the lane four wide while vying for minor positions,
but flattened out through the lane. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, set a clear pace around the turn, remained in
hand through upper stretch, but was roused leaving the three sixteenths pole as the eventual winner loomed a danger, got outkicked by that one at the
furlong grounds, and faltered late. B B MOODY stalked two wide and between horses, but yielded after being floated three wide entering the lane. BORN
AGAIN GEORGE tracked in the two path, then chased evenly along the inside through the lane while hanging on his left lead. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL
chased from midpack in the four path, but weakened between horses entering the lane. MAINTAINANCE MATT made little impact while hung in the five
path around the turn. JUST BLAZE was outrun along the inside. ROCKDALE broke slowly while snagging the outer part of the gate at the start, then saved
ground off of the pace, and tired.

Footnotes
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked the early leader from in between horses in the three path for the first two furlongs, started to gain ground at the half mile
marker, took command of the race at the quarter pole where she turned for home, left the exact amount of one path along the inside, intentionally making it
tight, then she she drew off easily for the win. MALIBU TOAST vied for the lead, set the fractions while racing along the rail, was caught at the quarter pole
and tired in the lane. GOLD PLUS vied for the early lead, settled into the second tier in the two path, saved ground racing along the fence, waited patiently
for racing room, angled out at the three sixteenth pole three wide but ran flat after that. CINCY'S ANNA was slow into stride, was unhurried until the half mile
pole, was asked at the half and responded with a good turn foot, traveled four wide through the turn was four wide at the upper stretch, was hustled and
encouraged down the lane but to no avail. BLACK ACE vied for the early lead, settled into the second flight of horses on the outside, angled into the three
path at the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the three path and shifted into the two path, was asked and encouraged, but tired late. SHE'S MY
LOUIE V. was off a bit slow, and four wide, moved up at the half where she split horses and and angled into the three path, saved ground in the turn, was
well positioned at the quarter pole, was asked but had trouble switching leads and tired late. SPOILED BRAT had an awkward start raced mid pack along
the rail early on, shuffled back a few while saving ground, passed the halfmile pole and started a retreat. THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION. THE
RIDDR OF MALIBU TOAST CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MAGOINABUBBLEBATH FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE LEVING THE
SECOND TURN. AFTER A STEWARDS' INQUIRY THE OBJUECTION WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
MAILMAN MONEY pressed two wide, bid for the lead at the furlong grounds while an outer rival threatened as well, and edged away through the late
stages. BIG BLUE LINE laid off of the pace in the four to three paths around the first turn, split foes two wide to claim show at the five sixteenths pole, took
aim outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but only managed to chase the bidding eventual winner leaving the furlong grounds, and gained place at
the wire. SUPER DESIGN set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids in midstretch, got outkicked nearing the final sixteenth, and lost place at the wire.
CASH LOGISTICS tracked three wide, chased around the far turn, and gave way entering the lane. FENWICK STATION tracked along the inside, but
lacked progress under urging around the far turn, and tired. PIPES AND DRUMS trailed in the four to five paths around the turns, weakened on his left lead
in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY SUNDAE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked behind the leaders and form the two path, smoothly tipped two wide entering the
lane to take aim outside of the leader, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, and inched clear. SMART IZZY leaned inwardly at the start, tracked from
midpack in the three path, then saved ground around the far turn, attempted to slip inside of STRAWBERRY SUNDAE at the quarter pole, but checked in
tight leaving that marker, sustained stride in the final furlong, split foes two wide in the final sixteenth, and gained place. TENSAS BERTIE tracked in the two
to three paths around the first turn, attempted to inch closer outside of the leading trio around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, stayed on to
bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an inner rival late. EVERYLITTLESINGH dueled for the lead along the inside, shook free entering
the lane, but was only clear briefly, got headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and faltered late. MO SMOKING settled far back in the three path,
fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. MIA ANTONIA broke a bit outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to
the four path entering the backstretch, swung to the nine path in upper stretch, and moved up. BLESSED ASSURANCE stalked three wide, pressed down
the backstretch, but yielded four wide and between horse entering the lane. HOT GOLDEN GIRL bobbled slightly at the start, saved ground at the rear, but
to no avail. GLAMOROUS STAR took back from crowded quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, chased in the three path
around the far turn, fanned six wide entering the lane, and weakened. YOCKEY BETTERFLY bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead two
wide, then from between horses down the backstretch, but weakened three wide entering the lane. ARTIE'S DEAL broke slowly, recovered to an inside
midpack position approaching the first turn, but was through after a half mile, and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF SMART IZZY CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF STRAWBERRY SUNDAE FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE QUARTER POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

MY AUNT SNOOKIE broke sharp, set the pace to her liking, saved ground racing along the rail, drew off in the stretch. TITLED LADY was slow into start
and laid far off the pace early, raced four wide after the half while gaining ground, smartly angled down to the rail entering the turn, saved ground the rest of
the way, was encouraged and responded well but could not catch the eventual winner today, ran a very game second. GRACIE DIAMOND was stalking the
early leader while racing along the rail, saved ground through the turn and moved, was well placed at the quarter pole but tired. ROJA LIGERA raced mid
pack early four wide, raced wide through out, tired. ELECTRIC SENSE was forwardly placed early on from the inside, improved position briefly after the half,
and tired after the three eighths.

Footnotes
GUITAR TRIBUTE raced at the rear two wide, fanned six wide in midstretch, and offered a strong late rally to drive past the leaders in the closing stages.
PAYDAY TOO bumped with an inner rival before being taken back to trail at the start, raced at the rear along with the eventual winner early on, sustained a
rail rally through upper stretch, tipped two wide at the furlong grounds, bid at the sixteenth pole, led briefly soon after, but was outkicked late, and saved
place. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, lacked speed in the four to five paths, stayed on mildly as the pace collapsed in
the final furlong, got outkicked for show in the final sixteenth, but kept on to gain that position at the wire. WAR COUNT bumped with an outer rival at the
start before being sent between horses, gained an advantage while shifting from the four to three paths at the seven furlong pole, cleared entering the
backstretch, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was caught passing the sixteenth pole,
and weakened late. SIR OVERANALYZE prompted the pace along the inside early on, backed off to track, was driven for gain in the four path around the
far turn, but lacked a bid before getting outkicked for minor rewards in midstretch. STEAL IT BACK tracked two wide, pursued the top flight from the two
path around the far turn, bid for place inside of rivals leaving the qurater pole, but yielded between foes at the furlong grounds. RUN ROCKET laid off of the
pace along the inside, was urged along in the two to three paths around the far turn, and failed to respond. LUCKENBACHER raced in midpack two wide
and between horses, but faded with five furlongs to go, and was done early. ARCTIC ROSE was jostled between horses at the start, recovered to be
forward in the four to five paths while outside of the leaders around the first turn, chased in the three path around the far turn, but weakened entering the
lane. HOT LE ROY bumped an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack three wide, but weakened around the far turn.
