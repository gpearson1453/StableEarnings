Footnotes
KARTANO prompted the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth pole and dug in. WICKED GENIUS
settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch, gained slightly, was
mildly herded out in the final sixteenth and was taken in hand late. DUBBY DUBBIE raced in range in the two path, was one-paced in the lane and gained
the show late. CRACK SHOT set a rated pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole, resisted inside of the winner past the eighth pole then
weakened. EL SOCIO chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. DRILLOMATIC failed to menace while racing two wide. BENELUX played no
factor while racing three wide. CASTAGNO was outrun inside. OBJECTIONS LODGED BY BOTH THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF WICKED GENIUS
WERE NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SHAKE YOUR BONES had an awkward start, trailed in the four path around the first turn, was coaxed in the six path midway down the backstretch,
advanced under a drive around the far turn and fanned out to the eight path into the lane, rallied down the center under left handed encouragement and
drew past a trio of inner rivals in final strides for the win. STRAIGHT TIME stalked between foes in the three path around the first turn and was in the five
path down the backside, took aim from the four path into the far turn, was cued nearing the quarter pole and was in the four path entering the stretch, and
ran on between foes for place. IMPETUOUS SOUL raced in range under a hold in the four path around the first turn, tipped out to the six path and moved
up down the backstretch, was roused to bid in the three path around the far turn and was under left handed urging from said position into the lane, and kept
on between foes to finish with show. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set the pace along the inside around the first turn and tipped out to the two path entering the
backstretch, was under a drive along the inside rounding the far turn and tipped back out to the two path for the stretch, and stayed on through the stretch
before yielding to a trio of outer rivals in the final sixteenth to miss minor placings. SIR BITESALOT was unhurried in the three path, tipped out to the five
path around the far turn and was urged from the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. PAPA KATZ tracked in the two path around the first turn and
was in the three path down the backstretch, was cued in the two path rounding the far turn and angled out to the five path into the lane, but was no factor.
HEART BOY rated along the inside but never threatened. TRUE IDENTITY prompted the pace in the four path but backed up early around the far turn.

A LA CARTE pressed the pace in the three path, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside of MR. PEEKS through midstretch and forged
clear late. MR. PEEKS set a pressured pace in two path, fought back inside of the winner in upper stretch and was clearly second best. LAST SHIFT was
bumped at the start, trailed early, made a strong four wide move around the turn to reach near even terms nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left
lead in the lane and was no match for the top two. LUPO'S LEGACY had his head turned at the start then bumped LAST SHIFT, raced in the three path and
never threatened. LOCKE AND KEY was outrun inside. PAPA DEL CIELO had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
SHERLYN GO GO stalked in the three path, was cued right handed into the far turn and under a drive while shifting out to the five path entering the stretch,
rallied to draw past an inner dueling duo in the final furlong, and went clear. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU set the pace in the two path around the first turn and
along the inside down the backstretch, was under rousing along the inside while challenged by an outer foe around the far turn, tipped out to the three path
into the lane, tipped back inwards in the upper part of the lane, bumped with an outer foe while digging in inside of that foe in the final furlong, was caught by
another late surging outer foe in the final sixteenth, but held on to place gamely. SHE'S A JOY prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed to bid in the
two path around the far turn, got floated out to the four path into the stretch, dueled with the inner pacesetter while tipping inwards in upper stretch and kept
on to take a narrow lead in the final furlong, bumped with that inner foe near the final sixteenth, and hung late to lose the duel with the pacesetter and
finished with show. HOAX tracked in the four path, was ridden around the far turn and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly.
SHEA D SECRET was unhurried in the two path, was cued along the inside around the far turn, tipped out to the three path into the lane, but was tired.
ESOTERIC raced off the pace in the five path and was never a menace.

Footnotes
FEARLESS SOLDIER steadied nearing the first turn, raced in range two wide around that bend, edged closer three wide around the far turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, closed under left-handed urging and drew clear. CHECKITUP was fractious in the gate, sped to the front two wide around the first turn, set
the pace along the rail down the backstretch and around the far turn and fought on inside of foes to hold the place. GIPSY CHIEF (GB) was forced out
entering the first turn, raced in range three wide, bid three deep around the far turn, reached even terms near the quarter pole, vied between to the sixteenth
pole and was outfinished. RIGHT TO WIN (IRE) was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace three wide, stayed on through the lane then bore out
late. UNION TRAIL veered out at the start and bumped foes, got out again entering the first turn, angled in midway around that bend, stalked inside down
the backstretch, bid two wide between foes rounding the far turn and weakened in the lane. TIGER'S LEGACY was bumped soon after the start, raced off
the pace two wide, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. HARRY HOOD broke in a tangle then was shut off and forced to check soon after,
raced well back three wide, swung out in upper stretch, lugged in not longer and improved position. MY SPIRIT saved ground in range, went two wide
around the far turn and faded. PRACTIKO saved ground in range and had no response around the far turn. SHARP PLAY BOY was rank early, saved
ground and made little impact. SPIRITWOOD was off slow and outrun while racing two and three wide.

SOUPER COHIBA rated in the three path around the first turn and was around the four path down the backstretch, tipped out to the five path and ranged up
under a drive around the far turn, bid passing the quarter pole and took the lead in the six path at the top of the lane, opened slightly in the upper part of the
lane and drew clear through the final furlong. BACKCHAT trailed in the four path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backside, was
coaxed in the five path rounding the far turn and tipped out to the seven path for the stretch, chased home the winner to finish with place. UNCLE
ARMANDO chased along the inside around the first turn and was in the three path into the backstretch, was under urging around the far turn and angled out
to the seven path into the lane, and finished evenly to get up for show. ADVANCE CASH raced keenly in the four path around the first turn and settled to
track from said position down the backside, was roused around the far turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. BADBADBOBBY prompted the
pace in the three path, was driven between rivals around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. J P HELLISH set the pace in the two path, was roused and
opened slightly into the far turn, but was reeled in midway around the far turn, and yielded in the stretch. THE MAR brushed the inner part of the gate
leaving, raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and was inside of rivals down the backside, was cued from the rail around the far turn but
failed to menace.

POWERFULLY BUILT settled off the pace outside, raced five and six wide around the turn, closed widest, seized command near the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead. SOUPER SUCCESS raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, rallied between foes, took a brief lead nearing the
sixteenth pole but was second best late. COTTON lacked early speed in the three path, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked a clear path until deep stretch
and rallied for the show. CHARMED (GB) prompted the pace three wide between foes, vied between to the sixteenth pole and weakened. HARD COUNT
was up close four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, led in midstretch and faded through the final furlong. UNCLE B had speed inside, bid at the rail
in midstretch and tired late. FOREST SURVIVOR chased the pace while racing two wide and lacked a closing bid. BEE BY THE SEA played no factor while
racing two wide. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK set the pace in the two path and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
WELL INTO set the pace in the two path, was roused into the far turn, opened up under right handed cues from the three path into the lane, tipped towards
the rail passing the eighth pole, and held sway. BE MY SUNSHINE tracked between foes in the three path, was coaxed in the four path around the far turn,
floated out to the eighth path into the stretch, ran on while tipping in through the stretch, and got up for place. ERNA had to check into the first turn and
bumped an outer foe while doing so, stalked in the four path, tipped into the three path under a ride around the far turn, and kept on from the four path in the
stretch for show. CLOUDY BAY was held up in midpack in the two path, tipped out to the five path and was roused around the far turn, got floated out to the
nine path into the stretch, an finished evenly down the center. TALL GIRL steadied along the inside of rivals around the first turn and raced off the pace from
said position, remained inside of rivals around the far turn and into the stretch but was one paced in the stretch. LADY AZTECA raced wellback in the two
path, was under rousing while tipping out around the far turn and bumped with an outer foe in the four path at the top of the lane, and flattened in the final
furlong. SILVER STRIPES rated in the four path around the first turn and was in the six path down the backstretch, was coaxed rounding the far turn and
urged from the seven path into the stretch, but was unable to factor. TITUBA raced prominently in the three path, was ridden around the turn and tipped out
to the five path into the lane, but faded. AROUND THE SUN was unhurried in the four path, bumped with an inner foe from the five path at the top of the
lane, and never threatened. ESSAOUIRA steadied along the inside into the first turn, was prompted along in the two path down the backstretch, was under
urging in the three path at the top of the stretch, but gaveway. MISS UCRANIA trailed in the four path around the first turn, was in the five path down the
backstretch, and was never involved. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL was bumped by a checking inner foe into the first turn, raced in midfield around the five path
but was no menacee.

Footnotes
FOR THE FLAG set the pace under a hold just off the rail along the inside, remained under a hold rounding the far turn before being cued in the three path
while being challenged by an outer foe at the top of the lane, dug in while drifting out against right hand cues through the lane, but held sway. SAHLABIYA
tracked between rivals in the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backside, ranged up in the four path around the far turn and
was roused while making a bid entering the stretch, ran on but was drifting out thru the stretch, and hung to finish in place. PURE COUNTRY steadied along
the inside around the first turn, was a bit keen and had to steady early into the backstretch, stalked along the inside, waited for room around the far turn, was
cued into the lane, and kept on for show. MESAORIA was unhurried around the four path early, was put to a drive around the far turn and ranged up from
the seven path into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong. ASPEN chased between foes in the three path, shifted inwards into the stretch and
finished evenly. LUTE PLAYER travelled in range under a hold in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn and in the six path at the top
of the stretch, but flattened passing the eighth pole. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL hopped at the start, raced wellback in the three path around the first turn and
was in the two path down the backside, was cued midway around the far turn, and urged left handed while swinging out to the eight path in upper stretch,
but was no factor. MS. SOLVEIG rated in the two path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn and was under urging while angling out to the seven
path in upper stretch, but was no threat. WAR PRINCESS prompted the inner pacesetter under a hold from the three path, was roused to bid around the far
turn, but gaveway into the lane. PIMENOVA trailed in the four path early, fanned out to the ten path into the stretch, but was no menace. SWEET
CURALINA settled up close in the four path but backed up around the far turn.
