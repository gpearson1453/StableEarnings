SIR CUPID far behind early, swung wide advancing into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in the final sixteenth. ASH OF MY ENEMY trailed for half
a mile, advanced inside and finished well to gain place. ET'S TOY SOLDIER dueled outside, took over midway on the turn, widened in the stretch then
weakened late. ALIGNMENT broke slowest and chased far behind then the narrowed gap while no threat. PRACTICALLYMINE chased wide down the
backstretch and faded steadily. KIMBO DANCER earned a narrow advantage dueling inside then stopped on the turn. JEKYLL ISLAND settled inside the
dueling leaders then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DATHOSS broke in bumping a rival at the start, stalked outside, moved up on the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch,
dueled with CRISTIANO'S DREAMi n the final furlong and wore down that rival in deep stretch to prevail. CRISTIANO'S DREAM chased close up on the
inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, put a head in front, dug in gamely on the rail and yielded grudgingly. COLD WALKER stalked the pace early on,
chased the leaders on the turn, finished evenly in the lane and held third. DADASHEV raced off the pace inside, came wide for the drive and rallied mildly
outside. BIZZY GILLESPIE was bumped and steadied at the start, raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. MR. TUTTLE was
bumped hard and steadied at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. BAR ON THE BEACH showed early speed outside to set the pace,
dueled between rivals entering the stretch and faded in the final furlong. DOUGIE was bumped on both sides and steadied at the start, then outrun.

Footnotes
CINNAMON DREAM trailed early, circled her field rallying on the final turn and drew away while being geared down in the late stages. MILWAUKEE BAY
saved ground to the stretch, angled out and closed well while no threat to the winner. HEART LIGHT settled just off the pace outside, moved closer on the
final turn then faded. CASH ON FIRST vied for the advantage inside for three quarters and faltered. NANA'S BOOPA moved close up outside, led briefly at
the quarter pole and gave way. MAARTY'S DILEMMA dropped back along the inside and was never in contention. MISBEHAVING LADY was fanned five
wide on the first turn then raced far back throughout. ROSE LEGACY led narrowly to the far turn then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
LA REGALADA drifted in slightly in front of REID'S FANGIRL soon after the start, chased three wide, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of
IMAGINTHEKISS, dueled in the final furlong, came over bothering that rival at the sixteenth pole, then drew clear late. IMAGINTHEKISS set the pace on the
inside, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail, was bothered slightly at the sixteenth marker and yielded. LOUELLA STREET stalked four wide
early, then chased inside on the turn and rallied mildly in the lane. THE FURMANATOR chased close up between rivals early, chased on the turn, came
three wide into the lane and weakened. REID'S FANGIRL clipped heels and stumbled badly soon after the start, the rider lost the irons and quickly
recovered, outrun early, moved up on the turn and failed to threaten. VERDANDI stalked three wide early, chased inside on the turn and gave way. A
Stewards' Inquiry was posted, along with Jockey Objections from the riders of IMAGINTHEKISS and REID'S FANGIRL against the winner. After reviewing
the video, LA REGALADA was disqualified and placed fifth for both incidents.

CREME CARAMEL earned a narrow lead outside, took over after half a mile and drew away under moderate urging. RISEN CHANGE saved ground, faded
briefly to last on the turn then came again and rallied for the place. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE settled inside the dueling pacesetters, angled out in the stretch
with a mild rally. TIZITA engaged in a duel with the winner inside for half a mile and faded. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX lacked speed outside, moved very wide
into the stretch and flattened out. DENALI RAE was well placed outside the dueling leaders then gave way after half a mile. I LOVE MAGEL raced very wide
throughout and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
KING SWANSBORO raced close up early, vied outside for the lead, dueled with SHADOW BAY on the far turn, took over, drew off, widened in the final
furlong and was geared down late. SHADOW BAY set the early pace, then vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, was no match for
that rival and remained clear for place honors. KANE raced two wide off the pace, asked for run on the far turn, came three wide into the laneand bested the
others. SETTE STELLE raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired. LOGAN'S RUNNER stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside,
chased inside on the far turn and tired. BIG REDWHITEBLUE lost his action and was very slow into stride, dropped far back after that and was outrun. After
a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official. PER RULING #23231PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, LOGAN'S
RUNNER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

clear pace to the final sixteenth but was nailed at the finish. BUCKS SOME moved just off the leaders three wide and continued willingly. AMBITIOUSLY
PLACED trailed down the backstretch, moved wide into the stretch and was no threat. HIGHTIME VALENTINE saved ground off the pace then flattened out
in the stretch. BILLIEANNE lacked speed racing wide and weakened steadily. BLINKERS broke slowest and lacked speed then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
SATCHEL DE RITCHES dueled briefly inside rivals, quickly drew away on the turn, widened in the stretch and stayed safe while ridden out. RUDY ROD
saved ground off the pace, angled out on the turn and finished gamely for the place. TACTICAL PLAN rushed up inside, was taken up sharply near the
three eighths pole, was blocked at the quarter pole, closed inside and edged for place. OUTRAGEOUS BET trailed for half a mile then offered some late
energy. HIBACHI raced in clear behind the dueling leaders then gave way on the turn. PASSAGE OF LINES prompted the pace between rivals in the
opening quarter then stopped. CATCH MY VIBE was urged close up three wide down backstretch then stopped abruptly. The stewards posted an inquiry
into the incident near the three eighths pole. PER RULING 23223PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, PASSAGE OF LINES WAS
DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
