Footnotes
BRINEE made the pace on a short lead along the inside, continued well into the lane and edged away late. SHEZA SAVAGE was just off the pace along the
inside then dropped back in traffic behind the leaders going to the far turn, came again in the lane and rallied clear for the place. BOLD LEGEND broke in
the air, followed the pace three and four wide then moved up in the lane but could not threaten the top pair. UNHERDOF was just off the early leaders while
three to four wide and weakened in the drive. NEBRASKA RED tracked the winner three wide and weakene3d in the drive. REMARKABLE CHARM failed to
mount a bid four wide. STARLIGHT TWIST was always back. BLUEBIRD DAY saved ground and was not a factor.

ground in reach of the pace, continued along the rail and was blocked through midstretch, took back and gaied third late. PARLAY PETE dueled in HOT
ARTIE early, continued to late in the far turn and came up empty. RANDOM AFFAIR failed to rally three wide.
