GOOD BYE CHARLIE tracked the leaders from the inside, gained command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear. RUN FACTOR was away in
good order to duel for the lead with KIND OF GALLANT while racing four-wide, could not gain on the winner late but finished well to re-gain the place. KIND
OF GALLANT broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FIRECRACKER STAND was forwardly
placed early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. JAZZ TOWN was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. FREESTONE showed no early speed, raced ten-wide through the turn and did not threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

LOOKIN SO LUCKY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. GYPSY WIFE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain on the winner. IF YOU
WANT IT broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and lacked the needed closing response. LADY NOGUEZ was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HURRICAIN HUNTER showed no early speed, saved ground
through the second turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MISS IMPORTANT raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards to be
going away late. J T'S LA NENA broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter but could not
resist the winner from over the top. HEART ON THE RUN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and rallied late.
ELDORADO DREAM was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. REIGN OF FIRE lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SPEEDY GIGI settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually
gave way. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

J T'S A. T. M. was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority.
MISTER MCLEAN broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place.
PRAYER OF JABEZ settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. CANDY ZIP lacked early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. STAY HAPPY disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half.
MOSQUITO FLEET showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FASCINATED was off slow, showed no early foot, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ROUSING RUBBLE pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off. RINGS OF SATURN
pressed the pace from the inside throughout and could not match strides with the winner in the drive. GOLDEN COWBOY broke sharply then settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some late run. WARFRONT FIGHTER
disputed the pace while racing three-wide, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. TUMAC MOUNTAIN vied for the lead from between foes,
checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way. DIAMOND WILLOW lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
ARIMONY was off slow, pulled up soon after and vanned off. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
