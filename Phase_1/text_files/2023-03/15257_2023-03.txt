Footnotes
UPPER ROOM sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. PARLEY STREET
chased the leaders while racing five-wide throughout and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. EROTIC was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM chased the leaders from the inside and gave way through the final
furlong. SPIRE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was off slow, showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. RANCHER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. THE
RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

eased through the lane. CENTAURUS lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn, did not reach contention and was eased through the lane. THE

Footnotes
SENSEMAKER was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and held off the closing CATS
TOUCH to prevail. CATS TOUCH tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner late. MOVE OVER (GB)
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. OF GOOD REPORT settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PALACE PRINCE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going five furlongs.
LOLLY EXPRESS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. UPO showed brief speed and weakened. THE
RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
DISCERNMENT was away in good order to press the pace of LEXINGTON HUMOR while racing four-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and drew clear. LEXINGTON HUMOR pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter but could
not match strides with the winner late. MISS GLORIOUS set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the quarter and gave
way through the final furlong. ASENA was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to rally. MS
PARKSIDE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn ,angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. BORN TO REIGN lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SEMI SWEET was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. FLO TIME was off slow and lagged throughout.
