Footnotes
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET rated off of the early pace while not far back, steadied slightly while in tight quarters heading to the turn, advanced while three
wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted OBVIOUS approaching the furlong pole, disposed of the runner-up leaving the furlong marker and kept to task
in the final stages to prove best. OBVIOUS bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, rushed up heading to the turn and pressed the pace into the bend,
took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker, was confronted by GENTLEMAN'S SECRET nearing mid-stretch, could not hold keep pace with the winner
in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. EMERALD MAGIC took back off of the moderate early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, was
roused three wide into the stretch, closed in the late stages and was up in the final strides to secure third. MINOSO stalked the moderate early pace from
the inside, made a bit of headway nearing mid-stretch, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and was outfinished for third. RHODIUM RUNNER broke
alertly and contested the early pace, battled for pace duties with OBVIOUS to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased while still in aim to
mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
BLUSHING BAY was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the turn, circled six wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed with a rush in
deep stretch, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker, surged in the final strides and was up for the win on the wire. GARDEES WORLD broke alertly
and dictated terms to the turn, extended the lead while setting moderate fractions to the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, came under
pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker and was nailed on the line for the win, while holding for the place. BOUNDFORJAMAICA took back off of the
moderate early pace, raced three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker and missed for the place, while
securing the show. HALF HOPING chased the moderate early pace, raced two wide between runners to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
offered a late rally but was outfinished in deep stretch and was just edged for the show. CLOCHARD STREET was forwardly placed into the turn, stalked
the moderate pace to the quarter marker, came three wide into the drive, chased GARDEES WORLD to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages.
SMILIN EVIE chased the moderate pace from the inside, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE was prominent into the first turn, kept attendance to HARBOR SKY through the backstretch run, advanced on that rival along the far
turn, battled to mid-stretch, put away HARBOR SKY inside of the furlong marker and drew clear under hand urging in the final stages. HARBOR SKY was
hustled to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions while off of the rail into the backstretch run, was well handled to the far turn, was confronted by
AUSPICIOUS STYLE nearing the quarter marker, met that bid and battled with that foe to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and just held for the
place. SPROSTON chased the moderate pace, improved position while two wide and between runners nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the
stretch drive, could not keep pace with the winner in the final furlong and just missed for the place, while clear of the rest for show. WILD WAGER was
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, improved position in the drive but did not threaten. CARSON'S LEGACY took back off of
the moderate early pace, was well positioned into the second turn, saved ground heading into the stretch, was outrun in the drive and tired in the final
furlong. BEROLIJEAN (FR) was allowed to settle while not far back, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch,
was outrun approaching the furlong marker and gave way.

OUR EXPECTATION was allowed to settle off of the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, caught STANFORD BAY at the the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail over the
oncoming runner-up. HUNTERS GHOST chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the turn, angled to the three path nearing
the quarter marker, advanced nearing the furlong grounds, was outkicked by the winner in the late stages, finished well in deep stretch and was second
best. STANFORD BAY broke alertly and showed good early speed, dictated terms to the turn, drew to a clear lead approaching the top of the lane,
remained clear to mid-stretch, was overtaken at the sixteenth-marker and just held for the show. SATANTA was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground
to the quarter marker, swung two wide for the drive, offered a late rally inside of the furlong marker and just missed for the show. AMANOFMYSTATURE
stalked the early fractions, raced three wide into the turn then angled to the two path while between runners, lost ground approaching the top of the lane, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, took up while in tight quarters just inside of the furlong pole and lacked a late response. REFI NOW tracked the decent early pace,
raced two wide into the turn then slipped to the inside nearing the quarter marker, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, drifted out just inside of the furlong
marker, made contact with AMANOFMYSTATURE and gave way in the late stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INSIDE
OF THE FURLONG MARKER INVOLVING AMANOFMYSTATURE AND REFI NOW. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
REFI NOW DRIFTED OUT AND INTERFERED WITH AMANOFMYSTATURE BUT DUE TO AMANOFMYSTATURE FINISHING AHEAD OF REFI NOW,
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. THE RIDER OF AMANOFMYSTATURE ALSO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF REFI NOW.

Footnotes
SMILING LADY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through decent fractions through the backstretch run, dictated terms to the
quarter marker, drew to a clear lead leaving the second turn, was given a few reminder taps in the stretch and held sway in the end as much the best.
BOURBON GLAZE was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, kept attendance to SMILING LADY to the
quarter marker, could not match strides with that rival in the stretch and just held for second. MASTERY KAT tracked the decent early fractions, was well
placed through the backstretch run, raced two then three wide to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in the late stages but was
unable to offer the needed late response and just missed for the place, while just holding for the show. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA took back off of the early
pace, came three wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, slipped to the inside heading into the far turn, improved position in
upper stretch, closed willingly in the late stages and just missed for the minor awards. DELUSIVELY chased the moderate fractions from the inside,
maintained position to the quarter pole, swung three wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally. HAPPY GAL was allowed to settle, raced three wide into
the first turn then tucked into the two path entering the backstretch run, was not far back heading to the second turn, was outrun while three wide nearing
the quarter marker, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
POUR ON THE COLE tracked the leaders along the first turn, settled off of the contentious pace along the backstretch run, loomed four wide nearing the
quarter marker, came five wide into the stretch, made a grinding rally in the drive, caught ON RAGLAN ROAD in deep stretch, took command at the
sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. ON RAGLAN ROAD tracked the decent early fractions, maintained position through the
backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid approaching the quarter marker, confronted TIZONA and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead
into the final furlong, could not hold off the oncoming winner in deep stretch and just held for the place on the wire. DI LAURIAN broke alertly, set the early
pace then ceded the lead along the backstretch run to TIZONA, rated off of that rival's pace heading to the second turn, advanced while saving ground
nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, lost ground heading to mid-stretch, re-rallied late but was outkicked in deep stretch and just
missed for the place, while clear of the rest for the show. TIZONA was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace into the backstretch run then took
command heading to the half-mile marker, drew to a clear lead approaching the far turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, battled with ON
RAGLAN ROAD to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. AWE was allowed to settle while not far back, mounted a four wide bid along the second turn,
could not sustain that run in the stretch and flattened out. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle, saved
ground to the second turn and did not threaten. ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried in the early going, lost contact along the backstretch run and showed little.

IMPLICITLY was away in good order then was shuffled to the back in the early stages, trailed heading to the turn, ran two wide to the quarter marker, circled
the field and came five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, took command in deep stretch and
edged away in the final stages. PHANTOM DROP showed speed and tracked the quick early pace heading to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the
quarter marker, ran in pursuit of MUAY THAI to mid-stretch, was not able to match strides with the oncoming winner in deep stretch and just held for the
place. SIERRA MELODY was pinballed at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace to the turn, saved ground while advancing
approaching the quarter marker, continued that gain to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and just missed for the place, while holding safely for
the show. CINDERELLAS PRINCE chased the quick early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, lost position approaching mid-stretch and did not
offer a late rally. EL CHARRO CHAMP broke out at the start, bothered the neighboring SIERRA MELODY and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early
pace while heading to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and was boxed in approaching the top of the stretch, ran
evenly to the furlong pole and could not muster a late response. MUAY THAI (IRE) showed early speed and assumed command soon after the break, set a
fast pace and drew clear heading to the turn, slowed down the pace and dictated terms to the quarter marker, held the lead to mid-stretch, was all out inside
of the furlong marker, was caught nearing the sixteenth-pole and faded in deep stretch. CONTINENTAL UNION broke alertly, took back to track the fast
early pace while outside of rivals, made a bit of headway while three wide on the turn, raced four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace in the lane and
gave way.

Footnotes
DON'T TELL HYDEE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to JAYCEE and pressed that rival to the turn, kept close attendance to the pace to the quarter
marker, took command in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong marker, kept to task while under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, felt
extreme pressure from A DIME FOR ME in deep stretch, was all out in the final strides and held on for the win. A DIME FOR ME was bothered at the start
then was shuffled to the back in the early going and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried heading to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, was boxed
in approaching the top of the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch, split rivals at the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in deep stretch, came within aim of
DON'T TELL HYDEE inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. AUSTRIAN NAVY was forwardly placed in the early
going and tracked the fast pace to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, chased DON'T TELL HYDEE to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final
stages and held safely in the end for the show. DANIELA BELLA chased the fast early pace, gained ground while outside of rivals on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, was unable to reel in the leaders in deep stretch and offered mild late rally. MAYCEE JO chased the fast early pace heading to the
turn, improved position while three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. TRULY FABULOUS
broke out at the start, bothered A DIME FOR ME and was away a step slowly, chased from towards the rear heading to the turn, gained ground while two
wide nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, steadied in tight quarters in upper stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and
finished evenly in the late stages. JAYCEE was hustled to establish the early lead, set fast fractions to the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker by
DON'T TELL HYDEE, could not keep pace with that rival leaving the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT CHICKS ONLY broke in at the start, made light contact with NEVER HAD I EVER then quickly joined the leading group racing four wide, backed off a
bit before the turn, then displayed a good turn of foot on the turn becoming the outside horse in a trio contesting the lead at the top of the stretch, finished
best under a strong hand ride and had enough to hold off a fast closing DUPLICATION at the wire. DUPLICATION broke well and was part of the early
pace, dropped off the pace heading into the turn, re-rallied and shifted to the outside approaching the quarter pole, tipped out four wide for the stretch run
and closed stoutly to just miss. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW broke alertly and hustled to gain the early lead, held the lead through the turn, responded when
challenged by a pair near the quarter pole, battled gamely to the wire but was outfinished in the end. MOTOWN CLASSIC was away well then outrun in the
early stages, gradually worked over to the rail before the turn, got a clear run through the turn and into the stretch, finished up well. NEVER HAD I EVER
good off to a good start and was part of the early pace picture, chased HOWDOYALIKEMENOW to the turn then moved in tandem with HOT CHICKS
ONLY to pressure the early pacesetter, was between horse for the battle turning for home but weakened mid-stretch. CANTILEVER outrun early, was part
of the trailing pack and racing four wide through the early stages, was put into a drive with three furlongs to run while still wide around the turn and finished
somewhat one-paced and a little green to the wire, unable to improve position. COOPERKLIMT was hustled from the gate but unable to engage in the early
pace, was green and climbed nearing the turn, jumped shadows at the seven-sixteenths marker, lost momentum and fell several lengths behind the field,
was kept to task and finished with some interest. SMOKIN BLAZE mid-pack early, had trouble keeping up passing the five-sixteenths pole and had nothing
to offer in the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUN INTO THE TURN. THE STEWARDS RULED IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION THAT COOPERKLIMT WAS GREEN, JUMPED SHADOWS AND WAS TAKEN UP BY HIS RIDER NEARING THE THREE-FURLONG
MARKER AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO ACTION TAKEN STEMMING FROM THAT INCIDENT.
