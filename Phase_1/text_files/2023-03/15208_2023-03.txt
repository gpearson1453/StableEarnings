Footnotes
LOOKINASSAH raced off the pace two and three wide, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. PHOBIA steadied early, advanced three wide around the
first turn, pressed two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch, put away the pace rival leaving the eighth pole but
could not withstand the winner. GENTLEMAN GERRY broke awkwardly, checked not long after, raced off the pace two wide, steadied late on the first turn,
continued two and three wide off the pace, steadied again nearing the quarter pole then rallied between foes to gain the show late. ROUGH AND ROWDY
trailed inside, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. NORFIE broke inwardly, raced three and four
wide and never threatened. LIEUTENANT JACK saved ground and failed to menace. MASTER OOGWAY set the pace along the rail to midstretch then
tired. FABLED PRINCE chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. FATIH prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, chased inside
around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
LEAD PERFORMER set the pace in the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, opened up around the far turn and
was cued right handed from the four path at the top of the stretch, continued to extend her advantage, was much the best, and was wrapped up late.
ANTRIM tracked along the inside, tipped out to the three path and was ridden around the far turn, tipped back inside entering the lane but went back out to
the three path passing the eighth pole, and kept on to get up for place. FOR THE THRILL raced in the three path around the first turn and stalked in the two
path down the backstretch, was roused along the inside of rivals into the far turn and tipped out to the two path into the stretch, and evened out for show.
GRAND ARROW trailed in the three path around the first turn and in the two path down the backstretch, was cued right handed in the five path rounding the
far turn, but was no factor from the six path in the stretch. BLACK ICE bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced prominently in the four path, was coaxed
rounding the far turn, but flattened in the four path in the stretch. TWO BEER BUZZ bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced in range while under a hold
in the three path, was ridden around the far turn, but was empty at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
TONE FEELIN stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, dueled outside down the backstretch, vied inside of HERCULES in the two path rounding
the far turn, fought on inside of that foe on a slight disadvantage from the five-sixteenths pole to wire and battled back inside to regain the lead on the wire.
HERCULES tracked the pace four wide for a half, bid in the three path around the far turn, took the lead outside of the winner near the five-sixteenths
marker, dueled from there to the wire and just missed. MOON OVER MONTANA chased the pace three wide, could not match strides with the top two
around the far turn but stayed on for the show. GHOSTINYOU was up close inside, dropped back under a drive around the turn, angled four wide in upper
stretch an churned on. EXAMINER failed to menace while racing four wide. THENORTHREMEMBERS stumbled at the start and never threatened while
racing four and five wide. THE BIG GREY bumped soon after the start, raced in the two path and had little response. PEERLESS COURT bumped a foe
soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and was through after a half. HIERRO was bumped and clipped heels soon after the start, raced off the
pace well wide and was eased through the lane.

RAISE A PROFIT trailed in the three path into the turn, was driven around the turn and was in the four path at the top of the stretch, angled out to the seven
path under left handed urging in upper stretch, rallied outside of rivals in the final furlong, and was up in final strides for the win. STERLING HARMONY
stalked in the four path, shifted in and was roused in the two path around the turn, was floated back out to the four path into the lane, ran on and took the
lead inside the final furlong, but was caught by a late surging outer foe to place. AWESOME CRUSADER chased in the three path, received a right handed
cue in the four path around the turn and swung out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. JERRY'S TURN tracked in the two path, was
ridden along the inside around the turn, had to wait for room in the three path at the top of the lane, was cued thru an opening between foes passing the
eighth pole, and stayed on. ALLEN DIGGS dueled for the lead in the two path, was roused passing the quarter pole, but faded in the final furlong. ALPHA
BLUE dueled for the lead along the rail, was coaxed nearing the quarter pole, but yielded in the final furlong.

GREAT ANALOGY saved ground well back, swung four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up on the wire. CAJUN FANTASY set a clear
pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, held clear to deep stretch and was nailed. LUNA TUNA prompted the pace three wide, continued
on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced to maintain the show. SUGAR SIN chased the pace inside and weakened in the lane. OMO TEN GIRL
chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. TROTTING GEAR threw her head at the start, raced two wide and never
threatened. AMERICAN ODALISQUE trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
SASSY NATURE raced prominently while up close in the three path, took command from the two path into the turn, floated out to the five path into the lane,
opened up under light rousing thru the lane, and drew clear while being kept to task in the final sixteenth. VAI BELLA brushed with an inner foe leaving the
gate, chased in the four path, was roused in the three path around the turn and swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on for place. SURE
CAN broke out at the start, stalked in the four path, was cued in the three path around the turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, drifted inwards
under left handed urging in the stretch, and kept on for show. ALTERNATE ROCK broke out at the start, tracked in the three path, was roused in the two
path around the turn and went out to the six path entering the lane, stayed on while merging inwards, and had to steady late. ONE OF ONE hopped at the
start and bumped with an outer rival, trailed in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the turn and angled out to the six path into the stretch, but
was no factor. WHATCHAMACALL prompted the pace along the inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong.
BEATIFUL KARLA got bumped between foes at the start and raced from wellback in the five path, and never threatened from the eight path in the stretch.
CONDESCENDING set the pace in the two path early but lost the lead along the inside early around the turn, and gaveway into the stretch.

SINGING THE OLDIES set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. SISTREN tracked the pace four wide and was clearly second best.
INQUIETA had her head turned at the start then was bumped, chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and bested the rest. FINAL
EPISODE was outrun inside. LADY OCEAN bumped at the start, chased the pace from the rail and retreated through the lane. GIRL BYE prompted the
winner in the three path and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
PILLBOX set the pace along the inside around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, was roused from the two path around the far
turn and cued right handed to open up into the stretch, responded well and held safe under left handed while drifting out late. STARSHIP BOEING brushed
with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack in the two path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn, angled out to the five path into the stretch, and
ran on for place. DOWNBURST was in the two path around the first turn and prompted the pace in the four path down the backstretch, was cued in the
three path around the far turn and under right handed urging while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. MISCREANT stalked
along the inside around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, received a right handed cue along the inside around the far turn, but
evened out from the two path in the stretch. CURIOUSLY raced between foes in the two path around the first turn and settled off the pace in the four path
down the backstretch, was ridden in the three path around the far turn and urged left handed from the four path into the lane, but was one paced. MARILYN
traveled in the three path around the first turn and tracked in the five path down the backstretch, was driven in the four path around the far turn and was
back in the five at the top of the stretch, and flattened out. POWDER MY NOSE brushed with an inner rival at the start, was unhurried along the inside,
shifted out to the five path rounding the far turn and swung out to the eight path into the lane, but was no factor. REACHING STRIDE raced wellback in the
three path into the far turn and never threatened. TOTAL BLISS broke out at the start and was out in the five path around the first turn but rated from there
down the backstretch, floated out to the six path around the far turn, and was no menace in the stretch.
