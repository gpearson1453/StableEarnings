speed then chased the pace, raced in the three path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then missed the
place while clear for the show. THINKABOUTIT bumped with a rivals at the start then was taken up in tight quarters, angled to the outside early, moved in
late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. GAGETOWN bumped with a foe at the start then was taken up while in
tight, paused while moving out behind foes early, reached the outside around the five-eighths, was urged six wide around the turn and lacked the needed
response. MONEY MIKE raced outside down the backstretch, was urged along in the five path around the turn and came up empty.

foe to the wire and missed while able to get the place. DREAM ROAD lost her footing at the start and was last to commence, moved in while settling off the
pace, shifted from three to five wide around the turn, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. GEORGIE'S LADIES was forwardly
placed down the backstretch, went around the turn inside to the two path, chased the leader while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and was
out-kicked then missed the show. MIDNIGHT ROSIE broke in then was hustled, steadied inside the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, was urged three
wide around the turn, moved out around seven wide while getting closer at the three-sixteenths but lacked the needed response and failed to impact.

the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the four path midway through the turn and came up empty. MY GORGEOUS moved up after

Footnotes
THRILL OF IT brushed with a foe just after the start while off a bit slow, settled off the pace, made a four wide bid on the turn, rallied to the lead into the
stretch then shook clear, came out under a left-handed crop late and proved best under a hand-ride to the wire. AGILITY settled just off the pace, drafted
behind a foe while two then three wide around the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was
second best. BRACIOLE moved in while settling off the pace, was urged in the two path on the turn, steadied behind a foe outside the quarter-pole then
altered around that rival, came three wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to garner the show. ASYMMETRIC was hustled from the start,
established a good position while rated just off the pace on the inside, was roused while finding clear room along the rail outside the three-eighths, made a
bid at the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then lost the show. FORTY TWO ACE prompted the pace on the
outside, took the lead late on the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave way.
AMEDEUS MUSIC brushed with a foe after the start while slow into stride, was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.
CLASH A. J. settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn and failed to respond. CHIEF ENGINEER went straight to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, lost the lead late on the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
VEGAS WEEKEND was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four to five path around the turn, gained to take the
lead into upper stretch then kicked clear and drew away under steady urging to prove much the best. KEEN DANCER settled well back in the field, moved in
around the five-eighths pole, shifted from the rail to the three path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out, angled out more
around the furlong marker and improved for the place. TRADE SECRET was hustled from the gate, showed speed then chased the pace, traveled around
the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved further out and weakened while just able to get the show. ITS COLD IN DEHERE
settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and just missed the show. RUVIES
IN TIME swerved in early then was corrected by the rider, showed the way while well off the inside, was asked in the three then two path around the turn,
lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. CARLY HUSTLE was urged along towards the rear, moved from the two path to the four
path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOW LUCKY broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, was urged three wide around
the turn and failed to respond. LEFT LEANING LUCY bobbled at the start, was taken in hand early then dropped back, went five wide around the turn and
had nothing left. CHLOE ROSE broke out then was hustled, moved in near the three-quarter pole, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back while
inside on the turn and capitulated. SHEA ON A MISSION settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, dropped from three to two wide
around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CALLALOO was taken in hand when a foe crossed in front near the seven-eighths then switched out, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the
three path around the turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, passed the furlong marker on even terms for the lead and proved best under strong urging.
MANDATORY angled in quickly while going to the front, dropped down to near the rail, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn,
spun into the stretch in the two path under pressure, lost the advantage to the winner near the furlong marker, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and was
outfinished while well clear for the place. FROMANOTHAMUTHA settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn and earned the show while no
match for the top two. SMOKE AND HEAT was hustled from the gate then taken in hand nearing the seven-eighths, moved out then was urged at the rear,
dropped from the four path to the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. COLLOQUY brushed the outside of the gate at the start, settled near the
back, saved grond under urging on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out, remained on his inside lead until inside the
furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and was no factor. LABARDE was taken in hand near the seven-eighths then switched out, raced up close
down the backstretch, dropped back four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MAPLE LEAF MEL showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, responded well without being asked in upper
stretch , swapped to the proper lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew off under wraps to win as the rider pleased. SECURITY CODE was hustled from
the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while
clear for the place. LES BON TEMPS broke just a touch awkwardly but towards the front, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the
turn and weakened but held the show. LITTLE LINZEE settled under some urging, moved out inside the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch behind a foe then moved out and lacked the needed response. BANTERRA broke in and hit the gate, was urged along off the pace, went
four wide on the turn and came up empty. QUEENS MASTERPIECE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled under some urging, went three
to four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. LADY MINE stumbled at the start, moved out early then was urged along on the
outside, went five wide around the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FOREVER AMY bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the inside of a foe, was eased back off the pace near the five-eighths pole then switched
out, ranged up in the three path around the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, drew away under urging into the
final furlong, remained well clear into the final sixteenth and held while shortening stride in the end. MISCHIEF MOTION settled off the pace, was urged five
wide around the turn, gained on the tired winner in the final furlong and just missed while well clear for the place. WINE GODDESS was bumped hard just
after the start, went three to four wide around the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and was along for the show. FLUTIE FLAKES was taken in
hand early then moved out while dropping back, went five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAGNOLIA WIND was
bumped at the start then forced into another rival, established a good position towards the front, moved from the two path to the four path under urging
around the turn and came up empty. BAD CONNECTION angled in while going to the front then moved clear near the five-eighths, vied in the two path for
most of the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and tired. CAIAROSSA broke out at the start, moved in while off the
pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. STORMY'S IN STYLE bumped with a foe at the start then
came in and bumped soundly with another opponent, raced in the front half under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to
respond. VIRTUAL BEAUTY broke out and bumped with a foe, dropped well off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. WAR MUSEUM
stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, steadied behind a rival near the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn and trailed.
