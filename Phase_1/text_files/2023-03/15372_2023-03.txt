Footnotes
ROMANTIC GAMBLE was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, continued that move off the turn and drew clear leaving the furlong
marker and widened the margin to prove best, driving. ZILLION was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn, angled out for racing room leaving the
furlong marker and finished willingly, held place late. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY was settled back early, saved ground on the turn, shifted off the inside when
straightened then angled back in by the sixteenth marker and rallied late to miss the place award. KHAKI JACK set the pace and then shook clear on the
turn, but weakened the final furlong. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was reserved early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally.
MAGIC SPIN stalked the pace two wide, came three wide into the lane and was empty. HIGH HEAT chased the pace three wide and swung out five wide
leaving the turn and weakened.

COUSTEAU vied for the early lead two wide, then went on to set a pressured pace on the inside on the backstretch, then drew clear leaving the turn and
then widened the margin to prove much the best, ridden out. WILL E SUTTON prompted the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but could
not go with the winner in the lane, second best. COOL COMEDIAN was rated along and made a inside bid on the turn but weakened the final furlong,
bested rest. MEAN MACHINE was reserved three wide early, made a four wide move on the turn but weakened. CRUSH IT was reserved on the inside,
made a three wide move on the turn bur was empty in the lane. TRIPLE A. PLUS vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. JONNY QUIST chased the
pace in between rivals and tired.
