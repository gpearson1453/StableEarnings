Footnotes
REMEMBERING WILBUR , away in good order, rated kindly while tracking the leaders off the inside, edged up to take aim off the duel mid turn, shifted out
four wide into the lane, responded when asked soon after, took command outside rivals near mid stretch, spurted clear then held firm while kept to task.
MAJESTIC FRONTIER saved ground off the pace, crept closer mid turn, got through along the inside to threaten in mid stretch, kept on gamely and earned
the place through the final fifty yards. ARISTOCAT cleared early and set a rated pace off the rail, was joined from his outside leaving the far turn, sparred
with DIVINE LAW around the turn, ceded the lead into the stretch, stayed on to battle between rivals in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. DIMMI
QUANDO , off the pace while four to five wide, failed to respond. DIVINE LAW broke slowly, regrouped and pulled his way forward leaving the chute and
prompted the pace, bid outside ARISTOCAT around the far turn, dueled from the half mile marker, took over and briefly cleared into the stretch, could not
contain the winner past the three sixteenths then weakened.

, a forward factor in the three path on the turn, failed to rally. SIR SMOAK raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, gave
way and passed a tired rival late. MOON SIGN , along the inner rail most of the trip, weakened in the stretch run. SERGEANT SHERMAN began sluggishly,
raced along the inner rail through the stretch and passed tired rivals. WILDERZAR lacked speed, raced in the three path on the turn and gave way.
EXPECT LUCKY , four deep chasing the pace into the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
NIBBLES , three deep the first turn, advanced outside HOLDING COURT to gain a short lead leaving the backstretch, battled with that one around the far
turn, remained on her left lead through the stretch and edged away under urging. HOLDING COURT showed speed, hugged the inner rail while battling with
the winner around the far turn, faded in the drive and was well clear of the others. BAD TEMPER stalked the pace down the backstretch, had a mild 2-path
move from between horses leaving the far turn and failed to sustain the bid. TORRE BRANCA lacked speed, swung five deep turning for home and passed
tired foes. WATER WITCH , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch and weakened. C TWO
showed speed along the inner rail and gave way leaving the far turn. SHE SO COOL , three wide the far turn, gave way.

Footnotes
BERKS stalked three wide, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, raced between runners into the lane, responded to right handed asks past the three
sixteenths, leveled off leaving the furlong grounds and closed sharply while being flashed with the stick, reeled in the leader from the outside and was going
away at the wire. ROMINSKI prompted the pace two wide, moved up outside the leader to engage mid turn, took over entering the lane, kicked away after
being roused, kept on gamely through the final furlong but could not contain the winner's charge. BIGMANCAN rated along behind rivals, swung out six wide
in upper stretch, rallied mildly between rivals and just nabbed the show. CHARGE TO VICTORY broke a beat slow, dropped inside and rated behind rivals,
slipped through along the rail to edge up, angled, worked between rivals in mid stretch, angled back in and churned on. THE SICARII broke a step slow,
saved ground off the pace, swung very wide and had belated action outside rivals. FORTH , four wide pursuing, came five wide for the drive but lacked a
serious finish. FREE DANCER , two wide chasing, raced between runners into the lane and faded. ARISTOCRATIC sped clear early, set the pace towards
the rail, took pressure leaving the three eighths, sparred to the head of the lane then gave way.

ON THE MARK raced in the three path between horses on the turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch, closed between rivals and drove clear late.
PUTTHEPASTBEHIND , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, rallied between horses and his rider dropped his whip near the sixteenth pole.
LOST WEEKEND , four wide around the turn, floated out a bit in upper stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and hung. WHERE IS MIKE bumped
LANDON JACK when bearing out leaving the starting gate, was a forward factor along the inner rail throughout and finished willingly. INDYBOUND , wide
on the turn, was not a factor. LANDON JACK , bumped leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, was well off the inner rail in the stretch and tired
late. ROAN BURGUNDY was outrun.

GOING TO THE LEAD , urged from the gate, dropped in and stalked the dueling leaders, was coaxed along to hold position mid turn, swung out for room
entering the lane, straightened and leveled off under left handed asks past the three sixteenths, kept on determinedly and forged ahead in the final yards. H
P MOON dueled outside HOLY SYNCHRONICITY while under rating, responded when roused entering nto the lane, spurted clear soon after, wandered
inward, straightened and remained clear past mid stretch, kept on well but just could not fend off the winner's surge. ALL THREES checked behind rivals
when fighting some restraint, regrouped and stalked outside the winner, was urged along past the five sixteenths, moved up three wide to take closer order
nearing mid stretch, chased but lacked the needed finish. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY was hard sent early and disputed the pace inside H P MOON, stayed on
to the head of the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
PARIS KENTUCKY saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, remained along the rail through the stretch, took command in hand in mid stretch then
was ridden out. OH MRS. MAISEL , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, finished willingly. FLIMSY , well positioned down the backstretch, was four
deep leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. BLUEBERRY INDYGO accelerated to the early lead, was clear turning for home, was kept in the two
path in the stretch and weakened in mid sttetch. ISABELLA'S GLORY lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn, steadied when getting out leaving the
turn, angled out in upper stretch and raced erratically in the drive. PROPER STORM , no factor, dropped back.
