Footnotes
CAVE HILL settled back off the early pace three or four wide, rallied through the far turn to come seven wide into the lane and moved clear under steady
handling. ONE SON OF A CHIEF stalked the pace three to four wide in good position, rallied six wide into the lane but could not handle the winner in the
drive. UNRESTRICTED stalked the pace four wide to bid through the far turn, edged clear into the lane but came up empty. OURBESTFRIEND D L was in
reach racing two to three wide but lacked a final closing run. GREY ROGUE was on the pace three wide outside a rival through the opening half and
weakened. GUINESSEY contested the pace inside a rival while out from the rail and weakened. OPTIMISTIC VALOR was not a factor. Six furlong fraction
not available.

Footnotes
CARPE VICTORIAM stalked the early leaders three wide, moved to challenge into the lane, responded with a late surge and was up in the closing jumps.
HANSENS MISCHIEF made the pace on a clear lead about the three path, continued well in the late but could not hold the winner safe. FIVE O ONE
tracked the leader from along the inside, closed but was outfinished for position late. THAT'S D 'CAT followed the pack three wide and had no rally. GONE
PREACHIN failed to mount a bid three to four wide. FERRARI ROAD was not a threat. CHARED dwelt at the break to spot the field several lengths and
trailed.
