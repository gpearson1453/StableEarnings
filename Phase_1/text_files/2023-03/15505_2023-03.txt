WICO (IRE) pressed to the half, hooked up to turn and stretch, battled to the wire under stout handling to prevail in a gutsy effort. NOISES OFF unhurried to
the half ranged inside, squeezed through tight spot, battled hard with winner in the stretch and proved best of the rest. WRITE OFF JERRY had a slow start,
raced back to the half, swept up turn for show. KIGALI raced along evenly with no late kick in the stretch run. MAGNIFICENT MILE three wide run to press
for three quarte and gave way through the stretch. RIVER IN EGYPT failed to menace throughout. NAVY CROSS no speed to far turn, swerved out around
foes, no late gain. SMOKEY MANDATE rated along to far turn, checked hard losing position, faded. MONBA QUAKE four wide speed to chased leaders to
the half, gave way readily. METATRON'S MUSE speed from inside, led to the half with nothing left and faded. THEOLOGICAL awkward from the gate,
never menaced while far back in stretch.
