MON PARADIS was off a bit slow and trailed early, rallied in the stretch and angled out three wide, closed determinedly and was up in the last jumps.
SILVER STICK STAIR dueled on the lead throughout, held grudgingly and just missed. CALTHA dueled on the lead from the inside and weakened late.
MYRRH raced between horses early and was in tight, steadied on the turn, then went evenly late. WILLYMAR was in tight early and had to steady, rallied at
the quarter three wide, put in her bid and flattened out in the stretch. TARA DAWN was outrun. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. The rider of of MYRRH
claimed foul against the riders of CALTHA and SILVER STICK STAIR for alleged interference down the backside. After viewing the tape the stewards took
no action.
