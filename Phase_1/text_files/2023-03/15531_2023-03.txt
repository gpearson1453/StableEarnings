MY IMAGINATION trailed early inside, advanced strongly on the turn, swung wide in the stretch and offered a late surge to get up at the wire. DESANTIS
vied briefly inside, shook loose on the turn, stayed clear to the late stages but was nailed at the wire. TALK WITH ME chased within range near the inside
and was up for the show late. TATUM stalked the pacesetters outside, bid on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. FINALLY CAPTURED prompted the
pace outside for half a mile and faltered. ALL IN ALL broke slowest, rushed up inside then gave way from the quarter pole. T'WAS THE NIGHT dropped
back wide in the opening quarter and was always outrun. EXCESS DEMAND was urged from the break, chased outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
TARA'S TALENT stalked the pace early on, chased three wide on the turn, rallied outside rivals in the stretch run, closed steadily in deep stretch and was
along in time for the win. JACKIE THE JOKER set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when challenged, dug in gamely between rvials, dueled with
the winner and yielded grudgingly late. BUCKS SOME was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, rallied on the rail entering
the stretch, bid and finished evenly. SENSE A MILLION stumbled at the start and bumped a rival, raced off the pace between horses, angled out for the
drive and finished evenly. I CROSS MY HEART raced three wide off the pace and faded. BILLIEANNE raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.
STARSHIP ROGUE was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
FIVE DREAMS saved ground, moved out rallying on the turn, bid to the front inside rivals in the stretch and edged clear. HUSHION prompted the pace
outside, loomed a stretch threat and finished gamely. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF hustled to a clear advantage in the opening quarter, was collared on the turn
and finished gamely. ROB THE RICH dropped back outside, continued wide and lacked a rally. ONE MORE SCOOP forced in early, saved ground and was
never in contention. PRACTICAL WAY was forced in early, lacked speed and proved empty in the stretch. A DANGEROUS GUY raced in closest pursuit of
the pacesetter and gave way after the half.

DREAMING OF GERRY stalked close up two wide, bid entering the far turn, dueled with HOOPLA, took over, drew clear and held well under urging. ROAN
MOUNTAIN was a bit fractious and then off a step slow, trailed the field, advanced inside at the quarter pole, rallied late inside in the stretch and got second.
KOBE B tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied mildly between horses in the stretch, then got the nod for third on the wire. BRETT'S
WORLD raced four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, off the rail, chased between rivals on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and lost the show
photo. HOOPLA set the pace on the inside, dueled inside of the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch, then weakened late. OLYMPIC ROMP
raced off the pace inside, betweebn rivals on the far turn, angled out and failed to threaten. SCREEN SAVER raced off the pace between foes, three wide
on the far turn and tired. CELTIC TREASURE raced three wide on the first turn, continued three wide off the pace and did not factor. MIDNIGHT CHROME
raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
CARTWHEEL raced off the pace inside, steadied slightly entering the turn, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, swung widest, commenced a strong run
outside rivals, rolled to the front at the sixteenth marker, won going away and was taken in hand the final strides. REITERATE raced between rivals early on,
then stalked the leaders, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied to take command in upper stretch, drew clear and then held on late to save the place spot.
ADHWAA raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and got third. GAVICHI raced off the pace inside, between rivals
into the stretch, rallied between, then closed late on the inside. BOCA ROYALTY raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch and failed to
threaten. J J LOVES BILLY trailed the field, raced inside on the turn and lacked a rally. GIA'S FUEGO vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and
tired. THE BIGGEST ONE chased on the inside and faded. KNOCK OUT KID raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. NOTHINS FREE vied inside
for the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.
