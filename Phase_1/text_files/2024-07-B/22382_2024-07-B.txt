Footnotes
ATHLETIC STAR, drifted out a bit at the break, steadied briefly when forced out soon after, regrouped and was unhurried in the early going to be well off the
pace in hand, angled five wide turning for home and closed with a late rush to be going away at the wire. HOLONUI stalked the pace through the turn, rallied
in upper stretch to take the lead, repelled several challengers in the lane and was caught in deep stretch by the fast closing winner in a game effort. LADDIE
DANCE prompted the pace four wide to midway on the turn, rallied to loom boldly at the top of the lane and hung in the drive unable to sustain the rally.
ROCKY'S ADVENTURE tracked the leaders from three wide into the turn, angled out five wide to be prominently placed at the top of the lane and finished
evenly. OFFICE CORRUPTION set the pace under steady pressure, responded when challenged in upper stretch and weakened inside the final eighth. ALL
FRUITS RIPE chased the leaders from four wide and lacked a closing response. SIN PERMISO bore in at the break bumping a rival, raced off the pace,
came well wide for the drive and went evenly never posing a threat. KINDA FONDA WANDA broke a step tardy seeing the his hole instantly close steps
from the gate, lagged down the backside and was never a factor. GALACTIC GLORY, bumped at the break, edged up and well placed between foes for the
first three-eighths and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARGIE'S FUN SON tracked the pace from the inside to the turn, failed to respond when called upon dropping to the rear of the field on the bend, angled
five wide turning for home rallying when in the clear on the outside and responded to rider's persistent urging to finish well and drew off in the final sixteenth.
GATTO BE PROUD stalked the pace from three wide between rivals in the turn, dug-in to steadily close in on the pacesetter through the lane and gained
the place in the final strides. BILL OF RIGHTS set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage midway
down the strestch and weakened in the final hundred yards. CAVENDISH prompted the early pace, moved to engage the leader down the backstretch
taking a brief lead into the far turn, dueled on the bend and gradually faded through the stretch. JAY broke a step slow to be at the back of the pack, was
taken outside in the run down the backside, circled up to contend into the turn and flattened out coming home.

Footnotes
CAP'N DUSTY took command shortly away from the gate, set a well rated pace under mild pressure for a half, opened a clear lead on the far turn,
responded when called upon turning for home to repel the challenge of the runner-up, maintained a clear advantage to inside the sixteenth pole and held off
the resurgent bid of his rival in deep stretch. MR FLOWERS broke alertly to be on top leaving the gate, was taken in hand to settle just off the pace, tracked
the pace from the inside down the backside, rallied on the turn splitting horses from two wide to engage the pacesetter at the quarter pole, could not go with
that one in upper stretch and re-rallied inside the eighth pole to be gaining late in the lane. COCKTAILS AT NOON raced between rivals in mid-pack into the
first turn, was steadied when crowded entering the turn to drop to the rear of the main body of the field, raced five wide down the backstretch while well in
hand, rallied circling from six wide on the far turn and made a steady gain to be along for the place. RAPTOR RAZZLE was in tight while racing along the
fence into the first turn, settled to a well placed position while rated off the leaders saving ground into the far turn, eased out leaving mid stretch and finished
willingly between runners. STOW ON THE WOLD stalked the pace from five wide into the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the final bend to threaten
turning for home and failed to sustain the bid in the stretch. PIETRELCINA reserved well off the pace saving ground through the first turn, worked his way to
the outside leaving the five-eighths pole, shifted out wider leaving the three sixteenths and showed good late energy gaining ground belatedly.
BATTLEFIELD PARK raced six wide down the lane for the first time, angled in entering the turn crowding several rivals to the inside, raced mid-pack to the
far turn and failed to mount a closing rally finishing evenly. POPS HARPER raced five wide in the lane away from the gate, was crowded entering the turn by
outside rival causing him to drop in to the three path to bump his inside rival causing that one to briefly steady, straightened away through the turn to be in
contention from four wide on the backstretch and went evenly lacking a rally. STORM FORCE pressed the pace for a half mile and steadily faded. LATIN
JET broke a step slow, clipped heels several strides from the gate to stumble in the first fifty yards, was taken well wide for the backstretch run, failed to kick
on nearing the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BLESSED CANDY quickly went clear then secured the inside to set a rated pace, handled outside pressure from the three eighths to the quarter pole,
spurted away after being set down in upper stretch, wandered outward while widening past mid stretch and proved clearly best while kept to task.
ANOTHERHOPE prompted the pace outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, forced the issue to the head of the lane, failed
to match strides from there but stayed on with good effort to remain clear of the rest. BOYS GO TO JUPITER eased back off the leaders while saving
ground, moved through to the inside of rivals approaching the stretch, churned on to the wire while not threatening then kept on well through the gallop out.
MORE BUBBLES steadied at the break, lagged inside under a ride, angled out and passed faders. MAP TO THE MOON bore out at the break, corrected
and edged up three wide, pursued three deep into the lane then faded. OODLES AND BOODLES broke inward, corrected and edged up to be close
towards the inner rail, eased out and chased between foes nearing the lane, lacked a punch soon into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
GO TAKE CHARGE settled well in hnd down the stretch the first time, remained reserved off the pace to the far turn, circled the field to commence a rally
from seven wide and closed with a late rush to be up in deep stretch. AWESOME STRIKE tracked the leaders for the first five-eighths, rallied under a long
drive midway on the final bend, engaged the leader leaving the eighth pole to take the lead and was caught late in the lane. MIKE THE BOMB stalked the
pace for the first half mile, ranged up two wide with an early bid to take command on the far turn, drifted in through the lane causing the early pacesseter to
steady along the fence in mid-stretch and kept-on while outkicked in the final sixteenth. PHOTO COPY raced four wide through the first turn, was unhurried
to be near the back of the field to the far turn and mounted a mild bid through the lane to hit the board. LA CREMA reserved off the pace in mid-pack for
three-quarters and showed good late interest closing through the lane. LANDSLIDE IS HOME sped off to a clear lead into the first turn, set the pace through
quick fractions for five-eighths, responded when challenged on the far turn, steadied along the rail when MIKE THE BOMB drifted in and continued to tire
through the stretch. REAP WHAT YOU SOW was rank resistting the rider in the run down the lane the first time, raced mid-apck throughout and never
posed a threat. SIGMUND stalked the pace for a half mile and steadily faded from contention entering the far turn. YAQUI VALLEY was caught five wide
into the first turn and was never a factor from there.

Footnotes
CAR RIDE broke a step slow to be the trailer, was under early urging to keep up with the pack, made up ground steadily on the turn from two wide, angled
out in upper stretch to the six path and closed well late to be up in time. BEACH COWBOY set a pressured pace along the fence, dug-in when challenged
turning for home to kick clear in upper stretch and was caught in the final strides in a game effort. LUCKY PRINCE tracked the leaders to the top of the lane
and found his best stride late to be gaining in deep stretch and be along for the show. NORTHERN CARDINAL stalked the pace from three wide to midway
on the turn, rallied to loom up at the head of the lane and failed to sustain the bid in the stretch finishing evenly. DOWSING ROD dropped back to trail
through the turn and showed some late interest in the lane without impact. DICEY GREY dueled on the pace to the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
YATTA reserved off the pace down the backside, nudged upon entering the far turn, waited behind rivals through the turn for racing room, surged in upper
stretch splitting rivals when the hole presented itself, engaged the leaders midway down the lane and cleared late in the drive convincingly. LA PACHANGA
prompted the pace for the first half mile, took the lead on the turn, fought gamely in the lane when engaged in upper stretch, could not hold off the winner
but held the place. GOGO CHANEL stumbled at thestart, quickly was gathered up to be well palced in contention along the fence down backside, rallied
from the inside on the far turn, split rivals angling out five wide in upper stretch to take a brief lead and hung through the drive. WELLAREYOUHAPPYNOW
was well held early to be the trailer, settled to a comfortable cadence down the backstretch whgile still at the rear of the field nad showed good late interest
with a belated rally in the lane. PLANET CLARE prompted the pace early, dropped back losing position along the fence into the fianl turn, rallied on the bend
to be in striking position, shied from the winner to the fence when the winner angled into the opening at the top of the lane, and finished evenly coming
home. NICOLAR chased the leaders from four wide for the first half mile, rallied three wide on the far turn to thraten and weakened coming home. MORE
THAN GLORY was hard to handle into the first turn pulling the rider to the lead from three wide, set a pressured pace to midway on the far turn and gave
way.

Footnotes
GINGER GIRL set the pace under mild pressure for the first half mile, pulled clear on the turn to an open advantage, kicked away in upper stretch when set
down for the drive and was kept to task in the lane while unchallenged. ISABELLA'S GLORY broke outward to bump rival leaving the gate, settled near the
rear of the field, made a steady advance saving ground on the turn and kept grinding in the lane to gain the place. MAVILUS broke in bumping rival at the
start, stalked the pace to the turn, rallied on the bend to be well positioned and failed to gain ground finishing evenly. MISCHIEF MOTION bumped on both
sides to be squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed most of the way and showed some late interest in the lane. ROWSIE EXPRESS pressed the pace for a
half mile and faded. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY stumbled at the start, was gathered together to rush up from four wide to track the pace and flattened out on
the turn.

Footnotes
HAPPY JAUNT drafted back off of a contested pace while removed from the inside, was under a ride mid turn, angled five wide into the lane, closed
relentlessly under repeated right handed asks and just got up outside rivals. DESTIN'S RAINBOW , off a beat slow, saved ground under rating, eased out
into the lane, moved up nearing mid stretch, altered out for a clear run near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely between foes. ART OF COURAGE ,
three deep with the early pace, forced the pace three wide outside IRISH HERO around the turn and into the lane, wrested command a sixteenth out, briefly
went clear then gave way grudgingly while just missing the place. IRISH HERO accelerated between foes soon after the start and took the lead, set the
pace just off the inside, was hounded around the turn and into the lane, clung to the advantage while under a drive in mid stretch, ceded command a
sixteenth out then faded late. THE BIG ENCHILADA forced the early pace between foes, eased back off the leaders leaving the far turn, stayed on to
pursue into the lane, shifted out then came up empty in the final furlong. THUNDER LAD broke sharply then was rated back just off the leaders while saving
ground, eased out a bit to advance in upper stretch, shifted towards the rail to threaten a furlong out, steadied when in tight soon after and faded.
