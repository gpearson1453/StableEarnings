LEAVE THEM BEHIND bumped at the start, pressed the pace, closed steadily under left handed urging, wore down SERPICO R S S and drew clear late.
SERPICO R S S was away alertly, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear, led to late stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. SPEED BUMP
BOB broke out and bumped at the start, raced close to the pace towards the outside, was carried out entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
DECK HUMOR raced mid pack in an even effort. READS PET ZENON bumped at the start and lacked a bid in an outside trip. PREMEDITATED LILY
bumped at the start, pressed the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. EVANGELINA WHO broke out and was crowded at the start, saved
ground and lacked a response.

Footnotes
SIDEWINDER SLICK got away well, raced close to the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, got through inside, dueled through the stretch and
prevailed in a game effort. FLAGS FINALE set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and was outfinished in a long
drive. BEACH RUNNER pressed three across to the turn, fell back, continued willingly and got up for show. MR. BIG RIG was never far back, put in a
steady effort, didn't have enough late and failed to menace. GO RED RASCAL pressed the pace while racing between horses, challenged for the lead on
the turn, dueled to mid stretch and faltered. PROBATE put in an even effort in a wide trip and was outrun. DIABOLICAL FIRE trailed the field and was not
urged late. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference in the stretch drive. No change was made.

close to the pace in an outside trip, put in a steady effort to earn place and was no match for the winner. E BAR SCOUT bumped and was crowded at the
start, stalked the pace, weakened in the drive and held safely for show. SHELL GAME bumped on both sides at the start, stalked the pace, angled in for the
drive, bid and came up empty. CAYCEE'S MARK was hustled along, raced inside to mid stretch, angled out and gave way.

Footnotes
TRUST ANABELLE was rated back at the start, taken wide, rallied around the turn, closed with a rush and got up at the wire. MARK IT DOWN got away
well, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was caught at the wire. STORM IN THE VALLE was never far back, advanced to the
turn, bid, hung and settled for show. RUN AWAY BAY veered in at the start, lagged early and and passed tiring rivals in an even effort. HUSTLING pressed
the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. KOMFORT KID was pushed in at the start, pressed the pace along the inside to the turn and stopped.
This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
