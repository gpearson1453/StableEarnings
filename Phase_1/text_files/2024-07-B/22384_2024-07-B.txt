Footnotes
MAKEIT TO CHEYENNE showed good early speed to set the pace, responded when roused, kicked clear at the top of the lane and was kept to the task.
JUNGLE GLOW chased close up early on the inside, was shuffled back slightly, tracked, angled out for the drive and finished well for second. K PAZ
chased the winner from the outset, made a bid at the quarter pole, then weakened and held on well to save the show spot. DUMB MONEY steadied at the
start, raced off the pace inside and rallied mildly between foes. U DIRTY DOG chased two wide and had no rally. CITY TIME raced off the pace with an
inside trip and lacked a rally. UNCLE TIMMY was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. WOLF BEACH
raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. PRETTY SIXXY was off slowly and dropped far back.

AFY KID stalked close up early on, bid between rivals entering the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch, responded, edged away, then dug in determinedly
late to hold off the runner up. CUMBERLAND BLUES raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied
outside, made a late bid and dug in gamely to the finish. DUDLEY DICKERSON raced three or four wide early, steadied at the three quarter pole, had a
three wide trip, came five wide into the lane, rallied mildly and got third late. HOME SCHOOL raced five wide early, stumbled at the seven furlong marker,
continued four wide off the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled and weakened late. KING RAMOS raced two wide off the pace, chased between
rivals on the far turn and lacked a rally. PREDICTED tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. LOOKIN' SUPER raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. FIRST MONEY raced six wide early, then moved up four wide on the clubhouse turn, cleared the field to set the pace, dueled
inside rivals into the far turn and gave way.
