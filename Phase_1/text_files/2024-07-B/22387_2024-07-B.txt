Footnotes
LIL SCREECHER vied inside of FIVE WON FIVE shortly after the start, battled on around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, widened to a clear
advantage, tapped once in the final furlong and pulled away. FIVE WON FIVE broke on top and angled in to race two wide, quickly took on the challenge of
inside running LIL SCREECHER and vied up the backstretch, continued to match strides around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the
head of the lane but ran on three wide and finished second best. PREACHER MAN SAM raced in range along the inside, cut the corner entering upper
stretch, launched an inside bid and cleared a share. SAVOYA RETURN raced two to three wide off the top flight through early stages, launched a three
wide bid at the quarter pole, raced in close contention then failed to sustain bid into the lane and flattened out. MARKSON raced two wide in the last flight,
hustled along three wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. ORPHAN SANDY raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LORRAINE'S LEGACY settled around the first turn then rated in range two to three wide up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide approaching the
quarter pole, steadily gained on the leader down the lane and edged by late. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE led the way around the first turn, set the pace and saved
ground up the backstretch, held firm around the final turn, came two wide into upper stretch, continued to dig in on top and got worn down in closing strides.
WAR MUSIC saved ground around the first turn then settled in the back through early stages, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and finished with
good response. BIG BAD DIVA raced in range along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, hustled up for response entering turning for home,
chased the top pair just off the inside then evened out in late stages. REBEL RISING stalked three wide up the backstretch, continued in close range around
the far turn, roused for response two wide at the head of the lane, failed to respond and steadily weakened. EUTYCHIA was forwardly placed racing behind
the leader, failed to keep pace under pressure around the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
OUR HEAVENLY GIFT hustled up out of the gate and took over the lead heading into the first turn, set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, took on
the challenge of DOUBLECHECK at the quarter pole, turned back rivals bid at the head of the lane, fought on gamely and kept clear. DOUBLECHECK was
forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked three wide up the backstretch, moved up to challenge OUR HEAVENLY GIFT at the quarter pole, could
not match strides with rival but stayed on stubbornly and finished clearly second best. I GOT A GUY was forwardly placed around the first turn and raced
just off the leader to the far turn, flattened off the top pair near the quarter pole, ran on into the lane and regained a share. CAN'T BE CAUGHT rated along
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, hustled along the inside into the stretch, gained position then flattened and lost show.
MISTER LESTER settled off the pace although not too far back in the early going, weakened around the far turn and failed to move into contention.
COUNTY JAIL lacked speed, raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and never threatened. DEVIL'S SHADOW raced three wide around the far turn,
raced off the pace and retreated in the lane.

a furlong out and finished clear. MUSICAL DIVA quickly cleared the lead and angled to the inside, led the way by a clear margin in the opening quarter, took
on the challenge of FULL SPIRIT late on the turn, vied into stretch, could not match strides at the furlong marker, kept on and held place. FEARLESS

second flight in early stages, moved up into close contention at the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch then evened out. MARSHSIDE MAMA raced in
the back, swung four wide into stretch and failed to threaten. ALWAYS SMILING tracked the clear leader in the opening quarter, continued in range inside

Footnotes
MY HEART'S ON FIRE took the lead at the start and quickly opened up around the first turn, continued to set a quick pace holding a clear advantage up the
backstretch, remained in command and saved ground around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, had more left in reserve and continued clear.
RED SANGRIA stalked the clear leader around the first turn and up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch, was no match for clear
winner but sustained bid and dug in for place. SHESGOTSPIRIT tracked the clear leader around the first turn and up the backstretch, urged along the inside
around the final turn, ran on into the lane and got edged late for place while finishing well clear over the rest. SHANNON K rated off the clear leader, hustled
up around the far turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch and never threatened the front runners. R N B BABY got bumped at the start, raced three
wide into the first turn, settled off the early pace and failed to move into close contention. LUCYS STROLL raced in the back along the inside entering the
first turn, continued off the pace, passed some tiring rivals near the half mile marker but failed to gain a threatening position. PISTOLPACKINGAL trailed
midway up the backstretch and passed a couple tiring rivals. WICKED HOT FOOT steadily retreated. SHARP ROSA came up empty after the half. This race
had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
