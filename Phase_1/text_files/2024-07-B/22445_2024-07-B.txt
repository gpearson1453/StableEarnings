winner, dug in gamely but finished second best. RONNI'S WIND had speed from the start along the inside, shifted outside the top pair in upper stretch
giving up some ground then came on again late in the five path. KETTLE KISS trailed early and passed tiring rivals in the six path. KERRI'S MIRACLE
stalked the pace between horses three then two wide and was through after a half. EXPRESS FASHION failed to menace. LUCKY PENNY ROSE forwardly

lead on the turn, drifted out from the rail to the five path under left handed urging through the final sixteenth of a mile and prevailed under strong handling.
EXTRA CRAFTY never far back, closed ground steadily outside the winner, was carried out to the six path and missed. DOMINUS O'S ME stalked the pace
into the stretch, swung wide giving up ground then finished evenly in the seven path. TITEBLUEJEANS hopped then was bumped at the start then was no
factor. PENNY'S TREASURE drifted out bumping CRYSTAL M and TITEBLUEJEANS at the start and failed to menace. CRYSTAL M was bumped then
squeezed at the start and never threatened. WAY OF THE WORLD pressured the winner two wide into the turn then gave way.
