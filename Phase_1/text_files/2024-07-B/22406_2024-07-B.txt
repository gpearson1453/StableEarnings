clear under urging. CUPID'S DUDE raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, angled in behind GOLDEN JUAN in upper stretch and
rallied inside for second. GOLDEN JUAN dueled two wide for the lead, shook free on the far turn, came wide past the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the
stretch run and yielded. STREET GLIDE raced off the pace inside, chased inside into the far turn, angled out midway on the turn and closed belatedly.
RHUMJAR was off slowly, raced off the pace between rivals throughout, chased on the far turn, moved up inside turning for home and lacked a rally.
CHEEKY TICO stalked the leaders early on, then chased and faded. KING OF HOLLYWOOD was fractious in the gate, dueled inside for the lead and gave
way on the far turn.
