ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through nearing the stretch and closed strongly. RED PANTY NIGHT was reserved off the pace while racing
three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. MERINO WOOL prompted the pace for six furlongs while two-wide and
weakened. REALREALGOOD settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and tired. MISCHIEF MAMA reared up at the start to get away well
behind her field then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover the lost ground.

WINTER FALCON saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. ATOMIC CANDY prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was
no match for the winner but finished well for second. HADLEES HONOR chased the pace racing along the inside, angled out to come two-wide into the
stretch and continued on for third in a steady effort. WARRENS CANDY MAN was reserved off the pace, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the
quarter pole and then went evenly late. MY SUNSHINE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. SUMMER SHANDEE
was unhurried while racing two-wide and failed to seriously threaten. MOON TIME settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide then was taken in
hand and pulled up nearing the half mile pole and was transported off the track via the equine ambulance.

GOOD FOCUS was reserved off the early pace, moved up two-wide nearing the quarter pole, lacked room to the three-sixteenths pole then angled out to be
four-wide and closed strongly to be up in the final strides. PEDAL TO THE METAL was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the
stretch, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and then just failed to last. ICE TOWER saved ground setting the pace to near the sixteenth pole and held
on fairly well for third when headed. C JAXON was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SUPER CREATIVE was
forwardly placed while saving ground to near the stretch and weakened. SECRET SAGA stalked the pace for a half mile but had no response when called

POWERIZED dueled WITH KNIGHTLINE while racing two-wide, shook that one off entering the stretch, then responded when challenged by DYNAMIC
SECRET nearing the eighth pole and was fully extended to prevail narrowly in a prolonged drive. DYNAMIC SECRET was reserved off the early pace while
racing four-wide, continued to be four-wide entering the stretch, caught POWERIZED nearing the eighth pole but was unable to get by that one in a game
try. KNIGHTLINE vied with POWERIZED for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and held on well for third. RUNDOFT was forwardly placed while
racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SPINNIN PISTOLS saved ground while being allowed to settle and went evenly. WELL IMAGINE THAT was unhurried

EXECUTIVE CHEF saved ground while being reserved off the pace, swung out nearing the stretch to be four-wide entering and closed strongly to be up in
the final seventy yards. COASTAL JAZZ vied with COOL PAPA G for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off entering the stretch but was unable
to resist EXECUTIVE CHEF late in a game effort. COOL PAPA G vied for the lead while three-wide early into the stretch and continued on well for third.
COASTAL KID was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. SMILING GOODBYE was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide but weakened during the drive. LANGSTON ROAD prompted the early pace from between horses and tired.
