DOROTHY'S THE BOSS lacked speed, advanced on the turn, angled wide then surged away in the final eighth. SWEET MISCHIEF stalked the dueling
leaders, bid clear on the turn then weakened late. PRACTICAL RACHEL fractious in gate prior to start, hesitated at the start then rallied inside. SWEETEST
MOMENT dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. ONTHISHARVESTMOON chased off the pace outside then flattened out in stretch.
WINE GODDESS raced far behind wide then faltered in the stretch. ELOPER raced in midpack and lacked a rally. FIVE STAR FRAN led narrowly inside
then began fading on the turn. FAR TOO FOXY forced the pace outside briefly then stopped abruptly.

HIGHTIME VALENTINE prompted the pace outside, took over after the half and eagerly pulled away while kept to her task. TOMARIE close up early, faded
briefly on the turn then came again for the place. JUST STAY HOME chased in the two path then inside and finished willingly. MORE RANSOM lacked
speed, angled inside stretch and closed well. CREME CARAMEL moved extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch. OLD HEAD eased back at the
start, moved inside and flattened. SCINTILLATING STAR led under pressure for half mile and stopped. CICI UNIFIED urged close up inside to the far turn
and gave way. CAPTIVATING CARA lacked speed and failed to respond.

BIRTHDAY BOND ROB prompted the pace three wide, took over after half mile and drew off under moderate urging. WHOOSH taken up early, advanced
wide and proved easily second best. BRASI forced the pace for half mile and weakened. PACIFIC STATES was urged close up along the rail and faded
after half mile. BUBBY PAPERMAKER dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PRINCE LUCAS raced in midpack and was never a factor.
THIS TIME BLUE was hustled to the front early then began tiring on the turn. CAUTELOSO lacked speed and stopped losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
TROPHY ROOM bid four wide on the turn then edged ahead in after a long drive. PETULANT DELIGHT earned a narrow lead opening half mile and battled
to the wire. AWESOMEBROTHERBILL bid inside into the stretch, led and just missed. THE ANGRY MAN far behind early, advanced inside narrowing the
gap. MAXIM MOMENT outrun early, moved extremely wide into the stretch. JARLIAN made a brief bid into the far turn then flattened out. JEBOLOGIST
dueled between rivals then was shuffled back on the turn. REJECTED AGAIN urged close up to the stretch and weakened. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS
prompted the pace opening quarter then gave way. LARGE broke sluggishly and lacked a response.
