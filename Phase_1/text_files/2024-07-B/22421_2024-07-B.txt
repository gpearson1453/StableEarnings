stretch finishing a solid second best. GIRO KATE slow early lagged to upper stretch rallying there in the three path passing the others. CURIOSITY KILLS
bumped at the break played no factor. CLAIRE'S DARLING bumped at the break was not involved. AMERICAN BOUND brushed at the break would press
early ceding on the turn wiling near mid track down the lane. DONYA'S MAGIC veered out causing traffic at the break.

much the best. QUICKSTYLE rallied on the far turn chasing through the lane a willing second best. MAYBE SARDONIC slow early lagged to upper stretch
passing tired ones there. REVENUE TRAIN raced evenly giving a mild move on the far turn weakening down the lane. ESTRELLA KIARA slow early played
no factor. CASSOULET hustled out set the pace ceding on the far turn wilting in upper stretch. DESPERATE TIMES chased the early pace giving way on
the far turn.
