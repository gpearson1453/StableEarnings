Footnotes
FOUR KNIGHTS was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. HE'S A SHOOTER stalked the
early leader and had the lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. PRIVATE LAKE was well back, had a mild gain
on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. OCTOBER FROST was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but
was no real threat. DIAMONDBACK showed speed from the outside and set the pace but was headed on the far turn and had nothing left.

ACE DESTROYER was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. STORMY SOUL was
unhurried early and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MUSICAL STRIDE was in touch and
roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. GREAT GO GO stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and from
the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally.

AWESOME SPIRIT GAL (FR) was well back, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. WAR VOW was
hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outgunned. AMI'S GIRL was away alertly
and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick. MISS SINGH ANGEL tracked the early leader and had a good position on the turn but from the five path
at the top of the stretch leveled off. BAD ZEZE set the pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way.
ALWAYS MY FAULT was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. COINS UNLIMITED was
in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. READY TO SCATTER was in range early and saved
ground on the turn but was not a factor.

Footnotes
BAIT N SWITCH was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. BEYOND TALENTED set the
pace and had the lead on the turn but was second best in a good effort. STREET SERENADE was in range, moved up on the turn and from the three path
at the top of the stretch held show. GENERAL COMMAND was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled
off. RIVER OF BABYLON was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but was never a threat. GUS'S GAMBLE was up close but chased on the turn
and had no late kick. BAILS HIM OUT showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
THY KINGDOM settled off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

MOUNTAIN SOUND was off the pace, moved up on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch proved best. J M R GEMMA was hustled from the inside
and had the lead on the turn but was no match for the winner. GLITTER BAY was in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch needed more. SHEBATOWN settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real
threat. CANT BEAT THE KATZ was up close and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. BODACIOUS MISS tracked
the early leaders but lost ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty.

factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. FREE SQUARE was off slow, roused on the turn and from the five path at
the top of the stretch finished evenly. MOBILIZER was hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled
off. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS broke poorly and showed little while while outrun. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but
was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOT'S VISION stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. UNION COLONEL was
in touch, had the lead on the far turn and vied from the three path through the stretch in a good effort. SENSIBLE PORTIONS was in mid pack, gained
ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. THELONIOUS was unhurried early, saved ground on the far turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. HALF LIT was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. FIFTH SEASON settled off the pace and was roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response.
CARMENOOTZ was off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn and was never in contention. HEEZESPEEDY set the pace but was headed on the far turn
and had nothing left. TARADAR was in range early but lost ground on the far turn and was outrun.
