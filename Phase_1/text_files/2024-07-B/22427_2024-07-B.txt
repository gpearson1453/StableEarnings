PERSEVERE tracked the early leaders from the inside, raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. DRILLHALL set
the pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied to deep stretch but was no match for the winner. SIGNONTHDOTTEDLINE stalked the early leader and was
a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. DELIRIO was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch was no real threat. SILENT SUMMIT was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MENAGERIE was off the pace, roused from the inside on the far turn and fought gamely through the stretch for the win. FEW REGRETS was unhurried
early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed. TANGERINE TWIST set the pace and had the lead on the far
turn but was outfinished. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for
a share. ASHWICKEN was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ASHCAR NELLIE stalked the
early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MISS SCHILLER was off slow and showed little
in a dull effort. SILENT WARNING was in range early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

trailed the field on the turn and was up for show. SPANISH SERENADE tracked the early leaders and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch needed more. BILL NEEDLE was off slow and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat.

Footnotes
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was in range, raced evenly from the inside on the far turn and with a bid in upper stretch proved best. TURF AND SURF checked
into the first turn, lacked room on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch closed. EYE GOT IT GOOD was in touch and a factor on the far
turn but with the lead from the three path in upper stretch was outfinished. FORMENTOR was carried wide on the first turn, had a good position on the far
turn and was all out through the stretch. LULU'S LULLABY was taken up on the first turn, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes. RIFLING was
in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. STOLE THE RING was off the pace and roused on
the far turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch had no response. CREATIVPERFORMANCE was hustled early and had a slim lead on the far
turn but gave way. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE forced the early pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
