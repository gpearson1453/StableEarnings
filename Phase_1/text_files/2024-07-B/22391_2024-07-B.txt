Footnotes
SIMULATE coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held stubbornly repelling one challenger and then faced a late surge and held by a
held to score. STATES' RIGHTS stumbled at the start, tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on, then surged late to get up for the place honors while missing by a
head on the wire for it all. WARLANDER tracked just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader and threatening to the outside through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire, then
got nailed in the final jumps and forced to settle for the show honors. WEST BEACH tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. BARRICADE lunged at the break, went three then two wide through the first turn,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished.
FLYING MOHAWK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, stayed on
one paced through to the finish. ATOMIC AGE broke a half a beat slow, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide
into upper stretch, offered no response. SPURGEON brushed the off side stall at the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. BESTFRIEND ROCKET three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled out six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SEATTLE ROAD saved ground near the rear of
the field, came under urging with five-sixteenths to run, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, made no impact.

NOONZIO broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along on the outside, chased in the four then three path on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a
drive into the final furlong, took over outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear while eased up late. SORORITY PRANK was hustled from the gate,
showed speed on the outside then moved clear outside the five-eighths pole, dropped from the two path to the rail while challenged early on the turn, shook
off a foe when asked near the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop while
shortening stride at the furlong marker and was overtaken while able to hold the place. EXECUTIVE MOVE broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged
along off the pace, went around the turn in the three then four path, came out some in upper stretch then was straightened by the rider, pursued the top two
in the drive and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. TWIRLING VINE dropped well behind under urging, rounded the turn in the three then
four path, turned into the stretch in the five path, remained on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and failed to
threaten. TINEBAR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace under coaxing, moved closer late on the backstretch, made a bid outside of the leader in the
three then two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. LEO'S REWARD was bumped at the start and forced in, saved ground
while urged along off the pace and failed to respond. IRON MAN IRA was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, showed speed then dropped back
near the five-eighths pole, came up empty on the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON coaxed from the gate directly to the front, led briefly three to four paths off the inside before being engaged in head to head combat by
NATURAL HARBOR to the inside, dueled with that rival tucking to the two path into the turn remaining patiently handled, took over command nearing the
quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to prevail. NOLO CONTESTO chased along the inside and then just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. NATURAL
HARBOR coaxed from the start, dueled inside of AMUNDSON from the five and a half furlong marker, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command and kept on under a drive but was caught late for the place honors while well clear of the rest for
the show. MARKET ALERT chased just off the inside, jostled between foes with PERFECT FLIGHT near the half mile pole, chased just off the inside
through the turn and then along the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. FLINT RIDGE got bumped at the start by CHARLIE FIVE O,
chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. CHARLIE FIVE O broke out at the start
bumping FLINT RIDGE, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. PERFECT FLIGHT a
bit fractious in the gate prior to the start requiring some adjusting, chased three to four wide and jostled between foes with MARKET ALERT near the half
mile pole, continued three then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SPEAK EASY was ridden along from the start, went around the turn in the four path, was driven into upper stretch in the six path, rallied outside to get the
lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. MARIACHI was fractious in the gate, broke outward then was hustled to the lead,
showed the way while off the rail, went around the turn in the two path, remained on his inside led while under threat in upper stretch, led into the final
furlong then was headed by the winner and proved no match but held the place. EDIFIED broke a step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, came under
stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three path, moved out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and finished with
good courage to garner the show. FORREST CITY was fractious in the gate, angled in while showing speed then chased the pace on the outside, went
around the turn in the three path, made a bid under a drive in upper stretch, battled with multiple foes into the final furlong and failed to match the winner
then just missed the trifecta. NOTAH stumbled at the start but broke with the field then was hustled, chased inside then was taken in hand behind the leader
late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue near the quarter-pole, made a bid along the rail in upper stretch, fought inside of foes
into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. GENERAL BANKER bumped with a rival at the start, was reserved towards the
rear, raced off heels under restraint late on the backstretch, was let out in the two then three path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. BE THE BOSS angled in while established a forward position early then was well placed, moved out late on the backstretch, chased in the four
path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and tired. KUNSHAN BRIDGE bumped with a foe at the start, settled under
some urging, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. LEDDY stumbled at the start but broke with the field, dropped back
under urging, traveled around the turn in the four path, came into the stretch in the five path, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to respond.

GAME WARDEN four wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and took
over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish kept to task. YO DADDY bobbled at the break, chased along the
inside and then just off the inside, came under coaxing half a mile from home and went two to three wide through the far turn, angled five wide into upper
stretch, ran on to chase the winner home but was ultimately repelled to the finish. STRAPPED chased along the inside and then just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WHO'S THE KING chased just off the inside and was a bit
rank into the first turn, then got steadied when impeded with seven and a half furlongs to run when SPECIAL DISPATCH tucked directly in front and altered
in, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. SPECIAL DISPATCH
coaxed from the gate, raced three wide into the first turn and then tucked to the two path impeding WHO'S THE KING and forcing that rival to steady off his
heels and alter to the rail with seven and a half furlongs to run, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and taking narrow
command outside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was collared at the three-sixteenths, then weakened through to the finish.
HAVE YOU HEARD coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front outside the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. PANDO three wide through the first turn, chased three then four wide under
coaxing from the half mile pole, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. COLLECTION DAY coaxed from the start, raced four wide through the first
turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
NAKATOMI showed speed on the inside of foes then dropped just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole,
swung into the five path under a left-handed crop while gaining into the stretch, chased the runner-up on the outside, drew alongside that foe inside the
furlong marker, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, brushed with the runner-up inside that pole and proved best under good handling. SKELLY
was last to commence, moved up on the outside to get the lead, shook clear near the nine-sixteenths pole, extended the advantage in the two path at the
seven-sixteenths pole then moved to the three path, controlled the action under extra left-rein pressure going around the turn, responded well when set
down after straightening for the drive, drifted out outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner outide the sixteenth-pole, brushed with that foe
inside that pole and was outfinished while able to hold the place. TWISTED RIDE showed speed between foes then chased the pace, moved out late on the
backstretch, was ridden along in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path, pursued the top two in the drive and finished with good
courage to safely secure the show. BABY YODA dropped back early then moved out, was ridden along on the outside, navigated the turn in the five path,
turned into upper stretch in the eighth path and weakened. MY BUDDY B dropped to the rear then was urged along at the back, went around the turn in the
two path and failed to threaten. SUBROGATE was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, traveled
around the turn in the four path, spun into stretch in the seven path, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong and had nothing
left.

Footnotes
CHANCER MCPATRICK coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish closing stoutly on the outside and was up in the final jumps overhauling a once clear leader in the
late stages. T KRAFT hustled from the gate, vied briefly before showing the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive edging away to inside the eighth pole, dug in growing a bit leg weary and was overhauled in the final strides to the finish while
clear for the place honors. NOBLE CONFESSOR coaxed from the start, led briefly and then chased four then three wide on hold until set down swinging
four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. FIDDLING FELIX tossed his head at the start getting away last and
conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went six wide into
upper stretch and showed good courage to offer up a mild kick to secure the last major share. TIZTASTIC coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until
tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was outfinished in
the late stages. AMERICAN PROMISE hesitated at the start and shied in from INVICTUS breaking inwards and conceded four to five lengths to the front,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, then got steadied off the heels of RESTORE near the three-eighths, angled out five
to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. INVICTUS broke in at the start, vied briefly three wide before chasing three then two wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. THARHOM chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four then three wide for home and tired. SHERMAN FURY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. RESTORE (FR) took an awkward first step at the start getting away a beat slow, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LAMORNA was bumped just after the start and forced out then dropped back, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, shifted to the
four path at the quarter-pole then quickly moved out while gaining fast, rallied to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. SATIN
BLUE stumbled at the start then was bumped and forced out into another foe, spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear, saved ground while
roused on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then quickly angled out, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed fast to just miss in a good
effort. ARRASOU broke out and bumped solidly with a foe, disputed the pace between horses, vied in the three path on the turn, took a short lead in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished but showed good courage to hold the show. MAC TO MOORE
showed speed on the inside of rivals then disputed the pace, vied in the two path under some extra left-rein pressure on the turn, battled with multiple foes
under into the final sixteenth and weakened while just able to get the last spot in the superfecta. DAY DAWNING showed speed between foes then was
taken back off the pace near the nine-sixteenths, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, jostled with a rival while
chasing inside the three-sixteenths, brushed with that same foe in the final furlong and was out-kicked. SCARLET POPPY (IRE) was coaxed along on the
inside, saved ground while drafting behind horses on the turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole, steadied while blocked and stymied behind horses
the entire stretch, jostled and brushed with a foe in the process and lost all chance while seemingly full of energy. ECHO BAYBE (IRE) broke out and
bumped with a foe then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside of opponents, vied in the five path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled
under a drive in upper stretch, was taken in hand while being out-kicked near the furlong marker and tired. TIPPLE dropped back then was urged along off
the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path, was carried out inside the three-sixteenths pole and lacked
the needed response. CORONA PRINCESS hit the inside of the gate then bumped with a foe at the start, angled in while off the pace, went three then four
wide on the turn, swung into the stretch in the seven path, dropped inward in the vicinity of the furlong marker and lacked the needed response then was
reported to have bled. AUNT NONA was bumped at the start then came out and bumped with another foe, disputed the pace between horses, vied in the
four path on the turn, dropped back off heels in upper stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FIERCENESS broke very alertly from the outside post, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead passing the
seven-sixteenths pole, went around the far turn in the three path, moved clear coming to the quarter-pole then spun five wide into the stretch before drifting
well out in the track, maintained a clear advantage into the final furlong, was guided in under right-handed pressure coming to the sixteenth-pole and held
under steady urging to prevail. SIERRA LEONE came away in good order then dropped to the rear, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried at the
back, passed the nine-sixteenths pole under coaxing, moved out into the far turn, was roused while getting closer in the two then three path on that bend,
came into the stretch in the four path then dropped inward, was carried in while gaining outside the furlong marker and finished with good energy but was
too late while well clear for the place. BATTEN DOWN was hustled from the gate then taken in hand nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two
path, was well placed just off the pace, came under encouragement while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, chased the winner in the
six path into the stretch then was carried out some, was guided in behind that foe inside the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in pursuit of the
winner in the drive and weakened but was clear for the show. SEIZE THE GREY saved ground on the first turn, settled nicely off the pace, was urged along
while inside to the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the three path, drifted out inside the furlong marker and came up empty. GOULD'S
GOLD was coaxed along early, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground on the
far turn and came up empty. PONY EXPRESS was sent hard to the front, dropped to the rail into the first turn, showed the way through solid fractions, was
headed by the winner at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside that foe under urging on the far turn, dropped back in the two path into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SUMMER WHIRL settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, altered out from behind horses in upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong
and closed strongly to get up in the final stride and prevail. AUTUMN was coaxed to the front, showed the way on the inside, shook off a foe near the
quarter-pole, lugged in some under a strong-hand ride in upper stretch, continued to lug in some under a left-handed crop in the final furlong and was
denied in the final stride. BOBBY M'S GIRL tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid on the far turn, lost touch with the runner-up in
upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of that foe to the finish and willingly earned the show. CAPITAL SPENDING went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was asked in the three to four path on the far turn, gained under a drive in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the show. NORTH END
LADY moved in under tight restraint early, was rank in the two path through the first turn then reserved while tugging at the bit, traveled around the far turn
in the two path, was asked for her best in upper stretch, gained while chasing in the final furlong, raced between horses late and just missed the superfecta.
MISS CITY GIRL rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was put to a drive
in upper stretch, gained inside the furlong marker, was held up in traffic in the final sixteenth and lost her best chance at a minor award. SHE IS ALL
BUSINES was well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final
sixteenth but was out-kicked. ASSISI was a bit reluctant to load, bumped with a rival at the start, moved in early, went around the turns in the three path,
shifted to the five path at the quarter-pole and failed to rally. PRINCESS SUMMER was last to commence, settled at the rear while inside to the two path,
moved out in upper stretch, dropped back in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten then was transported off the track via equine ambulance.
ALITTLEBITNAUGHTY was hustled from the gate, raced up close on the outside in the three to four path, chased on the far turn, bore out into the seven
path into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ADDAGIRL ADDIE traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged
along in the four path on the far turn and was no factor.
