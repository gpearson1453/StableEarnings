SEVENTEEN BLACK broke on top and raced under pressure from C R INSTA GATOR, continued to hold a slim lead into the early backstretch then edged
ahead to a length lead, widened advantage still racing in hand around the final turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch, shook the reins, responded,
opened up, tapped once and finished ridden out. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL raced off the clear top pair up the backstretch, picked up the pace around the
far turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch, finished with response and gained second best. C R INSTA GATOR applied pace pressure to
SEVENTEEN BLACK around the first turn and into the early backstretch while racing well clear over the next pursuer, remained forwardly placed and
stalked rival into the far turn, hustled along two to three wide in upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but kept on and secured a share.
SUCCESSION was reserved in the back and saved ground, rode the rail around the far turn, was ridden along into upper stretch and failed to threaten.
GINGER RULES raced off the clear top pair along the inside, urged two wide into the stretch and failed to move into contention.

SWEET LAURA was forwardly placed three wide around the first turn then moved up to apply pressure to UNDECODED in the early backstretch, continued
to force the issue into the far turn, dueled outside of aforementioned rival past the quarter pole and into the lane, took the edge at the furlong marker and
drew clear under mild urging. UNDECODED led the way around the first turn, then set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead inside of
SWEET LAURA at the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch, got collared for the lead near the furlong marker, ran on and secured second best.
GOLD STRATEGY raced off the early pace then picked up the tempo near the half mile marker, ranged up in contention near the quarter pole, flattened a
bit entering upper stretch but sustained a steady bid and finished well clear over the rest. BLESSED ANNA was forwardly placed and pressed the pace in
the early backstretch, weakened off the top pair and continued in range entering the far turn, saved ground and faded through the lane. GP'S AMAZING
GRACE moved at the break and came away slowly, raced three to four wide into the first turn, was not too far back in early stages, then steadily weakened,
came three wide into upper stretch and had no response. THE STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START OF GPS AMAZING GRACE,

Footnotes
SHOTSHELL led the way into the first turn then was quickly challenged by COST BASIS, dueled inside of rival up the backstretch and continued around the
far turn, shook free turning for home, responded gamely under right handed pressure, widened to a clear advantage and finished ridden out while going
away. COST BASIS moved up to engage SHOTSHELL for the lead around the first turn, vied outside of rival up the backstretch and around the far turn,
could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane, weakened off pulling away winner but kept on and finished second best. EMBER raced off
the early pace, continued in the last flight around the far turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, made contact with EXECUTIVE ACTION, moved up
three wide and lasted for show. EXECUTIVE ACTION raced in the last flight up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch, was forced
in and bumped by outside running EMBER, shifted to the outside and just missed show. CASEYS MEMORY stalked the top flight through early stages,
hustled along two paths wide into upper stretch then flattened late. RONIC raced inside of rival off the top flight, hustled along the rail to mid-stretch then
gave way.

Footnotes
SNAP'N TAP raced off the pace in opening stages, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch, moved up to duel four deep at the quarter pole, battled on
three wide, cleared command past mid-stretch and held firm. JAYSKER moved up to challenge mid-way around the turn, vied inside of rivals into the final
furlong, was no match when the winner took over but sustained bid and moved back up to capture place. TAKE ME UP BRADY moved up mid-way around
the turn, vied for the lead between foes into the stretch, was no match when the winner took over then yielded and lost place. SECRET BLARNEY raced off
the early pace, swung four wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. LUCKY LOUIE raced in the back, swung five wide into the upper
stretch and passed tiring rivals. BILLY BOB ROCKET raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. FRANKLYGREAT
raced up close in early stages then steadily weakened. FRANKLY EPIC sped to the lead at the start, challenged and vied for the lead mid-way around the
turn then tired in the drive.
