Footnotes
LOVE MY CHERYL was unhurried early, a factor on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch fought gamely for the win. KATCHY NAME showed speed from
the inside and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. SWEET FINALE was away alertly
and trailed the field on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. ORBALINE was in touch and forced the pace on the turn but from
the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. REMEMBEROLDTYMES was up close and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch had no response.

Footnotes
ROYAL CHROME was away alertly and showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. SHES HOT TO TROT was in
touch and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SOUL JOURNEY tracked the early leaders and
raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. ALWAY'S ROSIE was in range and hustled along on the turn but had
no late kick. GOLDEN SPRING settled off the leaders and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
SIGNATURE RING was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. ALWAYS MY FAULT was up close
early but lost ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

LULU'S LULLABY settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch proved best. MIA AND ME was away alertly
and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. PRINCE FOR A DAY was up close, forced the pace on the turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. HARPER CITY tracked the early leaders and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but was in tight
from the four path in upper stretch while all out. MISS D'S PRIDE was hustled from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch.
MIGHTY PELE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. ARTIE'S ALL IN was well
back and showed nothing in a dull effort. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON HARPER CITY AGAINST PRINCE FOR A DAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN

Footnotes
HALF TO RELOAD set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. SUNYANI was in
touch and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. STRONG ENDING stalked the early leaders and was hustled
along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. BEYOND MY DREAMS was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn
but was not a factor. PALACE PRINCE was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BOCELLI
was well back, trailed the field on the turn and was never in contention. LENNY K was off the pace, chased on the turn and dropped back through the
stretch.

slow, gained ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. CHERRY GARDENS showed speed from the inside and had a
clear lead on the turn but failed to hold. SMOKEN CHLOE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
needed more. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
AMONG THE ROSES was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. MO TWILIGHT stalked

path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MAGIC TOMAHAWK was in range, roused on the far turn and finished evenly. TRULY MISCHIEF forced the
early pace and had the lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. KIDDIE HOLIDAY was unhurried early, in tight
on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. TARADAR set a pressured pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
