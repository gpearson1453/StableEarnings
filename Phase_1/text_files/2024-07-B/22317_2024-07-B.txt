EKATI'S WAY chased the pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead past the three sixteenths marker then burst clear under mild left handed urging
through the final furlong to win as much the best. COLOR BEARER unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the five path and finished clear for second. ROLL
A QUARTERS sped to the front soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. WOLFINE close up, dropped back on the turn then
passed tiring rivals late. HARTSTEIN with the second flight inside, improved position on the turn then lacked the needed response. RUN RED RUN was
bumped at the start and failed to menace. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE chased the pace two wide and weakened on the turn then checked behind a rival nearing
the wire. A PRAYER FOR KIDS bobbled inward bumping RUN RED RUN at the start and trailed throughout.

ROCKSTAR RO never far back, closed rapidly two wide then along the inside through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch then finished full of
run under strong handling to win going away. SMOKIN' HOT chased the pace two wide, was carried out to the seven path entering the stretch, dug in late
three wide and got up for second. JOKEMEISTER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, gave up the lead
and was outfinished despite a game effort. CRYO never far back, finished well along the inside. REAL NAUGHTY stalked the pace three wide and failed to
respond. MAKING ME CRAZY was no factor. POWERFUL MOON had brief speed. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT was outrun, stopped abruptly in mid stretch, was
eased to the wire and walked off.

CLOUD PRINCESS stalked the pace into the turn, shifted outside the top pair, rallied in the six path under left handed urging to make the lead inside the
furlong marker and drew clear. VAL'S TWINSTAR pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, set the pace until deep
stretch then was no match for the winner. MANDAVILLA slow early, closed with a rush through the stretch outside rivals. ROLLIN FREEDOM vied for the
lead along the inside through the turn, shifted out to the five path at the head of the lane and finished determinedly. JUSTWORTHASHOT well placed, failed
to respond. SMARTASSET rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace for nearly a half then weakened. J. P INDY was no factor. FLAME
FOR REAL was no threat.
