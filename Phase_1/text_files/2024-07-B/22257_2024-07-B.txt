Footnotes
INFINITESIMAL stalked the pace from four wide through the turn, rallied at the head of the lane to take command in upper stretch and drew clear to the
wire. CHAOTIC JACK reserved off the pace to the turn, split rivals on the bend, angled out seven wide at the head of the lane and closed well belatedly to
gain the place. YAKETY YAK pressed the pace for the first half mile took a brief lead on the turn, dug-in through the stretch and was out-finished by the top
pair. MECKES PRIORITY raced mid-pack in contnention on the turn, rallied in upper stretch to be prominent and failed to sustain the bid finishing evenly.
CAJUN CYCLONE set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened in the lane. R T'S MIDNIGHT tracked the leaders to be well placed and lacked a
closing response when called upon. EL IT slow early to trail and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. PUPPETEER failed to menace. FREE FROM GUILT was
not a threat. ST BASIL chased the pace to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
GUITAR DOCTOR set a pressured pace for the first three-eighths, responded when called upon turning for home and opened a clear, unthreatened lead in
the lane. SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN tracked the leaders into the turn from four wide, drifted seven wide while rallying in upper stretch to loom, could not
gain on the winner but finished willingly as second best. SPLENDA GAIL pressed the pace from three wide to the quarter pole and kept-on down the lane to
hold the show. BIND FAITH reserved off the pace in the turn while being caught wide throughout and made up ground late in the stretch drive.
GOLDENLUTE hustled up the fence to be well placed in contention on the turn and finished evenly lacking a closing bid. ARKANSAS ZONG prompted the
early pace and weakened on the turn. LOOKIN FOR LOKI was one-paced never posing a threat. ALLEVA trailed throughout as a non-factor.

NORTHERNREFLECTION raced mid-pack through the turn while saving ground, cut the corner to ride the rail in the lane and closed well to prevail in deep
stretch. TURN ON THE MAGIC unhurried early to be well off the pace, circled seven wide at the top of the stretch and surged late in the lane to just miss in
a good effort. CRIMSON STORM tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied splitting rivals in the lane and was gaining late. POPULIST pressed the pace
to midway on the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole and kept-on willingly through the lane. VERRAZANO FIRST stalked the pace to the quarter
pole, rallied in upper stretch to take the lead midway down the lane and was out-finished in deep stretch. DOCTOR LEO slow early to trail the field and
made a belated gain in the lane. JOLLY TOMMY tracked the pace from the inside, rallied to loom in mid-stretch and flattened out. MARK THE MOOSE

Footnotes
MOR MOR MUSIC set a pressured pace while well rated for three-quarters, responded when called upon turning for home to open a clear advantage and
held well through the lane. DONA WITCH tracked the leaders to the far turn, circled four wide to mount a challenge at the head of the lane and finished well
to be gaining late as a clear second best. MY SOUTHERN GIRL pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and kept-on through the lane to hold the show.
BROADWAY STAR ducked out at the start, raced up into the first turn, settled three wide off the pace down the backside aand was along late to hit the
board. AWESOME BECCA slow early to trail on the final bend and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CONGRATULERA raced mid-pack to the far turn,
made a mild bid on the bend to be in contention and flattened out in mid-stretch. BROWNIE BAY stalked the pace for a half mild and came up empty.

Footnotes
COSTA LADY stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied from three wide to take command in upper stretch and drew off in the drive. SUGAR CANE
GAL reserved off the pace to midway on the turn, made a steady advance through the lane and surged in deep stretch to gain the place in the final stride.
FIVE LEAF CLOVER set a pressured pace to the top of the lane and weakened coming home. PENNIES FOR PAULLA broke slow to be the trailer, made a
strong middle move circling the field to loom in upper stretch and flattened out. SUNSET FLASH unhurried for the first half mile, was put to a long drive on
the turn, angled ten wide in the lane and made up ground late. DR. BOO raced mid-pack to the quarter pole and made a mild bid in the stretch. DAY
STORM passed tiring rivals without impact. C C LLAM tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn and faded coming home. ACESANDDIAMONDS
rated off the pace and lacked a rally when called upon. LUCCA'S LILYBY showed brief speed to be well placed down the backside and weakened.
ROMONA'SDREAM was not a threat. PRINCESS MOCCASINS pressed the pace to the turn and tired.

RED WHISTLE unhurried in the early going to trail, circled six wide turning for home to engage the leader inside the eighth pole and closed well to be going
away at the wire. STEPHANIE'S MARIA stalked the pace down the backside, split rivals leaving the half mile pole to battle on the lead from between horses,
took command in upper stretch and was out-finished late. A MISS DEAMEANOR dueled on the lead from four wide for a half mile and weakened down the
lane. DIAMOND DEAL vied for the lead from the inside to midway on the turn and weakened turning for home. TAKE HER AWAY was not a factor.

Footnotes
REAL ACTION broke outward losing ground leaving the gate, settled off the pace down the backside, circled the field turning for home and closed well to be
clear late. GATSBY'S FORTUNE stalked the pace from three wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and was out-finished in the lane. FLASHY
LOVER rated mid-pack to midway on the turn and mounted a rally to be gaining late. CHARLIE'S PARADE dueled from the rail on the early lead, lost
position dropping back on the turn and kepton in the stretch to hit the board. PATIO'S PORCH dueled on the lead from two wide to midway on the turn, took
the lead at the quarter pole, responded when challenged to the eighth pole and tired late. SPEIGHTFUL ONE was not a threat. HALF FULL was never a
factor while racing wide. MATZOH BALL squeezed shortly away from the gate, lost his action several strides later to be bucking down the backside, was
eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
LADY DREAMER set a pressured pace for the first half mile, repelled the runner-up nearing the quarter pole and drifted out through the lane while drawing
away. EMILY'S BULLET stalked the pace to the turn, challenged at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner and finished willingly as second best.
MISS DARLENE pressed the pace early and kept-on through the stretch to be the best of the rest. CRYSTAL D'ORO well placed off the pace along the rail
in the turn and finished with a grinding mild bid. LOUISIANA LIBERTY slow early to drop back well off the field to the turn, cut the corner and showed mild
late interest passing weaker rivals in the stretch. BERLAINE chased the leaders from four wide and flattened out. GIRL THIRSTY was not a threat.
