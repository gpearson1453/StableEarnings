Footnotes
ARTISTIC LANEY quick to the front well handled throughout, cleared off to the wire in a drive. FANCIFUL chased winner throughout bid in the stretch turned
away at wire. SHADY BABY outside run to the turn, kept on in the stretch for show spot. SHARP E tried to keep up with winner to the turn gave in readily
with a dull effort. SISSY'S MAY never menaced while down on rail in the stretch run. EMERALD EYES never menaced. LATE DATE always outrun. LACY
QUEEN could not keep up inside to turn, stopped readily.
