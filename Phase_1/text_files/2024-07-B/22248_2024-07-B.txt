Footnotes
LITERATE rated kindly on the fence, tracking the pacesetter in the early stages, began to cut into the leaders margin at the three furlong pole, was full of
steam quickly approaching the tiring pacesetter at the top of the lane, was asked right handed at the furlong marker and drew away smartly for the win at the
wire. STORMCAST was eager up front in the first turn, continued to be headstrong while opening up on horses down the backstretch, began to shorten
stride straightening out for home with the pace slowing down considerably, offered no resistance to the winner when collared outside by mid-stretch but still
managed to finish up well enough to be clearly second best in this bunch. ARRIVISTE co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, began to pick up the bit,
edging closer to runners at the half while on the fence, was scrubbed on for more with five sixteenths to go and closed mildly in upper stretch to be a distant
third at the finish line. LADY MOONSHINE co-trailed on the outside into the first of two turns, could see the strung out field by the half, made little impact on
the far turn but did pass a weakening runner inside with five sixteenths remaining, shifted outside in the three path for the drive and passed another tired foe
to settle for a minor role in the end. STREGA tracked two wide on the outside in the first turn, continued to sit outside of a rival watching the loose
frontrunner down the back straight, could not stay with the eventual winner who was starting a run three furlongs from home and wilted on the fence in upper
stretch. ZISISIT (IRE) sat alone in the third flight in the early stages, was roused for more three eighths from home, could quicken with other rivals on the
final turn, trailed the field by the quarter pole and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AWESOME ENTRY travelled on the fence near the rear in the beginning, rallied smartly when bursting between rivals at the five sixteenths marker, was
reaching for more ground six wide by upper stretch and under a vigorous ride by his jockey, wore down the front pair at the seventy yard marker to win
going away when crossing the wire. CONNOR shadowed the pacesetter outside under a snug hold along the backside, was content to sit just outside the
leader in the turn, moved in to duel for the lead in the five path at the top of the stretch, poked his head in front briefly between horses at the eighth pole but
could not fend off the winner who was full of run late. NIGHT STRIKER had a slim lead inside down the backstretch, set pace improving the margin up front
slightly around the turn, was headed outside in the three path at the quarter pole, fought stubbornly inside to the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly at
the sixteenth pole to hold for third money. CATHOLIC JACKIE watched the front duo while outside foes in the turn, was in range just behind the leaders in
the five path straightening out for the drive, ran greenly in the stretch drifting in and out and was one paced to the finish line to settle on the fringes in the
end. BLONDINA'S BOY travelled on the rail in mid-pack down the backside, improved to be in the third flight on the fence in the turn, shifted out to be four
wide in the stretch drive having a chance for a piece of the prize, was gaining but could not reel in rivals late. THEFRONTIERSMAN stalked in the third flight
outside of horses in the beginning, shifted outside for clear running room six wide at the top of the lane, lost his path at the sixteenth pole and could not play
a factor in deep stretch. BIG SHOOTER was allowed to settle down the backside, trailing the field, continued to be a distant last around the bend, angled out
widest in the nine path straightening for home and showed some late energy, passing weary runners in mid-stretch. DUBAWI BULL stalked close to the
back of the pack two wide down the back straight, status was unchanged running through the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch but made little
presence in the drive to the finish line. GENTLE PERSUASION travelled near the rear on the rail down the backside, save ground around the bend but
could not make any headway on the leaders and never reached contention down the stretch while running on the fence. SOUPER ICONIC had a tracking
role, watching the lead pair while nestled on the rail throughout the turn, was in the mix for a share in the three path turning for home but yielded onside foes
at the furlong marker. SPEEDY BULLEIT settled outside runners in mid-division in the early stages, made little progress while in the four flight around the
bend, shifted out to the six path for the stretch drive but was empty down the lane.

Footnotes
MENSA took control right from the onset, easily setting the fractions along the backside, was unchallenged while slowing the pace down around the bend
and was never threatened in the stretch winning under a hand ride to the wire. INTO DIAMONDS broke out on the start, chased the winner while four deep
outside foes down the back straight, began to pick up the pace three wide going around horses on the turn, battled outside for the secondary share down
the stretch and won the duel in a tight photo at the wire. SHADOW FACTOR pursued the leader in the two path while between horses down the back
straight, vied between rivals for the second money share around the turn and determinedly fought on the fence for the place award but just missed at the
finish by a nose. EMPOWER was scrubbed on to stay interested when trailing the field at the half, made little improvement throughout the turn shifted out to
the three path for the stretch run and passed tired runners for a minor share in the end. YOUR VALENTINO was in the three path with runners on both sides
while watching the frontrunner down the backstretch, had to be checked, losing positioning at the three furlong marker and could not recover down the lane
to pose a threat running to the wire. SOL DE VERANO travelled on the rail in the quartet that was tracking the leader in the early going, was ridden for more
in midturn but was going the wrong way by the quarter pole and flattened out on the rail at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
DANCIN IN DA'NILE was brushed lightly at the break, moved forward inside tracking the leader inside the second flight, edged nearer while being guided
out past the three-eighths, came to the top of the stretch four wide with aim on the leader, took over near the furlong marker, edged clear late under steady
handling. NEVER SURPRISED quickly moved clear and shifted in to the two path to set the pace, was shadowed by rivals, clear entering the turn,
challenged in upper stretch, resisted briefly but proved no match while clearly second best. BRITISH ROYALTY settled between runners in the second flight,
moved out four wide for the stretch run, kept on to secure show honors while no match for the top pair but best of the rest. RON'S GIZMO got away well,
was allowed to settle, stalked from outside four to five wide on the turn, floated six to seven wide for the drive, ran evenly in the stretch. COOL KISS settled
outside the second flight mid-pack, fanned seven wide turning for home, closed mildly late but just missed the super. TARANTO TITAN settled off the pace
inside, saved ground early on the turn moving out off the rail a bit late on that bend, failed to rally. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS was forwardly-positioned
stalking from outside the eventual runner-up, went three to four wide on the turn, was forced out leaving that bend coming five deep to the top of the stretch
and still within range, faded in the lane. GRANDSON brushed the outer rival at the start, settled at the back, raced two to four wide throughout, was never
near enough to threaten. TWOWAYCROSSING broke a step slowly, raced outside at the rear, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CUT THE DUST emerged from the pack to have a slim lead at the half, pulled away while in hand at the three furlong pole, opened up with ease turning for
home and was kept to the task late for a dominant victory. SCORCHING sat alone behind the foursome contesting up front down the backstretch, had to be
throttled down momentarily when coming up to a tired runner with five sixteenths to go, found a seam three wide at the top of the stretch, quickly burst
through and had good strong late energy to best the rest at the wire. SHADOW REALM stalked near the rear, having one foe beaten along the backside,
took closer order, starting a rally three wide midway through the turn and finished up smartly outside horses to win the duel for the show award. GROOT
chased the leader three wide with runners on both sides, kept pace with the frontrunner around the turn, shifted inwards for the drive, kept on fighting on the
fence down the lane and settled on the fringes in the end. CARNEW prompted the pace four deep down the backstretch, took up the chase but could not
close the gap on the winner throughout the turn and faded at the eighth pole between runners. LASTING SILENCE broke with the field but had no early foot
even though was urged to stay involved along the backside, continued to trail the pack around the turn and passed a straggler outside at the furlong marker.
ADMIRAL NELSON pressed the pace two wide between runners in the early going, had no more to offer on the fence by midturn, backed away on the
inside and emptied out on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MYRA'S BOY exchanged a light brush at the start, settled toward the rear two to three wide, was encouraged along coming to the five-sixteenths, angled
out at that juncture moving four then five wide on the leaders, drifted in a bit in upper stretch then again under right-handed urging once in charge a furlong
out, held sway. CHASING TROUBLE settled at the back shifting in three to four wide in the early going, bided time through the far turn, waited briefly past
the quarter pole seeking room in behind runners, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, was gaining steadily but too late while clearly second best. GOOD
POINT tucked in tracking inside the second flight, came out a bit in upper stretch, secured show while no threat to the top pair. STRETCH PASS got away
well and went straight to the front, set the pace in the clear, weakened in the stretch when headed. WHISKEY ROW exchanged minor contact at the start,
was well-positioned stalking two to three wide, put to urging past the five-sixteenths but was only one-paced. FIGHTING IRISH brushed with a foe at the
start, stalked from outside mid-pack three to four wide early, continued in range four to five deep on the far turn but failed to rally. MONDAY MORNING
broke inwardly brushing a rival, stalked from between foes in the second flight, moved out from three to five wide on the far turn, failed to make a bid. DARE
TO BE KING brushed with a foe at the start, angled in saving ground along the rail, was never a threat. LOST STAR was caught outside foes racing mostly
four to five wide throughout and was not a factor. BEST IN CLASS broke a step slowly and steadied slightly, raced at the rear off the rail, was not a threat.

Footnotes
SWIFT DELIVERY was unhurried travelling four wide outside horses near the back of the pack in the first turn, relaxed well just ahead of one rival down the
backstretch, weaved through runners in the two path at the quarter pole, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane, accelerated quickly when a seam
presented itself four wide at the furlong marker and when asked with only mild urging ran by runners to take control seventy yards from home. RUNAWAY
CHARLIE was bumped at the break, recovered to take this field into the first turn, set the pace while pressed outside down the backstretch, put away the
early speed foe by the quarter pole, braced for the new challenger outside in upper stretch, fought on courageously on the fence to the wire and held for the
place share with that solid effort. PIERRE stalked in the third flight between horses, closed in three wide with three eighths to go, poked his head in front
outside the pacesetter briefly at the quarter pole but could not find more late and was outfinished by the rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth to settle for
third money. LEGAL CATCH tracked three deep outside foes in the second flight down the backstretch, rallied four wide midpoint on the far turn, was
fanned out to the six path straightening for home and won the battle for a minor role in the end. EXUDE made a good move, saving ground early getting to
the fence into the first turn, stalked near the rear inside down the backstretch, shifted out to be two wide between foes at the three furlong marker, had an
impressive turn of foot splitting runners three wide midway on the final bend, was in the hunt in the five path turning for home but stalled a bit with runners
on both sides in final sixteenth. MCAVOY was brushed outside on the start, watched the front duo while tucked in on the rail in the early stages of the race,
waited on the fence in the far turn, shifted just outside in the two path behind the leaders at the top of the stretch and evened out through the stretch.
ROSCAR broke inwards to begin, tracked two wide between foes in the first turn, lacked running room when stuck behind a stopping rival at the quarter pole
and had no bid to offer in the drive to the finish line. SPINZAR was brushed on the start, trailed the field down the backstretch, tried to start a rally on the
final turn but appeared to be getting out with five sixteenths to go, but did finish with some intent in the four path through the stretch running. BAIL US OUT
saved ground throughout, was nestled on the rail in the third tier for the race, had clear run on the fence in the stretch but lacked a serious bid to the wire.
FANORE (IRE) stalked in the third flight three wide outside foes for the most part, offered a mild run three wide outside horses at the three furlong marker
but had little to offer in the stretch drive. HAWKESBURY broke in to begin, pulled the rider to force the issue outside in the first turn, continued to battle up
front down the back straight, had no more to offer when engulfed by runners on both sides at the quarter pole, was checked and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) was brushed inside to begin, settled in midfield outside horses down the backstretch, crept closer while still in hand around the bend
three wide of runners, posed the main threat in the six path straightening for home and relentlessly wore down the leader through the lane to get up a few
jumps before the finish line in a well timed late run. STONE AGE (IRE) settled on the rail behind the front runner, watched the contesting pair while waiting
to move at the three furlong pole, pounced sharply to take command in the four path a quarter mile from the wire and fought on stubbornly trying to hold the
lead but gave way to the winner in deep stretch. KAUKOKAIPUU sat alone, rating kindly keeping a close eye on the lead trio down the backside, waited for
the cue to move at the three furlong pole, angled out to be four wide behind the leader turning for home, shifted inwards at the three sixteenths pole, battled
inside to the wire but could not find more late and was a distant third in the end. DUN DRUM had a stalking role on the rail in the third flight down the
backstretch, closed in well going around the bend, was in the mix in the two path behind the leader in upper stretch and finished up willingly to just miss
closing in for third money. SOUTH BEND stalked outside near the rear in the beginning, closed the gap on the turn but could not improve position, angled
out widest in the eight path at the top of the stretch but failed to fire down the lane. LIL BIT GANGSTA was ahead of only one rival along the backside,
saved ground but made little impression through the turn and could not get involved driving to the wire in the five path down the stretch. LUCKMAN was
brushed outside to begin, trailed the field by many in the early stages of the race and passed tired foes on the outside in mid-stretch. DAY TRIPPER
prompted the pace outside down the back straight, took over the lead briefly with five sixteenths to run, gave way to rivals in the three path at the top of the
lane and yielded on the rail at the furlong marker. EXPRESSMAN assumed command, getting to the rail down the backside, set the pace while hounded
outside around the bend, was collared outside at the three furlong pole, offered little resistance and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VITALITY broke out to begin, settled in mid-pack four deep outside foes at the half, quickly moved around horses when asked for more at the seven
sixteenths marker, seized control three wide at the quarter pole continuing the sharp rally and kept on going with no challengers in sight through the stretch
for an impressive route score. BEDARD was brushed at the break, had a good spot on the rail watching the lead trio down the backstretch, waited to move
when stuck behind the tiring early leader on the far turn, shifted out by the quarter pole in the three path, loomed the main threat four wide straightening out
for the drive, was no match for the winner but did hold on to win the battle for second money at the wire. WYOMING BILL had a compromised beginning in
between horses at the start, stalked near the back of the pack down the backstretch, was encouraged right handed three furlongs out, circled smartly
around the field four wide through the far turn, was in the mix in the six path for the drive and continued to rally gamely in the stretch to just miss the nod for
the place share at the finish line. THOR'S CAUSE stalked three wide near the rear in the first bend, improved smartly on the fence along the backstretch,
kept pace with the leaders while three wide around the final turn, angled out in the five path with a chance for a share turning for home and fought on to the
finish line to capture a minor award in the end. BEYOND ADVERSITY settled on the fence in mid-division in the early going, edged closer to the leaders
while inside runners down the backstretch, saved ground keeping pace on the final turn, shifted to the three path just behind the eventual winner at the top
of the lane and was one paced to the wire just missing out on a minor share at the wire. SAINT TEMPLAR was in the second flight four wide into the first
turn, travelled in midfield down the backstretch three deep outside foes at the half, offered a mild run three wide between horses with five sixteenths
remaining but could not continue on at the top of the stretch and stalled in the six path down the lane. KING ROSSO was brushed on the start, was ahead of
only one rival while stalking on the rail in the first turn, made little progression down the backside, came under a ride on the final turn but made no headway
and could not be a factor in the three path driving to the finish line. RIDEAU HALL was fractious in the post parade, roused at the break trying to get the lead
but had to settle for a tracking role down the backstretch two wide, started to rally when urged right handed at the three eighths pole, moved in on the
weakening pacesetter to poke his head in front for a moment between horses at the quarter pole, could not sustain the run and tired in the two path with a
furlong to go. BOWMAN'S RUN was five wide on the first turn outside runners in the second flight, entering the backstretch was shuffled back to near the
rear, offered a mild run two wide between foes at the three eighths pole until the top of the stretch in the five path then gave way in mid-stretch. DERBY
STREET trailed the field in the early stages, caught up to runners on the outside three wide midpoint on the far turn, was fanned out to be widest in the eight
path for the stretch drive and could only pass tired foes in the lane. MIDNIGHT MO was hustled to the lead on the rail into the first turn, set a brisk pace up
top along the backside, was collared outside by runners midway on the final bend, had nothing left to give and stopped on the rail in mid-stretch. ONE LAST
KISS prompted the pace four wide on the first turn, chased the front runner outside down the back straight, emptied out on the far turn and retreated through
the field at the quarter pole.
