Footnotes
CYBERTIME rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold
on. CROWN THAT SAINT settled inside on the first turn, started his bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily from that point, raced in the
four path on the far turn, dueled to clear second late yards and was gaining strongly on the winner. NO BRAKE NEEDED exchanged contact with Hurricane
Jim leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and relented in the stretch
duel for second. YANGARRA broke awkwardly and made contact with Hurricane Jim then stalked inside the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. KARMA'S INTHEHOUSE became fractious in the gate, dropped well back from contention and could
only improve his position. EL REY DE PAPA rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened approaching
the far turn. HURRICANE JIM was jostled leaving the gate, saved ground on the opening turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BIG HAMBONE cleared rivals on the chute and tapered to the inside to show the way, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
turn and held well with steady stretch handling. GRAND FIBER veered in leaving the gate then continued to angle sharply in and gave chase, raced close
off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. E J'S REVENGE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. INSIDE
RISK broke a step slow then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. DAN THE MAN CAN chased inside, rounded the
turn at the rail, was eased out toward the head of the lane and showed little further. HEY CONGRATS was shut off leaving the half mile pole, gave chase
past that point, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path. JAZZ
MAN DO was pinched back past the half mile pole then gave chase, was eased to the five path through the turn and weakened in the lane. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Grand Fiber for interference shortly after the start, lodged by the rider of Hey Congrats, and as a result,
disqualified Grand Fiber to sixth place.

Footnotes
I AM THAT I AM settled in the four path early, bid and challenged approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn
and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage late yards. PROTA became a bit anxious in the gate then took a quick lead and rated the pace, came
under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail into the far turn, was met at even terms midway through the turn and dug
in gamely from that point, though, reluctantly ceded in late yards. WELLING settled close inside, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole,
entered the far turn at the rail, angled to the three path approaching the head of the lane but showed little further. CAYENNE CREEK stalked the early pace
off the rail, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. TOP OF THE MINT settled in the four
path the first turn, left the second turn outside and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened
in the lane. MASTER THIS mostly saved ground.

COLT ROCK pressured the pace and contested at a slim disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took the nod entering the stretch and was all out to hold
on. MISSIONARY gave chase then altered course past the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the five path then dueled through the stretch to share
second. PINK DINGHY gave chase but was shuffled back from between horses nearing the three eighths pole, altered course to go around a rival and
resumed the drive, entered the turn two deep, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and dug in through the final furlong to share second under
the wire. DIXIE YODELER gave chase, entered the turn about the four path, was eased to the six path through the turn and finished well outside.
AREYOUGONNAKISSME chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. GOLD FIBER gave chase, raced close in the three path on
the turn and finished evenly. CHARITABLE WINDSOR set a pressured pace and contested the edge two deep on the turn, was met entering the stretch and
weakened inside the sixteenth pole. DOC ELM gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. HE ROLLS was unprepared for the
start and raced wide on the turn.

REMY'S HOTSHOT took the lead while angled in and rated the pace, was pressured approaching the quarter pole, extended her lead at the rail on the turn
and was kept sharp in the stretch. MAMA MARGE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail, dueled to clear second mid-stretch and closed the gap the final
sixteenth. YES TO LOVE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and relented in the stretch duel for second. BULL'S LEGACY bobbled inward and made
contact with XTENDED STREAK then gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and passed rivals in the lane. The latter
was bumped and squeezed leaving the gate then angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the lane. CREME
DE LA QUEEN broke outward and made contact with Xtended Streak, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and

MARK DID IT took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, was pressured leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
and was kept sharp in the lane. ANTIPOISON settled off the rail the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five
path and dueled to clear second mid-stretch. BONNIE BILL angled in and stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back
approaching the five sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened. RRACE DAY WARRIOR raced off the rail the first turn and gave chase into
the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail then steadied in tight at the rail mid-stretch. SIMPLY JACK rounded the opening turn off the rail, gave
chase into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER saved ground. AWESOME PRINCE broke
in the air and settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened in the three path on the far turn.
