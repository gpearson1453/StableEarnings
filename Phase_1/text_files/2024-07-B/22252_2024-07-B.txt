Footnotes
COLLECTED DREAMS showed good early foot to control the early pace, raced off the inside throughout, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling.
WORRIES UNFOUNDED stalked the pace, raced two deep around the far turn, drew even near the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort.
BALENCIAGA BETTY stalked the early pace setters, raced four deep around the turn and finished willingly to the wire. LUNA AMARILLA was bumped, in
tight at the break, trailed early on after the poor start, ridden five wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position. LOKI'S LIGHTNING urged from
the inside early on and weakened through the drive. STYLE AND PROFILE raced mid pack early, was three wide around far turn and had no response.
ENKINDLE settled early on, was seven deep into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. PASSIONFORQUALITY saved ground and lacked a bid.
GREYGRAZIE broke in, bumped at the start, dropped back, lost ground through the stretch and never menaced.

ASSUME NOTHING rated along early, ridden from the inside around the far turn, split rivals three deep near the three sixteenths pole and got up late under
strong handling. ALWAYS ABOVE was bumped, shuffled back at the start, raced near the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and finished
gamely to the wire to just miss. BOLD MAJESTIC coaxed along early, raced five wide around the far turn and kept on willingly racing from the far outside.
SAVE THE KING quick to begin to set the early pace and drifted through the stretch while weakening. FLYING HOUDINI stalked the pace, raced three deep
around the far turn, took aim into the upper stretch and faded. MAGIC HEART raced four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. IRONSIDES was
off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, was four wide around the far turn and never threatened. BREAKWATER lost ground to race far back
and was eased up on in the stretch.

ARGAN quick to begin, set the early pace and built a long lead through the stretch run under steady pressure. MORNING MIRACLE tracked the early
leader, raced three wide around the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. SHORT SKIRTS stalked the pace, ridden along the inside into the far
turn and had not enough for the top pair. PURR FACTOR raced off the early pace, was three to four wide around the far turn and had no final bid. SUGAR
MOMMA was bumped soundly at the start, saved ground through the far turn and never menaced. BONITA BREEZE raced mid pack early on, saved
ground on the turn and lacked a solid bid. ANNIE'S KINGDOM failed to sustain a bid. MAS VICTORIA bumped at the start, chased from the inside and

Footnotes
CREATE TROUBLE was well rated four wide early, stalked the pace three wide on the turn and made a three wide bid off the turn and drew off to prove
much the best while being wrapped up late. FAITH'S SPIRIT set the early pace while racing off the rail, then was headed leaving the five sixteenth and
dueled for command to upper stretch, then proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the place award. TELESCOPIC was off a step slow,
then reserved early, three wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and was along for the show award late. RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW chased the early
pace and saved ground on the turn, made a mild bid leaving the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. GRAND KINGDOM was settled early and three
wide on the turn and had no response. DEUTERONOMY stalked the early pace three wide, then angled in by the seven sixteenths and was on the inside on
the turn while stopping.
