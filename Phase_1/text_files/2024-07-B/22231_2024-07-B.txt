Footnotes
BUTTERED TOAST settled outside rivals in the third flight along the backside, made a sharp move circling around horses with three furlongs to go, loomed
a menacing presence in the five path at the top of the lane and tenaciously fought down the stretch to win in a tight photo. WICKED MIAH trailed the field
after the break, saved ground through the turn, started to pass runners inside at the quarter pole, skimmed the fence straightening out for home, battled
down the stretch but was denied by the slimmest of margins at the finish line. HOT OMELET prompted the pace issue three deep in the beginning, seized
control outside to edge away for the lead with three furlongs remaining, was headed outside by the winner turning for home and finished up determinedly
with rivals on both sides to the wire but was on the losing end of a three way photo for the win. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN stalked near the rear in the early
going, commenced a rally three wide in midturn, angled out in the five path with good momentum at the top of the stretch and finished up willingly to settle
on the fringes. CHROME'S ANGEL pressed the pace between runners in the beginning, was reined back to watch the contesting duo at the half, kept even
with the frontrunner throughout the turn but was one paced down the lane and could not threaten in deep stretch. SEATTLE SIGNAL assumed command
under a snug hold at the start, surrendered the lead while on the rail with three furlongs to go, emptied out by the quarter pole and could not be a factor in
the drive to the wire. ABSOLUTE JEWEL sat alone in the middle of the pack in mid-backstretch, made little impression around the bend and could not offer
a rally through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALICIA'S KID had the lead briefly leaving the chute, then was quite content to shadow the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, was let out a notch to
cruise to the lead midway around the bend, was headed outside at the quarter pole, spurted away in upper stretch and was kept to the task to the finish line
to just hold safe at the wire. TRICKY MAGICIAN tracked the front pair while running outside horses down the backside, rallied smartly three wide around
foes in the turn, moved in to apply pressure on the leader just inside the quarter pole, was gaining in the five path down the stretch but could not reel in the
winner in time. ONE MORE BREW travelled on the rail in the back flight in the early going, waited in behind horses around the bend, was roused for more
on the fence at the quarter pole, shifted out, quickening stride in the four path between runners at the top of the lane and was full of run at the furlong
marker to be a clear but non threatening third at the finish line. COMMANDER JOE had a stalking position three deep outside foes in the third tier down the
back straight, began to go by rivals on the outside with a good turn of foot three eighths from the wire, swung out widest in the five path for the drive, battled
for the show money down the lane but settled on the fringes in the end. GHOUL (BRZ) was nested on the fence watching the front pair along the backside,
took closer order on the front two at the three eighths marker, shifted outside off the tiring early leader by the quarter pole to be in range for a share in the
three path straightening for home but failed to fire down the stretch. RACE FOR PINKS settled in the third and last flight between runners down the back
straight, offered a brief run between horses to the three furlong marker, gave way to rivals through the turn and failed to menace in the stretch drive. SEA
TO AIR was hustled after the start to emerge with the lead while on the fence at the five furlong marker, was hard ridden when passed by the winner
midway on the turn, was going in the wrong direction by the quarter pole and retreated inside by upper stretch.

Footnotes
QUEEN GYPSY broke out on the break, set the soft pace running inside foes into the first turn, was unopposed up front continuing to gallop along on the
lead down the backstretch, moved comfortably still alone upfront with no challengers in the far turn and had more to offer in the stretch when asked to hold
safe for the win when crossing the finish line. TAKE CHANCES trailed three wide on the first turn, improved slightly while outside horses down the
backstretch, was ridden for more, circling three wide passing horses at the three eighths marker, posed the main threat outside rivals straightening out for
home and closed late to best the rest for the runners up share at the finish line. HYPER AWAKENING was five wide in mid-pack on the first turn, tracked in
the second flight three deep down the backside, took closer order by the half, chased the pacesetter throughout the final turn, could not make any gains in
the stretch and faded late to settle for third money at the wire. HURRICANE GIZMO was squeezed at the start, recovered to be tucked in on the rail behind
the frontrunner in the first turn, continued in mid-division on the fence down the back straight, came under a ride inside but was not making any headway on
the leaders in the final bend and showed some willingness on the fence dueling for the place share down the lane but had to settle for a minor role in the
end. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY broke inwards on the start, stalked between horses near the rear in the first turn, could see the compact field on the rail along
the backside, could not match strides when outkicked by challengers at the three furlong pole and passed a weary foe down the stretch. BIRCH BARK
tracked the pacesetter outside in the first turn, was nudged trying to maintain forward position with rivals on both sides at the half, began to back away from
the field between rivals three furlongs remaining and folded on the fence by mid-stretch.

RUMOURS FLY raced between foes off the pace early, settled and dropped back to the rear switching out up the backstretch, advanced three then four
then five wide on the far turn, took aim and continued to rally in the stretch taking the lead about the eighth pole, edged clear under steady handling.
MOTORIN' MAGGIE bumped a rival at the start, moved forward outside runners four wide into the first turn, spurted clear by the three-quarters and was
guided in to set the pace but still off the rail, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch, kept on and got the nod for second. LADIES
RUM was between foes three wide mid-pack early, steadily dropped back heading to the far turn, was ridden along on that bend, continued about in the
same path and one-paced, angled out at the top of the stretch for room, picked it up late and finished well but just missed the place. POWAQA saved
ground along the rail while held up in behind runners late on the first turn, settled into stride for the run up the backstretch still along the rail, advanced inside
foes on the far turn, came out a bit in the stretch for room, needed more late. BRIT was a bit fractious in the gate, was bumped inward at the start and
steadied, settled at the back outside a foe then angled in a bit on the first turn bringing up the rear but still racing off the inside, began to advance willingly
outside foes four wide on the far turn coming to within range by the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort in the stretch and flattened out. ANNIA
CORNIFICIA F broke awkwardly and bumping with rivals, was ridden along soon after but lacking early speed, moved out entering the first turn racing four
wide on that bend, gained some ground on the leaders up the backstretch, dropped back still four deep on the far turn and had nothing for the drive.
STANDING STRONG was a bit keen at the start leading them to the first turn then angled in and ceded that lead to track in behind, raced on then just off
the rail about mid-pack or nearer early, dropped back on the far turn between runners and came up empty. SILVER LASSO was bumped inward into a rival
at the start, gained forward position into the first turn between runners then stalked close-up about three deep up the backstretch, was ridden to keep pace
about the five-sixteenths, faded in the stretch. SAKE AND SUSHI was bumped at the start then veered out a bit moved forward between runners to a narrow
and brief lead early on the first turn, was soon overtaken for the front-end but chased in behind, was ridden along to keep up near the three-eighths but had
no late response.

Footnotes
FABLED PRINCE patiently watched the top pair while settling on the inside down the backstretch, shifted out to quickly close in on rivals midway on the
turn, loomed boldly on the outside in the five path turning for home, was encouraged right handed at the furlong marker, found another gear late and drew
away in deep stretch. RELOAD'S REBEL kept a close eye on the front two when tracking outside down the backstretch, was urged at the three eighths
marker, chasing the frontrunner around the turn, battled stubbornly between foes down the lane, was no match for the winner late but bested others
comfortably for the runners up share at the wire. PAT'S GAMBLE was checked soon after the start, had only the other poor starter beaten along the
backside, started to mount a rally two wide outside foes at the quarter pole, angled out widest with run at the top of the lane and finished with purpose to
close in for the show money. VALYRIAN SKY took command from the start, cleared to the rail to be alone upfront at the half, set the pace while loose up top
around the bend, was clinging onto the lead with rivals closing in from the outside at the furlong marker, could not find more late and faded for a minor share
when crossing the finish line. SOONER LUNAR stalked near the rear on the rail in the early stages, made no improvement on the leaders running on the
fence through the turn and could not reach contention driving to the finish line. MUSICAL SPELL chased the frontrunner under a tight rein down the back
straight, continued to try to reel in the leader but to no avail around the bend and wilted in the two path turning for home. VALLEY VICTORY stumbled at the
break, spotted the field by many down the backstretch, could not make any progress while saving all the ground around the turn and failed to be a factor in
the stretch running.

TEMPORA got away well, settled off the intent leader stalking that one from outside, advanced willingly about three wide coming past the quarter pole,

rallying widest while no match for the winner. TAYLORMOON settled off the pace, fanned five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside then between runners
late and got show honors. MISS BOBBIT settled off the pace, angled in and saved ground on the turn, came out two to three wide in upper stretch, rallied
but was outfinished for show. HIPNOTIZADA reared at the start, was urged strongly and swiftly made the lead inside, set the pace through the turn, was
challenged and overtaken in upper stretch, came up empty late. HEKLA'S AURA was brushed at the start, settled off the pace racing three to four wide
through the turn, came out six wide for the drive, was never near enough to threaten. DIXIERIBSY brushed a foe at the start, was forwardly-positioned
stalking mid-pack three to four wide in pursuit of the leader, faded. SILVER TUNES tracked the pace from inside on or just off the rail, was empty in the
stretch.

Footnotes
VOICE FROM ABOVE was checked slightly on the start, had a stalking role in the third flight inside a rival down the backstretch, shifted out in the four path
while starting to reach for more ground when turning for home, was full of run, extending her stride smartly at the furlong pole outside of runners and got up
just before the wire in a well timed late surge. SHARP FLAME stalked in the third tier while running outside of horses along the backside, began to pick up
the bit three wide around foes when coaxed for more three furlongs from the prize, was very much in the thick of things in the three path in upper stretch,
closed in on the embattled leaders between horses at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner nearing the wire. LOOKS LUCKY TO ME was
content to watch the pacesetter just outside in the first of two turns, waited for her cue while in the second flight tracking outside, moved in to bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, battled outside for the lead in upper stretch, wore down the leader at the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the late closing rivals on
the outside in late stages of the race and settled for the show award in the end. CRAFTY OAKS took this field into the first turn, was uncontested setting a
tepid pace along the backside, was collared outside by the quarter pole, dug in stubbornly on the fence down the stretch but could not find more late and
yielded inside at the seventy yard marker. TWO SIP SALLY broke out to begin, was nestled on the rail behind the frontrunner in the first bend, settled on the
fence in the second flight down the backside, tried to shift out off the leaders for a clear lane in the drive to the wire, lacked running room in mid-stretch and
was one paced late. CANDID CANDACE could see the field while outside foes three wide on the first turn, was unhurried trailing the pack down the back
straight, showed little interest when asked on the final turn and could not get involved inside rivals down the lane.

Footnotes
ECHO SEVEN opened up soon after the start to be alone on the lead down the back straight, continued to roll along loose on the lead around the turn, was
set down with an eighth remaining, stayed on the wrong lead to the wire but held on for the front running score. HOME FOR A REST broke in on the start
bumping the inside rival, settled in mid-pack three wide on the outside of foes at the half, had to wait when stuck behind horses midpoint on the turn, quickly
burst between runners when a seam presented itself in the three path at the quarter pole, shifted out to be six wide gathering momentum in upper stretch
and came running in deep stretch, flying late but could not reel in the winner at the finish line. LADY WELLINGTON was ahead of one rival while in the four
path between foes along the backstretch, made no headway around the bend, could see the field while outside horses at the quarter pole, swung out widest
in the eight path at the top of the lane and had a strong late rally in the final sixteenth to close in and capture the show award. APRIL DE VELP was brushed
inside on the break, ran after the leader in the three path with runners on both sides along the backside, chased but to no avail the winner in upper stretch
and weakened some late to lose a couple of positions in deep stretch. SPEEDY ESSA was situated on the rail while part of the group watching the leader
down the backstretch, stalked on the fence in the third flight around the turn, shifted out three wide at the furlong marker off a tiring rival and finished up
evenly in the late stages. TATOOSONMYSOUL broke out on the start, travelled in the four path between rivals in the group of five behind the frontrunning
winner along the backside, kept pace while three wide pursuing throughout the turn but stalled in the four path by mid-stretch. FIRST ROUND PICK was
situated five deep outside rivals close to the back of the pack at the half, offered a mild run three wide midway on the turn to be in the seven path when
turning for home, could not sustain the run and made little presence in stretch drive. I'M TENACIOUS was brushed outside to begin, trailed down the
backstretch, caught up to rivals running inside midway on the turn, shifted out to the four path straightening out for home but had little to offer driving to the
wire. HOBBIE CLASS was the lead horse in the chasing group down the backside, while on the rail continued to try to gain on the winner who had it all his
own way around the bend loose on the lead and folded on the fence by the seventy yard marker. ROSIEPOSIE stalked near the rear on the rail, made little
advancement taking the shortest way around the turn and lacked a rally inside foes down the stretch. TIME TO WATCH was squeezed in tight quarters on
the start, improved between horses down the backstretch, stalked in the third flight three wide outside challengers in the turn and was hard ridden but
yielded to others on both side by the quarter pole. MY ASSISTANT travelled in midfield between runners in the three path down the back straight, was
pulled up when taking an awkward step nearing the three furlong marker and left the track via equine ambulance.
