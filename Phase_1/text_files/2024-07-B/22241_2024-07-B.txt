Footnotes
FIGHTERTOWN cleared early, was nicely rated setting the pace in the two path, spurted away under a bit of hand coaxing past the five sixteenths, came
under a solid ride soon into the lane, kept on under left handed asks leaving mid stretch, was joined from both sides in deep stretch and dug in tenaciously
to prove best. LUIGI'S SPIRIT settled in range about the four path, was under a ride pursuing three deep leaving the three eighths, shifted out a bit for the
drive, kept grinding through the final furlong to range up outside rivals and nabbed the place at the wire. SHADY MUNNI prompted the pace while saving
ground, was nudged along the stay close into the far turn, was under a fierce hand ride past the five sixteenths pursuing the winner, remained towards the
rail and challenged in deep stretch, continued willingly but was nipped for the place. YODEL E. A. WHO drifted in and bumped with GALATIANS leaving the
gate, was in a bit tight soon after, lagged back off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride from the three eighths, remained towards the rail into the
stretch, eased out some in the final furlong but could only muster up a mild run. GALATIANS , bumped at the start, regrouped and edged up behind rivals to
stalk, was under pressure past the three eighths, swung five wide for the drive but came up empty. TUBTIMSIAM angled out and edged up early, prompted
the pace three wide, was under a ride between rivals near the five sixteenths, lacked a punch soon after and weakened.

Footnotes
MOMMA'S LINO stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, secured command mid way on the far turn, quickly opened up turning for home and
was kept to her business in the drive. WHISPERING SEA , well placed along the inner rail leaving the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out to the
three path in upper stretch and rallied. SKY VICTORY , unhurried early, swung to the six path in upper stretch and showed a late move outside rivals.
ROMANTIC STORY set the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage on the far turn and weakened in the drive. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS , inside
horses most of the race, was not a factor. OLD BAY stalked the pace along the inner rail, moved to the three path at the head of the stretch and gave way.
KAMIKAZE UMAGI , no factor, raced along the inner rail in the stretch. FEELIN SO LUCKY , four deep on the far turn, gave way. BY THE GLASS , gave
way in upper stretch, was eased late.

Footnotes
SUGA STEVE settled outside a rival and off the contested early pace, responded when given his cue leaving the three eighths and commenced a run,
boldly moved up four to five wide to engage the leaders entering the lane, surged clear soon after, was given one right handed ask in mid stretch then
maintained a safe advantage while steadily hand ridden through the final sixteenth. MACLIN broke a step slow, was nudge along off the pace while saving
ground, angled out mid turn, straightened to be four to five wide in upper stretch, advanced outside pursuers in mid stretch and finished up with good
energy. DANCE FOR GREEN broke outward, corrected and attended the pace three deep, stayed on to contest the lead outside DUNPHY near the quarter
pole, continued on to give willing chase past mid stretch then faded late. FIND FAITH broke outward, corrected to flash some speed, drafted back off the
leading trio past the five eighths, raced in good position past the three eighths, entered the lane three wide but came up empty. INEVTABL CONECTION
vied inside a pair of rivals, steadied when in close nearing the five sixteenths, regrouped to chase inside runners near mid stretch then faded. DUNPHY ,
urged up between foes to gain a slim early lead, took pressure to the head of the lane then tired through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CORRECTED PEDIGREE , moved to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, was taken back to
the rail near the eighth pole, closed determinedly and was up approaching the finish. ZINGALES KING , well placed outside horses around the turn, bid for
the lead in mid stretch and hung. MILE HIGH MIRACLE set the pace, saved ground around the turn, was in the two path late and finished willingly.
MASTER MUNNINGS bumped with GALT'S PROMISE soon after the break, circled the turn three wide, angled out in mid stretch and rallied mildly. WHITE
SERIES prompted the pace outside MILE HIGH MIRACLE and weakened. VALORE saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and
failed to rally. BASIC MILES , between horses in the stretch, was not a factor. BAND TOUR , four deep on the turn, was no factor. DOWSING ROD stayed
along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. GALT'S PROMISE bumped with MASTER MUNNINGS soon after the break and trailed.

Footnotes
SUSAN'S MULE sped clear early, rated kindly while in about the two path, was guided out a bit further and set down soon into the stretch, opened up under
a solid drive in mid stretch then continued to widen while kept alert to deep stretch. STICKWITHTHECOLORS , nudged along behind a trio of pursuers into
the turn, advanced along the inner rail leaving the five sixteenth, kept on gamely though no match but was able to earn the place late. KILO ROAD broke a
step slow, recovered to edge up inside foes leaving the five eighths and stalked, eased out leaving the far turn, chased the winner three wide into the lane,
shifted out a bit for the final three sixteenths and gave way grudgingly. DEWEY DOIT came out a bit at the break and bumped with ARCH STREET, bumped
with that one as well when leaving the five eighths, pursued under a ride and between rivals departing the far turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths
and weakened. BETSY IS THE GAL lagged off the pace while saving ground and failed to menace. ARCH STREET exchanged bumps with DEWEY DOIT,
stalked four wide into the turn, failed to kick on mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
JEAN VALJEAN accelerated to the early lead, was kept slightly off the rail around the turn and through the stretch and prevailed under intermittent urging.
BIZ BIZ BUZZ , bumped and forced in by HUNTER JOE leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path around the turn, worked between horses through the
stretch and rallied. MID DAY IMAGE , bumped and forced in soon after the break, raced along the inner rail most of the trip, was well positioned in the drive
and flattened out. YES AND YES , well off the rail around the turn, chased the winner and gave way late. FIVE DREAMS circled horses on the turn, drifted
wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. SWILL stayed along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. HUNTER JOE caused a jam up at the start
when bearing in and bumping BIZ BIZ BUZZ then was outrun. MR. HUSTLE , pinched back in the jam up leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
RAINY SKIES stalked between rivals, worked outward when advancing past the three eighths, circled four wide continuing progression into the lane, drifted
in under right handed asking past the three sixteenths, came in again under right handed encouragement bothering BLUE KINGDOM with about a sixteenth
remaining then edged away late while making his way down towards the rail in the final yards. CAP COM settled off the early pace, was coaxed along
between rivals mid turn, shifted in approaching the stretch, remained inside through the drive and made a grinding run to gain the place. BLUE KINGDOM
secured the inside leaving the chute and disputed the pace to the inside of PAPPY'S REVENGE, edged clear of that one with five furlongs remaining, raced
two wide maintaining the lead into the lane, kept on under a drive in mid stretch, steadied when bothered by the winner drifting in near the sixteenth pole,
ceded to that one then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. PASSIONED , three deep chasing the pace, shifted out in upper stretch then
churned on with some interest in the final furlong. PAPPY'S REVENGE contested the early pace outside BLUE KINGDOM, stayed on and tracked after that
one cleared, had his outside threat rebuffed entering the lane, chased past mid stretch then faded. FORMAL AFFAIR edged up to the inside of rivals early
on, chased inside around the turn but came up empty. WALDRIP , four wide off the pace, failed to respond around the turn then gave way. An objection by
the rider of BLUE KINGDOM against the winner alleging interference near the sixteenth pole was not allowed. There was also a stewards' inquiry into the
stretch run. No action was taken.

Footnotes
TOM HAGEN sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail and was under constant encouragement in the drive. PRINCE KHOZAN ,
a forward factor along the inner rail throughout, rallied gamely. THE LAST SCIP raced in the two path on the far turn, moved to the three path in upper
stretch and rallied between horses. THE KING CHEEK , well placed in the two path between horses the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and
lacked the necessary rally. SAGRADA RAY chased outside the winner to upper stretch and gave way. MR MATUSCHEK lacked speed, swung to the six
path in upper stretch and failed to be a threat. B DETERMINED raced in the five path turning for home and came up empty. RARIFIED FLAIR was never a
factor. POWER BACK chased the pace outside horses, faltered in upper stretch and was eased late.
