GLOME raced two wide into the first turn and rated just off the early leaders, picked up the pace three wide around the turn, hustled along into upper stretch,
responded gamely under left handed pressure, moved up to take a slight edge at the furlong marker then finished going away. BAD BOY BRAWNY led the
way around the first turn and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of SASSY B KEEN at the quarter pole, shook free turning for
home, got collared by eventual winner a furlong out, ran on and finished clearly second best. SASSY B KEEN was forwardly placed around the first turn and
applied pace pressure to BAD BOY BRAWNY up the backstretch and into the far turn, moved up to engage rival for the lead at the quarter pole, could not
match strides turning for home, weakened off the top pair but remained clear for a share. TACTICAL REBEL was unhurried and trailed in the back through
early stages, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. BOBULINSKI saved ground around the first turn, rated off the top trio in
early stages, rode the rail around the final turn and gave way. GUNPOWDER N' LEAD was forwardly placed around the first turn and into the early
backstretch then came up empty and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MORNINGNOONANDNITE vied for the lead with OVERQUALIFIED up the backstretch, continued to match strides into the turn, took on the added
challenge of CLASSIC CASH at the quarter pole, dug in gamely and held a slight edge at the furlong marker, continued to dig in under firm pressure and
just lasted. CLASSIC CASH tracked the top pair up the backstretch, moved up to engage duo three wide at the quarter pole, continued in striking distance at
the lead at the eighth pole, dug in gamely under left handed pressure, was inching up on the leader approaching the wire and got denied by a nose.
OVERQUALIFIED dueled inside of MORNINGNOONAMDNITE up the backstretch and into the turn, took on the added challenge of CLASSIC CASH at the
quarter pole, fought back to the furlong marker then weakened and held show. STELLA BELLA chased the pace into the turn, saved ground, cut the corner
entering upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. R F FINISH LINE chased along the inside through early stages, had no response when called upon
around the turn and failed to threaten. IOWA FARMGIRL showed brief response in early stages then retreated. ART'S RED WAVE had no response.

BETTY JO rated off the pace in the opening quarter, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, roused forward into striking distance, dug in gamely nearing
the wire and got up late. SORCERER'S GIRL tracked the early leaders, picked up the pace around the turn, came three wide into the lane, vied for the lead
at the sixteenth pole then got denied in final strides. C L LEGACY raced in range through early stages, chased in contention around the turn, hustled along
four wide into upper stretch, edged into close contention, dug in between late and got nipped for place. MY MAYBELENNE raced along the outside off the
early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch, tipped a path wider in the final furlong, closed fast to the wire but was too late for serious impact. PEACH
STREET dueled for the lead up the backstretch and into the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, held clear a furlong out then yielded late. KID BIZ raced
in or near the back, swung wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. TAP ME A TEXT was ridden along racing off the early leaders, swung four wide into
upper stretch, angled in a path and failed to threaten. SCOOT ALONG raced off the pace and lacked a needed rally. EUROWENDI raced near midpack,

MOR FOXY sat back just off midpack in the opening quarter, hustled up three wide around the turn, gathered momentum under firm handling down the lane,
surged to the wire and got a nose up to win. MY FIRING LINE moved up to engage rival for the lead past the half mild marker, vied outside of CANT MAKE
ME around the turn, rival edged away on top in upper stretch, fought on gamely, moved back up, led the way approaching the wire and got nipped for the
win. CAN'T MAKE ME held a slim lead in opening stages, then took on the challenge of MY FIRING LINE late on the backstretch, vied around the turn,
shook free at the head of the lane then got caught in closing strides. SKYLAR'S FIRE pressed along the rail in the opening quarter then weakened and
chased the top pair around the turn, came two to three wide into the lane and needed more for serious impact. BIT A BAD NEWS raced in the back, saved
ground around the tune and had a mile improve. AMERICAN SUE chased in contention in the opening quarter, weakened around the turn, came five wide
into the lane and failed to threaten. CATALE raced off the early pace, edged closer along the rail late on the turn then gave way. UNGLUED failed to move

ANNUAL BUDGET raced off the top trio up the backstretch, edged closer three wide at the quarter pole, hustled along four wide into upper stretch,
sustained bid, advanced to race near the lead leaving the sixteenth pole, dueled with RAZOR WIRE in deep stretch and nipped foe on the wire. RAZOR
WIRE was forwardly placed through early stages, hustled up two wide at the quarter pole, roused forward near the sixteenth pole, dueled with ANNUAL
BUDGET in closing strides and got nipped on wire. COLORFUL NATIVE sped to the lead at the the start and held clear up the backstretch, continued to
hold firm over close running pursuers around the turn, saved ground turning for home, fought on gamely to the sixteenth pole then got collared and
weakened to show. LITTLEMORE TA KELA raced in the back, came two wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. TAP THE BRAKES raced up
close through early stages then weakened late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive. STAR OF MINE was off slow at the start and saved ground to
no avail.

Footnotes
SWEET AND EZ dueled for the lead up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free turning for home, quickly widened to a clear advantage, was
confidently handled and finished ridden out. DR. WOODS MIRACLE raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, picked up the pace along the inside at
the head of the lane, steadily gained closer contention and finished clearly second best. RUN A FIRE raced in range along the inside, chased two wide late
on the turn, came out three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on for a share. TIZ A STRATEGY raced off the early pace, hustled up around the turn,
came four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. MS BUMBLEBEE raced near mid-range, chased three to four wide into upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally. SUPINE DUCHESS dueled two wide up the backstretch, battled on with the eventual winner around the turn then gave way. FLAT
OUT LOUDER raced near midpack, chased three to four wide late on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LITTLEDABWILLDOO
raced outside off the early pace and failed to move into contention. ZOE NATION lacked early speed and never menaced. RUBY LYNN was forwardly
placed three wide up the backstretch, weakened late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
