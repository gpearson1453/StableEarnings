GAMBE FORTE set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. UNCLE WINCHESTER veered out at the start, settled
off the pace while racing within striking distance, lacked the needed late response and got up for place while no threat to the winner. MAT MATTERS was
never far back, bid willingly, hung late and settled for show. GRAND PARK VIEW was off a step slowly and crowded at the start, raced mid pack along the
inside, backed up and angled out on the turn and lacked a stretch response. SECRET SATURDAY lagged early, had an outside trip and lacked a response.
GALLANT CREEK showed speed to the turn, stopped and was not urged late.

Footnotes
SOLVING PROGRESS bumped twice at the start, set the pace, with a clear lead and widened in the drive to finish much the best. SEARCH was rated back
at the start, saved ground to the second turn, angled out, offered a mild bid to earn place while no threat to the winner. BYTHENUMBERS raced mid pack
along the inside, advanced to the far turn to get within range, had nothing left for the drive and settled for show. TOOSHAY was never far back, went widest
in the drive and lacked a bid. AMORICA bumped repeatedly at the start, put in an even effort and was transported off the track via an equine ambulance.
SWANS ISLAND was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. MUCHO MACHO MRYTLE was
through after a half in an outside trip.

effort. DUDE AFFRIGHT was pushed out at the start and showed little. MARCHIN INTO APRIL trailed the field. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NOTMYFIRSTRODEO set a pressured pace to the second turn and drew off under mild urging. LIAM'S THE GREAT pressed the pace two across to the
second turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. CRABCAKES N BEER raced in the second flight along the inside, advanced to the turn to
loom a threat, tired, dropped back and held safely for show. TUFF LUCK bumped at the start, was slow early, angled out for the drive and lacked a
response. KITTEN'S PLOY raced in the second flight, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. SOLEIL VOLANT was through early. LUCA MACHINE
veered out and bumped at the start, bore out on the first turn and was through after a half. QUAHOG REPUBLIC bumped and was squeezed at the start
and failed to threaten in an even effort.

Footnotes
DOCTOR ABBIE was unhurried early, raced outside, rallied on the turn, had the rider lose his whip, bid five wide, closed steadily and drew clear late. KISS
ME HARDY raced close to the pace along the inside, lacked room on the turn, fell back, came again, was blocked mid stretch, altered course and surged to
get up at the wire for place. FLASHNDYNAMITE was sent to the front to set the pace, fought back when headed, had the lead briefly late, was outclosed
and caught for second. PRINCIPIA stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch, faltered and lost position. BROWN SUGA
BABE raced mid pack in an even effort. WEST SIDE GIRL showed speed to the turn, tired and gave way. HONOR THE TRUTH was not a factor.

MALIBU BEAUTY pressed the pace two across to the second turn, assumed command, drew off and was kept to task. BOUND BY DESTINY raced mid
pack, saved ground to the far turn, angled out and closed well to finish second best. INTREPID DREAM was unhurried early, went six wide at the top of the
stretch and finished well to earn show. DOUBLE FIREBALL set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. DON'T TELL KELLY broke slowly,
trailed the field, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. MY THOUGHTS settled off the pace, showed speed to the second turn,
tired, stopped and was not urged late.

Footnotes
ANNIEWORKSTOOMUCH vied in the two path into the turn, put to task nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear under a drive. BIG BOLT raced off the pace
and along the inside, inched into contention around the bend, eased out in upper stretch, closed the gap willingly while racing on her left lead. FIA FIRST
vied along the inside, cut the corner at the top of the stretch, unable to match strides with outside rivals leveled off to the wire. CHELLS GIRL, bumped at the
start, started her bid leaving the three eighths pole, in striking distance in upper stretch, failed to sustain the bid through the final furlong. CITY KISS chased
the pace from between runners, under a drive around the bend, went by the faders through the stretch. BIG BOURBON BABY off to a quick start, chased
the leaders from the three path into the turn, under pressure between runners nearing the quarter pole, gave way through the stretch. VERINA tracked the
early pace from the four path, came under a drive while outside rivals around the turn, weakened through out the stretch. FINAL NOTE slow away from the
gate, never able to gain momentum.
