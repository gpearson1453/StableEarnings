Footnotes
BECKETT'S BEST away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched his bid sharply one out from the rail
entering the final turn, and closed steadily five wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. OUR BLOKE rushed to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn from the inside of his stablemate, and closed willingly two wide
in the drive and just failed to last. FRASER LANDING away well and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the
issue from the outside of OUR BLOKE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the top pair late, but proved
clearly best of the rest. QUATRE BAK unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run
down the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest three wide in the lane. NU SOUP FOR BABY
broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and had little
to offer late.

MR MORRIS away well and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, battled
through the final turn from the inside of DEAL EM, turned back that challenge leaving turn, and fended off that determinedly rival late to prevail. DEAL EM
hopped slightly at the start, and trailed the field into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, raced into a stalking trip entering the backside, tipped four
wide approaching the final turn to launch his bid, battled through the turn from the outside of MR MORRIS, and fought on determinedly three wide in the
drive to prove clearly second best. RUN RUDOLF stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, was carried four wide in the run
to the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the turn, and closed four wide in the drive to garner a share. VECTOR away alertly and tracked the
pacesetter into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backside, was unable to keep tabs on the
leaders entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. AMERICAN TSUNAMI broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing
one out from the rail, forced the issue from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, but struggled to keep tabs on the leaders entering the final turn,
and weakened over the final furlong.

PIONEER STORM KING away well and rushed up along the rail to vie for the lead entering the turn, turned back the challenge of ANOTHER LAST DANCE
leaving the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. ANOTHER LAST DANCE broke sharply and pressed the leader through the turn while racing one
out from the rail, was unable to match strides with PIONEER STORM KING entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly
second best. ANSTRUTHER lacked the early speed to contend entering the turn while saving ground at the rail, and closed with late interest from along the
inside in the stretch drive. MISS LARUE away alertly, but was devoid of early speed while trailing the field into the turn, was always well back and failed to
make an impact.

PURSUE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, launched his bid four wide
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides. PAY MY WAY away well and was allowed
to settle off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance soon after entering the
backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive, but was unable to fend off PURSUE in the final
strides. NEIGHBOR away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of BUTTONWOOD TREE entering the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip
in the run to the second turn, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, assumed command
leaving the turn, but was outfinished late in a solid effort. BUTTONWOOD TREE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
before taking control and leading the field into the second turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
was overtaken midway through the turn, and weakened late. BUZZINGA KARMA stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing under snug
restraint, held his position in the run down the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
APPREHEND broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of JUST JIMMY entering the stretch the first time, continued to press the pacesetter in
the run down the backside and through the final turn, continued their battle into the lane, but edged clear from his pace rival in deep stretch to prove best.
JUST JIMMY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of APPREHEND in
the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival in deep stretch, but finished well to prove easily second
best. BIG UNION was unprepared at the start, and still in the hands of the assistant starter when the gate sprung as he hopped in the air, tracked the
dueling leaders one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position throughout, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while
finishing three wide in the drive. ARISTOCRACY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was off a step slow and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing out from the rail, advanced smartly three wide midway
down the backstretch, continued a three wide bid entering the final turn, quickly took command soon after entering the turn and drew off as much the best.
INDYETTA away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, was quickly
overtaken shortly after entering the final turn, but battled determinedly three wide in the drive to hold the place. MISS THE HYPE settled off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, trailed the field in the run to the final turn, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and
finished full of run five wide in the drive to get up for a share. QUALITY COMMAND settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the
run down the backside, continued a ground saving trip through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive in an even effort. LUCY
TREASURE away well and stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. NO PEOPLE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of
INDYETTA entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the
final turn, and faded over the final furlong.
