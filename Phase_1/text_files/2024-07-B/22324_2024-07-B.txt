loose leader through the far turn rallying on the inside down the lane bidding gamely late. GET BY sent clear was hustled on a big lead through the far turn
wearing down between horses in upper stretch. SOMESUGARNSPICE raced evenly off the pace lacking a contending move. DONT CROSS BOUDICA
tracked evenly fading on the far turn lacking response down the lane. ARTUME was never involved. XHILARATINGPURPOSE struggled throughout. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MR HOOVER set the early pace, won driving. SCORSESE rallied second best. TRIGZ TOO chased early then weakened at some point. BULLION raced
evenly early then faded. CONGRATS THIS appeared to play no factor. RY'S REVENGE was well back in the stretch. HEAVY RAIN AND FOG OBSCURED
THE HALF THREE QUARTER AND STRETCH CALLS.
