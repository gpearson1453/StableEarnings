Footnotes
MASAI MAN stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was
steadily handled to hold on. MISTER WINSTON raced well back off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily,
eased out through the far turn, entered the stretch about the seven path and finished well while gaining on the winner. KRUG settled in the three path the
first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly to take third late yards. CLAW took over
while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and relented the
final sixteenth. DUDE AND JUMPER became edgy in the gate then saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and flattened in the lane. ALPHA CHI RHO rated close inside then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened in the stretch. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but
showed little response. BAHAMA CHANNEL was not a factor.

Footnotes
GHOST OF ALCINA settled in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn about the three
path, took the lead passing the eighth pole and drew away later yards. CUT HIM LOOSE raced with the pace through the front stretch then took the nod at
the nine sixteenths pole, raced clear at the three eighths and was pressured for more into the far turn, rounded the turn at the rail but was met entering the
stretch and flattened stride. FLORIDIFIED settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail
on the far turn, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and came along for third inside the eighth pole before flattening stride. PALACIO settled
in the four path the first turn, chased past the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn about the three path, was carried out into the lane but came back to
finish evenly. SWIPE THAT CANDY raced well back about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five
path and passed some rivals. LUZIA rated a slim early lead inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at
the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. SPARKLEINYOUREYE broke a step slow then saved ground, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but was forced out leaving the turn and weakened. JUJU ON DA BEAT saved ground.

Footnotes
CLASSY FOE set a pressured pace at mostly even terms, inched clear passing the eighth pole and was steadily urged through the lane. CARMELIZED
gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and dug in to take second the final yards. BIT OF BLESSINGS veered out leaving the gate then pressured
the pace at mostly even terms, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane but relented second the final
yards. ITSUPTOME chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. FUNNY ROAD was unruly behind the gate, gave chase outside,
rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the lane. SWISS HORIZON chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and
weakened in the lane. RUMORGOINGAROUND gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path. ORO OSCURO broke a step slow then saved
