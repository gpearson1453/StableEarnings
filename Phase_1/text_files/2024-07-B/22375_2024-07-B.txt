Footnotes
KEE JEE unhurried in the early going, moved up around the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied down the lane and proved the best.
BREAKING STAR pressed the pace, raced outside around both turns, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. RED OCTOBER
bumped at the start, racing in the back, made a late wide gain, but was no match for the top two. MO CAN DO showed early speed, forwardly placed
throughout and faded down the home stretch. MONOLITH raced in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY went
to the front, drove clear, saved ground and retreated. STRONG DIAMOND broke out, bumped rival and was never close.

DRE ME LESS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, came around the second turn on the rail, took the advantage, was all out and held on for the
win. MSCHITCHATTOUR void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide rally and finished willingly. LILY'S CREED
raced within contention, made a late rail bid, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. CARRY ON pressed the early pace, forwardly
placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. FASTED drifted out around the first turn, raced evenly near the back and was no threat. BETISON
went to the front, drove clear and was finished early. TOLATETOOWAIT always raced near the back, finished wide and was never close.

FAST MEDICINE broke a step slow, racing from the back, moved up, within contention, came around the turn wide and pulled away. SMALL TOWN
HEROINE showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. HALF AN APPLE dueled on the
front end, saved ground and tired. FRET NO MORE lacked early speed and was never a threat. MOMENT TO PREACH showed brief speed and dropped
back. LAGUNERA always raced near the back and was eased to the wire. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S DEAL unhurried in the early part, racing near the back, moved up, four wide around the turn, dueled down the home stretch and drove clear before
the wire. SAUCY GEM vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was best of
others. COUSHATTA CUTIE raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, lacked a late kick and was no match for the top two. TIZ A
BREAKUP lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. NANNY'S HOUDINI broke in, raced near the back, came around the turn on the
outside and was never a threat. QUICK BITE raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and finished evenly. SEND IT SOARING checked at the start,
forced in, racing in the back, rushed to the front, saved ground and tired.

JALOUSE raced within contention, made a late outside bid, got up late and finished well. A LIL PSYCHOTIC dueled on the front end with MRS. KATZ, put
her away, but proved second best down the lane. IM SINGLED UP void of early speed, showed late interest, but proved no match for the top two. MRS.
KATZ challenged for the early lead, saved ground and faded. STEEL GUITAR raced within striking distance in the early part, weakened and finished evenly
near the back. SIGNING always raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and was never close.

driving clear before the wire. ITS WILD AGAIN pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win and was a clear second. MOON
TRIP raced within striking distance, moved up strong around the final turn and hung on the inside down the lane. SAUCY ARGUMENT lacked early speed,
moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the lane, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ADMIRAL AFLEET void of early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. TUCKER THE GRUMP raced near the middle of the field, weakened and lacked a late bid. OUR HEATSEEKER
pressed the early pace, racing outside around the first turn and faded. MINE YOUR BIZ always raced near the back and was never a threat. IDE LIKE
