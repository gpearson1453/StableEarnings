turn and finished with interest. CONFORMIST In hand four wide early, lodged a bid along the three path into the lane and weakened. HOLY COWBOY
Checked at the start, sent out to contest the lead along the rail and tired with a furlong to go. PREPARE FOR GLORY Broke sluggishly, four wide on the

wide into the lane, altered in and finished with interest. CAMBU In hand along the rail, angled to the three path on the last turn, checked at the top of the
lane and failed to fire. BENCH PRESS Unhurried six wide, five wide on the last turn and finished wide. SHE SPEAKS WELL Unhurried along the rail,
appeared blocked nearing the quarter pole, took up sharply and tired. BIG HUTCHY Three path close up early and tired. HARDLY WORKING Tracked five
wide and then was two from the rail on the last turn. PEACEFULPERSUASION Vied early, dropped back on the last turn and was eased over the wire. A
