stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. ZORA stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through

Footnotes
EXCLUSIVE ENTRY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged and lasted under steady pressure. LAST POST well placed and
outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. FAST
LEARNER well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, evened and held the show. MR.
IMPATIENT unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for a share. NOT TODAY
GOVERNOR mid pack, gained position four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. THAT'S JUST GREAT
ran evenly for a half, holding position four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. OVERTIME CHARLIE never far back,
held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and had no rally. DUKE OF SICILY passed tiring rivals. ELUSIVE
CHANGE rushed up to track the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded the final furlonh. COCOA BANANA was no factor,
inside.
