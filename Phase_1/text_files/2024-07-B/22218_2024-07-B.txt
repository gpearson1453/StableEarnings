for winner. STRAWBERRYLEMONADE inside run to turn never far back, kept on in stretch for third. CRYSTAL SNOW tardy start, far back to the turn, wide
run to stretch, moved up. SYLLABUS saved ground throughout to no avail. ABOVE THE SKY in the mix to the turn with nothing left in the stretch run. MIRO
MOGO never a threat throughout. KACHOW tried to keep up outside to the turn, gave way in the stretch. MISS MO MESA speed between horses battled to
the turn, weakened in the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
