Footnotes
TOOTALOO KANGAROO set the pace from the inside, drew out on the turn in hand, came three wide off the bend and drew off, then was given one pop
right handed with the crop and then was flagged a few times by the sixteenth marker and then had speed to spare at the wire proving much the best.
FLAGRUNNER was off a step slow, then moved up from between rivals to chase the pace, then advanced three wide on the turn, came three wide off the
bend and finished willingly to win the place battle. DANCING CHIME tracked the early pace on the inside under a hard hold, then chased the pace on the
tirn and then was out-kicked for the place award while besting the rest. ADIOS MEISTER stalked the pace three wide and then chased the pace on the turn,
came five wide off the bend and weakened. RED BETTY chased the pace on the outside and was four wide on the turn and weakened.
PEACEOFTASTYCAKE showed brief foot two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
RAINAS ROLLIN prompted the pace two wide and then went up to vie for command by the quarter pole, sent down when straightened and took over, then
drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under mild pressure. PYROTECHNICS tracked the pace on the inside in hand, eased o0ut midway on
the turn and came three wide off the bend and made a bid, proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. DIVINE PROMISE was a bit
slow into stride, settled on the inside on the turn, angled off the inside for racing room by the furlong marker andf finsihed willingly to best the rest.
TAPESTRY COLORS chased the early pace three wide, the3n was three to two wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and had no kick. SECRET
WISPER set the pace from the inside and then dueled by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. HOP TO A DECISION was far back early and never
factored.

TUDOX OPPORTUNITY set a pressured pace in the two path, drew clear on the far turn, then came off the turn three wide and drew off to prove much the
best while being ridden out. TIME TO CRUISE stalked the pace three wide and then was between rivals on the far turn, came four wide off the bend and
proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. GENGHIS chased the pace on the outside, then made a mild move four wide on the far turn
but could not sustain that bid, held show award. WISH FOR PEACE was reserved early on the inside, then advanced two wide on the turn and then was
out-kicked for the show award. THIRSTY PAPPY was hustled early and then pressed the winner from the inside and fell back on the turn and tired in the
lane. TUNE IN chased the pace on the inside and tired.
