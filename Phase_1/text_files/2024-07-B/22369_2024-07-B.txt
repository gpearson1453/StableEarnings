TELLTALE sat in striking position while three wide, gained the advantage at the quarter pole, was under pressure through the stretch and held under a
drive. STEVIE WONDER GIRL sat just off the pace, moved up between foes nearing the five-sixteenth pole, kept pressure on the leader through the stretch
and weakened late. MACHINA trailed and bid belatedly. SINGING BELL tracked four to five wide, and lacked a closing response. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE
contested the pace from the rail, and gave way in the stretch.

THESHACK dueled on the front outside of QUINTO SOL, edged away nearing the head of the stretch, was under pressure late and held on. VICTORIA'S
CHIEF unhurried early, drove five wide at the head of the lane, closed steadily under encouragement and missed. CHASE THE SUN tracked four wide
through the backstretch, advanced outside in the final turn, closed well and weakened in the final yards. ALL RUN trailed early, swung wide at the quarter
pole, and closed gradually under urging. QUINTO SOL vied inside for the lead, dueled through the far turn inside of the THESHACK, was unable to move on
with the eventual winner and faded. HE'S A SAINT jostled leaving the gate, settled inside, roused at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. THE BEAT
attended the pace from between foes and tired early. ROCKTILLYOUDROP offered little.
