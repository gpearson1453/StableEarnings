fanned into the seven path entering the lane while being bumped from between horses and leveled off late in the drive. FOR LOVE AND HONOR raced in
the five path along the first turn, was in the eight path into the lane while no threat. KISS BLUE set the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and
gave way down the lane. STEPHANIESWARRIOR was never a factor. I AM THE SAUCE tracked the pace early on, was in the six path into the lane and
faded in the stretch. MY SEXY BLONDE was steadied off heels in the first turn.
