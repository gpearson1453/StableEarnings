Footnotes
DIGITAL WALLET broke a half-step slowly then sped clear soon after the start, set the pace from off the rail, drifted out leaving the turn, spurted clear of all
pursuers again and held safe. BURNINGDAYLIGHT chased from outside four to six wide, kept on to gain the place while no threat to the winner.
MITOLEMYBELLE pursued the eventual winner up close three to five wide, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, was outfinished for place. PARK IN THE DARK
was off the pace four to five wide on the turn, angled out nine deep in upper stretch, kicked on mildly. STEPMONSTER was forwardly-positioned, chased
from inside on the turn, failed to rally in the stretch while switching outside a foe in mid-stretch. TAMMY MACHO was off the inside three to four deep and
well back of the leaders through the turn, was never near enough to threaten. ZAPPIN broke a step slowly, was caught outside foes five to seven wide
through the turn and wider still for the drive, was unable to threaten the top ones. EXPRESS MONEY broke awkwardly and slowly, was at the back off the
inside and never a threat. LIGHTNING GIRL chased mid-pack between early, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
COYSTER was taken back and angled in early, saved ground on the turn biding time, shifted seven to eight wide once in upper stretch, rallied and surged
late to prevail. NUMEROLOGIST exchanged bumps at the start, settled off hte pace and in the four to six path, swung out eight to nine wide in upper
stretch, rallied well while widest but was only second best. BIG CREED prompted the pace from outside dueling three then four wide through the turn and
entering upper stretch, contended between foes at the three-sixteenths, had no extra for late stretch. TEE ROY shifted in, saved ground on the turn in
behind runners, advanced along the rail, drifted out a bit leaving the turn while bidding for the lead at the top of the stretch, fought on till late stretch but head
no extra. PHANTOM MAC was lightly bumped after the start, raced close up and outside on the turn five wide, floated seven deep into upper stretch within
striking distance but could not rally. WIND RIVER was urged from the break, set a pressured pace racing off the rail, was overtaken by the top of the stretch
and came up empty. BUFFETT bumped with a foe at the start, was up close four wide on the turn, faded in the stretch.

FASTTRAINTOTEXAS exchanged a light bump at the start, set the pace racing off the rail, entered the turn in the two path, drifted out a bit leaving that
bend, held sway under steady handling. D D S EXPRESS chased from outside racing up close, moved in from six to five wide on the turn, kept on in the
stretch but was only second best. SNAPP DADDY settled off the pace, saved some ground near the rail on the turn coming out late on that bend, moved
back in near mid-stretch, ran on to be best of the rest. AZTEC SUN chased from inside racing just off the leader, lacked the needed ltae kick. DINI DICE
chased initially five wide between runners then four wide on the turn, failed to rally. COMPELLING UNCLE was urged at the break but lacking speed, angled
out at the top of the stretch, failed to threaten. OM FIRE chased three to four wide, was eased then pulled up in the stretch, was transported off of the track
via equine ambulance.

NO REGRETS N LOVE pressed the early pace, raced five wide into the turn, took control mid stretch and edged clear. PRETTY PEPPY was allowed to
settle from the inside, was closing late and finished second best. LIL MISS CASSIE set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, weakened late
and held for third. DELIA was taken back early, raced three wide through the turn and finished belatedly. OUR SOARING ANGEL tracked the early pace,
raced six wide through the turn and was empty. MOONLIGHT WARRIOR was void of any early speed, raced seven wide and offered no late rally.
