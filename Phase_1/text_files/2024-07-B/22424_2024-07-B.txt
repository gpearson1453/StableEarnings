late stages and was taken in hand nearing the wire. MAGICGIRL set a pressured pace along the inside and finished second best. CHARGINA pressed the
pace two wide into the stretch, was in tight between rivals before the furlong marker, steadied a bit then was outfinished. CHERU trailed into the turn and
found her best stride late six wide. SKY went evenly. SCOOP THERE IT IS had good early speed along the inside, was righted entering the turn then faded.

GEH SCHNELL never far back, closed willingly inside rivals into the stretch, dug in under left handed urging late and got up in the final strides. KLAATU set
the pace along the inside for nearly a half, was headed, kept pressure to the quarter pole, regained the advantage, set the balance of the pace in the while
drifting to the five path and just missed hanging on. OPEN OUT well placed, went evenly. CANDY CRUSHEM failed to menace. LEXATOGA was no threat.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN pressed the pace two wide for a half, gained a narrow lead, set the pace to the quarter pole then came up empty.
