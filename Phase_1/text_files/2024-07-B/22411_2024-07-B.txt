Footnotes
KITTY ON FIRE broke best from the inside, ran straight and true under steady handling and increased the margin through the final furlong as much the best.
PAINT BIG DREAMS broke awkwardly to the inside then veered out and made light contact with THE PERFECT GIRL 2 a few strides from the gate, ran
well once straight, finished well for second while no match for the winner. LOUIE narrowly avoided contact with PAINT BIG DREAMS at the break, came
away alertly and was close to the winner to the halfway point but was outfinished for second in the late stages. THE PERFECT GIRL 2 bumped lightly with
PAINT BIG DREAMS at the break then shied from SULTAN coming into the path in the initial strides, was close up to the furlong pole then was unable to
keep up late. SULTAN broke slowly, was quickly far behind and never a factor.

Footnotes
AUTISM RESILIENCE showed good early speed away from the start, engaged with BIG CROWD and contested the decent pace outside of that runner,
dueled into the turn, shook free into the stretch and opened the lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and was hand urged to
the finish for a convincing win. BEACHLEY was crowded leaving the start and broke a bit slowly, rushed up to chase the decent early pace, raced widest
into the turn and chased four wide nearing the quarter pole, made a sustained rally into the stretch, could not impact the winner into the final sixteenth and
bested the rest. PLAY MISTY CAT broke alertly and vied for the early lead inside of a pair of rivals, ceded the lead then tracked three wide nearing the
half-mile marker, got caught in tight while between runners approaching the turn, took up at the three-furlong pole and was carried four to five wide along the
turn, recovered and swung widest into the stretch, was full of run into the final sixteenth and was a clear third. RETINA VIBRATING chased the decent early
pace from the inside, was guided to the outside along the bend and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch
drive and weakened. BUCKY'S DREAM was forwardly placed away from the start, chased the decent early pace from between rivals and was rank nearing
the half-mile pole, chased between rivals approaching the turn, was hard to place entering the bend, drifted to the three path and bothered a rival leaving the
three-eighths, dropped back heading to the top of the stretch and could not come up with a late response. BEDOWNTOMESSAROUND raced close up to
the decent early pace, got caught in tight in the opening furlong and checked approaching the half-mile, was guided to the inside and chased from the rail
heading to the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch and gave way. BIG CROWD showed good early speed while between rivals leaving the
start, pressed the decent early pace inside of AUTISM RESILIENCE, kept close attendance to that runner into the turn and disputed the pace heading to the
quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
POKER ALICE broke well and seized the lead going into the first turn when no one else took the initiative, was left alone allowed to dictate very slow
fractions, led a compact field to the far turn then quickened passing the seven-sixteenths pole, put a little distance on the field through the turn and won
clear under steady handling. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS was not asked for speed from the break, kept to the inside and near the rear of the field but not far
off the leader in a very compact field, launched a bid from the three furlong marker, tipped out four wide into the stretch and rallied under strong handling
and intermittent urging to get up for the place. SUPER ELLIE came away in good order and raced inside just behind POKER ALICE under a stiff hold with
no interest in contesting the early lead, kept to the inside and kept to task to earn the third placing. BROOKYS GAL raced in the two to three path through
the first turn just behind the leader and with SUPER ELLIE to the inside, maintained position down the backstretch then came under a drive when POKER
ALICE started to slip away, looked to get to the outside but was blocked from doing so, finished evenly under steady handling but could not improve.
MASTERY KAT hustled from the gate but was unable to get over and went four wide through the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run down
the backstretch, advanced into contention heading into the far turn and went three wide under a drive, moved into second at the head of the stretch but had
trouble changing leads, and was passed for a minor award in the final yards. VULIN came away from the gate last, went two wide through the first turn and
was at the back of the field through the first turn but not far from the front, came under heavy pressure near the three furlong pole but did not quicken,
continued to be kept to task under a stiff drive but could not improve. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN broke well, vied for the early lead then assumed command and set a pressured pace outside of a rival heading to the half-mile marker,
shook free approaching the turn and showed the way to the quarter marker, raced in hand into upper stretch and widened the lead nearing the furlong pole,
was kept to task into the final sixteenth and won geared down in deep stretch. LUSMA got caught in tight leaving the start and was shuffled back in the early
stages, was allowed to settle heading to the half-mile marker, advanced approaching the turn and chased two wide into the bend, shifted three wide at the
quarter marker then encountered traffic into upper stretch, altered course to go widest at the furlong marker, could not impact the winner into the final
sixteenth but ran on with good late interest to be best of the rest. READY TO GIG chased the solid early pace from between rivals, was steered to the rail
entering the turn and ran in pursuit heading to the quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch was outrun at the furlong marker, stayed on into the final
sixteenth and just held for third at the wire. SWIFT NONNI was prominent away from the start, elected to settle just off of the solid early pace and stalked
from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed into the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the
stretch and faded in the final furlong. TAMANTARI tracked the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter
marker, swung widest into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. KRISTIN LEE rated off of the solid early pace while not far back, tracked the
leaders from the outside and went three to four wide into the turn, shifted out and chased five wide nearing the top of the stretch and could not muster a late
rally. CONQUEST SECRET went up to dispute the solid early pace inside of TIGER QUEEN, was guided outside of that rival approaching the turn and
chased the pace two to three wide and between rivals nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WRONG DIRECTION tracked two wide just to the outside of IT AINT OVER through the first turn, went into a drive near the seven-sixteenths pole, did not
respond at first then started to run on after passing the quarter pole, raced between horses in a four-way battle down the stretch, was kept to task, surged
near the wire and got a nose down just in time. BROTHER O' BRIEN went three wide through the first turn tracking mid-pack in the tight field, continued the
same path down the backstretch, then started a forward move after passing the half-mile pole, loomed three wide past the quarter pole, pulled even on the
outside of four horses contending at the furlong marker, continued to finish strong under steady handling and got a share of the top prize. IT AINT OVER
inherited the lead with none of the quintet showing much interest in leading early, led the field down the backstretch with the rest evenly spaced behind, was
still going well in hand on the lead then was set down from the quarter pole, held a short lead in mid-stretch while beset by challengers inside and outside,
finished gamely between horses and lost a heartbreaker at the wire. CROWN MAGIC kept to the inside through the clubhouse turn, continued up the rail
through the turn, finished with relentless determination but game up a bit short in a blanket finish. ZEN STATE was last away and trailed the field through
the first bend, was unable to make up any ground through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and chased the rest to the finish. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY tracked the early pace from outside of rivals, raced widest into the backstretch run and was close up to the modest pace heading to the
half-mile marker, stalked three to four wide into the far turn, was roused into the stretch, battled BIG FLAME approaching the furlong marker and took a
narrow lead at mid-stretch, dueled under right-handed urging into the final sixteenth, took the slimmest of leads in deep stretch and determinedly outlasted
the game runner-up. BIG FLAME was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace outside of MOVIETIME then went up to prompt that rival into
the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the modest pace heading to the half-mile marker, pressed the pace between runners into the far turn, vied for
the lead into upper stretch and battled between runners nearing the furlong grounds, dueled SEA OF LIBERTY into the final sixteenth, just missed for the
win and was clear of the rest for second in a game effort. MOVIETIME asked for early speed leaving the start, assumed command into the first turn and set
the pace while off of the rail into the backstretch run, set modest fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, led into the far turn and was challenged at
the quarter marker, overtaken into upper stretch, stubbornly battled inside of the top pair approaching the furlong marker, was outfinished in deep stretch
and was a clear third in the end. J T'S WATCH was fractious in the gate, broke a bit slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the first
turn, was content to trail into the backstretch run, improved position two wide into the far turn, made a mild gain into the stretch, could not sustain his run into
the final sixteenth and flattened out in the late stages. GORDY'S BOY broke alertly leaving the start, ceded the early lead and settled into the first turn while
not far back, saved ground through the backstretch run, was well placed nearing the far turn and saved all of the ground heading to the quarter marker,
could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

HOT CHICKS ONLY broke out at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, recovered and stalked the solid early pace three deep heading to the half-mile
pole, was well placed approaching the turn, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command at the
furlong pole, drew clear under mild urging into the final sixteenth and pulled away in the late stages. MARK LOVES ANN hard sent leaving the start,
assumed early command and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed good speed into the turn and set a pressured pace nearing the
quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch and chased HOT CHICKS ONLY approaching the furlong grounds, was not able to match strides with the
winner into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch for second. NOVINOPHOBIA was crowded at the start and broke a bit slowly, recovered to track
the solid early pace four deep nearing the half-mile marker, chased while widest into the turn, went four to five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and just missed for second. PARTY WITH PADDY broke alertly, vied for the early lead then ceded to
MARK LOVES ANN and pressed that rival through solid fractions heading to the half-mile marker, contested the pace between runners into the turn, battled
into the stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and faded in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video

Footnotes
ELCONDOR showed good speed away from the start and assumed early command, ceded the lead to ALMANERA and pressed the pace inside of that
runner heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and stalked the moderate pace approaching the quarter pole, drew to even terms with
ALMANERA into upper stretch, repelled that rival at the furlong marker and was kept to task while leading into the final sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch
and held at the finish for a determined win. ALMANERA (IRE) broke a step slowly leaving the start, was hustled in the early stages and assumed command
heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace outside of ELCONDOR approaching the turn, shook free along the turn and set the pace nearing the quarter
pole, was confronted by ELCONDOR and was overtaken by that rival into the stretch, battled to the furlong marker and was repelled at mid-stretch, hounded
ELCONDOR into the final sixteenth but was kept at bay in the late stages and was a clear second. JERRY JEFF WALKER took back in the early stages and
was unhurried approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, shifted two wide for the drive and
continued his bid at mid-stretch, finished well into the final sixteenth and was a clear third. AMANOFMYSTATURE rated off of the solid early pace while not
far back, saved ground into the turn, ran evenly into the stretch and lacked a rally in the late stages. DUPLICATION tracked the solid early pace from the
second flight, chased three wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not offer a late
response. REFI NOW tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased from the outside along the turn, went four to five wide into the stretch and
could not muster the needed late response. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.
