Footnotes
ARTHURIAN pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, challenged entering the stretch and drew off
from there, in command at the wire. SECESSION led the way on the outside early, saved ground around the bend and was no match for the winner in the
stretch but kept on to the finish from there. BALADINE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, stalked the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. MALIGATOR bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, trailed the field up the
backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and never threatened. A P BLAZING GREEN settled in the middle of the pack on the inside
early, came around the bend in the three path and faded in the lane. OSCAR NOMINEE raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in
the two path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
HANDSOFFTHEGOODS raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to get up for the win late. SLAVA UKRAINI raced in the three path around
the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second turn and dug in gamely in the lane but
narrowly missed. ROCKET HOTSHOT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in the
three path and improved position in the stretch. JET FLIGHT raced in the five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came
around the far bend in the five path and showed no kick. ITWASTHISBIG raced in the two path early, dueled between horses up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. MR FROST saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
