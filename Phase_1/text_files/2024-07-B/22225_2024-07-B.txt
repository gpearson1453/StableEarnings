Footnotes
EVERYDAYISAGIFT lunged leaving the gate but quickly picked up the chase, entered the turn near the rail, angled three wide entering the stretch and dug
in to take over later yards. BREAKING BULLET stalked the early pace then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on
the turn, dueled for the nod approaching mid-stretch but was caught flattening stride later yards. LOVELY LUCY chased outside through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the five path and finished well while taking third later yards. TWO STEP SALLY gave chase toward the outside, raced in the four
path on the turn and flattened in the lane. J J'S JOY rated a slim early lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested even
terms at the rail on the turn, gave up the lead while weakening toward mid-stretch, pulled up sore past the wire and was vanned off.

and ran evenly in the lane. BLUSHING BIP BOP chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and flattened in the lane. GREY

MALEKES MAGIC took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the head of the lane
but dug in under steady encouragement to recover the advantage mid-stretch and inched clear at the wire. LITTLE RICHIE saved early ground then gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn about the four path then dug in through the lane and took second the final
stride. YAREAKH stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and closed to a brief lead at the rail toward the head
of the lane, but gave up the lead mid-stretch and was nipped from second the final stride. COLONIAL ROAD settled in the three path the opening turn,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, but could only improve her position. FAPPIANO HALO came away a
step slow and was forced out into the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little in
the lane. GETTIN SPICY stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and remained a factor in the three path on the
far turn, but weakened in the lane. COLD CASH drifted into the opening turn then gave chase into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened in the lane.

SNOWY JUBA CAT drew clear while angling in and rated the early pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled to hold on well. LITTLE BIT OF THAT became fractious in the gate, gave early chase inside, rounded the turn about the three path then
dug in to take second the final strides. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE checked on the chute then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened late yards.
SULTRY SALLY H chased outside, rounded the turn in the five path and showed little in the lane. SHUTUPN'KISSME gave chase to no avail. VALID
REASON was eased shortly after the start but loped to the wire. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, claims of foul against the rider of Snowy Juba Cat
for alleged interference leaving the chute, lodged by the riders of Little Bit Of That and Delightful Breeze.

TIDBIT stalked the early pace from the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took over two deep approaching the head of the lane, dug in under
steady handling and held on well. EIGHT OZ MOCHA raced in the four path the opening turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path and dug in to clear second late yards. FEATHER WISH raced with the early pace then dueled clear toward the three
eighths pole, was met at the rail approaching the head of the lane and flattened stride mid-stretch. WAC IS FAST dwelt at the break and raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then angled out into the lane and showed little further. LOVE
NOTION rated just off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in
the lane. HIDDEN RIVER saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. GET LOADED raced with the early pace inside,
gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.
