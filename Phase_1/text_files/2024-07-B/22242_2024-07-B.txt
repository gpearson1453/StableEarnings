pace, chased two wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and missed for third. VINGATIVA raced two wide off the pace, then between rivals, chased three wide
on the far turn and failed to threaten. ANADOR (FR) tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and weakened. INSTINCTIVE raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. MERCY MERCY raced three wide off the pace between rivals on the far turn and did not factor. MYSTIC DREAMS trailed the field
