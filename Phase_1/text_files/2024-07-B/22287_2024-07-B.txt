Footnotes
PONCHO ATTACK tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
kicked clear in the stretch. NAGY AND DA BEARS led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and chased on
from there. BLACK RUSSIAN raced off the pace early, saved ground around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground late. SHTARKER
raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position
in the stretch. LEGENDARY PHANTOM pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and gave way in the
lane. JAKES CHANNEL raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and made no bid. CUPID'S WAR
stalked the leader on the outside early, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane. LORD BLOCK trailed the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and was never a factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
MOVE IT BABY chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground late to get up for the win. GET THE
CANDY led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and dueled to the wire to get caught in the final
strides and just miss. COVENANT LADY raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, continued around the turn in the two path and gained ground
late. CHROME ATTACK raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and
flattened out in the stretch. FROSTED ECLAIR raced off the pace through the opening stages, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and
improved position in the lane. SHE'S WANDAFUL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path
and finished evenly. TAPERINEA was squeezed back and took up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the five path
and never threatened. RAMBERT stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired from there.
LIPLINER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the bend from the four path and faded in the stretch.
