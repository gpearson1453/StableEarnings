MO HAIR SAM tracked the pace early on from the inside, shifted into the four path entering the lane, rallied and made a bid down the lane, edged clear in
the final stages. FIRMANTOWN tracked the pace early on while two wide, swept past the leaders three wide entering the lane, inched clear nearing the
eighth pole but yielded late in the drive. STASHU dueled early on while two wide, was in the two path into the lane and weakened in the stretch run. MR.
COLOSSAL was a tad slow at the break and raced back early on, was in the five path entering the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive.
PREYATHOUSANDWORDS dueled early on from the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch. HANK HILL was never a
factor. MENDELLO was through after a half. RULOOKINFORRAYRAY was a tad slow at the start and done early.

Footnotes
RECKER POINT stalked the early trio, made a three wide entering the lane, was under a long drive down the lane and edged past the leader in the final
stages. CAN'T HUSH THIS pressed the pace early on from between horses, was in the two path into the lane, inched ahead down the lane under a long
drive but gave in during the late stages. UNDERHILL'S TAB raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in
the late stages. FLOKI'S FLIGHT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. GILMORE was in the five path into
the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. WINTERS LION slightly hopped at the start, raced in the two path into the lane and improved position late in
the stretch. INVULNERABLE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. FORT WARREN tracked the pace
early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and faded in the stretch. ETHEREAL ROAD was never a factor.

stalked the pace early on from between horses, was asked under a full drive nearing the lane, raced in the three path into the lane and was no match for the
winner in the stretch run. AMERICAN BAND chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. PISTOL chased the
pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. SECRET STATEMENT tracked the pace early on three wide, was in
the four path into the lane and faded down the lane. ALTERED SHOT was a tad slow at the start and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
DASHMAN tugged between horses approaching the first turn to achieve stalking position two wide and between horses, loomed a danger outside of the top
pair and from the for path turning for home, bid at the quarter pole, led entering the lane, drove clear, shifted in and held sway. AK SAR BEN DERBY
bobbled outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground pursuing from midpack, came under urging around the far turn, slipped through inside of
rivals in upper stretch to bid for place, sparred with an outer pair for that position through the late stages and gamely prevailed. CLOUDY HOLIDAY laid
unhurried along the inside, awaited racing room briefly nearing the lane, smoothly shifted out to split foes four wide at the furlong grounds, dueled for place
between a pair of rivals through the late stages but missed. THE DOVER SPECTER pursued from midpack tucking to the three path into the first turn,
fanned out to the six path entering the lane, ran on to vie for place with an inner pair in the late stages but was denied. ENGLISH CHUNNEL laid off of the
pace in the two path, chased between horses entering the lane, encountered mild traffic nearing midstretch, then split foes, stayed on and edged a minor
placing. BOMB CYCLONE prompted the leader from the three path, vied into and around the far turn, but got outkicked by an outer challenger entering the
lane and yielded between horses. FRENCH BREAD stalked along the inside, tipped out entering the lane before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, but
gave way between horses. REDEMPTION SPEIGHT was wrangled back between horses early on, settled off of the pace three wide, was roused four wide
turning for home before floating to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. REMARKABLE MO was bumped by an inner rival at the start, showed
the way inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one while remaining a path off of the inside around the far turn, got headed by a wider challenger entering
the lane and faded between horses in upper stretch. AWOL was bumped by an inner rival and steadied at the start, trailed two wide, encountered traffic
three wide and between horses entering the lane, and made little impact. SON OF A MAN leaned out, shied and steadied at the start, got keen into the first
turn before settling to stalk outside of the top pair and from the four path, applied mild pressure down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn and
quickly faltered.
