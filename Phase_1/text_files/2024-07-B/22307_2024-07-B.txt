STROLLNTOTHEMARKET settled in good position sitting off the embattled pair in early stages, edged closer three wide late on the turn, given cue entering
upper stretch, responded willingly, poked a head in front at the furlong marker then finished going away. STROLLIN NORMAN B raced in the back and
saved ground, angled out around the turn, came five paths wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and got a nose up for place. ROCKIN BOOTS
rated off the early pace, saved ground along the rail on the turn, angled out three wide in upper stretch, roused forward and got nipped for place.
SKALKAHO vied outside of KILLIAN for the lead in opening stages and continued to match strides into the stretch, got headed by the eventual winner at the
furlong marker and gave way. CINCO DE MO raced off the pace, edged a bit closer late on the turn, hustled along four wide into stretch and failed to
respond. KILLIAN vied inside of SKALKAHO in early stages, battled on into stretch, was no match when the winner took a slim lead a furlong out and
weakened.

DESERT GAL vied for the lead with SC SKYLARS EMPIRE in opening stages, then set a pressured pace around the turn, hustled along two wide entering
the head of the lane, edged ahead to a length lead, raced under pressure, dug in gamely, turned back bids and held firm. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY settled
off the leaders in early stages, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner and advanced into strong contention, could not reach the game winner but
sustained bid and held place. S C SKYLARS EMPIRE vied for the lead in opening stages then weakened off the top pair, chased around the turn, launched
a three to four wide rebid at the head of the lane, responded, edged closer late and just missed place. BREATHTAKING FOLLY forced the pace in the
dearly going, continued to apply pressure to the eventual winner around the turn, ran on to mid-stretch then gave way. AZTEC EMPRESS raced off the
early pace, swung four wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.

DON'T FLY STAND BY rated off the top trio in early stages, edged closer along the rail late on the turn, slipped through a narrow opening racing two wide at
the head of the lane, then took the inside position, dueled for the lead into the final furlong, dug in gamely, took a slim lead and held firm. F B I BOB sat off
the top two leaders late on the backstretch, launched a four wide bid entering the head of the lane, vied three deep a furlong out, could not match strides
with the winner but stayed on gamely. MAVERAMA was forwardly placed racing off the early leader, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, vied two
wide between rivals at the eighth pole then yielded late. DRAW YOUR BOW was stubborn to load, lacked early speed and raced in the last flight, hustled
along four wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. WAR ECHO sped to the lead at the start and set the pace into the turn, saved ground along
the rail, took on challengers at the head of the lane, briefly got in tight along the inside then steadily faded. KING OF SWING lacked speed, came two wide
into the lane and never menaced.

OUR LAST CHANCE sped to the lead at the start and led the way along the inside into the turn, repelled the bid from TRIPULANTE past the quarter pole,
saved ground entering the upper stretch, turned back the bid from DIAMOND CITY past the furlong marker and kept on gamely. DIAMOND CITY tracked
the pacesetter through early stages, edged closer late on the turn, launched a three wide bid entering the head of the lane, raced in striking range a furlong
out then failed to be a match for eventual winner but kept on for place. OUR CORNERSTONE raced in range along the inside, cut the corner entering the
upper stretch, lacked a clear path, angled out three wide and finished with good response. TRIPULANTE tracked the leader up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge OUR LAST CHANCE at the quarter pole, could not move on with the eventual winner but ran on then weakened in the final furlong. PEACE DOG
rated in range racing two wide up the backstretch, came under a ride two wide mid-way around the turn, shifted out wider for the drive, continued under firm
handling but had no response.

Footnotes
GARBO SPEAKS raced up close three wide in opening stages, dueled three deep past the half mile marker and around the turn, battled on with ANCHORS
AND SPURS into the final furlong, took a slight edge at the sixteenth pole, fought on gamely and just lasted. NATUSIA was unhurried and raced in the back,
saved ground around the turn, angled out a path in upper stretch and moved into contention, tipped a path wider, surged gamely to the wire and got denied
by a nose. SWEET STROLL raced inside of rivals in the second flight, rode the rail around the turn, given cue along the inside at the head of the lane,
steadily inched up into striking distance, dueled in closing strides, dug in gamely, just missed and finished on equal terms with CLIMB TO GLORY for show.
CLIMB TO GLORY was allowed to settle through the early going, edged closer late on the far turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, gathered
momentum under a drive, steadily inched up closer to the wire and narrowly missed while finishing on equal terms with SWEET STROLL for show.
ANCHORS AND SPURS raced in striking distance along the rail in opening stages, dueled for the lead past the half mile marker around the turn, continued
to battle on gamely into stretch run then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. HARD SPIRITS raced off the early pace, failed to advance when called
upon around the turn, came three wide into the lane and never threatened. CONFETTI BETTY led the way in opening strides then quickly came under
pressure, dueled between rivals through the backstretch, battled on into the turn then came up empty past the quarter pole and retreated.
