DRILL BABY DRILL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, and drew clear in the lane as much the best. B C CHRISTIE stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,

early pace from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn,
and finished three wide in the drive to just miss the place. VISENYA broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, continued to chase the leader into the final turn, but needed more when called upon. E Z TONIGHT away well and stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

WIRLY GIRLY broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of LICORICE entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow lead into the lane, and inched clear late to prove best. LICORICE away alertly and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of WIRLY GIRLY in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was
unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, but finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to hold on for the place. LOLA M away well and
tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn,
shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly while unable to improve her position. B C CHU CHU tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, loomed a danger three wide approaching the final turn, but needed more over the final furlong.

TIME TICKER unhurried early, and settled well behind the pack entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the filed in the run
down the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, swept to the lead straightening for home, and drew clear late. CURLIN ROCKS
away alertly and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his trip in the run down the backside,
rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished well four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. WISELY PLAYED broke

FOREVER SUMMER away well and pressed the pace from the outside of CHABI entering the backstretch, continued to battle with that rival into the final
turn, took control leaving the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. STILETTOS ONLY away alertly and stalked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily five wide in the drive to get up for
the place late. NUMAANY'S CANDY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, and closed evenly two out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. NOZOMI broke inwards in the opening strides, before rushing up
along the inside approaching the first turn to gain a tracking trip entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot. CHABI raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside
of FOREVER SUMMER in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival midway
through the turn, and faded in the late stages. RICHIE'S DREAM unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an
impact.

Footnotes
DREAMING D'ORO stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly two out from the rail in deep stretch to get up in time. ANNIKA'S SONG away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of
SAILINGFORTHESTARS in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle two wide through the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the
turn, and just missed following a stretch long battle. NU BLEND settled off the contested early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backside,
launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. WEEKENDINDELMAR away
well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
evenly three wide in the drive. SAILINGFORTHESTARS broke sharply and vied for the lead from the inside of ANNIKA'S SONG in the run down the
backstretch, continued to set a pressured pace through the final turn, but was outfinished late. BABY I'M A STAR unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, rallied along the inside from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. FEBRUARY tracked the
dueling leaders three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
STANFORD NORTH broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
maintained his advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. RICK'S DANCER tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly along the inside through the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the lane to finish on even terms
with BARBERRY BANDIT. BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the lane to finish on even terms with RICK'S DANCER. GREYTOGO scrambled in the opening
strides while off to an awkward start, and settled well off the early pacesetter entering the backside, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the
final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn, and was gaining late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. RANCHO RED away well and stalked the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide approaching the final turn, but needed more late when
called upon. SILARONE stalked the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied
two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ATOMIC HAZE unhurried early while trailing the field
into the first turn, was always well back and never a factor.
