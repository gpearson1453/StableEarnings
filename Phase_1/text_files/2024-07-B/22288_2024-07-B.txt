OVERWISH saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, found room inside TACTICAL JOKE to take command near the eighth pole then drew off under
urging. DIAMOND SUE raced in the two path between horses around the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside horses in
mid stretch and finished willingly. TIRUPATI prompted the pace outside TACTICAL JOKE bid for the lead in the three path between horses in mid stretch
then gave way. TACTICAL JOKE set a pressured pace along the inner rail, moved over in mid stretch and gave way. PLOY , four deep on the turn, chased
the pace to the stretch then steadily retreated. DARK PRINCESS , in the three path chasing the pace to the turn, gave way. BANDBOX LEGACY trailed.

Footnotes
WATCH ME DISAPPEAR sped clear soon after the break, was nicely rated towards the inside, responded when asked two wide in upper stretch, kept on
under under left handed asks past mid stretch and was unwavering to the wire. LITTLE JOSIE WALES stalked off the inside into the turn, dropped in
towards the rail around the turn, moved up to take aim in mid stretch, kept on with good effort but was denied through the final sixteenth. BULLOCK , off
slowly after leaning in and hitting the gate, brushed with an inner rival soon after, regrouped and advanced outside horses nearing the turn, tracked the
winner into the lane, shifted out four wide and gave hard chase past mid stretch but came up empty in the final yards. MELIPONINI BEE , brushed at the
break, settled in range while off the inside, shifted five wide in the drive and offered a mild rally. PRINCESS PALMER , taken to settle off the pace, raced
two to three wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious rally. BOH'S N O'S drafted back between foes early on, came three to four wide for the drive but
failed to generate a run. SWEET FACTOR broke inward, corrected and saved ground but failed to menace.

Footnotes
BAND CAMP broke outward and brushed with a rival, corrected then rated back off foes to settle, angled out and was put to some asking leaving the far
turn, cruised up four wide outside rivals into the stretch, forged past MY LAST MISSION nearing the eighth pole and eagerly drew away under a steady
hand ride. MY LAST MISSION displayed sharp speed when coaxed from the the gate, took outside pressure into the turn, spurted clear under a light hold
leaving the three eighths, came off the rail for the drive, was no match for the winner in mid stretch but continued with some effort to preserve the place.
CURLIN'S MALIBU settled in the clear and off of contested pace, angled four wide approaching the stretch and churned on past fading rivals. MOSLER
TIME , brushed at the break, corrected and was perched three wide just outside the leaders, was under pressure pursuing MY LAST MISSION past the five
sixteenths, lacked a kick leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. BACKNTHEWOODS saved ground stalking the pace, was urged along nearing the
lane and weakened. MISTER AGENT , brushed at the start, quickly moved to contention, disputed the pace outside MY LAST MISSION near the half mile
marker, failed to keep pace with that rival departing the three eighths and tired.

Footnotes
LEVISA , outside horses down the backstretch, moved to the two path on the turn, sprinted clear in mid stretch and lasted. TRUE SUNSHINE , three wide
chasing the pace around the turn, closed to reach contention late and hung between rivals. VIROLOGIST raced between horses on the turn, swung to the
six path in upper stretch and closed outside foes. BEATIFUL KARLA , sent soon after the break, hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace and faded in the
drive. AT FIRST SIGHT bumped with SHEHERHERS leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in the stretch and failed menace in an even effort.
SHEHERHERS bumped with AT FIRST SIGHT leaving the starting gate, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch and weakened. ALWAYS
FORWARD circled foes on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA , along the inner rail most of the
race, was no factor. DESTINED TO DANCE , outrun, drifted wide turning for home. PER RULING ECM2024-259 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING
COMMISSION, LEVISA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST TO UNPLACED DUE TO MEDICATION POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PETINGAS TWIN edged up nearing the half mile marker and took a stalking position off GERRY'S GEM, was under a ride pursuing into the stretch, made a
grinding run under left handed asks through the final furlong and was along in time. GERRYS GEM cleared soon after the start, dropped in towards the rail
and set a rated pace, was put to a ride two wide entering the lane widened a bit past the three sixteenths, wandered outward inside the sixteenth marker
and gave way grudgingly. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , brushed with an inner rival at the break then steadied soon after, regrouped to be off the rail and about
two wide, worked his way between rivals leaving mid stretch, shifted in towards the rail late and rallied. WHISKEY AND YOU lost ground four wide pursuing
the leaders, shifted out for the drive and churned on. SUPREME LAW , pinched back soon after the break, recovered and was taken six wide to edge up
outside foes, lost ground five wide and under a drive mid turn, worked further out in the lane and kept on with effort. CAJUN DREAM brushed with an outer
foe at the break, saved ground off the pace, remained inside for the drive and continued trying while steadily bridging the gap. TAKE CHARGE TOO had his
head turned as the gates sprung and was away a few lengths last, was sent up to the inside of foes in the opening furlong and gained a forward spot, was
under pressure pursuing the leader past the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. CATAHOULA MOON , four wide between foes nearing
the half, was under a ride three wide mid turn, failed to kick on and faded.

Footnotes
MISS HARRIETT broke a beat slow but quickly recovered and accelerated inside foes to poke a head in front nearing the three quarter pole, was nursed
along while handling outside pressure, spurted away after being set down soon into the lane, wandered outward near mid stretch then held firm under
repeated right handed encouragement. GO SHERRY GO , brushed at the break, settled off the leading trio while saving ground, was shoved along to stay in
range mid turn, continued inside for the drive and finished up with good energy while gaining the place. DAUGHTER OF TIME broke outward and brushed
with GO SHERRY GO, corrected and was with the early pace three deep, forced the pace outside the winner leaving the five sixteenths, drifted out to the
four path into the lane, straightened to pursued, remained on her left lead and failed to drum up a serious finish. OVERLY DRAMATIC forced the pace
between foes, backed off the leaders past the three eighths, stayed in range while under a ride past the quarter pole, failed to go on past the three
sixteenths, faltered and was eased late.

SPARKLE BLUE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced four wide entering the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole when
challenging for the lead and prevailed under pressure. CUT FROM CLASS set a pressured pace along the inner rail, drifted out near the eighth pole and
held gamely. SUN BEE , three wide the first turn, kept outside horses, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch and rallied mildly outside horses.
GLITTERING LIGHTS (GB) lacked speed, was behind horses around the far turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch and passed tired horses.
CHARMED WAY stalked the pace racing near the inner rail, eased off the fence in upper stretch and was steadied in close quarters behind the top pair in
mid stretch. TIC TIC TIC BOOM prompted the pace two wide, weakened in upper stretch and was steadied on rival's heels in mid stretch. CATS INTHE
TIMBER , forwardly placed along the inner rail to the far turn, gave way. Objections by the rider of CHARMED WAY against SPARKLE BLUE and CUT
FROM CLASS for alleged interference in mid stretch were not allowed.

SUMMERSTATEOFMIND rated stalking the clear leader, moved through as that one drifted out and took over past the five sixteenths, edged clear soon
after, responded to firm handling past the eighth pole and kept BOX N BEN at bay. BOX N BEN , sluggish from the gate, advanced four wide into the turn,
continued progress three wide to take aim on the winner near the quarter pole, gave game chase from there but failed to make any headway through the
final sixteenth. GET LIKE MIKE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out around the turn, came four wide for the drive and churned on. HAMPDEN
LANE saved ground with strong pursuit, edged up slightly past mid stretch then flattened out. COUNT DADDY , brushed at the break, raced three deep near
the half and failed to menace. CATCHING STARS , awkward away from the gate and brushed with an outer rival, raced between runners nearing the half,
failed to respond mid turn and tired. PERSPICACIOUS BOY sped clear early, set the pace off the inside, wandered out to about the seven path approaching
the stretch and faltered.
