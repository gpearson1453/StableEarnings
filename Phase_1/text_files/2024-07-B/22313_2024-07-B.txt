Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME stalked the pace from four wide to the turn then tucked in to two wide on the turn and engaged the leader at the quarter pole to
take the lead at the top of the stretch and drew clear. UPTOWN SOCIAL hustled away to a clear lead to midway through the turn then was headed at the
quarter pole and kept on to be second best. STOMPING HOTROD chased the leaders down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn and
made a rally for the show. CHARLIECANDO was void of early speed and trailed through the turn then moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole
for the late gain for show. VALDINA DREAMS raced off the pace to the turn from two wide and faded. RARE STRIPE tracked the leaders from the inside but
was not a factor. YOU VEE CEE hopped at the start then rushed up from three wide to be off the pace but was not a threat.

Footnotes
OVERANALYTICAL went to the front to take an unchallenged lead to set all the pace and won going away. READY SHOES bumped with SUMMER LOVER
leaving the gate, tracked leaders from the inside while settling in mid pack down the backstretch then moved between horses in upper stretch for the late
rally. AMERICAN DOLLARS went four wide into the first turn and stalked the pace from two wide down the backstretch then made a bid at the half mile
marker but was no match for the winner and weakened. DUDE DROP KID settled off the pace to the half mile marker and faded. WANNA WINNA was
unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced on the backstretch but failed to sustain that bid. SUMMER LOVER bumped with READY SHOES
leaving the gate and trailed the field while saving ground, passed tired foe in the stretch. ATHENS MOON was allowed to settle near the back down the
backstretch, moved up from three wide around the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the rally.

Footnotes
MILLIE'S STARDUST stalked the pace from three or four wide then closed willingly to run down the leader in the final yards and cleared late. MISCHIEF
PRINCESS shot away from the gate to show good speed to midway down the stretch but was caught in the final yards. DAZZLING DUCHESS bumped with
FERN SPIRIT leaving the gate then tracked the leaders from off the rail through the turn then shifted inside to make a rail bid in the stretch giving a game
effort. PEPPERMINT BITES broke inward leaving the gate then raced near the back to the top of the stretch, angled out at the quarter pole to go four wide
into the stretch to make the late run to improve position. HOOK EM UP saved ground throughout and made a mild bid in the stretch but was not a threat.
GIVE EM HAIL GAYLE rubbed the gate at the start then rushed to contention, chased the leader through the turn and tired in the stretch. FERN SPIRIT
bumped with DAZZLING DUCHESS leaving the gate then raced three wide but was never a factor.

GHOST BAYOU went to an unchallenged lead to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch to prove best. LIGHTENING MO was allowed to settle around
the first turn then moved up the rail on the backstretch to be off the pace but couldn't catch the leader and was clearly second best. MIZ JAMESON raced
near the back through the final turn while racing three wide and made a late run to be up for the show. ROLLIN BLACKOUT prompted the pace around the
first turn then settled in the middle of the pack to midway through the stretch and weakened late. FOREIGN TOURIST raced four wide into the first turn then
trailed the field while being outrun.

IZEONPOINT was taken back to angle inside to save ground down the backstretch will racing near the back, moved out to two wide midway through the
turn then maneuvered through traffic in early stretch to find an opening and drove past the leaders while being well ridden. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER raced in
the middle of the pack from two wide to the turn then moved between horses midway through the turn, tipping out to four wide at the quarter pole for the late
rally to be second best. TEXAS RED BEL bumped with STRAWBERRY SUNDAE leaving the gate, then shared command outside of HURRICAN TIZWAY
to mid turn and edged away but was collared at the quarter pole but couldn't fend of the two closing rivals but fought gamely for the show. CAVIAR
RESOLUTION was unhurried from outside of IZEONPOINT while matching strides with that one and moving up on the turn but couldn't keep pace through
the early stretch traffic and made the late gain for show. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE was bumped by SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW and TEXAS RED BEL leaving
the gate then stalked the pace from four wide and engaged the leader at the quarter pole but lacked the late response. HURRICANE TIZWAY went to the
front to share the command inside of TEXAS RED BEL to midway through the turn and fought gamely to the eighth pole but gave way grudgingly and was
outkicked late by the closing rivals. SASSY SAGEY tracked the leaders from the inside to the turn and faded. SHE DAZZLE raced off the pace from three
wide to mid turn and gave way. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW bumped with STRAWBERRY SUNDAE leaving the gate then settled in mid pack while racing
three wide but was never a threat. OOCHIE trailed the field and was outrun.
