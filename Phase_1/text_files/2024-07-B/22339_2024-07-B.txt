Footnotes
GALILEE rated in hand early to be mid-pack along the fence, gained on the leaders in the turn, angled to the clear in upper stretch and prevailed in a
determined drive. HOMETOWN HERO slow early to be near the back of the field, remained in that position to the top of the lane, angled seven wide turning
for home and closed well belatedly to just miss. LE GRIFFON prompted the pace through the first turn, moved to the pacesetter to apply pressure down the
backstretch, responded when called upon nearing the quarter pole to take the lead in upper stretch and could not hold off the top pair. LUCKY RUNNING
CAT tracked the leaders to midway on the far turn, rallied turning for home to loom in mid-stretch and finished evenly late in the drive. PRETORIAN GOLD
stalked the pace to be well placed on the far turn and lacked a clsoing response. BETWEEN THE COVERS raced mid-pack from four wide, was called upon
to circle five wide in the far turn and failed to mount a bid. SHOGUN BE FAST set the pace under pressure through rapid fractions, dug-in turning for home
when challenged and tired in the lane. LA PAZ hopped at the start to trail early and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MUSICAL HEART stalked the pace down the backside from three wide, angled in to the rail on the far turn to challenge the pacesetter on the bend, took
command turning for home, drifted out through the lane while finishing as much the best. DESANTIS set a the pace under pressure down the backstretch,
responded when engaged by the winner, could not go with that one in the stretch drive and kept on willingly as second best. LORD WINSALOT pressed the
pace down the backside from between rivals and finished evenly unable to go with the top pair. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) missed the break giving the field
several lengths, made up ground steadily to the top of the lane and flattened out. PURPLE SHIRT contended for the first three-eighths, dropped to the rear
of the field down the backside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WORK FROM HOME reserved off the early pace for the first five-eighths, commenced a rally circling five wide on the far turn to engage the pacesetter in
mid-stretch and edged away at the wire. TACTICAL HUMOR broke alertly to take command from the gate, set the pace on a clear lead to the head of the
lane, dug-in when challenged in the stretch and was out-finished late in a game effort. RUM TUM TUGGER rated in mid-pack to the far turn and rallied
mildly to gain the show. STANDPOINT tracked the leaders throughout and showed late interest in the lane. SOCIAL JOE unhurried to race near the rear of
the field and closed well belatedly in the stretch. UPTOWNJACOB BROWN slow early to be the trailer and passed tiring rivals in the lane. UTILITY
prompted the pace from between rivaals down the backstretch, continued to press to upper stretch and weakened in the final eighth. LUCKY DOUBLE
ZERO went evenly. RUMORS TO BLAME pressed the pace from the rail in a three way duel through the trun to be prominent turning for home and tired in
the stretch. TWIST OF FAITH stalked the pace from three wide to midway on the turn and flattened out coming home.

Footnotes
WHISKEYMAC sped to the lead from the gate, set the pace through quick fractions on a clear lead and finished willingly without challenge in a game effort.
RESTORED ORDER stalked the winner the entire way, could not narrow the gap at any point and kept-on willingly in in a good effort. BIG BEAUTIFUL
WALL unhurried to be near the rear of the field, swung out wide at the head of the lane and closed well belatedly to be up for the show. HARDY CHOICE
tracked the leaders from the fence and kept-on in the stretch while unable to gain on the top pair. LACCO AMENO raced mid-pack down the backside, lsot
position on the far turn, rallied cutting the corner at the head of the lane and finsihed evenly unable to sustain the bid. INDIRECTLY chased the leaders from
four wide throughout and lacked a clsoing bid. JO JO KATZ reared at the start to trail the field to the head of the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
LAKE NAKURU was not a threat. WILL E SUTTON raced in mid-field forseven eighths and weakened inside the eighth pole. COPPERHEAD CREEK
tracked the leaders for a half mile and steadily faded.

SUGAR'S LAST HOPE set the pace on a clear, well rated lead to upper stretch, repelled the bid of the runner-up midway down the lane and edged away
late in a game effort. MUSKOKA GIANT slow early to trail through the first turn, steadily gained ground to be in striking distance on the far turn, rallied to
engage the winner in the lane and failed to get passed while finishing well to be second best. DON'T QUESTION ME stalked the leaders from three wide
down the backside, ralied on the turn to be prominent and failed to sustain the bid. DORSODURO prompted the pace for the first half, rider lost the inside
stirrup down the backside, regained the iron to chase into the turn while attempting to bolt on the bend and came home evenly. HE'S ON FIRE was eased to
the wire having lost contact on the far turn.

SKIMBLE SHANKS unhurried in the early going to be the trailer down the backside, mounted an early bid into the far turn, swept to the lead from four wide
turning for home, dueled with the runner-up through the lane and prevailed in the final strides. FOLE'S NOTION raced wide in the first turn to move to a
stalking position down the backside, rallied three wide into the far turn to challenge for the lead, battled with the winner through the length of the stretch and
wasdenied late. CLANCY O'TOOLE prompted the pace down the backstretch, rallied two wide to be in a three way duel turning for home, could not go with
the top pair and finsihed willingly in a good try as best of the rest. RENEWING VOWS tracked the pace for the first half mile, dropped back to trail on the
final bend and passed a tired rival in deep stretch. LUCKY LINUS set a pressured pace to midway on the far turn and gave way.

SPORTING THE GOLD set a pressured pace from three wide the entire way, responded when challenged in the lane and held his rivals safe in a
determined effort. PRACTICALLYMINE pressed the pace from four wide to the turn, rallied to challenge the winner under an early drive on the turn, battled
through the stretch, was unable to catch the pacesetter and fought gamely to hold the place. HYPER INFLATION stalked the pace from five wide to the turn,
commenced a rally from the outside turning for home, idled briefly in mid-stretch losing ground and surged again late to be gaining at the wire. BEJUCO
stumbled at the start, rushed up the inside to press down the backstretch, was in tight quarters at the seven-sixteenths pole checking and hitting the rail and
lost all chance from there in a very troubled trip. LETSGETLUCKYTONITE rushed up from two wide shortly from the gate to press the lead from the inside,
was in traffic nearing the turn and gave way on the bend.
