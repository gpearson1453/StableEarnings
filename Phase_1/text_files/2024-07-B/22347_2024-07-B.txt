Footnotes
EXPLODE sat in striking position under a snug hold, swept the lead leaving the backstretch, was given his cue at the head to the lane, and was ridden out
under a confident hand ride. CALI CONQUEST was outsprinted to the opening the turn, prompted the pace outside of LANNY MAC, rallied three wide at the
head of the stretch and edged away to secure a second place finish. LANNY MAC vied inside for the early lead, set a pressured back from the two path,
was overtaken into the far turn, rallied between foes entering the stretch and weakened. WYE CROSS sat in second flight, launched a rail bid but was
unable to improve position in the drive. ZOFFA showed little.

TRAPEZE lagged early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, experienced traffic into the lane, found running room inside and drove clear. LAHUN
contested the pace from the rail, drifted in turning for home, and was just held for second. VANTASTICCANAVERAL pressed the pace from between foes,
fanned three wide, dug in in the final yards and narrowly missed. BARAK stalked the early pacesetters, drove inside in the final turn, was in close quarters
into the stretch and yielded. J J'S CAPER broke sharply then attended the pace while four wide, drove five wide at the quarter pole, and came up empty in
the drive. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of BARAK against the rider of LAHUN alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed.

FASTESTGIRLINTOWN dueled for the early lead outside of MILITARY SASS, disposed of rival at the quarter pole, was joined at eighth pole, and yielded
late stretch. MILITARY SASS dueled for the early lead from the two path, was unable to move on with rival, and gave way. BURNING UP chased wide, and
failed to menace. SUNBIZ stalked while five wide, shifted down to the rail leaving the backstretch, and lacked a closing response.

BEAUTIFUL MESS was gapped early, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane, closed steadily outside and was up in time. PRETTY ARIA set a
pressured pace from between foes, dueled inside of SKIP'S ROCK through the final turn, edged clear and was caught. DANCE SHOES saved ground
inside, was roused four wide, improved position mid-stretch and flattened out. SKIP'S ROCK pressed the pace while five wide, dueled in the final turn
outside of PRETTY ARIA, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. AFTER A FEW lodged an inside bid at the top of the lane and gave way. MISS
MIEZIE contested the early pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, and then was eased.

Footnotes
FIRECRACKER STAND was sent for speed then emerged the leader leaving the backstretch, remained clear into the stretch and was ridden out under a
light hand ride. MOB BOSS vied inside early, drove three to four wide in the final turn, chased through the stretch but was no match for winner. SMILIN
EVIE lagged early, and lodged a late mild bid for show. LITTLE GROOT fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, swung five wide and faded in the
stretch. TIGERITO fractious in the gate, and offered little. LIL ZAPPER fanned four wide in the far turn, and faded gradually. FAST EH tracked five wide, and
stopped.

Footnotes
MOUNT ASGARD trailed the field early, rallied in traffic nearing the stretch, and won driving. MENDELJOHN (IRE) settled five wide leaving the chute, was
urged at the three-sixteenth pole, closed gradually under encouragement and was bested. SILVERFOOT sat in second flight while three wide, drifted in
leaving the final turn, and rallied late stretch to earn show. VILLA NOVA chased in the three path, shifted inside at the head of the stretch, and was
outkicked. ABOVE AND BEYOND raced wide in the backstretch and offered a mild rally. LIFES ADVENTURE sat just off the pace while four wide, matched
strides outside of DON'T STOP DREAMIN in the final turn, was showing tiring nearing the stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. DON'T STOP
DREAMIN attended the early pace, dueled and faltered in the stretch. AMEER saved ground along the rail, and had no response when called upon.
HALLISAR contended the pace from between foes, was unable to keep pace with the field and was eased.

Footnotes
STARMA dueled inside of DIAMOND DI for the early lead, continued to battle outside nearing the stretch, wore down rival late stretch and edged clear.
DIAMOND DI contested the early pace inside of STARMA, dueled inside into the stretch then gave way grudgingly late stretch. OOPS (GB) trailed the field
early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and closed well outside. TENDER LOVE chased five wide, brushed PARZANNI in the backstretch, and
rallied mildly in drive. PARZANNI went wide through the backstretch, was brushed by TENDER LOVE, was bumped at the three sixteenth pole, and yielded
in the stretch. CINNAMON SAINT chased and passed tiring rivals. SIZZLIN ROSE fractious in the gate, hustled away, tracked the dueling pacesetters, and
chased to no avail. CHICTIME showed little. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL failed to menace. RUN MYA RUN no factor. DEFINATELYATEN fractious in the gate,
was never involved and was eased.
