Footnotes
HOLY TUTTA BELLA broke in the air then moved into contention on the first, was allowed to settle, angled out two-wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole
then caught DON'T TELL HYDEE entering the stretch and edged clear late. DON'T TELL HYDEE saved ground setting the pace, responded when
challenged y HOLY TUTTA BELLA but was unable to stay with that one late while holding on gamely for the place. SCATALICIOUS was reserved off the
early pace, moved up along the inside nearing the quarter pole then angled out for the drive and finished in a mild rally. LEMON DROP LADY was forwardly
placed while racing three-wide and lacked a rally. GOLD COAST GIRL hopped at the start then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. PARCO chased the pace while racing two-wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ROPERS N WRANGLERS dueled with SECRET HOTTIE from along the outside, gained a slight lead from that one leaving the eighth pole and prevailed in
a stiff drive. SECRET HOTTIE dueled for the lead throughout and held on gamely during the drive for second. YOGYA saved ground while being allowed to
settle, angled out three-wide nearing the eighth pole and closed strongly. POP CHART was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide, came five-wide
into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SIMPLY GRACIOUS saved ground stalking the pace, swung out to be four-wide entering the stretch but lacked a
rally. BUCCHERA was three-wide early while racing in the middle of the field but lacked a response when asked. UNBRIDLED VIOLET dropped back early
while saving ground and was not a factor.

the three-sixteenths pole and then again to bump with that one nearing the sixteenth pole and finished fast when clear to be up in the final strides. BENNY
BUCKETS saved ground setting the pace, responded when asked and held on gamely for the place. FIRST ENDEAVOR saved ground while being
forwardly placed, angled out to be two-wide nearing the quarter pole, came in slightly to brush with ENGLISH MEADOW leaving the three-sixteenths pole
then was bumped by that one nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. MONGOLIAN SPRING was unhurried early, came four-wide into
the stretch but lacked a rally. RALLIFIED saved ground while dropping back, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a mild bid nearing the eighth pole
then flattened out. CRAZY STORM was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and weakened. BOSSYBYNATURE prompted the pace for five
