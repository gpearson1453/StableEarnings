Footnotes
SOUPER ZONDA stalked in the five path down the backstretch, was coaxed from the four path entering the far turn, tipped back out to the five path passing
the eighth pole, and kicked on to get up in the final strides. RAMSEY POND steadied into the first turn, rated in the three path down the backstretch, came
under a ride midway around the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, rallied to lead passing the eighth pole, got clear around the sixteenth, but
ducked out suddenly late to get nailed by an inner foe in the final strides. CHEESE set the pace in the two path, came under a nudge when challenged
passing the half, dug in and bumped with an outer foe at the top of the lane, lost the lead passing the eighth pole, but held show. BELLE MIA laid up close in
the three path, was ridden in the two path around the far turn, angled outward thru the stretch, and finished evenly. HELLO HELLO HELLO chased in the
four path, came under right handed urging from the three path midway around the far turn, but drifted out down the stretch, and made no impact. SHEDOO
KITTEN laid in range in the three path, but drifted out down the lane, and failed to bid. MATTINATA checked inside of foes midway around the first turn,
moved up to vie for the lead in the three path passing the half, received a right handed cue in the two path midway around the far turn, bumped with an inner
foe from the three path at the top of the lane, and faded. MUSTANG BUCKS raced off the pace in the five path, but floated out to the seven path midway
around the far turn, and was no factor. NASHVILLE SLEW steadied into the first turn, tracked in the two path but weakened. LET'S DANCE AGAIN bobbled
at the start, trailed inside and never threatened. GIFTBOX SURPRISE raced wellback in the four path but was no menace.

AWESOMELY WILD settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. SHILOH
broke a bit awkwardly, pressed the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and kept on to hold the
place. HOLY KINGDOM prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole but was outfinished. HUGE G bumped with LOLA LOCA at
the start, raced in range two wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. LOLA LOCA bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. MIGGI set a pressured pace along the rail and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
YOURAMYSTYLE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, split rivals turning for home and drew of funder a drive.
THINGSRGETTINHARRY prompted the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. BREATH DEEPLY set
the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. RAGS SPECIAL chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. HE'S A COMMISIONER failed to
menace while racing three wide. DYNAMIC EMPIRE was bumped on both sides at the start, gave chase four wide and had little left for the drive. AMAZING
JETT was bumped soon after the start, raced two wide and never threatened. GINGERSNAP JACK broke in and bumped at the start, raced three wide and
never reached contention. BLAZING TYREEK was bumped between foes at the start, clipped heels soon after, raced well back inside and was never
involved.

Footnotes
BIG MARTINI laid up close in the five path, bid in the four path midway around the turn, took the lead at the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final
furlong. CLASSIFY set the pace in the two path, was coaxed when challenged by an outer foe passing the three-eighths pole, but lost the lead at the top of
the stretch, tipped out to the five path around the sixteenth, and chased on for place. COPPERMASTER trailed in the five path but finished evenly from the
two path in the stretch for show. LUNI SIMA bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path but drifted out down the stretch, and weakened.
POWER HUMOR bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path but was no menace.

WARHOL set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, widened in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. FREGON saved ground well off
the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch and finished strongly. ZACK'S MYSTERIO prompted the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane.
ASHER'S EDGE saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. JUNCTION ROAD failed to menace while racing three wide. URGE TO MERGE (IRE)
raced off the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. CHEYENNE BRAVE played no factor while racing four wide. SEEKING TO COLLECT prompted the
winner in the three path and faltered in the lane.

VINDICATE CHA CHA set the pace in the two path, waited confidently around the turn, was roused from the three path turning into the lane, drew clear
passing the eighth pole, drifted out around the sixteenth, but held sway. PARTY SHAKER tracked in the four path, was coaxed into the turn, fanned out to
the eight path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE chased in the two path, was coaxed along around the turn, and kept on
for show. LUCY'S COOKIE was hustled from in range in the two path, swung out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened. STAR
OF SATURN trailed inside and made no impact. GALLOP D'HERMES raced off the pace in the three path, angled outward in upper stretch, but did not
threaten. AVELLINO stalked in the three path but weakened from the five path in the stretch, pulled up on the gallop out and was transported off the track in
an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
GENERAL LEDGER stalked the early pace three wide, angled to the rail late on the first turn, took the lead inside of the early pacesetter early on the
backstretch, drew clear not long after, set the pace in the two path around the far turn and widened under a drive. BRAWN pressed the pace in the three
path, settled back when the winner made the backstretch move, chased in the three path around the far turn and was clearly 2nd best in the lane. PET MAT
saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch and was along late for the show. QUESTER raced off the pace inside, angled four wide in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. SPEED CONTROL raced off the pace two and three wide, shifted into the five path in upper stretch and never
threatened. THEMANUPFRONT set the early pace in the two path, chased inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and faded through the lane.
LOMACHENKO trailed inside.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING DUST set the pace in the three path, was confidently handled in the two path rounding the turn, roused just past the quarter pole, and inched
away in the three path down the lane. FOR THE THRILL bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was ridden from the rail around the turn, and
ran on from the two path down the stretch for place. WEST BANK stalked out in the seven path before merging into the three path entering the turn,
received a right handed cue midway around the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and flattened for show. LACE CURTAIN raced off the
pace in the six path, got put in tight and had to steady passing the half, was driven in the five path around the turn, but did not factor in the seven path down
the lane. COOL TRICKS raced in midpack from the five path, was coaxed along between foes in the four path around the turn, but flattened from the eight
path down the lane. ALWAYS DRAMA bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid up close in the two path but faded around the turn. NOMOREBILLLS
bumped between foes at the start, rated in the three path but never threatened. REIGN IN MY HEART raced wellback in the four path and never menaced.
INVIDIA DEL COCO always trailed.
