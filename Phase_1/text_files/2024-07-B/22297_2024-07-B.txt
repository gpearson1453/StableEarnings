Footnotes
ADELAIDE COURT broke sharp, patiently found his stride while tracking the engaged pair down the backstretch, began to take closer order by the quarter
pole, moved in at the top of the stretch, was encouraged right handed at the furlong marker , found another gear and went by at the seventy yard marker for
the win. COMPETITIVE TOUCH contested the pace up front on the outside down the back straight, began to edge away for the lead in midturn, opened up
at the top of the lane, could not find more late and was caught by the winner, seventy yards from the finish line. PONTIAC travelled in mid-pack on the rail in
the early going, started to gather momentum midway through the turn, shifted out to be three wide turning for home and won the duel for third money down
the lane. COHERENCE trailed the field along the backside, began to offer a mild run when passing a rival outside into the turn, was asked left handed with
five sixteenths to go, angled out widest in the four path straightening out for home and lost the battle for the show award to settle on the fringes in the end.
WET AND WILD went head to head with the outside foe setting the pace along the backside, could not continue on upfront midway around the turn and tired
on the fence at the sixteenth pole. MANETKA stalked near the rear on the fence, was urged, but made no headway on runners through the turn and failed to
be a presence in the stretch drive. BREAK THE SPELL stumbled on the break, dislodging the rider and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #4

Footnotes
RIVER OF BABYLON co-trailed on the outside at the half, continued to see the field around the turn, began to extend his stride when swinging out widest in
the eight path for the drive to the wire, was full of run down the stretch, surging past many rivals at the sixteenth pole and got up just in time for the score.
RYE'S MY GUY was brushed at the start, settled outside runners in midfield, crept closer while behind runners midpoint on the turn, angled out in the four
path straightening out for home, started to reach for more ground closing in smartly to the wire but was just outfinished by the winner. DANCIN' DEPUTY
tracked the lead pair on the rail, closed the gap two wide between foes at the quarter pole to be in the hunt three wide entering the stretch and determinedly
fought on to the finish line, closing in late for the show money. YOGA had a slim lead outside down the back straight, opened up on rivals by the quarter
pole, began to get leg weary with an eighth left to run, drifted out under left handed encouragement nearing the wire to settle on the fringes in the end.
AMAZING SUCCESS tracked the front duo outside down the backstretch, took up the running after the leader three wide at the quarter pole, posed a threat
turning for home, chased but to no avail down the lane and was checked when in tight quarters when crossing the finish line. MEXICOFFEE pressed the
pace on the rail, could not quicken with the other speed foe with five sixteenths to run, dueled on the rail for a minor role in upper stretch but gave way at the
furlong marker. COMMANDER AT SEA broke out to begin, stalked near the rear while on the fence, made little progression around the bend, shifted to the
seven path with the eventual winner on his outside at the top of the lane but lacked a rally in the stretch. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW was bumped outside to
begin, recovered to sit in mid-division on the rail down the backside, travelled evenly throughout the turn, shifted out to the five path for the drive but emptied
out in upper stretch. MEKO MAKEE broke in a tangle at the start, co-trailed on the inside, could not make any improvement around the turn while saving
ground, angled out three wide for the stretch run but could not get involved.

Footnotes
RULE THE WAVES broke in to begin, pressed the issue between after the start, opened up impressively while still in hand at the three eighths marker,
continued to roll along sharply in upper stretch and was kept to the task to win by a diminishing but comfortable margin in the end. SUMMER BUCK was
forced out on the break, co-trailed inside in the beginning, took the short way around in the turn burst between horses finding a seam three wide at the top of
the lane and kept on coming in the stretch to nail the runners up share right at the line. BACKONTHECHAINGANG broke out at the start, prompted the pace
on the fence in the early going, tracked on the rail throughout the turn, was the only one who could threaten the winner at the top of the lane, ran on his
wrong lead to the finish line and was caught right at the wire for second money. HIGHLAND BLUE was squeezed on the break, co-trailed on the outside
down the backside, started to rally around foes three wide in midturn, was in the hunt when widest in the five path straightening for home, lugged in through
the stretch and finished up on the fence, crossing the wire to be a fringe player. HAPPY QUAD settled all alone in midfield down the backstretch, tracked the
pacesetter outside around the bend, was checked mildly losing its path turning for home and could not reach contention through the stretch drive. PRETTY
GOOD JOKE seized command at the start, had no response trying to keep up to the winner at the three furlong marker, chased throughout the turn outside
but folded in the four path between runners in upper stretch.

Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA was content to watch the pacesetter down the backstretch, sat just outside measuring the frontrunner in the turn, moved in on the
leader in upper stretch three wide, took control at the sixteenth pole and held off charging rivals late. PEACH COBBLER tracked the front duo outside in the
turn, angled out four wide having a clear run down the lane and closed in sharply to the wire but was denied by the game winner. SOUPER SUNDAY had a
good set up, tracking the lead pair nestled on the rail, waited to move behind the duo on the bend, found a seam in the two path turning for home but did not
have enough late to threaten for the winners share while holding for third money. AMERICAN GAMBLE settled in mid-pack in the early going, kept pace with
horses throughout the turn, shifted out to be four wide for the stretch run and showed good late energy to close in on the leaders and get up for a minor role
at the finish line. SUMMER SNOW broke through the gate prior to the start, had the lead quickly when the gates opened up, continued to play catch me if
you can through the turn, was collared outside in deep stretch at the sixteenth pole and tired late, losing some placings in the end. MI TORMENTA had a
stalking role, ahead of only the poor starter running down the backside, made no impact travelling on the fence around the bend and failed to menace inside
down the lane. ALA TURKA was off slowly to spot the field along the backside, could not catch up to the field around the turn and could not overcome the
start to pose any threat in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
COOLCOLLECTED tracked from inside just off the leaders, began shifting out near the five-sixteenths, had aim on the leader five deep and exchanging a
bump with an outside rival at the top of the stretch, struck the lead near the three-sixteenths, edged clear under steady urging. FORTY N FIVE pressed
three wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was soon overtaken and no match for the winner but fought on to preserve the place. WAR WARRIOR
broke on top then settled off the leading pair content to stalk those from outside, travelled mostly four to six wide throughout, was within range coming to the
top of the stretch, exchanged a bump with a foe at that juncture, needed more late. SPECIAL SESSION settled tracking mid-pack inside, shifted out six to
seven wide leaving the turn, kept on in the stretch. CHARTED MAP angled in early, was a bit hard to control and keen to go on racing in behind and inside
runners up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out a few paths for the drive and kept on well but missed rounding out the super. SCUDERIA
settled outside runners near mid-division racing four wide through the turn, was floated out seven deep by a rival turning for home, ran on one-paced.
SUGAR BUZZ moved forward under mild coaxing, set a pressured pace inside, gave way in the stretch. MEGALODON got away slowly, was outpaced in
the early going bringing up the rear, swung seven wide turning for home and passed tired rivals. GOTME GOOD raced outside a foe well back of the
leaders, continued off the inside and was never near enough to threaten. BAYTOWN GUVNAH chased from between runners three wide into and on the
turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
JUNIPERO SERRA was allowed to settle into stride trailing the field in the beginning, shifted outside, still in last three wide down the back straight, started to
unleash his run three deep with three furlongs to go, swooping the field around the far turn and was full of run in the stretch, widest in the five path under left
handed encouragement to take the lead at the seventy yard marker and cleared off when crossing the finish line. GRAN SPIRITED assumed the lead,
setting a pedestrian pace to the half, was nudged on, rationing out the speed to still have the lead when pressed outside by the quarter pole, stubbornly
fought on gamely inside to the finish line but succumbed to the winners late surge nearing the wire. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE broke in but was quickly
straightened up, stalked three wide outside horses early on, improved down the backstretch, turned up the pressure three wide to bid at the quarter pole,
dueled between rivals in the four path down the stretch but was outkicked late by the winner. JIM'S HOPE tracked the pacesetter for the most part, was hard
ridden at the quarter pole trying to reel in the frontrunner, battled for the lead in the three path with runners on either side in upper stretch, had to be checked
between foes losing momentum at the seventy yard marker and could not re-rally in time to pose a threat at the finish. COOLER MAN stalked on the fence
in the early stages, was asked for more when in the second flight between rivals with three furlongs to go, had a chance for a share when in range behind
the leaders in the two path straightening for home when the field was bunching up but failed to fire to the finish line. GREYSTONE was tucked in on the rail
behind the pacesetter in the first turn, shuffled back losing some positioning down the backstretch, was roused on the fence but could not keep up with rivals
outside making a move and had nothing to offer in the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 PAT'SEEWINGMACHINE AGAINST #2 JUNIPERO
SERRA IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL#5 JIMS HOPE AGAINST #4 PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE AND #6 GRAN

Footnotes
PUDDINGONTHERITZ was bumped at the break, raced in a bit tight behind and inside in the early going, saved ground near the rail, came out in upper
stretch, took aim, rallied strongly to drive past late. GAROFOLI tracked from inside, moved out three wide past the five-sixteenths nearing the quarter pole,
took the lead at the eighth pole, led till late but was outfinished. ROCK TO FAME got away well and quickly moved clear to set the pace near but off the rail,
weakened. ORPHAN HALLIE bumped a rival lightly at the start, settled at the back, came out a bit for the drive, ran on. KINETIC STONE chased from
outside racing mostly three to five wide throughout, faded in the stretch. IT'S A FLUKE hopped at the start, moved up just a bit outside foes up the
backstretch, swung out six wide for the stretch run, was not a factor.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S FORTUNE stalked near the rear on the fence down the backstretch, skimmed the rail in the turn, shifted outside to be seven wide for the
stretch drive, determinedly fought to the wire under right handed urging with a pesky foe to his outside and prevailed in a photo at the finish line. CLAYTON
was unhurried to trail in the early stages, gathered momentum when angling out widest in the nine path turning for home, one by one started to go past
runners, dueled with the winner in deep stretch, appeared to be inadvertently struck by the inside riders crop in the drive late and was denied at the wire.
THERE'S NO JOE was hustled on the rail from the start to get to the front, continued to be nudged on, setting the pace through the turn, kept finding more
down the lane clinging onto the lead on the rail but just missed a few jumps before the line to hold for the win in a gutsy front end performance. JAZZ
HANDS was bumped inside to begin, regrouped to be content just sitting off the leaders three wide down the backside, moved in to bid for the lead outside
in the three path by the quarter pole, relentlessly kept edging closer to the front with a sixteenth to go but could not go by late and settled on the fringes in
the end. ESKIMINZIN sat alone watching the lead trio down the back straight, settled in the second flight surrounded by rivals on both sides throughout the
turn, was in the hunt four wide for the drive to the wire and ran only evenly in the last furlong. TRUEBELIEVE was in midfield just off the rail in the two path
with horses outside, stalked in the third flight while saving all the ground on the fence, angled to be five wide straightening out for home but could not be a
factor running to the wire. GIANT TEDDY was four deep outside horses in mid-division along the backside, kept travelling four wide but was going the wrong
way around the bend, shifted out between foes eight wide for the drive, could not find more and retreated at the furlong marker. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN
broke out to begin, pressed the pace between early on, gave way up top three furlongs from home, tracked on the rail on the turn, sat just behind the
contesting leaders in the two path in upper stretch but wilted with a sixteenth to go. GALVASTON settled in mid-pack between runners in the three path,
improved to be in the second flight outside foes three wide on the turn, shifted out in the six path to be in range at the top of the lane but yielded in
mid-stretch.RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #6 CLAYTON AGAINST #5 FORESTERS FORTUNE NEARING THE WIRE

READY TO COLLECT broke outwardly bumping with a rival, settled tracking from between runners early, advanced in the three to four path on the turn,
took aim in upper stretch, took over past the furlong marker and drew clear under steady urging. LUMBERYARD veered outwardly bumping a rival at the
start, contested the pace from between runners early with a narrow advantage then dueled inside a foe but off the rail, was headed near the quarter pole,
fought on but was no match for the winner while battling on and just saving place. YODDHA settled off the pace near but off the rail, came out four to five
wide in upper stretch, kept on late but just missed second. DRYDEN was bumped at the break, pressed from the outside about three to four wide, was even
nearing the quarter pole putting a short head in front while contending for the lead, kept on but was simply outkicked. ITS JUST MONEY broke a step slowly
and was squeezed back at the start, moved forward outside racing mostly four to six wide throughout, kept on evenly in the lane but needed more. SEHR
SCHOEN broke inwardly bumping with a foe at the start, vied inside briefly then checked near the seven-sixteenths rapidly losing several lengths, failed to
rally thereafter and was one-paced. GINGER'S HOLIDAY broke a step slowly and was not a factor. SMARTER STILL got away a bit slowly and was put to
urging but lacking speed, raced near the inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE HOME was quite relaxed, shadowing the pacesetter outside in the early parts of the race, moved in to be three wide by the quarter pole,
dueled outside by mid-stretch, showed her dominance late to clear away easily and was geared down when crossing the wire. PERSONAL PURSUIT had a
stalking role while outside a challenger through the turn, shifted out to be between rivals in the five path at the top of the lane to commence a run, dueled for
the place share through the stretch, won the battle but could not threaten the stablemate winner who was very good on this day. LUZ DE LA LUNA stalked
on the inside for the most of the race, shifted out turning for home to be just behind the winner in the three path in mid-stretch, battled for the runners up
share to the wire but had to settle for third money. VERDEJO co-trailed inside throughout the turn, angled out to be six wide straightening out for home,
found her best stride in deep stretch and got up for a minor share. CARA CARA while under a snug hold set the pace along the backside, continued up front
around the bend, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch, fought on clinging to a narrow lead at the eighth pole , could not find more late and
faded in deep stretch. GLORIANNIA co-trailed on the outside in the early going, angled out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and could only
find enough for the drive to pass tired rivals in the final furlong. ZANA travelled outside a rival watching the lead pair around the bend, shifted out in the five
path to be in the hunt straightening for home but gave way at the furlong marker between foes. OL' BLONDIE tracked the leaders on the rail throughout the
turn, took closer order by the time they turned for home to be in the mix on the fence, could not continued the rally and folded by the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
C C'S KINGDOM was unhurried trailing in the early stages, made a bold move from last, shifting out three wide bursting between foes midway on the far
turn, angled outside gathering a head of steam in the six path for the stretch run and flew past rivals in mid-stretch to win going away in the end. GREAT
FACES made a sharp move from the outside post to clear to the front on the rail while setting a slow pace, continued to set even fractions down the
backside up top, was headed outside by a rival in upper stretch, dug in to repel that foe but could not find more late to fend off the late surge by the winner.
INFAMOUS COVERT broke out on the start, tracked three wide in the first turn, took closer order down the backstretch, chased the pacesetter outside in
the final bend, bid for the lead outside by the quarter pole, was repelled by the frontrunner at the furlong marker and held on for the show award. H C
HOLIDAY settled in the third tier between runners early, travelled on the rail in mid-division down the backstraight, kept pace while scrubbed on throughout
the final turn, angled in the four path at the top of the lane and had a good late kick from the furlong pole to the wire to just miss closing in for third money.
CUPID'S CLAWS stalked near the rear five deep in the first bend, improved down the backstretch to be in the third flight outside not far off the leaders, was
urged right-handed but could not make any headway at the quarter pole and was one paced down the stretch. TIMESKIP tracked on the rail in the first turn,
was nested on the fence, sitting just behind the leader along the backside, waited to move inside through the far turn, had a clear run on the fence turning
for home to be in the thick of things in upper stretch for a piece of the prize but stalled late. ANSELMO was bumped inside to begin, settled close to the back
of the pack outside runners down the backstretch, started to put in a mild rally outside at the quarter pole, was floated out widest in the seven path by the
winner and could not offer a finish down the stretch. HELL BENT chased the pace in the early stages, could no match strides with the top pair in the final
turn while under a ride and weakened between horses at the furlong marker. EMBRACE MY UNCLE settled on the rail in mid-pack, continued down the
backside status unchanged, was hard ridden at the quarter pole but could not offer a rally and made no impression down the lane. ARGENTIUM stalked
near the rear on the first turn outside runners, was ahead of only one runner down the backside which was the eventual winner, showed no interest when
roused on the far turn and could not get involved in the running to the finish line. MAMBOINTHEFOREST was in the tracking group five wide outside foes in
the first turn settled in midfield three deep down the backside, could not go with others making a move on the far turn and was empty for the drive.
