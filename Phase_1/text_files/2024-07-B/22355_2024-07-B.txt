Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE rated in hand just off the pace from the fence down the backside, waited patiently on the bend for racing room, angled out five wide to the
clear at the head of the lane to engage the dueling pacesetters in upper stretch and drew off convincingly. HEARTFULLOFSTARS pressed the pace from
two wide through the turn, dueled with the pacesetter down the stretch, was no match for the winner but fought on willingly to gain the place. B WEST set a
pressured pace from the fence to upper stretch, could not go with the closing winner and kept on battling for the place but was outkicked lin the final strides.
BARON'S LEGACY bobbled leaving the gate, ranged up three wide to stalk the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing response when called upon
midway on the bend. NIFTY went evenly never posing a threat.

Footnotes
CLAUDEE BOY tracked the pace from a clear pocket into the turn, angled six wide turning for home to mount a rally and closed with a well timed, late rush
to be up in the final strides. MONCRIEF broke a step slow, was hustled up five wide to stalk the pace, loomed at the head of the lane and kept-on well down
the stretch to garner the place. ONE WAY TRAFFIC set a well measured pace to the quarter pole, responded when called upon turning for home to open a
clear lead in mid-stretch and could not hold off the closers inside the sixteenth pole. KATIE'S NOTION unhurried in the early going to race near the rear of
the field, saved ground through the turn, searched for racing room in upper stretch, angled out to the clear midway down the lane and found his best stride
late to be gaining in deep stretch. SPLENDID SUMMER stalked the pace from four wide to be well placed turning for home and lacked a closing kick.
JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH trailed for a half and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. BOSS MAN J J reserved off the pace through the turn, rallied mildly in the
lane while altering course through traffic. SIR LANCE showed brief speed to contend early, was shuffled back on the bend and failed to mount a closing
response. GOLDEN ARM prompted the pace from the fence to the head of the lane and weakened down the stretch.

Footnotes
MORNING THOUGHTS set a well rated pace under mild pressure to the far turn, surrendered the lead turning for home when challenged by the runner-up,
angled to the outside in upper stretch and came again gamely in deep stretch to prevail in the final strides. ALIFEROUS unhurried for the first half mile,
commenced a steady rally from four wide into the final bend, took command turning for home, opened a clear lead in mid-stretch and drifted out while tiring
inside the final eighth to be caught late. ZOOMER stalked the pace from the fence to the turn, was set to drive midway on the bend, altered course in
mid-stretch to angle inside the drifting top pair and was gaining late in the drive. TUBTIMSIAM prompted the pace for the first half mile, was called upon in
the far turn to keep pace and was unable to sustain the bid finishing evenly. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED went evenly and failed to threaten.

COMPASS RISES reserved off the pace to the backstretch, steadily gained ground from three wide to the far turn to be prominent, rallied from between
horses down the lane and prevailed in a determined drive. DEAD SEXY unhurried for the first five-eighths to be well off the pace, circled five wide turning for
home and closed well to be gaining at the wire. SHAKREVENGE broke awkwardly tossing his head leaving the gate, settled to be rated in mid-pack for the
first half mile, made an early four wide bid into turn to engage the leaders at the quarter pole, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and weakened late in the
lane. PURRING tracked the leaders from two wide to the far turn, rallied in upper stretch to loom in the lane and could not get passed. LEARNING TO FLY
raced in contention to the backside, dropped back on the far turn losing position and passed tiring rivals in the lane. KAKE'S TAP DANCER set a pressured
pace through quick fractions and weakened in the stretch. MER SOLEIL stumbled badly a step away from the gate going to his knees and lost all chance.
ANXIOUS HEART ptessed the pace for three-quarters and came up empty.

FAITH AND LIBERTY stalked the pace from three wide into the turn, rallied to engage the pacesetter turning for home, took command in mid-stretch and
held clear convincingly. GOOD STORY reserved off the pace to midway on the turn, made a steady advance splitting rivals in the lane and finished willingly
to gain the place. SOUTH PACIFIC saved ground while well placed in the turn, tipped out in upper stretch around the tiring pacesetter and closed with a
mild bid to be along for the show. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM tracked the leaders from four wide to the turn, made a bid to threaten at the quarter pole and
failed to sustain the rally in the lane. BALI HAI sped to a clear lead through the turn and tired in the stretch. JUST THE THING chased the leaders from five
wide to the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. JOB'S NOT FINISHED went evenly failing to menace. CARA IN THE CITY trailed most of the way
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SKIP THRU DA FIRE was not a threat. CONFLUENCE LASSIE raced in contention early and gave way coming
home.

TWO BY TWO reserved well off the pace for the run down the backside, mounted a rally midway on the turn circling six wide to circle the fiield and closed
well down the lane to be up late. U S CONSTITUTION tracked the leaders from the rail through the turn, angled out to challenge in upper stretch, took the
lead inside the sixteenth pole and was caught in the final strides. UNCLE CURLY saved ground racing along the fence to near the quarter pole, angled out
while mounting a strong bid in upper stretch, altered course in mid-stretch to angle in splitting rivals and finsihed willingly to just miss in a good effort.
SHOFAR prompted the pace for the first half mile, mounted a bid to engage the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally late in the
lane. HELMS DEEP set a pressured pace to midway on the turn, responded when challenged turning for home and kept-on through the lane finishing
evenly. GRADED ON A CURVE was unhurried for the run down the backside to be near the rear of the field nad made a mild bid in the lane without impact.
AMERICAN D'ORO was unprepared at the start to break slowly, trailed the field to the far turn and passed weakened rivals in the lane. SUMMER ANTHEM
rated in mid-pack to the half mile pole, rallied into the turn to be prominent on the bend and flattened out. BONDED tracked the leaders from four wide to
midway on the final bend and gave way. SUMMER SILENCE raced in contention early and steadily faded to the rear of the field.

Footnotes
IRISH EXIT bobbled at the break but came away with the leaders, rated back a bit and stalked the pace from four wide to the turn, rallied while under a drive
on the turn to engage the leader turning for home and finished willingly to prevail. BRILLIANT ICE, firmly rated back leaving the chute, tracked the leaders
into the turn, gained on the bend while saving ground along the rail, cut the corner turning for home and rallied along the rail to be second best. MURRAY
trailed the field into the turn and circled the pack rallying seven wide and closed belatedly to gain the show. BOSS LOGIC tracked the leaders to the head of
the lane to be in striking position and finished with a grinding rally through the stretch. MAGIC MICHAEL lunged at the start, was kept in hand to be
unhurried down the backstretch and mounted a mild late bid down the lane. KARAN'S NOTION prompted the early pace, moved to engage the pacesetter
into the turn, took command on the bend, and weakened turning for home. CELESTIAL MOON went evenly never posing a threat. BOB MARCO flashed
speed to take a clear early lead and was through after a half. SHERLOCK'S JEWEL chased the leaders from four wide to the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAJOR HOULIHAN rated kindly prompting the pace outside the leader, moved to engage around the far turn, sparred under some nudging past the five
sixteenths, wrested command a furlong out, spurted clear under left handed asks near the sixteenth pole then held firm under steady handling. COVER THE
SPREAD , off a beat slow, quickly reached a forward spot then stalked three deep through the backstretch run, was under a hustling ride pursuing the
embattled leaders nearing the lane, shifted out wider for the drive, closed steadily and earned the place. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE was hustled up between
foes soon after the start, remained between foes past the five eighths while stalking, dropped inside approaching the stretch and kept on gamely. PLEASE
MARRY ME was urged to a clear early lead, dropped in and set the pace, met the winner's outside bid around the far turn, dueled and held that one off to
about mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. CRIMSON PRINCESS settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths,
shifted further out in upper stretch then steadily bridged the gap. HAZELMOOR BEACH , four wide into the first turn, lost ground four wide with a mild run
into the lane then failed to sustain. CHAVETA , in close attendance while saving ground and under some early rating, failed to kick on under pressure past
the five sixteenths and weakened. SEAFARER was outrun.
