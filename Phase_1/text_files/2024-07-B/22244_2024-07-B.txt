Footnotes
NATIVE HELLRAISER got bumped at the start then remained unhurried in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted out four wide turning for home,
launched a bid at the head of the lane, responded gamely, rallied along the outside and got up late. MC COUGAR vied for the lead in early stages,
continued to battle inside of HOOKED ON DREAMS around the turn, shook free to a slim lead in upper stretch, continued on top deep stretch then got
outfinished when the winner surged by. HOOKED ON DREAMS vied for the early lead, continued to match strides outside of MC COUGAR around the turn,
could not maintain equal terms at the head of the lane, but kept on and just lasted for show. A JUST CAUSE raced off the top two flights entering the turn,
saved ground around the turn, hustled along the inside in the upper stretch, gained some ground then tipped a path wider and just missed show. SANGRIA
SKY briefly vied for the early lead then raced off the top pair around the turn, hustled along three paths wide into the stretch and needed more for late
impact. FREEDOM TO SPEED briefly held a slim lead out of the gate then vied for the lead, flattened off the top pair around the turn and continued to tire in
the drive.

Footnotes
FLOOR IT held a slim lead around the first turn then led the way under a bit of pressure from EZ FITZ, turned back the bids from a duo at the quarter pole,
saved ground and opened up entering the lane, widened under mild urging and kept to task. LUCKY'S SECRET was allowed to settle out of the gate and
raced two wide into the first turn, remained unhurried in the back, picked up the tempo late on the far turn, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch,
sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. WICKED PRINCE raced four paths wide entering the first turn, stalked in good position up the backstretch,
edged up to race in aim three wide at the quarter pole, could not reach eventual winner, came two wide into the lane, evened out and held show. EZ FITZ
was forwardly placed around the first turn, and remained in striking distance up the backstretch, moved up to challenge two wide near the quarter pole,
could not reach the leader, ran on into the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. NICE ONE JULIO raced up close around the first turn, remained
in close contention into the early backstretch then steadily faded after the half.

Footnotes
UXMAL tracked along the inside around the first turn, moved up to take over a slim lead mid-way up the backstretch, vied inside of MR.THUNDERSTRUCK
around the final turn, shook free entering the head of the lane and kept clear. OCEAN OF STORMS matched strides for the lead around the first turn, edged
back into tracking position entering the backstretch, raced in contention along the rail on the final turn, angled three wide for the drive, finished with response
and gained second best. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK raced off the pace around the first turn then moved up to press the pace in the backstretch, vied for the
lead with eventual winner at the quarter pole, failed to match strides turning for home, kept on and cleared the rest. IMPECCABILITY trailed through early
stages, saved ground around the final turn, roused for more at the head of the lane and improved position without threatening. PURE ROCKET got bumped
at the start and tossed head briefly, pulled to race on top entering the backstretch, then weakened, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened.
MISSION IS A GO raced in range midway up the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

BIG MAN STAN vied inside of MEEKER for the early lead, battled on around the turn, saved ground and shook free entering the head of the lane, widened
to a clear advantage and held sway. MEEKER vied outside of BIG MAN STAN in opening stages, battled on around the turn, could not move on with
eventual winner at the head of the lane, stayed on with response and secured second best. TIME TO SING was forwardly placed racing three wide just off
the dueling duo around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and prevailed for a share. TOMS PROSPECTOR was not far back along the inside
in early stages, ran one paced around the turn, remained inside through the lane and lacked the needed kick for impact. VIRTUE'S REWARD was ridden
along three to four wide late on the turn, edged a bit closer then came four wide into the upper stretch, kept under firm handling along the outside and failed
to move on. SHAME ON STEVE got bumped at the start then steadily faded after opening stages, raced in the back and had no response.

Footnotes
INTERSTELLA sped to the lead at the start and continued on top around the first turn, set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, continued with the
clear advantage around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened to a commanding margin without much asking at the furlong marker and kept
to task while ridden out. MISS PEACH tracked the pace around the first turn, moved up closer mid-way up the backstretch, hustled along two wide in pursuit
of INTERSTELLA around the final turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. LAVENDER LIL was well
reserved trailing in the back running through the backstretch, hustled along three to four wide entering the upper stretch and got up late for show.
DEMIDANU tracked in contention up the backstretch, was ridden three to four wide for response around the far turn, was no match for pulling away top pair
in the stretch and got edged late for show. KAYLA rated off the early pace, urged to pick up the tempo past the half mile marker, angled to the rail around
the far turn and faded. ANGEL'S MELODY came up empty after a half and jogged in.

Footnotes
TAPITURE'S LADY was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced off the pace around the first turn, edged a bit closer along the outside mid-way up the
backstretch, hustled along four wide around the far turn, edged closer under left handed pressure three deep in upper stretch, drifted out wider while closing
in, cleared the lead approaching the final sixteenth and finished going away. SHEZAWILDSTORM secured inside position around the first turn and tracked
the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the final turn, had to wait briefly for a clear path at the head of the lane, tipped three wide and
given cue, responded and cleared second best. DEVIOUS DIVA was forwardly placed around the first turn, continued in striking range three wide up the
backstretch, moved up approaching the mid-way point around the far turn, dueled for the lead, battled on gamely into the lane, held a slight edge a furlong
out then got overtaken by the winner and flattened out. DREAMIN IT UP led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled
for the lead with a duo around the far turn, fought back a furlong out then weakened late. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS was forwardly placed around the first
turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the final turn then tired in the drive. TAP GALORE was not too far back being rated
between rivals up the backstretch, failed to move on when called upon around the far turn and steadily faded. THAT'S OUR VISION iron came unbuckled at
the start, was unable to correct equipment malfunction and trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE RUNNING OF THAT'S OUR
VISION, AFTER REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE IRON CAME UNBUCKLED AT THE START
