Footnotes
SANTINO'S FANTASY was kept close, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, engaged SWISS GUARD midstretch, gradually edged ahead inside the
last furlong and maintained control while wrapped up the final seventy yards. SWISS GUARD broke a bit inward, brushing MAJESTIC ATTACK, was sent to
set a pressured pace just off the inside, moved clear leaving the turn, took the rail in the lane, did not have enough left the final eighth but was easily second
best. ON THE MONEY RED dwelt at the start, spotting the rest of the field several lengths, advanced from outside, was four wide taking the turn, took over
third upper stretch then could only just hold onto his position late. AFTER MY BROTHER displayed early speed from inside but flattened out for the drive.
MAJESTIC ATTACK crowded at the start, raced in contention toward the outside, found himself boxed in behind SANTINO'S FANTASY on the turn, angled
out widest at the top of the stretch for a clear path but had little to offer.

Footnotes
SILVER EYES jostled briefly with HER SPEAKER'S ON as those two left the chute, stalked the pace while toward the outside, went for the lead three wide
on the turn, quickly moved clear leaving the quarter pole and held sway while kept to task to the wire. MORO MAESTRO prominent from inside, gradually
angled out taking the turn, came four wide into the lane, angled inside with a furlong left and edged ahead for the place as she closed the gap belatedly on
the leader. SPIRIT SMOKE came into contention three wide on the bend, fanned five wide for the stretch run, dueled for second but did not have enough left
in the late going. DERBY DAY GOLD hesitated at the break, saved ground taking the turn, angled outside rivals upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. SKIP TO BALI vied for the lead from outside, was two wide through the bend then gave way for the stretch run. HER SPEAKER'S ON soon
overcame jostling with SILVER EYES leaving the chute to vie for the lead between rivals, began to yield along the rail leaving the turn, angled out between
rivals inside the final eighth and continued to fade. CUPID'S HOPE also hesitated at the start and was never a factor. RAIN ATTACK soon retreated from
well off the inside, distanced herself from the field, finished the course and walked off.

Footnotes
C C RITHMS rated just outside the early speed, took over three wide on the turn, drew off upper stretch and kept PETE'S LEGACY at bay. PETE'S
LEGACY advanced three wide on the bend, swung outside OLD TOBY entering the lane, rallied belatedly and moved clear for second the final sixteenth.
CUTADAY broke a step slow and outward, was void of speed, picked up his pace from path three on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the stretch,
surged outside rivals and caught LELAND JOHN for third. LELAND JOHN soon moved clear of the rest, was overtaken from outside on the bend, no match
for C C RITHMS in the lane and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. RED ROIL failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. OLD TOBY went for the
lead just outside LELAND JOHN on the turn, did not stay with C C RITHMS leaving the bend, fanned outside that one into the stretch and steadily gave
way. HALF THE BATTLE broke outward, stayed off the inside came into the stretch from path four and had no late bid. SOLO TOURIST showed little. PLAY
THE BLUES moved to contention just off the rail on the turn but faded from between horses the last two furlongs. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN threw his head as
he was forced outward at the start, advanced from outside to be a contender four wide on the bend but faded for the drive.

Footnotes
JUST AT MIDNIGHT shared the lead from between rivals, did not stay with HEAVENLY SCENT into the turn, floated out to path four as she went for the
lead again entering the lane, moved clear and kept HIGHTAILING IT at bay under urging. HIGHTAILING IT well placed from inside, angled outside JUST AT
MIDNIGHT on the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch, loomed a serious threat inside the last eighth, leveled off in the waning yards but was
unchallenged for the place. TU ROYAL broke outward, bumping IMAGE OF CURLIN, was void of early speed, picked up her pace widest through the bend,
lost further ground fanning to the middle of the track for the drive and showed a willingness to run late. DRAGONFLY KISSES gradually angled out taking
the turn, came six wide into the lane and also rallied belatedly the last furlong. IMAGE OF CURLIN pinched briefly at the start, moved to the inside early on,
rallied along the rail upper stretch to gain a striking position but could not sustain her bid in the waning yards. SCRAPPY PATCH trailed from inside, lodged
a mild bid along the rail leaving the turn, swung out to path three for the drive, gradually improved position without threatening but was easily best of the
rest. STARSOVERPARADISE chased from well off the inside and was never a factor. HEAVENLY SCENT vied for the lead from outside on the backstretch,
moved clear on the bend, took the rail, was overtaken leaving the turn and faded through the lane. FERGIE ATTACK broke inward, also bumping IMAGE
OF CURLIN and showed little.

Footnotes
SPICY DELIGHT forwardly placed behind the early speed, went for the lead three wide on the bend, moved clear of LUCKSME inside the last eighth,
lugged in through the waning yards but held sway. CANTOO was a step slow at the start, advanced to outside to race in the second flight, did not keep up
three wide on the turn, fanned outside SPICY DELIGHT for the drive, drifted out slight upper stretch, was straightened, took over second inside the final
furlong, did not have enough late but proved easily second best. LUCKSME shared the lead from outside, moved ahead two wide on the bend, floated out
some entering the lane, was overtaken midstretch and began to yield soon after. FREE LOVE void of early speed, came into contention two wide on the
turn, moved back to the rail at the top of the stretch and also weakened the last furlong. WILDWOOD POSSE dwelt when the gate opened then broke
inward, gradually moved to the inside, was steadied in tight quarters along the rail leaving the bend and failed to have a significant stretch response. JOLIE
RULER steadily faded while toward the outside, stayed wide through the turn and had no stretch bid. MAMBA OUT was sent to dispute the pace from
inside, began to yield on the bend, faltered while just off the rail leaving the turn, was pulled up and walked off.

ARGYBARGY BUCK rated outside the early speed, commenced his bid three wide on the second turn, drifted out slightly upper stretch, edged to the fore
nearing the eighth pole and was challenged from inside with a sixteenth left, dug in and kept CHARM THE LADIES at bay. CHARM THE LADIES rated from
inside, fanned out entering the lane, split rivals three wide inside the final furlong, fought inside ARGYBARGY BUCK the last sixteenth but had to settle for
second best. WARNING LABEL was sent to vie for the lead outside MOCOWBELL on the backstretch, had a narrow advantage leaving the second turn but
slowly wore down two wide in the lane. KEEN RESPONSE a step slow at the break, was then steadied when MOCOWBELL came close, was settled
outside, rallied widest through the second bend, steadily advanced in the stretch but was too late. COPPER CROSSING raced in contention toward the
outside, lost some ground four wide taking the second turn then rallied belatedly the final eighth. PERFECT WAGER soon trailed, was just off the inside
through the second bend, angled out some upper stretch and progressed between rivals without threatening. DRAMA CRITIC broke outward, bumped then
jostled briefly with MOCOWBELL was settled off the inside, gradually advanced to gain a striking position three wide on the second turn, fanned out further
for the drive and began to yield. MOCOWBELL soon overcame jostling with DRAMA CRITIC at the start to gain the lead from inside, was challenged on the
backstretch and gave way along the rail through the stretch. CARTE BLANCHE chased from off the inside, angled in on the second turn and had little to
offer for the drive.

Footnotes
CLYDE'S GREEN GO stalked the early speed from just outside, took over when allowed two wide on the bend, moved clear, received one tap of the crop
upper stretch, received little asking after that and was much the best. WESLAN was bumped leaving the chute, trailed from outside, just off the rail taking
the turn, split rivals at the top of the lane, floated out slightly nearing the furlong marker, was straightened, took over second inside the last eighth, lugged in
through the late going but lasted for the place. I'M YOUR VALENTINE bumped with RHODIUMS PRIDE leaving the chute, moved outside at the end of a
quarter mile, lost ground four wide through the bend, jostled with MAMAS FIRE nearing the eighth pole, veered outward, was straightened and showed a
willingness to run deep stretch. MAMAS FIRE advanced from outside, was three wide taking the turn, altered out slightly when WESLAN came out upper
stretch, jostled with I'M YOUR VALENTINE and had no late bid. RHODIUMS PRIDE was bumped and forced into WESLAN leaving the chute, raced in
contention from inside on the backstretch but began to fade on the bend. XPRESSIR fractious in the gate before the start, broke on top, soon moved clear
of the rest, took the inside, was overtaken on the turn, no match for CLYDE'S GREEN GO when set down for the drive and gave way the final furlong.
