Footnotes
CURLINS INCHARGE broke a step slow, laid off off the pace two to three wide, moved forward approaching the far turn to track the leading pair from the
four path, chased into upper stretch, ran on between horses to offer a late bid, forged an advantage in the closing stages and held. HASKELLED laid
unhurried along the inside, advanced two to three wide and between horses entering the lane, tipped four wide in upper stretch, sustained a rally outside of
rivals to offer a late bid, but missed. WASHINGTON'S UNION laid off of the pace along the inside before moving between horses entering the backstretch,
awaited racing room behind rivals while saving ground around the far turn, slipped through rail quarters to launch a rally in midstretch, offered a late kick to
bid approaching the wire, but missed. FLASH OF GENIUS vied four to two wide around teh first turn, led into the far turn, met an outer challenge while
taking that bend in the two path, repelled that rival and shook clear in upper stretch, but drifted out while tiring in the final sixteenth and faltered between
bidders late. GOLDEN BUCK stalked five to three wide, bid outside of the leader and from three path around the far turn, got turned away in upper stretch,
sustained a chase in the final sixteenth, but steadied late when put to tight quarters. LEAD FOOT steadied when put to tight rail quarters inside of rivals
early on, lagged behind down the backstretch, rejoined the rest in the four path around the far turn, then improved between horses. ONE LAST BID tracked
along the inside around the first turn, steadily retreated to trail turning for home, then surpassed tired rivals. MR. FAVERSHAM broke a step slow, lacked
speed in the two to four path, fanned six wide into upper stretch and failed to factor. IBN AL ARABI prompted three two to wide and between horses early
on, stalked from the two path down the backstretch, chased between horses around teh far turn and gave way. TAP THE CANDY vied along the inside,
chased into the far turn, then faltered between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
MORUNNING pressed two wide, vied around the turn, assumed command nearing the lane, drew off under a mild drive and was geared down late.
MELLIFLUOUS lacked speed two wide, advanced in the three path nearing the lane, tucked to the inside in upper stretch, sustained progress to offer a rail
place bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled for that position and prevailed. DU MONDE took contact from an outer rival shortly after the start, pursued from
midpack in the four path, rallied to bid for place in the final furlong, dueled with inner rivals late but hung. BERNIN HOT bumped an inner rival at the start,
led from an outer prompter into the turn, vied around the bend, but proved no match for that one leaving the quarter pole, met bids for place on either side in
the final furlong and got bested. MARK UR WAY laid off of the pace in the four path and moved up. SESAME STREEK tracked three wide, chased the top
pair around the turn and faded. LATTA bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased along the inside and tired. HARBOUR BRIDGE was bumped between
horses and dropped back at the start, lagged behind in the three to four path and made little impact. CRUSADER CONRAD bumped with an outer rival at
the start and failed to factor along the inside.

ELEGANT TRIP laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted in while launching a rally entering upper
stretch, bid inside of the leaders passing the furlong grounds and edged ahead. ROWDY RIOT took back passing the five furlong pole, laid off of the pace
three to four wide, gained ground fanning to the six path entering the lane, rallied to bid in upper stretch, led narrowly into the final furlong but was bested by
an inner challenger. ROCK N ROLL BOLT broke outwardly, laid off of the pace three to two wide, got floated inwardly in upper stretch, then stayed on
willingly. ENTICE THE NATION dueled for the lead along the inside, failed to sustain the battle nearing the lane, shifted out to the three path entering the
lane, rebid along with rivals on both sides nearing the furlong grounds, but got outkicked then lost show late. TRUST ISSUES stalked two wide and between
horses, shfited out to the four path entering the lane but lacked a kick. CAPE MAELSTROM dueled for the lead two wide, led nearing the lane, but faltered
between bidders leaving the furlong grounds. NOBLE EAGLE tracked three wide, floated to the five path while between horses entering the lane and gave
way. DR TIMOTHY laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path into upper stretch but failed to factor. FLAME ROCK FIRE broke slowly and
got rank at the start, lagged behind into the turn and failed to factor. FORT SAM prompted between horses early on, checked back at the nine sixteenths
pole, stalked along the inside, gave way turning for home before steadying entering the lane and caved.

Footnotes
BRUNACINI broke inwardly, stalked closest to the embattled leading pair, bid outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, led leaving the quarter pole and
inched clear under a drive. AJAAYB dueled for the lead two wide, led as an outer rival bid turning for home, got headed leaving the quarter pole, yet kept on
well to remain clear of the rest. MULTITASK was bumped by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, stayed onto gain show at the furlong
grounds, dueled with an outer bidder late and held. EGLISE broke slowly, lacked speed in the four path, stayed on to bid for show in the final furlong, dueled
late but was denied. LOU'S LEGACY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted out to the five path entering midstretch and moved up.
BEAVER STATE broke awkwardly while last away, trailed in the three path, then improved position in the six path. GOLDEN SYMPHONY leaned into an
inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and failed to menace. AMENTUM chased from midpack along the inside and gave way. CARNITINE
dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but gave way with five sixteenths to go and weakened. HIGH FIVE SY made little impact four wide. MORAL DILEMMA
was very fractious in the starting gate before being backed out and re-cleared to go, bumped the inner stall door at the start, then was outrun along the
inside.

Footnotes
CALLIE'S GRIT set the pace along the inside, inched clear in the two to three path in upper stretch and held sway. PAINT ME PERFECT laid off of the pace
two wide and between horses, swung out to the six path entering the lane and rallied to gain place in the shadow of the wire. MAKE THE BOYS WINK
pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, tipped two wide nearing the lane, chased between horses to vie for place in
the final furlong but got outkicked late. BEST PERFORMER stalked along the inside, chased along the rail through the lane and needed more. NO FEAR
(BRZ) tracked two wide and between horses, ranged up outside of the leading pair around the far turn, fanned to the five path into upper stretch but lacked a
bid, bled. HONEY HAULER pressed two wide, failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch and yielded between horses late. EMBRACE ME saved ground off
of the pace to no avail. LADY JUNE trailed three to two wide and failed to factor. CATMINT stalked three wide and faded four wide around the far turn.
TOWHEAD lacked speed three to four wide, was eased and taken wide around the far turn, then jogged home.

Footnotes
GOURMET took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide, built a loose margin into the far turn and drew off then held sway under a drive.
SHE'S SO MALICE was off awkwardly and floated out, trailed early on, split foes four wide in upper stretch and rallied. PLAY MAKER pursued from midpack
to two four wide, got floated to the seven path entering the lane and ran on willingly. FASHION AFFIRMED broke a step slow, lacked speed, progressed in
the five to six path entering the lane and stayed on between horses. RETAIL THERAPY stalked three to two wide, chased along the inside turning for home
and gave way. COMPUTADORA failed to factor from the four path. HAND IT OVER tracked two to three wide, chased and faded. FANCY FASCINATOR
bumped an outer rival at the start, vied inside of the eventual winner early on, chased approaching the far turn and faded. SUCRE CECILE tracked along
the inside, came under urging three deep around the far turn and faded. MORE SPIRITS PLEEZ lacked speed along the inside, then faded between horses
around the far turn.
