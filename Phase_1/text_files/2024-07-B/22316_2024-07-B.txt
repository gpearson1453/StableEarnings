Footnotes
ADIOS BOBBY hustled early to take the lead, set a well rated pace while under constant pressure to midway on the far turn, opened a clear advantage
when called upon nearing the quarter pole and held that margin to the wire. VELOCE tracked the pace from the rail in a three horse duel in the second flight,
pulled away from those rivals while rallying on the final bend, cut the corner turning for home and finished willingly to be second best. J P CORNETTA
tracked the pace from between rivals for the first half mile and kept-on with a mild bid in the lane to be along for the show. SPETTACOLI (ARG) went evenly
without posing a threat. FUEL THE BERN pressed the pace to midway on the final turn and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
VERBAL GEYSER (FR) prompted the pace for the first half mile, moved to challenge on the far turn, took command turning for home, opened a clear
advantage in mid-stretch and held the closers safe. SHE'S GOT RHYTHM stalked the pace from the fence through the final bend and finished willingly
along the rail to be second best. PATH TO VICTORY unhurried early to be the trailer, commenced a rally in the far turn and split rivals turning for home with
a steady advance. GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME reserved off the pace for the first half, rallied from four wide on the turn to loom in upper stretch and failed to
sustain the bid flattening out down the lane. INDIAN SPIDEROO set a well rated pace and failed to respond when challenged nearing the quarter pole
fading through the lane. SWEET NOLA tracked the leaders from two wide down the backside and came up empty on the final turn.

SENSIBLE MARRIAGE reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied up the rail into the far turn, waited for racing room on the bend, angled four wide to
the clear at the head of the lane and closed well to be going away and geared down nearing the wire. SLAINTE MHATH set the pace through the first turn,
was taken in hand to settle to a stalking position down the backstretch, re-bid turning for home to take the lead in upper stretch and was out-finished by the
winner in a game effort. BELLA SKYE pressed the pace early, assumed command down the backside on well rated fractions and weakened in upper
stretch. SUSANOO unhurried early to trail for the first half, commenced an early bid into the turn splitting rivals in a drive and flattened out in the lane unable
to sustain the rally. VERSACE SUMMER tracked the leaders from the fence for a half and lacked a closing kick. GIO'S MY DAD broke awkwardly, was rank
early on and never posed a threat.

Footnotes
BOURBON BREEZE unhurried early to trail, circled six wide turning for home and closed well to be up in the final stride. CANDI GIRL pressed the early
pace to the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole, dug-in when challenged in mid-stretch gamely and was nailed at the wire. FLEUR DELACOUR
tracked the leaders from the rail, tipped out at the head of the lane to threaten at the eighth pole and was outkicked in deep stretch in a good effort.
YELLOW FEATHERS stalked the pace to the turn, rallied to striking position nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. PEACH PASS
set a pressured early pace and faded.

Footnotes
HAMMER LANE set the pace under pressure down the backside, opened a clear lead on the turn, maintained the advantage to the final sixteenth and held
the closer safe at the wire while tiring. GRAEL tracked the pace from the rail through the turn, cut the corner coming home , angled out in the lane and was
gaining with every stride late. ROCK WITH YOU pressed the pace to the turn, chased the winner in an early drive midway on the turn and finished evenly to
be best of the rest. BACKDOORPARTY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and showed some late interest in the lane. NAVY PIER raced
mid-pack throughout lacking a closing kick. THOUSAND LOVES stalked the pace from the inside through the turn and faded in the stretch. GOLDEN OAK
was not a threat. GET ALONG failed to menace.

Footnotes
NOBLE JON dueled on the pace for a half mile, opened a clear lead when called upon turning for home and drew off convincingly. CITY TRIPPER pressed
the pace from two wide exchanging the lead with the winner down the backside, battled head and head on the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane,
kept-on willingly but ducked in to bump COLONEL POPPY late in the lane causing that one to check sharply and finished willingly. LITTLE BIG reserved off
the pace through the turn, rallied up the fence in the stretch to be gaining late. TONY SMALL unhurried in the early going, circled the field turning for home
to loom large in mid-stretch and hung in the late going. COLONEL POPPY trailed to the head of the lane, split rivals in the lane to be rallying when rival
lugged-in to bump him severely causing him to check late in the drive. MIDNIGHT AMBITION stalked the pace to be well placed turning for home and
lacked a closing response. RECYCLE chased the leaders from three wide and faded in the lane. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE
RIDER OF COLONEL POPPY CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW CITY TRIPPER WAS DISQUALIFIED
AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S stalked the pace from the fence while well in hand down the backside, lost position on the turn, cut the corner coming home and closed well up
the fence to prevail late in the drive. YADI reserved off the pace to the turn, circled five wide on the bend to be prominent in upper stretch, took a brief lead
in the final eighth and was caught nearing the wire. RICHARD HOOTY unhurried for the first half mile, rallied on the turn in a drive and steadily advanced
belatedly in the stretch. CATATUMBO tracked the leaders from four wide down the backside, was hard to handle in the turn racing rank under restraint,
rallied to loom in mid-stretch and failed to sustain the bid. JEN'S SONG trailed to midway on the final bend, circled eight wide at the head of the stretch and
showed some late interest. VAN prompted the pace to nearly the quarter pole and gave way. PRACTICAL WAY set the pace under mild pressure down the
backside, held the lead to the quarter pole and tired coming home. VILLAGE PREACHER was not a factor.
