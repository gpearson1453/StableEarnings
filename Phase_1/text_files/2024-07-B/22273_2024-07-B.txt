Footnotes
FIFTY CINCO broke in a bit at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, recovered and was sent to establish the early lead, cleared into the first turn and
set the pace while off of the rail entering the backstretch run, was well rated while carving modest fractions nearing the half-mile, showed the way into the far
turn, was set down into upper stretch and drew clear nearing the furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and held in a drive over the oncoming
runner-up. RICH GOLD broke a step slowly and was unhurried away from the start, was caught a bit wide into the first turn and was allowed to settle into the
backstretch run, guided three wide into the far turn, swung widest into the stretch and mounted a five wide rally at the furlong marker, closed into the final
sixteenth but could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was second best. ACCLIDER was forwardly placed away from the start, a bit keen into the first
turn, tracked the modest pace from an inside path into the backstretch run, stalked the pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn
and chased nearing the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch, could not match strides with the leading pair into the final sixteenth and was
a clear third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) settled just off of the early pace and tracked from the outside entering the first turn, was well placed through the
backstretch run, chased four wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, continued that bid into the stretch and raced within aim at the
furlong marker, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and gave way. WARRENS WORLD got squeezed leaving the start and was away a bit
slowly, rushed up outside of rivals and stalked the pace into the first turn, attended to the modest pace through the backstretch run, prompted FIFTY CINCO
into the far turn, chased three wide nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
KNIGHTWITHLOUIS broke well but was having to be prompted to keep up with the early pace, was four wide down the backstretch run then went into a
drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, moved to the inside for the run through the turn then swung out three wide for the stretch run, was finishing well
despite running on the wrong lead to mid-stretch, then straightened out and drew away in the final yards. GRACIE'S BIG DAY broke well and took the lead
out the gate, joined at the five furlong marker by RUNNIN ON PROMISES, ceded the lead before the turn then took a stalking position just behind that one,
came back on passing the quarter pole, took the lead at the head of the stretch, kept on under steady handling but gave way the winner in the final sixteenth
while holding second. NEPHELE broke well, race five wide in the early stages and was tracking in mid-pack well off the pace but settled into a good rhythm
heading into the turn, went three wide through the turn then found clear running to the inside coming into the stretch, finished well under handling to gain
third with a distance back to the next horse. RUNNIN ON PROMISES stumbled at the start but recovered quickly and had a share of the lead by the five
furlong pole, took over the lead before the turn then tried to slip away from the field near the five-sixteenths but weakened after passing the quarter pole
then had little to offer in the stretch. A CLEAR BEHEST did not show speed from the break but held the inside position then made a forward move from the
half-mile marker then had to check approaching the three furlong pole, lost momentum and was unable to recover. SURF STAR lacked speed from the
break and raced near the rear of the field to the turn, came under a ride with three furlongs to run but had little to offer in the stretch. CHATTY
LEROYBROWN raced in the three path close up with the leaders through the early stages, started to weaken near the quarter pole and had nothing for the
stretch run. TRUZUL was outrun from the start, dropped to last and chased the field to the wire. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn
and was well handled along the bend, drew clear into the stretch, responded to urging past the furlong marker and extended the lead into the final sixteenth,
was hand urged in deep stretch and was geared down in the late stages to prevail as much the best. TOM'S REGRET broke alertly, took back off of the
early pace and tracked the leading pair heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, maintained an outside path
into the stretch and re-bid at the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch for the place honors.
BLEVYS TIGER took back off of the decent early pace and was allowed to settle, guided two to three wide along the turn, swung five wide into the stretch
and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. SMILING
MOLLY prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead to CHANCERY WAY and stalked that rival through decent fractions heading to the half-mile
marker, attended to the pace two to three wide into the turn, lost ground into the stretch and chased CHANCERY WAY approaching the furlong grounds,
could not muster a late response and gave way in the final sixteenth. DRAW ME unhurried away from the start, settled in the early stages and saved ground
into the turn, trailed nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and did not offer a late response. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROSES R BLUE was bothered at the start by CRY ME A RUNNER and broke a bit slowly, settled off of the solid early pace and tracked from the outside
heading to the half-mile, was guided three wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, loomed three to four wide into the stretch, took
command past the furlong marker, drew away under mild urging into the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep stretch as much the best. BRONZE
GIRL sent leaving the start, showed good speed and assumed early command, set a solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn
and was pressured by HER PERFECT VISION nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch, was confronted approaching the furlong marker by
ROSES R BLUE, met that rival's bid past mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the late stages for
second. CRY ME A RUNNER veered in at the start and bothered neighboring rivals, recovered to track the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground
into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the
winner into the final sixteenth and was outkicked for second, while clear of the rest for third. SAHARA SUE was crowded leaving the gate, took up sharply at
the start and spotted the field to begin, trailed heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn, could not impact the leaders into the stretch and
passed tired rivals in the late stages. TAKES A VILLAGE was forwardly placed away from the start, raced close up to the solid early pace, chased three
wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. HER PERFECT VISION broke through
the gate prior to the start, was away in good order and attended to the solid early pace, pressured BRONZE GIRL into the turn while outside of that rival,
was turned away into upper stretch and faded in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT CRY ME A RUNNER IMPEDED SAHARA SUE AT THE START AND COST SAHARA SUE
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. CRY ME A RUNNER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH. ADDITIONALLY,
THERE WAS A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SAHARA SUE AGAINST THE RIDER OF CRY ME A RUNNER, WHICH WAS
UPHELD. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
REEF CITY broke in at the start and made contact with PRIME TIME PORTA, then was outrun in the early stages but began to find best stride passing the
half-mile pole, angled to the inside and found a clear path through the turn, swung four wide into the stretch racing on the left lead, lugged out to mid-stretch,
then got straight inside the furlong marker and got clear, pulling away in the end. CARDINAL TRICK lacked any early speed, was allowed to settle and bided
time along the rail to the turn, started to run on from the three furlong pole, swung five wide into the stretch, had some trouble changing leads in upper
stretch but continued to gain ground and was able to grab the second spot in the final yards. RUNNIN UTE came away well and raced just behind the two
leaders, bid for the lead passing the five-sixteenths pole, and turned into the stretch on even terms with eventual winner REEF CITY but was unable to
match strides with that foe in the stretch, kept to task but was passed late for second. PRIME TIME PORTA broke outward and bumped into REEF CITY
after the break, then hustled from the gate but was outrun for the lead by DR.ONE, stalked that rival to the turn the bid for the lead near the five-sixteenths
marker, ran on well but missed out on a minor award while finishing well clear of the next horse. PARK ROAD COWBOY bobbled slightly at the break then
got into a tracking position before the turn, responded when put into a drive from the three furlong pole and loomed a threat passing the quarter pole despite
being five wide the flattened out in upper stretch and finished evenly. APLOMBADO was slow into stride and dropped far behind early despite the best
efforts of the rider, trailed the field to the stretch, kept to task and passed one late. DR. ONE rushed to the front, set fast fractions then weakened
approaching the quarter pole and hand nothing left for the stretch run. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WARREN'S WILD RIDE was allowed to settle and raced near the back of the compact field through the early stages, advanced through the turn while still
on the inside, responded when set down at the top of the lane, took the lead before the furlong pole and held to the wire to prevail. STYLISH DRESS came
away well then tracked behind ICY MISCHIEF to the turn, cruised in hand to bid for the lead approaching the quarter pole, the rider took a confident look
back at the top of the stretch, then had to battle a resurgent foe to the inside, came back on in deep stretch, outfinished ICY MISCHIEF for the place under
steady handling but came up short of catching the winner. ICY MISCHIEF broke sharply then opened up a clear lead and angled over to the rail before the
turn, fought off a bid from STYLISH DRESS at the quarter pole but left the rail open for WARREN'S WILD RIDE, drifted out a bit in upper stretch but kept on
well under steady handling and intermittent urging then weakened late and lost second to STYLISH DRESS in the final yards. HAPPY CHAPPY struggled to
keep up with the early pace despite cues from the rider, then was allowed to settle going into the turn, was set down from the three furlong pole, advanced
into contention near the top of the stretch but could not sustain the bid and finished evenly. RIVER OF AMBITION was not asked for speed from the break
took a furlong to get into a good rhythm then began to advance while hold the rail position, got close to the leaders approaching the three furlong pole then
came under pressure, struggled to keep up and was no factor in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

DANGEROUS GAME hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early going and stalked the pace into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, was roused into the second turn and took command at the quarter pole, raced in hand into the stretch and drew clear nearing
the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady handling into the final sixteenth, was a bit green into deep stretch but maintained a clear lead to the finish
and held sway. UPDRAFT allowed to settle in the early going while not far back, tracked the moderate pace into the backstretch run and was well placed
while between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, went two to three wide into the far turn and loomed at the quarter pole, chased DANGEROUS GAME into
the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on in deep stretch to secure place
honors. BEAU BRUME broke in a bit at the start but was away in good order and assumed early command, cleared the field into the first turn and set
moderate fractions into the backstretch run, led to the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the far turn and was overtaken by DANGEROUS GAME
nearing the quarter pole, chased the winner into the stretch, yielded in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while holding in the end for third.
MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY was forwardly placed in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the modest pace into the backstretch run, well
placed nearing the half-mile pole, saved ground into the far turn and lost position at the quarter marker, raced a bit in tight at mid-stretch, found room into
the final sixteenth but could not muster a late response. LIBERTY WOLF settled off of the modest early pace, was a bit green and hard to place while racing
behind rivals into the first turn, was taken to the outside entering the backstretch run, mounted a two to three wide bid into the far turn, shifted four wide for
the drive and lost ground at mid-stretch, could not find more into the final sixteenth and weakened in the late stages. NICE BOOTS off a step slowly leaving
the start, was hustled and rushed up to track the early pace from the outside along the first turn, raced close up to the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, well placed at the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, could not keep pace into
the stretch and tired in the drive. WHATAFOOLBELIEVES hesitated at the start, was away a bit awkwardly and spotted the field to begin, raced greenly
while trailing in the early stages, was put to a drive at the half-mile marker, lost contact into the far turn and did not factor. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
