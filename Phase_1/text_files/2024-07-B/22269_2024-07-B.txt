gamely in the final sixteenth and held on. FATIMA'S BLESSING raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied three wide in the
stretch, closed well late in the two path and was gaining at the finish. CITIZEN K trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole,
came three wide into the lane and closed well late outside. COLPO D'ORO raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly
between foes. WINNING FACTOR raced off the pace between rivals, then three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly.
IMMORTALIZATION stalked two wide, chased the winner on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly on the inside. VETERANS BEACH raced
off the pace inside, chased between rivals on the far turn and lacked a bid while racing behind horses most of the stretch run. GET BACK GOLDIE pulled
early, then tracked on the inside, steadied on the far turn and dropped back. CABINET PIK raced four wide on the first turn, continued with a wide trip and
faded. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH raced three wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten.
