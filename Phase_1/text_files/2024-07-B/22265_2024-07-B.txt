the lead midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. MAGICAL SURPRISE chased, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
CANDY FOR JUBA tapered in and rated the pace, kept the edge over the challenge of MAKIN' GOLD leaving the three eighths pole, was hand urged to
clear that one midway on the far turn, pressured further into the lane and drew away. The latter stalked from the three path, challenged toward the three
eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and held on for second. SCARE DEM
stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and flattened in the lane. TIME TO
CHOOSE settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
HAZEDNCONFUSED settled in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off
the rail on the far turn. HURRICANE ALERT stalked inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
ROOMMATE MARTIN angled in and stalked off the rail the first turn, moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled with the advantage from that
point, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, lugged in and exchanged light contact with BID ON BLUE leaving the eighth pole, dug in determinedly
from there and drew clear late yards. The latter set the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled at a slim disadvantage from that point,
contested near even terms at the rail on the far turn, was brushed lightly passing the eighth pole and remained a factor to late stretch before relenting.
SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn
outside and dueled through the stretch for third. RUDD'S ROCKET raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole
and entered the far turn about the six path, moved in through the turn and entered the stretch in the three path and was outfinished in the duel for third;
though finished well. MEGS GOLDEN BOY broke awkwardly and made contact with Ghostly Leo then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. TOWN HOT settled back inside and could only improve his position. BIG
BAD BRASS became fractious in the gate and raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the
rail on the far turn. GHOSTLY LEO broke awkwardly and was bumped then saved ground racing well off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, ran in the four path on the far turn and weakened. CANO'S BABY rounded the first turn in the five path, chased from the three eighths pole but
weakened in the five path on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Roommate Martin for interference
passing the eighth pole, lodged by the rider of Bid On Blue.
