Footnotes
STAR KANOO raced in the second flight early off the inside, came three wide for the drive, set down, kicked down the leader inside the furlong marker and
drew clear under continued firm handling. MOHAAFETH slow to start, continued to lag up the backstretch while well out in the strip, raced four wide when
beginning an advance through the turn, finished willingly to be well clear for the place while remaining out in the strip, not a serious threat to the winner.
BREAKING NEWS dueled up front while in the two path, disposed of the other speed late in the turn to be clear into the stretch, could not contain the top
two, comfortably saved the show. COUNTRY GUY in the second group early while inside the winner, was finished before a half, continued to fade stretch.
RISKY BOY dueled up front closest to the inside, stopped, well back.

Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN broke in the air to trail early, continued back while four wide into the bend, called on for run entering the stretch, displayed good resolve
down the middle of the strip to be up in time. LILY'S WOOFY broke well, pressured the leader while just outside that rival, continued to force the issue
through the turn, crept alongside and took over approaching the furlong grounds, put that foe away, led late, nailed in the final strides. RACEDAY ATTIRE
within striking distance behind the two frontrunners for a half, shifted out from the two path for room in upper stretch, lacked the necessary closing response
to finish up evenly. TRIPLE SCOUT away in good order, took control soon after, set a pressured pace for four furlongs, began to weaken when headed by
the runner up nearing midstretch. SAMARITA slipped at the start, recovered to move up to race within striking distance along the inside, was covered up in
some traffic late in the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive.

Footnotes
JET FLIGHT broke well from the outside, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, rated in the run up the backstretch, extended that
advantage by late in the final turn, held sway through the length of the stretch under steady handling. PALHACO hesitated at the break to spot the field a
couple of lengths, moved up while four wide to a forward position through the first turn, closer before a half, chased the winner into the stretch while
remaining outside, could not get to that one in the final sixteenth while remaining clear for the runner up positionb. JIM AND JIM tracked the winner from
along the inside, in some traffic along the rail with a half mile remaining into the far turn, continued to save ground through that final bend, went evenly
through the lane without seriously threatening the top pair. PERFUMER void of any early foot, swung out four wide when beginning to advance exiting the
final turn, lugged in past the furlong marker and flattened out. BLOOMING GARDEN pressed the winner for a half then began a steady retreat to trail home.

Footnotes
AHEADOFTHEGAME with the pace from the start, shook clear onto the backstretch just off the inside, set a modest pace the middle half mild, drew off
through the lane to win ridden out. JEFF THE LION lacked early foot, continued to race back into the far turn, managed an outside rally for the place through
the lane, no threat to the winner. STRONGER TOGETHER forwardly placed early, fell back a bit the middle half, came again for the show to narrowly gain
the nod. BANDIT SWANSON back off the early pace, advanced up the inside to a forward position by late on the backstretch, waited along the rail into the
far turn, fell back and went evenly through the stretch. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE chased the winner early, advanced and lodged a mild, brief bid into the far
turn, weakened from then on to the wire, lost show late. TRY TRY AGAIN was finished before a half, trailed in well back.

DARING DO within striking distance from the outside, three wide into the lane, set down for the drive, engaged the leader with a furlong to run and wore that
rival down under firm handling the held the runner up safe late. LAURA'S CHARM broke with the leaders, fell back before a furlong inside, continued to save
ground turn, cut the corner into the stretch to improve position, finished willingly while unable to get to the winner late. WIDE WEST (IRE) showed good
speed from between horses to take command just after the start, continued to show the way through the turn in the two path, responded when the winner
came calling in midstretch and proved stubborn until late. OEUVRE bothered slightly at the start, raced back as a result, continued to lack speed turn,
improved position through the lane, outside of traffic in the late going. RILEYS REDEMPTION forwardly placed along the inside early, steadied in some
traffic early turn, stalled through the remainder of the turn, within striking distance a furlong out in some traffic a furlong out, lacked a closing punch. FACCIA
BELLA off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, also lacked a closing kick in the late going. MOONLIT LADY last away to mid pack early, briefly
tapped the breaks early in the turn in some traffic, within striking distance when drifting in upper straight, went flat in stalling the final furlong. AMERICAN
STARLET broke out to bother an outer rival, lacked speed, five wide into the lane, roused, failed to mount a charge out in the middle of the course.

Footnotes
WILLIE BIRD unruly in the gate, moved up to take control soon after the start, set the pace inside, came in the two path for the drive while extending that
advantage, continued to lead by daylight past the furlong marker under steady handling, held the runner up safe late while wrapped up a bit in the late
going. C V SHACKLES broke well, relinquished the early advantage to the winner soon after, pressed that one into the turn, fell back off that same rival
exiting the bend, trying to get back the winner while fully extended. GOOD YEGG lacked early foot off the inside, was five wide exiting the turn, staged a
mild rally to be along for the show, no match for the top two. C SUITE BOY forwardly placed while four wide up the backstretch and into the turn, had little
left for the drive, outkicked for the show spot. CRUZIN N CURSIN in bit tight at the start, trailed for a half, picked off a single tiring rival while never a threat.
MY LAST ESCAPADE broke out, was straightened and asked for some run to maintain a forward position early, three wide into the inside, dropped in
toward the rail and began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE in some traffic early to brush with MONEY WAR, remained back into the turn, asked three wide to move between rivals into the
lane, moved out a bit wide, displayed good resolve down the middle of the strip to be going well clear late. ONE TIMER broke running from along the inside,
narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, continued to hold the advantage in the two path entering the straight, briefly responded when
the winner came alongside inside the furlong marker, could not match strides with that one late, fully extended to hold the place. MONEY WAR brushed
early with the winner, dropped inside turn, continued to save ground and rallied up the inside to annex the show, outkicked 2nd. MARK OF THE Z broke with
the runner up, vied outside that one and between horses into the stretch, gradually weakened through the lane. COMISKEY PARK last to leave, trailed most
of the way while saving ground, lacked a closing response. CYCLONE ATTACK with the pace while widest up the backstretch, got out a bit when beginning
to tire allowing the winner a hole turning for home, continued to weaken through the stretch.

Footnotes
MAQAMAT broke well, raced forwardly up the backstretch outside, moved at will to challenge three wide by late in the turn, dueled into the lane, disposed of
that rival upper stretch, not seriously threatened to the wire while under wraps late to win ridden out. ALYANAABI prompted the early leader from the
outside, fell back off that one a bit as well as the winner turning for home, battled back to gain the place while not a threat to the latter. IDEA MAN lacked
early foot, raced three wide through much of the turn inside of a rail, four wide entering the stretch, staged a mild rally to be along for the show.
UNCAPTURED PULSE also raced well back off the pace, four to five wide through the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. BOURBON
TEDDY restless in the gate, lost footing both front and rear at the break, moved up to a forward pocket by late backstretch, waited for room early in the turn
along the rail, fell back and was not a factor through the lane. ALPINE GHOST set the pace for along the inside, gave way when confronted by the winner
late
in
the
turn.

Footnotes
TIGHTROPE good speed from the start, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, spurted quickly clear early in the bend, sizable advantage into the lane
while still in hand, kept to task late in a solid effort. GRAND HIDEAWAY broke to to bother a couple of outer rivals, was straightened to settle well off the
pace inside, moved out for the drive nearing the furlong grounds, rallied through some traffic to be up for the place at the wire. THREEFIFTYSEVEN in mid
pack early toward the inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out and rallied from between horses to be closest to the winner late, nailed to the place
at the wire. DINOS DIXIE slow to settle while dueling inside the winner, fell back through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. PINBALLER off a step
slow, trailed early as a result, continued to lag through the turn, came five wide for the drive, lodged a mild, belated rally to improve. A P BLAZING GREEN
went one paced throughout while toward the inside. RIVZONAROLL bumped at the start, raced in mid pack for three furlongs, tired in the drive. DRAGON
DREW forwardly placed while outside, drifted a bit through the lane while steadily weakening. KENNESAW forced out and was bumped at the start,impoved
a bit the middle part then failed to make a further impact through the lane.

Footnotes
GRAYTANA broke out, was straightened to race forwardly early, fell back off the pair of dueling rivals into and through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive,
collared that pair and kicked clear. GET THE CANDY showed good speed away from the gate, dueled up front closest to the inside, edged away from the
other speed in upper straight, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the runnerup spot. BALI BABY lacked early foot, staged a late rally, angled
in and was in time for the show. RAMBERT broke well, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate up front through the turn, first to blink in upper
stretch, drifted, continued to tire to lose the show late. ADIVA settled in mid pack, went evenly throughout in lacking a closing response. NIFF broke back,
saved ground to no avail in failing to threaten while passing tiring rivals. ELLIE DELI in the main group early, began a steady fade before three furlongs.
SUMMER DAY four wide through the turn when off the pace, tired in the drive. APRIL'S GEM also raced four wide through the turn, remained back.
