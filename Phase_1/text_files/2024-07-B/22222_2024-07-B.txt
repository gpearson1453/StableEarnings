Footnotes
MONAASIB went five wide on the first turn, was never far off the pace, rallied into the second turn, challenged for the lead, dueled to late stretch and drew
clear. SEEHOSS got away well, stalked the pace in a good position, bid between horses into the stretch, was taken back near the eighth pole, altered
course and closed to get up late for place. BELLO CREEDO was hustled along to set the pace, raced in hand early, responded when challenged to duel for
the lead, weakened late and lost position. THE GREEN CRUSADER raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the second turn, swung wide
and finished well. RUN ROCKET was unhurried early, saved ground, ran up behind horses on the backstretch, was checked, bid along the rail into the
stretch and had nothing left. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE was steadied into the first turn, raced six wide down the backstretch, swung wide entering the stretch
and lacked a bid. COLOR FAST was through early and not urged late.

Footnotes
COPTER was quickly taken to the rail, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off entering the stretch for a clear lead, was fully extended and just held. B W
P SPIRIT was unhurried early, raced outside, rallied into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and was gaining late. ORDER UP raced
close to the pace near the inside, bid along the rail on the turn, shifted out at the top of the lane, finished well, didn't have enough late and settled for show.
MAGAWILDTIME stalked the pace, went four wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN pressed the pace
two wide to the turn, dropped back and went evenly late. HARDLY ABLE raced between horses, showed speed to the turn and gave way. THE FEATURE
broke slowly, raced in the back in an even effort and was outrun. TRUVY'S BANDIT was not a factor.

Footnotes
JOEY'S GAME lagged early while racing inside, advanced along the rail on the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily and got up in the final strides. DUSTIN
THE DIAMOND was unhurried early, rallied between horses on the turn to challenge, dueled through the stretch while being carried out and was outfinished
in a game effort. PURE MALICE stalked the pace while racing outside, assumed command on the backstretch, responded when challenged to duel for the
lead, drifted out in the drive and yielded late, grudgingly. PLAY MASTER stalked the pace while racing inside, was rated back, shifted out on the second turn
and offered a mild bid only. SABERMAN pressed the pace while racing in hand, bid along the rail on the turn and lacked a stretch response. Z'S GUITAR
showed speed to the second turn in a wide trip and tired. RUN ON ACES was not a factor. MAIN DUDE was hustled along to set a pressured pace far off
the rail, was headed on the backstretch, came again on the second turn and stopped. HUMOR ME PLEASE was outrun in a wide trip. STONE ALLIANCE
was not a factor.

SWEET ALEXIS set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. CZAR'S BALLERINA broke awkwardly,
stalked the pace while racing in hand early, saved ground, advanced into the turn to loom a threat, fell back, couldn't gain on the winner and held for place.
MAGNOLIA AVENUE raced close to the pace in an outside trip, fell back on the turn, went seven wide entering the stretch, closed well and was gaining for
second. PIP SQUEEK stalked the pace, was under a snug hold early, fell back on the second turn and came up empty in the drive. SIKARA SIKARA raced
mid pack, saved ground to the turn, angled out and lacked a bid. HOT PATOOTIE broke slowly and was not a factor. ZIPPING MOLLY was outrun.

Footnotes
EASY BET stalked the pace towards the outside, closed steadily, wore down DESTINY'S GRACE and inched clear late. DESTINY'S GRACE set a
pressured pace to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. HARD CANDY KISSES raced inside to the turn, angled out, bid four wide, came up empty and
settled for show. RAGAZZA was slow early, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR pressed the pace, bid off the rail,
had nothing left for the drive and gave way. NANNY'S HOUDINI was not a factor. VINCENT'S GEM was checked hard at the start, taken wide and passed a
tiring rival. CRIMSON GLORY pressed the pace along the inside to the turn and stopped.
