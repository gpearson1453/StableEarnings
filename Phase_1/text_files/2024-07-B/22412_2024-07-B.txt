Footnotes
RELIABLE SOURCE went to the front, set the early pace under pressure from both sides, dueled inside of MARGOT'S ANGEL while in the two path on the
turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, continued to duel while put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, brushed with that rival outside the furlong
marker, shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. BURIANA came inward at the start, showed
speed then pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back with five furlongs to run, fell well behind the top two while saving ground on the turn, moved to the
two path late on that bend, turned into the stretch in the three path, pursued the dueling leaders into the final furlong and got up for the place while unable to
threaten the winner. MARGOT'S ANGEL was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with five furlongs to run, dueled outside of
the RELIABLE SOURCE in the three path on the turn, continued to duel under a drive in upper stretch, brushed the aforementioned foe outside the furlong
marker, lost touch with that opponent outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened then was caught for the place while well clear for the show. MY SHOT broke
a step slow then was taken up with the left-rein while carried in, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the two then
three path, was driven into the stretch in the four path then drifted in and failed to respond. MARITAL TRUST came inward at the start, was urged along off
the pace, dropped back while moving from the inside to the four path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY GIRL coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging three to
four wide into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. SUN AND WIND leapt up at the start and conceded three
lengths to the front, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
FULIGNI broke in at the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid. TRY IT AGAIN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. GEORGE'S VICE coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from GHOSTLY GIRL to the
outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding command straightened away and tired. GOLDEN
DAGGER lost her rear footing at the start and conceded two to three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping four
to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
SHESALITTLE EDGY was bumped lightly at the start, moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was challenged near the
half-mile pole, vied inside to the two path while inside of a foe on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, shook
off opponents under a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. KILLY START was taken under a tight hold early, dragged
her way forwards under stout restraint outside the five-eighths pole, moved up while rank under a vigorous hold to race just off the pace, drafted inside while
leveling out on the turn, attempted to come through inside of the pacesetter into upper stretch, didn't have enough room then steadied, was roused shortly
thereafter, moved to the two path while chasing into the final furlong, dropped back towards the inside around the sixteenth-pole and gained willingly to get
the place. TOSCONOVA BEAUTY broke in then made light contact with a foe, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied
outside of the winner in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead
coming to the furlong marker and weakened while just able to get the show. GOLDCREST was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path for most of the
turn, shifted to the four path while roused late on that bend, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside of rivals into the final furlong and
was outfinished then missed the show while under a moderate hand-ride and being flagged with the crop late. FONTANAFREDDA tracked the pace on the
inside of a rival while loosely between horses, lost position from about the five-eighths pole into the turn, dropped to the rear in the process, was roused in
the three path on the bend, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. RIBOT'S VALENTINE settled off the pace, moved out outside the
five-eighths pole, chased in the four then five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, shifted in near the furlong marker and came up
empty.

Footnotes
FANCYPANTS JULIANA chased two then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, rallied in
tandem with LINARITE to overthrow the leader forty yards from home and battled to the finish to prevail gamely at the end. LINARITE coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to battle head to
head with her barn mate inside the final sixteenth and was ultimately denied at the end. A THOUSAND PLANS buckled at the start in the initial jump from
the gate, then established the front just after the break and cut the pace just off the inside and then along the inside, got roused taking the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught by a pair forty yards from the finish while safe for the show honors. PUNCH THE CLOCK coaxed from the
start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
kick. FABULOUS FOX coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide pulling on the bit keenly under the restraint of the rider, got set down angled four
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished in the late stages. DELIGHTFUL DIXIE hustled from the start, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. LADY JASMINE chased
along the inside patiently handled until set down angled three wide into upper stretch and then stayed on one paced through to the finish. ENFUEGA coaxed
from the gate, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
AMERICA'S VOW was hustled from the gate, raced in the two path on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, was asked in the three path on
the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead in the four path into upper stretch then shook clear, responded well in the final furlong
and proved much the best under steady urging. CENTRAL AVENUE angled in early, saved ground for most of the first turn then shifted to the three path,
settled off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and safely
secured the place while no match for the winner. SEDONA charged the front of the stall and was fractious in the gate, came away in good order, went
around the first turn in the three path, settled outside at the rear, dropped further behind the leader under urging late on the backstretch, was ridden along in
the three then four path on the far turn, came into the stretch in the seven-path while under a left-handed crop, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths pole
then was straightened by the rider and gained with late energy to get the show. CRUSHED ICE was restless in the gate then bumped in the hindquarters at
the start, went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was roused under threat
near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and tired. REGULATORY RISK broke hard through the front of the gate prior to the rest
of the stall doors opening, veered in then bumped hard with a rival and was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths despite leaving the gate first, saved
ground for most of the first turn then angled to the four path, dropped back in early on the backstretch, settled off the pace, moved closer near the
nine-sixteenths pole, chased inside to the two path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the three path under the crop and lacked the needed
response. SWEET MYSTERY was bumped very hard at the start then checked, spotted the front several lengths, dropped from the two path to the rail on
the first turn, raced in hand behind a foe onto the backstretch, settled last but one, was urged in the two then three path on the far turn, spun into the stretch
in the four path then drifted out and was no factor. STANDOUTSENSATION was held by the assistant starter after the stall opened and had her head-turned
completely to the side, came out well behind the rest of the field and was immediately pulled up by the rider then walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START, REGULATORY RISK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND MADE UNPLACED DUE TO BREAKING THROUGH THE
GATE PRIOR TO THE REST OF THE FIELD LEAVING. FUTHERMORE, STANDOUTSENSATION WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER

REINING FLOWERS settled unhurried near the rear of the field just off the inside through the first turn, tipped out three to four wide down the backstretch
before making her way back to the two path with seven-sixteenths to go, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away and then an additional path a furlong out, rallied offering up a good finish to just get
up in the final jumps to prevail over a trio going away with good energy at the end. GOOD LONG CRY established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under threat holding stubbornly until nailed in the final jumps to the finish. AS CATCH CAN saved ground near the rear of the field
patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing well through the final furlong and missed at the end.
OPULENT RESTRAINT (IRE) got bumped between foes at the start conceding two lengths to the front, raced just off the inside through the first turn and
then tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack down the backstretch, tipped back to the two path through the far turn and was let out spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick unable to go by the leader through to the finish and was outfinished in the late stages.
TWO TURNTABLES broke out at the start and bumped CORAL SEA, attended the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole before being set down just off the inside at that station, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going. CORAL SEA got bumped at the
start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and
improved position to the wire. OLIVIA'S POTION veered in at the start, got eased off the lead early on to track along the inside from a loose pocket and was
patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. NANANANABOOBOO broke in at the start hitting
the near side stall and then bumping OPULENT RESTRAINT into MCKINZIE'S GLORY and conceded two lengths to the front, chased two to three wide
until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
MCKINZIE'S GLORY got bumped at the start OPULENT RESTRAINT due to pressure from NANANANABOOBOO and conceded three lengths to the front,
chased two to three wide and then along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.
RAVENITE three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch
and tired.

SOUPER QUEST broke alertly then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path then shook clear, came under a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, swapped back to his inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and just held
under strong urging. OUR SHOT was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied along the rail into the final furlong, closed fast to make a
bid inside of the winner late and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. MID DAY IMAGE established a forward position on the outside, was
guided in outside the half-mile pole then well placed, saved ground while roused on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, swung into the
five path into upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to just miss while able to get the show. NOBALS stalked the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped behind the winner under a drive in upper stretch, kept on well in the
final furlong and just missed the trifecta. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) made light contact with a foe at the start, bumped soundly with a rival shortly thereafter
then dropped back while taken in hand, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two then three path on the turn, swung out into the six path into upper
stretch and gained with good energy but was belatedly on the scene. BOAT'S A ROCKIN bumped lightly with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the
outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped behind the winner in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, was given one final pop of
the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while tiring in the final sixteenth. THIN WHITE DUKE bumped solidly with opponents after the start
then was taken in hand, raced well off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the three then four path, came into upper stretch in the seven path and
gained late but failed to impact. STEP FORWARD bumped solidly with a foe early then checked sharply, spotted the front many lengths, angled in at the
back then dropped well behind, went around the turn in the three path, gained in the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and finished with
interest while behind traffic. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF STEP FORWARD CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST NOBALS ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE AFTER THE START. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
SCARAMANGA coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of FOR SOME REASON from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, collared the leader a furlong out, dug in tussling with that rival to inside the sixteenth marker, then inched
away to the finish. FOR SOME REASON got bumped at the start by QUICK HAMMER, who broke inwards, came under coaxing and showed the way in
hand just off the inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared at the eighth pole, fought on to inside the sixteenth pole before being shaken off in the
late stages while clear for the place honors. SOUTH STREET broke out at the start, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DEVIL'S CAY bobbled at the break and was brushed by SINFUL
DANCER, who recovered outwards from a stumble, but only conceded about a length to the front, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. QUICK HAMMER broke in at the start bumping FOR SOME REASON,
chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BLUE
PLATE SPECIAL broke last when off to a hesitant start and conceded six to seven lengths to the front, then chased sluggish early on four wide down the
backstretch, continued four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, made no impact. SINFUL
DANCER stumbled at the start, recovered outwards and brushed DEVIL'S CAY but only conceded about a length to the front, chased along the inside and
then just off the inside, tucked back inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. MUDVILLE NINE
coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths,
tipped four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
SILVER KNOTT (GB) came away in good order and went straight to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, controlled the action while
inside on the final turn, responded well when set down near the three-sixteenths pole, was put to a right-handed crop near the furlong marker and proved
best under steady urging. SOLDIER RISING (GB) dropped back after breaking at the rear then angled in, saved ground while settling near the back, moved
closer on the second turn, was well placed down the backstretch, chased inside on the final turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and proved no match but
willingly earned the place. STRONG TIDE raced in the three then four path on the first turn, settled on the outside, rounded the second turn in the two path,
tracked the leader on the outside down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner
to the finish and just missed the place. OHANA HONOR was hustled from the gate then taken in hand nearing the first turn, saved ground around most of
that bend then shifted to the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, went around the second turn in the three path, continued just behind the leader,
dropped back under urging in the two path on the final turn and lacked the needed response. ENGLISH CONQUEROR broke out at the start, tossed his
head while rank between foes in the two path on the first turn, settled more kindly down the stretch for the first time, traveled around the second turn in the
two path, continued at the rear down the backstretch, was urged in the two then three path on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up
empty.

LAUREL VALLEY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, remained patiently
handled and took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused nearing the eighth pole and edged away, then dug in and held well and safe to the wire.
SLAPINTHEFACE broke out at the start bumping SONIC SPEED, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MIRACLE MIKE shied out at the start filling the space left
vacant by MANNY PENNY, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. TWO'S A CROWD chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. SONIC SPEED got bumped at the start by SLAPINTHEFACE, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. DOLLY'S BANK got bumped at the start by MANNY PENNY, chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KINGDOM ON PAWS coaxed
from the gate, raced four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and made headway before
swinging six to seven wide at the head of the stretch, then weakened in the drive. SHPILKES coaxed from the start, raced three then two wide through the
first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. MANNY PENNY broke out at the start
bumping DOLLY'S BANK and then got steadied back conceding five lengths to the front, chased along the inside and then just off the inside, swung four
wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish and trailed throughout.
