Footnotes
LADY OPHELIA broke in, took control after the start, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set a relaxed set of fractions while still hand, responded
when the runner up came to challenge in upper stretch, held that one at bay while steadily drifting out six to eight paths. INDEPENDENCE WAY forwardly
placed along the inside, continued in hand while saving ground backstretch, brief wait in traffic late in the final bend, eased out and advanced on the winner
when straightened for home, dueled with that one to the wire, outkicked late while being floated out several paths. AIN'T NO LADY lacked speed along the
inside, continued unhurried while saving ground, staged a rally up the rail to annex the show late, no match for the top pair. BOURBON DIVERSION raced
off the pace and the inside, four wide through the second turn, roused for the drive, displayed some mild interest to improve through upper stretch then
flattened out a bit late. NO SHOW four wide in the first turn when in the second flight, crept a bit closer in the three path through the second bend and into
the straight, flattened out a bit the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. MINARI last to leave, void of speed, improved position through the lane, not a
serious threat off the inside. CHANGE ORDER in tight at the start, settled in mid pack, in some traffic into the far turn, came up empty for the stretch run.
RENDEZVOUS chased the winner for three quarters off the inside, had little left for the drive. CYNTHIA JUNE reluctant to load, tired. AUTUMN IN
VERMONT finished early, trailed home to be always outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP AGAINST THE WINNER, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

K P ALL SYSTEMS GO outrun early while saving ground, continued along the inside in the run up the backstretch while in hand, shifted out three to four
wide ion the second bend for room, set down for the drive, closed resolutely to be up in time. MY NOBLE KNIGHT in the second flight off the inside, chased
the winner into the stretch, reeled that foe in inside the furlong grounds to challenge, could not match strides with the winner in the late going. OPPOSITES
ATTRACT four wide through the first turn when with the main body, continued outside in that group the middle half, came three wide for the drive, displayed
only mild late interest to be outgunned by the top two at the wire. SUSTENANCE broke on top, clear before a quarter, extended that advantage in the run up
the backstretch, continued to maintain a sizable advantage into the stretch before folding up the final sixteenth. BRUCE BANNER chased, little left. MINE
RUN settled in mid pack early, finished after five furlongs. ROCKLAND EXPRESS lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally, little left. BOCA GUY last away,
trailed throughout, jogged in late after losing contact with the field through the lane.

BAND LEADER behind the pace while between rivals in a forward position, encountered some traffic late in the turn while remaining between horses,
shifted out when straightened for home in upper straight, roused, responded with good late energy to win going away. NO CENTS NON CENTS moved
outside to assume a stalking position for the run into the turn, moved closer by late in the bend, challenged inside the winner with less than a furlong
remaining, proved no match for that rival late while lugging in to bother BEN'S HERO in the final strides who was then forced to steady across heels. BEN'S
HERO prompted the leader for a half in the two path, bit closer late in the turn, fell back a tad in upper stretch then was trying to get back to that faltering
rival inside the furlong grounds when forced to steady across the heels of NO CENTS NON CENTS who was lugging in late. NONE THE WISER away in
good order, cleared to the inside to show the way into and through the turn, continued to hold the advantage past the furlong marker. WOW WHATA PARTY
within striking distance for a half while along the inside, lacked a closing punch when clear in the drive. PRETTY JIMMY off a step slow, failed to menace.
SINGULARITY shuffled back in some traffic soon after the start, lacked a closing response. MISTY RIVER broke slowly and remained back throughout.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BEN'S HERO AGAINST NO CENTS NON CENTS FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THRID.

Footnotes
BLAME THE CLOUDS forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground when inching closer through the final turn, moved out a bit for room late
in that turn, engaged the leader from the outside in midstretch and wore that rival down under steady handling. STAYINYOURLANE broke on top, set the
pace, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way into the straight, gave ground grudgingly to the winner while holding sway for the place.
MORTAL SIN in the second flight outside the runner up and between horses, moved with that same rival on the leader in upper stretch, stalled while drifting
out, in and back outside with a sixteenth to run, slowly gaining for the second spot late. STREET OUTLAW went one paced throughout, lacked a closing
punch through the stretch. AMERICAN DAY within striking distance off the inside, moved a bit closer in the three path final bend, flattened out in the final
furlong. COBBLESTONE BRIDGE raced back off the inside, also lacked a closing kick when asked. PEYTON'S DAY last away, remained back in lacking
speed, failed to rally as well. HOLLYWOOD HERO four wide in the first turn when with the main body, tired after a half. FLAT CAP was never a factor.
TRUE ACCOUNT prompted the runner up from the outside for six furlongs and stopped, eased under wire.

Footnotes
MERRY AND BRIGHT tracked the leader from along the inside in the second flight, advanced on that one and lodged a challenge along the rail turning for
home, kicked clear in a solid effort. SMARTEST void of speed just off the inside, angled out four wide entering the stretch, closed with good late energy to
be in time for the place, no real threat to the winner. TACO CAT BACKWARDS in mid pack early while four wide through the first turn, advanced and
challenged three wide late in the final turn as the winner was lodging a rail bid, quickly lost contact with that one approaching the furlong marker, could not
contain the runner up in the late going, well clear of the others. QUEEN IN THE DECK off a step slow, lacked speed, continued well back into the far turn,
staged a mild late rally to improve position, no threat to the top trio. SWEET AMBITION in the second flight for six furlongs while off the inside, had little for
the drive. MISS TAPATIA in the second flight early, fell back a bit the second quarter, came up empty for the stretch run. VICKI VALE lacked speed, failed to
respond when asked for the drive. FIVECLOCKSOMEWHERE popped stall doors, off a step slow, came in soon after, trailed most of the way in failing to
threaten. BODY LANGUAGE sprinted clear to set a modest pace while just off the inside, allowed the winner the rail exiting the final bend, stopped through
the stretch when headed by that one.

Footnotes
MASSIF unhurried early, moved outside, circled five wide into contention late in the final turn, extended stretch, proved best while fully extended in a
determined effort. COVERT KAT settled toward the front while saving ground, patiently handled through the second turn when covered up and losing some
position, eased out in the two path turning for home, hooked up with the winner nearing the furlong grounds, long duel to the wire, outfinished in the late
going, cearly second best. T REX in mid pack early, fell back while saving ground through the second turn, improved inside of several rivals entering the
stretch, shifted out a bit then continued to improve, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. HEAVY POUR went one paced while racing
off the inside, four wide through the final turn, in some traffic late in that bend then lacked a significant closing response when clear for the drive. STREET
ROCKIN back off the early pace, made an early move on the outside to reach a challenging position before a half, bid second turn, failed to sustain that
effort through the stretch. BLUE CREEK last to leave, trailed for over a half, improved by picking off mostly tiring rivals. Z DANCER away in good order,
narrowly set a pressured pace along the inside, gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. MORNING MARCH pressed the issue up front
in the two path early, fell back before a half, nothing for the drive. NERVES OF STEEL broke back, raced four wide through the first turn, lodged a bold
move four wide to a forward position before a half, five wide through the lane, gave way through the stretch. HYTECK PRINCE finished early, fell further
back, well beaten.

Footnotes
CAROLINA HIDEAWAY reluctant to load, outrun in the early going, asked along while three wide into the stretch, angled inside of the group of forerunners
past the furlong marker, took over, edged clear. SPLASH OF JACK within striking distance toward the inside, moved out, three wide into the lane, roused,
finished willingly in the late going to be up for the place. THY NAME IS WOMAN last away, raced back, inside by cutting the corner into the lane, reached a
forward position with less that a furlong to run, narrowly missed the place. LA BEFANA settled off the pace while well out in the course, four wide turning for
home, lacked a closing kick. DAISY MY NAME bothered just after the start, void of speed in trailing early, continued back through the turn, improved a bit in
the driving without posing a serious threat. HAIL NO balked at loading, chased the early leader, challenged upper stretch, dueled, led a furlong out, faltered.
FIRST TO ARRIVE bothered early, was never a threat. MY SOFIA ROSE broke alertly, sprinted clear, set the pace four three furlongs, dueled into the
stretch off the inside, gave way nearing the furlong marker. SECESSIONIST came out early, bothered outer rivals, in mid pack for three furlongs, gave way.

Footnotes
INCINERATOR closest to the early leader, prompted that one into the turn, fell back off that same foe in the two path through the bend, shaken up turning
for home, rebid between horses a furlong out, proved best under firm handling. RENNIE back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, rallied,
not enough for the winner late, clearly second best. DUCKPINS lacked speed inside, slipped through along the inside to improved midway on the bend,
continued mildly to the wire to finish up best of the others. ORANGE JUICE within striking distance early, fell back turn, two path into the lane, improved
slightly, no real threat. GET THEM DIGITS last to leave, reamend back while four wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. WHO KNOWS tired while racing three wide. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way into the turn,
extended advantage late in the turn, gave way the final furlong when headed by the winner.

Footnotes
AWARD TOUR (IRE) was settled back early, advanced on the far turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, came wide into the lane and made a bid and
drove clear and moved in leaving the furlong marker and was clear to prove best. IDA BOSS was reserved two to three wide, then advanced four wide by
the quarter pole, came six wide off the bend and then finished well to be clearly second best. TRES FRANCAIS tracked the pacer from the inside, then
moved off the inside on the far turn and then came two wide off the bend, then was blocked and bumped with HURRICANE BON by the three sixteenths,
then was in traffic by the furlong marker, split rivals by the sixteenth pole and got the show award. SATISFIED was settled three wide, advanced three wide
on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had no punch in the drive. BOSSY BOOTS was reserved early, on the inside, moved out leaving the turn
but was blocked nearing the furlong marker, then had no room by the sixteenth marker and then improved late in traffic, brutal trip. HURRICANE BON was
allowed to settle on the inside, swung out two wide leaving the turn but was bumped by the three sixteenths, then moved back to the inside and got thru by
the furlong marker but needed more late. LA TACHE chased the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead off the turn but
weakened in the final furlong. INSTPARTY prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead but weakened in the drive.
MANITOULIN ISLAND was taken back early and showed little. AWESOME MOON set the pace on the inside and gave way on the far turn and stopped.
