GO LEE ANN GO raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the
five path coming around the second turn, drifted in in upper stretch, brushing with STRABELLA in the process, swerved in sharply near the eighth pole,
drifted out again late, bumping with ELEGANCE N TONIC while dueling to the wire and got the head bob for the win. ELEGANCE N TONIC saved ground at
the back of the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch, gained ground, drifted in in the
final sixteenth, bumping with GO LEE ANN GO near the wire and dueled from there to just miss. KOOKYBERRY saved ground early, chased the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, raced in tight quarters in upper stretch and kept on from there.
WITHHERBOOTSON saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second
bend and improved position in the lane. FACTOR THAT raced in the two path around the first bend, led the way up the backstretch and around the far turn,
steadied slightly in traffic near the eighth pole and weakened from there. STRABELLA raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid headed into the far bend, continued in the four path from there, raced in tight quarters in upper stretch,
brushing with GO LEE ANN GO and was outkicked in the final furlong. ANA raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the four path and never threatened. ON SPEED DIAL raced in the two path around the first bend, continued in the middle of the
pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was empty in the stretch. SASSY MAMA raced in the three
path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded in the lane. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH RUN. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF HORSE THREE, ELEGANCE AND TONIC, CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST HORSE FIVE, GO LEE ANN GO, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE

Footnotes
CLIFF DIVER raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and dug in
gamely to the wire to get up for the win. TWOKO BAY raced in the three path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far
bend from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late to just miss. LORING PARK saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the
inside up the backstretch and around the far bend and dug in gamely to the wire to just miss. BOURBON AFICIONADO raced in the two path around the
first bend, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and improved position in the stretch. SKIPPY'S STRIKE
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. CRAFTY KING
saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and weakened in the lane. FLY
NIGHTLY saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far bend and made no bid.

path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DARNQUICK drifted in in the opening strides, bumping with BLUESKIESANDANGELS and CAJUN HOPE, shook clear to lead the way up the backstretch,
opened up while racing in the two path around the turn and held a fair margin to the wire. SCOOTER'S BOY raced at the back of the pack on the outside
through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. COPANELLO BAY raced
at the back of the pack on the inside early, continued around the bend in the three path and improved position in the stretch. JUST PLAIN ORNERY raced
off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and made up some ground in the lane. IN HONOR OF AUTISM raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and showed no kick. BLUESKIESANDANGELS was forced to
jump up check early when DARNQUICK came into his lane, hitting the rail and causing his rider to lose a stirrup, recovered to settle off the pace on the
inside for the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. CAJUN HOPE raced in tight quarters and bumped with multiple horses in
the opening strides, chased the leaders from there, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE
OPENING FURLONG. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF HORSE THREE, BLUESKIESANDANGELS, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FIVE,
DARNQUICK, CITING INTERFERENCE EARLY IN THE RACE. UPON REVIEW, HORSE FIVE, DARNQUICK, WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST
FOR INTERFERENCE WITH MULTIPLE HORSES.
