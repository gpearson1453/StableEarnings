Footnotes
SPIRIT OF VICTORY tracked the pace from the rail, bid inside of the pacestter in upper stretch, took over near the eighth pole drove clear. DREAM
DIAMOND set the pace in the two path, led to midstretch and held well clear of the rest. RED HAIRED GAL raced off the pace two and three wide, steadied
near the five-sixteenths marker, shifted further out and was along for the show. NOUVEAU RICHE saved ground off the pace, swung out turning for home
and lacked the needed rally. PRINCESS OPAL trailed in the three path while a bit rank around the first turn, moved up some at the rail around the far turn
but lacked a closing bid. TIZ ERIN chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. NEW BABY raced up close three and four wide and faltered in
the lane. LADY LYLA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CAJUN GAL was outrun inside. SPANISH GIRL played no factor while racing four
wide. TAPPING GIRL chased the pace four wide and retreated after six furlongs. MRS BRADSTREET had early speed three wide and was through after a
half.

Footnotes
CALYPSO CHARLIE was hustled along while in range from the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, kicked on from the three
path entering the lane, inched forward in the final strides to nail the drifting outer pacesetter at the wire. LUKAS PRINCE showed the way in the five path
before merging into the three path while being roused into the turn, ran on to maintain a firm advantage turning into the stretch, but drifted out to the seven
path in upper stretch, and was nailed at the wire by an inner foe to place. SOUPER SUNSHINE was reluctant to load, stalked the pacesetter in the six path,
received a right handed cue in the four path midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and kept on for show. DON'T ANSWER had a
slow start and raced wellback in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, angled out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and stayed
on. SERGEANT SINATRA had an awkward start and bumped an inner foe, rated in the three path, was coaxed between foes in the four path around the
three-eighths mark, tipped out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and improved but made no impact. BLACK SEAL tracked in the four path, came
under a ride in the three path going into the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and mildly gained, but did not factor. CANDY STREET
got bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path but flattened from the four path in the stretch. VIVA VICTORY trailed in the five
path early and never threatened. HERMOSO HOMBRE chased in the five path but weakened around the turn.

NO ACTION hit the starting gate and steadied at the start, dueled at the rail throughout and dug in gamely to prevail. PHAT CHANCE FANCY stumbled at
the start, was bumped on both sides immediately after, dueled outside of the winner throughout and kept on well to hold second between foes. KAITIE KAIT
bumped at the start, chased the pace two and three wide, rallied outside of the top two but could not get by. MOON ROSE was bumped between foes at the
start, saved ground off the pace and had a mild gain. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL was bumped on both sides at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three
wide near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. NOBLE DREAMER prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. DEVRA
WARRIOR was bounced around at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER failed to menace while racing four wide.
MANGROVE MAMMA was very fractious in the gate, bumped hard at the start, trailed throughout and was eased in the stretch.

BOSTON ROSE (IRE) laid off the pace in the four path, was roused into the far turn, ranged up to bid passing the quarter, took command from the three
path at the top of the lane, and drew clear. HOCKEY showed the way in the three path, was roused from the two path early around the far turn, faced an
outer challenger passing the quarter, lost the lead in upper stretch, but chased home the winner to hold place. FREE TO ROAM tracked in the three path,
received a right handed cue in the two path entering the far turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, but flattened for show. LADY O'BRIEN rated
in the two path but did not threaten. SAUCY SIX trailed throughout from the four to five paths.

faded in the stretch. DEFENDED failed to menace while racing four and five wide. NIGHTSABER (GB) played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY RASCAL stalked in the five path, steadied early into the turn, was coaxed from the four path midway around the turn, swung from the five path
into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, and inched ahead late. JUST RELAX led inside early but steadied awkwardly to lose the lead early into the turn,
tipped out to the three path midway around the turn, rebid in the four path entering the stretch, ran on to reclaim the lead passing the eighth pole, but was
caught by an outer foe to place. LET'S GO LIAM was hustled from in range in the two path, driven along the rail around the turn, cut the corner to bid in
upper stretch, and kept on to split place. ZIZKA chased in the four path, got floated out to the six path midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path
at the top of the stretch, and mildly stayed on. KING ZAYDEN pressed in the three path, inherited command while under coaxing in the two path early
around the turn, floated back out to the three path at the top of the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. WIN WITH FAITH tracked inside, angled out to the
six path in upper stretch, but failed to bid. SWEET LAZARUS raced wellback in the two path, was cued in the four path midway around the turn, but never
threatened. NEOSTAR broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path, took some awkward strides early around the turn, and
failed to menace. GODWIN steadied at the start and always trailed. NEOEQUOS got bumped hard by an inner foe at the start and lost the rider, completed
the circuit, was caught shortly after and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWADS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE START.

Footnotes
CATTIN set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. LORENZ (BRZ) chased the winner in the clear in the three path, could not reel in that
foe but kept on for the place. YACOWLEF (IRE) saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally at the rail for the show. TREASURE KING chased the pace
four wide and finished evenly. UNO TIGER was unprepared for the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. TIZ THE
BOMB failed to menace while racing two and three wide. HAKKIMI (CHI) chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
BREEZERO laid up close inside, received a right handed cue but got stymied while along the rail midway around the turn, angled out passing the quarter,
bid while getting floated out to the six path turning into the lane, took the lead before the eighth pole, and drew clear. DOWN IN THE BAYOU rated inside,
was coaxed along the rail around the turn, swung from the three path into the stretch, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for
place. HOLY COFFEE bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside passing the three-eighths mark,
tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but lost the lead, and evened out for show. EVANORA chased in the four path, loomed three wide under
coaxing midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, began to flatten, and had to steady before the sixteenth. MISS BEE HAPPY
bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was roused while three wide passing the quarter, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the
lane, but failed to bid. THREE GIRLS tracked between foes in the two path, had to steady going into the turn, got shuffled back, and did not threaten.
SUMMER GOLD stalked in the three path but faded between foes passing the quarter.

Footnotes
ONE SHARP COOKIE pressed the pace in the three path, took over approaching the three-eighths pole and drew off while being ridden out. BLACK FURY
was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the rail, was no match for the winner but kept on to be clearly second best. RAGING FURY was pinched
back at the start, trailed outside, advanced four wide around the turn and bested the rest in the lane. CROSS HASTE raced in range three wide and lacked
the needed rally. VIDIANO bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. DR BAYTER was squeezed back at the start, saved ground off the
pace, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths pole but never reached contention. REBELDE failed to menace while racing five wide. ROUKI broke in and
bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
BET STORMY stalked in the three path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, and kicked on to draw past the inner
pacesetter in the final sixteenth. TINTA ROJA set the pace in the two path, was nudged along and opened slightly around the turn, floated out to the four
path under a ride turning into the stretch, inched further clear passing the eighth pole, but was caught in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place. BRITISH
EMPRESS chased in the three path, was driven from the six at the top of the lane, and kept on while on her left lead for show. GHOSTS LIL SECRET rated
in the four path, merged into the two path approaching the far turn, swung from four path under a drive turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. MAKIA
raced wellback in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. MISS CASSIDY tracked in the two path, but lost
ground along the rail around the far turn, and flattened. SPICY GUACAMOLE raced in midpack from the four path but did not threaten. ELECTRIC
RUNNER raced off the pace inside and was no factor. MISS SPITFIRE had an awkward start, got rank around the first turn to move into range while under a
hold in the four path entering the backstretch, but weakened turning into the lane. AMANDAANNADREW trailed out in the six path and never menaced.
WINDRUSH prompted the pace from the three path turning into the backstretch but backed up early. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
