GOVERNOR SAM established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail kept to task. TEST SCORE crossed to the
two path briefly carrying in KY ANANSI, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch, altered out a path inside the three-sixteenths and offered up a mild kick. NO EVIDENCE chased four then three wide striding green
early on, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, lugged in just inside the
three-sixteenths forcing TEST SCORE to alter out and kept on to secure the show honors. AFTER TAXES (IRE) broke out at the start brushing KY ANANSI,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened. DEW chased just off the inside and
then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. KY ANANSI got brushed at the
start by AFTER TAXES and then carried in briefly by TEST SCORE, grew detached at the tail of the field when devoid of speed and chased just off the
inside and then along the inside, continued inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout. Please note a head on replay including the far turn and stretch

Footnotes
IT'S HOT IN HERE (IRE) moved in while taken in hand early, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the middle of the field, saved
ground while roused on the far turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths pole then brushed with the
runner-up, dueled inside that opponent in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. DEA MATRONA (FR) moved in while taken under a
hold, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was urged on the far turn, shifted to the three path near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied to make a bid in
upper stretch then brushed with the winner, dueled outside that foe to the finish and was denied while clear for the place. FROM HELLO had her
head-turned at the start but broke with the field, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, gained into upper stretch then moved out, pursued the top
two into the final furlong and flattened out while clear for the show. WINGS LIKE EAGLES saved ground on the first turn, was taken in hand off heels near
the five-eighths pole while reserved off the pace, went two then three wide while roused on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. BACKSTRETCH ROSE dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the
final turn, spun three wide into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths pole and failed to threaten. MAGIC EIGHT BALL quickly sped clear,
traveled around the first turn in the two path, opened up a sizable advantage, raced inside on the far turn, shortened stride in the two path into the stretch,
was collared by the top two inside the three-sixteenths pole and tired. ALLEY'S SONG was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early, rounded the
first turn in the three path, settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and was no factor. UNICORN CAKE was hustled from the
gate, went around the first turn in the two path, followed the clear leader from second, was urged along late on the backstretch, pursued the pacesetter in
the two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside near the three-eighths as the runner up advanced outside and was placed to
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail.

under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away in the late stages kept to
task. CHATEAU hustled from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn, got set
down taking the two path into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on safe for the place honors.
HONORARY DEGREE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
tipped out a furlong out and brushed with EMERALD FOREST, then kept on to secure the show honors. LAFITTE'S FLEET got steadied after the start

backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, tipped
out one more path straightened away and kicked on belatedly to the finish. EMERALD FOREST got steadied after the start losing two lengths of position

Footnotes
PRINCESS MADISON chased the pace on the outside from third, moved closer in the four path on the turn, made a bid in the five path at the quarter-pole
then took the lead in upper stretch, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. ROSWELL settled off the pace,
gained while roused in the three path on the turn, shifted to the five path late on that bend, made a bid in the six path into upper stretch, fought outside of
the winner in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. CARA'S TIME was hustled from the gate then chased the pace on the outside, made a
bid in the three path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the five path, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the top two
but finished with good courage to just get the show. SAM'S TREASURE settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was given her cue in the
three path at the quarter-pole, chased the top two in the stretch and just missed the show. WAILUA was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved
up under urging on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. TRICKY TEMPER
broke a bit slow, settled near the back under some urging, was ridden along in the two then three path on the turn, floated into the seven path entering the
stretch and failed to threaten. BRODERIE stumbled at the start, was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch
in the six path and was no factor. RISK FREE was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and showed little. DO GOODER was fractious in the
gate then bobbled while breaking in front, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked under heavy
threat near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and faded.

ROOT CAUSE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside patiently handled, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go, slipped away to the eighth pole, dug in and held on to prevail. CHILD OF THE MOON (FR) along the
inside through the first turn, tracked from just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch,
closed well to the finish but was ultimately staved off to the finish. VINO ROUGE just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. DETERMINED LILLY just off the inside
through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. ANY PORT just off the inside in pursuit, tucked inside through the far turn and came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. ANILEATE just off the inside through the first turn, chased
four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and made no headway. MORE MANGO three wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AUNT YOLA was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid with three furlongs to run, vied in the three path on the turn, dueled
with the runner-up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GEOPOLITICS broke out and bumped with a foe, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, dueled with the winner to the finish and just missed while able to get the
place. HEART OF THE NIGHT showed speed then dropped just off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch
and finished with good courage to safely secure the show. BAREFOOT DISCO settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path late on the
turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and improved position. SPLASHY bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was roused three then four
wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. STARSINTHECITY was bumped on both sides at the start then was squeezed back in tight quarters, moved
from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and also improved position. CERRETTA was ridden along on the outside,
traveled around the turn in the four path and failed to rally. BETTER BE SMART was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and
lacked the needed response. LA FIERE settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. ARIANA RYE settled
on the inside, saved ground while dropping back on the turn and came up empty. RUSSALITE settled towards the back, went around the turn in the four
path, turned into the stretch in the six path and was no factor. LIL' HAYADOIN settled just off the pace, was roused in the three then two path on the turn
and failed to respond.
