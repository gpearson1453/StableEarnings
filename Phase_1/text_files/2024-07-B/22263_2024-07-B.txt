Footnotes
INTOLERABLE was reluctant to load, saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, swept to the front in
midstretch and drew off under a drive. FIRST SHOT FIRED bumped with GOWOKEGOBROKE after the start, raced in range three wide, advanced outside
down the backstretch, bid two wide around the far turn, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and was clearly second best.
PARAKEET (IRE) saved ground well off the pace, was in tight between foes around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and rallied between
foes for the show. BUILDER JAK raced off the pace two and three wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. MILCHIN stalked the pace two and three wide,
had the rider drop the crop near the quarter pole and faded in the lane. ALBERT SON bumped at the start, raced two and three wide in midpack and lacked
a closing bid. WILD CHARM saved ground and failed to menace. UZZIAH had his head turned at the start and was in tight soon after, raced three and four
wide and never threatened. GOWOKEGOBROKE was bumped off stride at the start, bumped again soon after, moved two wide to the lead, drew clear
down the backstretch, led at the rail into the far turn, yielded midway around the turn and retreated through the final furlong. FIGHT TIL DAWN was bumped
at the start and made little impact while racing three and four wide. GO GO SANTI set the early pace along the rail, chased inside around the far turn and
wilted in the drive.

Footnotes
LETS GO KOKO tracked in the two path, was coaxed passing the three-eighths mark, angled out passing the quarter, swung from the seven path turning
into the lane, and rallied past an inner foe in the closing stages. MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA got bumped by an outer foe going into the first turn, then again
by another outer foe midway around the first turn, stalked in the four path, was ridden three wide into the far turn, bid while floating out to the six path at the
top of the lane, ran on to take command just after the eighth pole, but was caught by a late charging outer foe in the closing stages to place. BONMATI
bobbled at the start but recovered well to show the way in the two path, was roused while just off the rail when challenged midway around the far turn, dug
in from the two path in upper stretch, lost the lead just after the eighth pole, but held show. GRIDLOCK prompted the pace in the three path, bid between
foes while two wide and under a ride midway around the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. SINGING SANDRA
bumped between foes going into the first turn, trailed in the two path, was coaxed from the three path early around the far turn, but weakened. REPAYNT
bumped with an outer foe going into the first turn, then again with another outer foe midway around the first turn, rated in the three path but never menaced.

ALESS QUEEN set the pace in the two path and drew off while drifting out badly under steady right-handed urging. R DISASTER was very reluctant to load,
had early speed inside, checked while racing greenly near the eleven-sixteenths marker, angled out to stalk the winner in the three path, could not keep
pace with that foe but stayed on to hold well clear of the rest. FIVE EYES ONMICHEL chased the pace four wide, lacked a rally but bested the rest. UNION
HARMONY failed to menace while racing two wide. FUSSY GIRL chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. BASILICA LIGHT hesitated at the
start, ducked in soon after, trailed throughout and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
ALPHA BLUE set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue passing the quarter, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, dug in on his
left lead, and held sway. BERNARDO'S LEGACY laid up close along the inside, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, cut the corner to bid in
upper stretch, and ran on, but was denied by the outer pacesetter to place. MISTER COOPER bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was
ridden from the rail around the turn, angled out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. FLASHOVER bumped between foes at the start,
tracked in the two path, was roused into the turn, but finished evenly down the stretch. WICKED PHANTOM bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed
inside and made no impact in the two path down the lane. PERSONAL DRAMA stalked in the five path, received a right handed cue passing the quarter, but
flattened. JAKE'S AFFECTION was prompted along from in range in the four path but faded. SVAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in
the two path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. BLAME DENNIS pressed in the three path but backed up around the
turn. TRU KATZ bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
PERSONAL CHOICE pulled between foes early to set the pace in the two path, waited confidently along the inside rounding the turn, kicked away in upper
stretch, was roused just before the eighth pole, and held firm. ALL CLASS tracked in the two path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, floated out
to the five path entering the stretch, and chased on for place. MAJOR PRYCE rated inside, was roused from the three path passing the three-eighths mark,
swung out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and was along to get up to split show honors. ADIOS BABE raced off the pace in the four path, advanced
under a ride around the turn, but flattened in the stretch to split show. UNRELENTLESS trailed in the three path, floated out to the nine path in upper stretch,
and never threatened. BROWN EYED BEAUTY laid up close along the inside but weakened around the turn. PRETTY'N AWESOME prompted the pace in
the three path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
COMO saved ground off the pace, swung out turning for home, causing HEGS to clip his heels, rallied three wide and forged ahead in the final sixteenth.
ARISTOTLE saved ground in range early, advanced two wide around the far turn, bid between foes near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked late.
MONEYLOVE set a clear pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead and weakened late. IBRAHIMOVIC had his head
turned and hopped at the start, raced well back three wide and rallied belatedly. CENTERFOLD GUY failed to menace while racing three wide. THREE
WELLS tracked the pace inside, steadied near the quarter pole and faded in the lane. ARTEMUS WIZARD was outrun while racing four wide. HEGS was
forced in at the start, raced in range three wide early, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, was about two lengths behind the leader turning for
home, clipped COMO's heels when that foe swung out abruptly, nearly the lost the rider and was eased from there. SIR ASCOT checked soon after the
start, raced two wide and never factored. GENUINO hesitated at the start and was outrun inside. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT NEAR THE QUARTER POLE AND REVIEWED OBJECTIONS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF HEGS AGAINST COMO AND LODGED BY THE
RIDER OF THREE WELLS AGAINST ARISTOTLE, BOTH FOR INTERFERENCE LATE ON THE FAR TURN. THEY DISMISSED THE LATTER FOUL
CLAIM BUT UPHELD THE FORMER AND DISQUALIFIED COMO FROM FIRST TO EIGHTH FOR INTERFERENCE AGAINST HEGS TURNING FOR
HOME.

Footnotes
LEGACY ISLE chased in the six path, ranged up under a drive in the five path approaching the quarter, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
kicked on while on his left lead, and drew past an inner trio while drifting out in the final sixteenth. LORD MILES laid wellback in the four path, floated out to
the six path midway around the turn, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. SHAQ DIESEL stalked in the four path, was
under a hard drive rounding the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, kept on to bid on his left lead passing the eighth pole, but hung late for show.
POSITIVE REVIEW tracked in the two path, was coaxed between foes passing the three-eighths pole, but got stymied passing the quarter, split foes in the
two path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on but was out-finished. GOLDEN GLIDER rated in the two path, came under a ride while tipping out to the
four path entering the turn, angled out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. BLACK BELT laid up close in the three path, was roused
to bid nearing the quarter, kicked on to take command in the three path at the top of the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. BIG AND CLASSY prompted
the outer pacesetter along the inside but weakened in the stretch. LOVE ME NOT raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened. CHROME
GHOST set the pace in the two path but yielded at the top of the lane. THE SKIPPER TOO trailed throughout around the three path.

Footnotes
SWAN LAKE set the pace in the two path, drew off around the far turn and widened under a mild urging. WICKED GENIUS saved ground in range, could
not match strides with the winner but kept on to be clearly second best. UNCLE ARMANDO raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the
show. NIGHT JUMPER raced in range three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. BRINGER OF RAIN raced two wide in midpack, angled
to the rail midway around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. BURNING MAN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BRYCE CANYON was
outrun inside. ACAMAR pressed the winner in the three path and retreated after a half.
