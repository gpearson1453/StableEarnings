Footnotes
CRESSONS LIL CHARM went to the front to an unchallenged lead through the final turn then was challenged by outside rival and was headed at the eighth
pole, dueled to the wire and won the nod. SWIZZLECITY stalked the pace from two wide through the final turn then engaged the leader and took a narrow
lead at the eighth pole, dueled to the wire but lost the photo. C C'S COWGIRL raced off the pace from two wide down the backstretch then made a mild bid
on the final turn but was no match for the top two. MY MY hopped at the start and trailed the field to the final turn then moved up and showed a late kick in
the stretch to be best of the rest. I DONT KNOW EITHER raced near the back down the backstretch, went three wide around the final turn but was never in
contention. SUPER ET saved ground to no avail.

LITTLE BURRITO hustled along to share the command from two wide to the quarter pole then kicked clear to prove best. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS rushed
up to share the command from the inside to the quarter pole then chased the winner home and was second best. LEPRECHAUN CHARM broke well then
settled off the pace from four wide through the turn, made a mild gain on the place position and was best of the rest. JANIS tracked the leaders from three
wide but never made a bid and tired. MDA SENORITA RUN trailed the field to the turn then saved ground on the turn but was not a threat.

Footnotes
LIFE ON THE NILE went to a clear lead through the final turn then was headed at the eighth pole while trying to avoid loose foe and was able to hold on for
the win. CONTRABANDISTA tracked the leaders down the backstretch then moved up from three wide to engage the leader at the eighth pole and matched
strides to the wire and just missed. BENZODINI raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the final turn, tipped out
to three wide at the quarter pole and made a late rally for the show. DABOOGEYMAN prompted the pace from two wide to the three furlong marker and
weakened. ROULETTE stalked the pace from three wide but lacked the late response. CHROME RUN raced off the pace on the inside to midway through
the final turn and gave way. NORTHWIND went five or six wide into the first turn then settled near the back and was not a factor. PRINCE SIMBA was
allowed to settle around the first turn and trailed. ROYAL DE BE hopped at the start and unseated his rider, walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
START OF RACE, AFTER A REVIEW IS WAS DETERMINED THAT ROYAL DE BE WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
BROADWAY PEARL raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, moved between horses at the three
furlong marker then shifted out to three wide in upper stretch and drew off. SHEZA CAT hesitated at the start and trailed the field to the three furlong marker
and made a mild bid on the final turn, angled out to mid track in upper stretch to make the late rally. GYPSAN was allowed to settle around the first turn then
moved up on the final turn but ran into traffic at the eighth pole, made a late four wide bid to just miss the place. PNEUMA raced near the back down the
backstretch then advanced on the final turn, tipped out to six wide in upper stretch and gave a late kick but was not enuf. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT stalked
the pace from three wide around the first turn then moved up to engage the leader at the half mile marker and fought gamely on the fina turn but faltered.
MEGANS MILLIONS stalked the pace from three wide but ran into traffic in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. SISTER SAINT raced near the back on
the backstretch. MISS CHARGE IT rushed away to the lead but floated out on the first turn, prompted the pace down the backstretch, moved up to
challenge on the final turn but weakened in the stretch. SHE'S EXTRA raced off the pace on the inside to the top of the stretch and lacked the late
response. RIVER'S END raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn and retreated. NATURAL TOUCH tracked the leaders from two wide to the final
turn and gave way. SWIFT RED BIRD inherited the lead on the first turn when MISS CHARGE IT floated out, then kicked clear to the half mile marker, then
slowly faded and tired.

BEER CHASER stalked the pace from three wide to midway through the final turn then moved up to engage the leader near the eighth pole and dueled to
the wire inside of GOLDEN QUALITY under a determined ride. GOLDEN QUALITY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out to four wide at the
quarter pole and engaged the leaders, dueled outside of BEER CHASER to the wire and was denied. JULIA'S WARRIOR raced in the middle of the pack to
midway through the final turn then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and gave a late kick and saved the show. EGO raced near the back down the
backstretch then advanced from two wide on the final turn, shifted in at the eighth pole but was outkicked. JUST BATTLE went to the front to co-lead from
two wide to the three furlong marker, inched away on the turn but was eclipsed at the eighth pole and gave way. BIG POWER RED trailed and was not a
factor. AWE SHACKLE co-led from the inside to the three furlong marker, fought gamely around the turn but tired in the stretch.

up in the final jumps. EASY BIG BOY pressed the pace from the two path through the final turn then took the lead near the eighth pole but was caught in the
final yards to be second best. HEZA PICKLE raced off the pace on the inside to the quarter pole, angled out to three wide in upper stretch to make a late run
but was outkicked in the final yards. GUITAR BOY raced in the middle of the pace through the final turn then moved out to five or six wide in upper stretch to
finish strong but was not enough. FREEDOM FACTOR stalked the pace from three wide to the half mile marker then moved up to engage the leader after
the quarter pole but tired. ROBO rushed up to a pressured lead on the inside to the eighth pole and gave way. FEDERAL HILL was allowed to settle and
