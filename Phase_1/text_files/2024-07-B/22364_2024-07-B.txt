Footnotes
CONFUSING took control right from the start, clearing to the rail taking this field into the first turn, improved the advantage while unchallenged by the half,
comfortably was rolling along around the far turn, was asked for more in upper stretch, had something left for the drive and easily won under basically a
hand ride. CHANCEL was under a tight hold watching the loose frontrunner down the backstretch, tried to reel in the winner with a quarter mile to go, could
not narrow the margin in upper stretch and just held on for the runners up share at the wire. CANTUCCI stalked in the third flight outside in the early stages,
was roused for more, to go after the front two three furlongs out and finished up, gradually gaining on the place award but just ran out of ground at the finish
line. BET N WIN hopped on the break to trail into the first turn, improved outside foes along the backside, made little progress on the lead trio in the final
turn and was one paced in the lane for a minor role in the end. VINCENZINO stalked on the third flight nested on the fence, travelled in mid-division on the
rail down the backside, lost ground to the leaders while taking the shorted way around on the far turn and failed to menace in the drive to the wire. LUCYS
CHILD had a rail trip near the rear in the beginning, could see the field by the half, was scrubbed on with rivals on both sides three furlongs out and had little
to offer in the running down the lane. BAYTOWN ELVIS was situated between rivals close to the back in the first turn, continued that position through the
back straight, tried to offer a rally three wide outside horses with three eighths remaining but made little impact on the far turn and never was a factor in the
stretch drive outside rivals.

KITTEN'S ROMANCE was unhurried early on the be ahead of only the poor starter in the first turn, quickly circled rivals four deep at the seven sixteenths
marker, seized control outside a quarter mile from the wire and won going away impressively at the finish line. GABBY SQUARED stalked on the rail in the
third flight down the backstretch, hugged the fence when things got tight three eighths from the wire, chased the top two on the final bend and closed in late
to get the runners up share. LADY IN RED assumed command from the onset, dictated terms up front along the backside, was collared outside by the
winner at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and faded late to lose out on holding for the place share. TEXT ME UP stalked between runners in the
third tier in the early stages, was in tight quarters when the field bunched up three furlongs from home, lost some positions around the final turn and
re-rallied on the fence to settle on the fringes in the end. FRANKIE'S GIRL travelled four wide outside all rivals in the first turn, settled three deep outside
foes in mid-pack down the backstretch, was shuffled back for a moment at the seven sixteenths marker, recovered to rally four wide around horses at the
three furlong marker to be in range for a piece of the prize turning for home in the four path but failed to fire to the wire. ENGLISH BISCUIT chased the
pacesetter while quite keen down the back straight, was checked briefly in the three path with three furlongs remaining and yielded between horses in the
two path by upper stretch. ANTIGONE travelled in the two path stalking close to the rear in the early stages, was checked while in the three path nearing the
three eighths marker, losing momentum around the far turn and made little presence in the stretch running. UMNEYAAT was away poorly to spot the field
many lengths into the first turn, trailed throughout and could not overcome the start to be a factor in the stretch drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING
#1 UMNEYAAT ON THE BREAK RESULTED IN #1 UMNEYAAT BEING DECLARED A NON STARTER AND MONIES REFUNDED. RIDERS CLAIM OF

Footnotes
FASCINATION STREET was nestled on the rail, watching the engaged duo down the backstretch, was asked for more while on the fence with three
furlongs to go, closed the gap smartly at the top of the lane, shifted just out from the rail at the furlong marker with run and powered on by at the sixteenth
pole for the victory. BOSTON BAY was pushed out on the break, stalked outside foes near the rear, began to start a rally outside midway on the turn to pass
runners, was fanned out widest in the six path with a head of steam and was full of run late, to surge near the wire to get up for the place share. UNCLE'S
THE BANKER prompted the pace inside, shifted out to chase the pacesetter throughout the turn but on the outside this time and finished up willingly in the
three path to hold on to the show money in the end. UNSTABLE STORM seized the lead on the break, opened up mildly with three furlongs to go, continued
to set the pace around the tun, began to get leg weary, clinging onto the lead inside at the eighth pole and tired late, losing a couple of placings at the wire.
SQUEEZETHESHARMAN broke out on the start, settled three deep in midfield along the backside, was roused on the turn but with little response and was
one paced in the stretch. PANYARD TAP tracked two wide with runners on each side down the backstretch, was hard ridden between foes in midturn,
retreated when behind a weakening runner at the quarter pole and could not be a factor in the stretch running. CANADIAN DADDY was near the rear inside
horses down the backstretch, was taken a hold of when stuck behind runners on the rail at the three furlong pole, shifted out at the quarter pole to be four
wide for the drive but could not get involved in the run down the lane. CHEAP SPEED tracked three wide outside rivals at the half, offered a mild run
chasing the top pair at the three eighths marker but folded in the three path between runners at the furlong marker. STOLZER ONKEL was forced out on the
break, trailing down the backside, lost touch with the field around the turn and galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
SCAT FACTOR moved forward between foes entering the first turn to vie for the lead, settled inside a rival but just off the fence content to press up the
backstretch, took the lead by the three-eighths, was put to moderate urging, kicked clear turning for home, widened when asked in mid-stretch, held safe
and was eased up nearing the wire. PERFECT PLAY settled inside at the rear, was off the fence late on the far turn, angled six wide leaving that bend,
kicked on to secure the place while no threat to the winner. TRINITY PARK broke in just a bit, had good position outside mid-division, stalked three wide into
the far turn, moved out four deep when ridden by the five-sixteenths, was within range at the quarter pole but failed to rally. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER broke
in just a bit, angled in and was ridden a bit but lacking early speed bringing up the rear two to three wide into the first turn, continued at the back, swung
eight deep turning for home, passed tired rivals. BAR TALK moved forward four wide outside foes on the first turn, took the lead outside the three-quarters
and forced the pace up the backstretch from outside, weakened in the stretch. HAAHEE tucked in from four to three wide at the back on the first turn, settled
at the rear, was ridden along past the three-eighths racing three wide, moved out six wide by the top of the stretch, failed to threaten. THIS KATZ FOR
REAL was a bit headstrong into the first turn and taken back off the leading pair racing just off the fence, tracked those from inside, moved out at the top of
the stretch then faded.

Footnotes
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY was under a tight hold on the fence in the first bend, galloped along, rating kindly behind the leaders down the backstretch, waited
behind the front pair on the far turn looking for room, found a seam in the two path straightening out for the drive, shifted in to the rail with a furlong to go and
battled on the fence to wear down the leader in deep stretch for the win. CLASSY WHISPER stalked between horses in the third flight in the early stages,
made a sharp move at the quarter pole shifting out around rivals to be gathering momentum in the six path for the stretch drive, closed with a rush but just
missed with a late surge for the win at the finish line. WILBERFORCE prompted the pace outside in the early going, watched the pacesetter into the
backstretch, re-engaged for the lead by the half on the outside, dueled for the front throughout the far turn outside of a rival, emerged with a clear lead in
upper stretch, dug in at the eighth pole but could not fend of the winner inside but determinedly stayed on between foes to save third money at the wire.
MEDIA SENSATION settled three deep in mid-division down the backside, was scrubbed on three wide through the far turn taking closer order outside,
posed a threat with runners on either side five wide turning for home and with a gritty effort to the wire battled gamely for a share but had to settle on the
fringes in the end. LION KINGDOM was unhurried to trail in the beginning, co-trailed on the outside with a half mile remaining, made little impact three wide
around the final turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and passed tired runners down the lane. SPRING MOUNTAIN bobbled slightly on the break, stalked
outside in the third flight, improved along the backstretch to track the contesting leaders outside at the half, was in the hunt in the four path between horses
turning for home but wilted in the final sixteenth. GREEN FLEET travelled on the rail in the third flight in the early stages, started to commence a run but
lacked running room when behind horses at the quarter pole, finally shifted out from behind rivals at the furlong marker but could not offer a rally in deep
stretch. JAMIESTA was ahead of one foe at the start, co-trailed on the inside by the half, had little to show for around the final bend and could not reach
contention in the stretch running. STYLISH GENT pulled the rider to the lead in the first turn, opened up mildly into the backstretch, was hounded outside by
rival at the half, dueled on the rail in the far turn, had no more to offer losing its path on the fence in upper stretch and stopped at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
IF YOU INSIST broke in just a bit but got away alertly, soon led and was coaxed clear, set the pace up the backstretch racing nearer the rail, spurted clear
turning into upper stretch and put to stronger urging, held safe while being kept to the task. CLIVE CROSS settled well back two to three wide, bided time till
late on the turn, angled six wide by upper stretch then was forced out a bit further, rallied widest eight deep before lugging in late when clear of others to
secure the place. HANLAN tracked in between foes and in behind the leader, was encouraged along chasing three wide midway on the turn, put to stout
urging by the top of the stretch while floating out a bit wider, failed to rally, just saved third. RED IN FRONT settled at the back inside on or just off the rail,
came out four to five wide in upper stretch, rallied mildly between foes but missed show honors. FOREST WOODSMAN was well-placed in behind the
eventual winner tracking that one's pace from inside, saved ground, failed to rally. ONTARIO HOLIDAY settled at the back, shifted out in upper stretch then
back in near mid-stretch, ran on but needed more. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE was up close pursuing the pace three to four wide, put to urging on the turn,
drifted wider in upper to late stretch, came up empty. SIR TIBBS chased from outside mostly four to five wide, faded.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN BEAST was unhurried early on, settling near the back in the early going, followed the path of a rival making a move outside at the three eighths
pole, angled out widest in the six path when full of run and blew past the boys at the sixteenth pole for the victory under a well timed late rally. WHERE IS
ESSA travelled outside runners in midfield, started to rally outside three furlongs from home, loomed boldly in the five path between foes at the top of the
stretch, was no match for the winner outside but did fight on to secure the place share by a nod at the finish line. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ was off slow on
the break to trail in the beginning, settled on the fence in midfield down the backstretch, rallied smartly on the rail at the quarter pole, found a seam three
wide turning for home and battled on stubbornly for the place share but lost in a photo at the wire. DREAM ON BABY was bounced around at the start
between rivals, afterwards had an ideal trip watching the front three slugging it out down the backside, moved in by the quarter pole but was pinned in,
behind the tiring leaders in upper stretch, finally had clear room in the five path with a furlong to go and finished with good energy to get a minor share of the
prize in the end. SERENADING HALL broke with the field, then had little turn of foot to trail down the backside, still could see the pack on the turn, shifted
outside, six wide for the drive to the wire and passed the tiring early three speedsters who were dueling early on. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE broke out at the
start, vied between runners down the backstretch, stubbornly dueled with horses on both sides throughout the turn, had no more left in the stretch drive and
wilted two wide between foes with a furlong remaining. HE'S FULLY LOADED was jostled on the break, prompted the pace three wide down the
backstretch, poked his head in front for a moment three wide outside at the quarter pole and was the first of the early speed trio to give way to others in the
four path at the furlong marker. YORKVILLE had a slim lead on the fence down the backstretch, continued to fight it out just in front of the outside rivals
around the bend, dug in on the rail for a while in upper stretch on the fence, could not find more late and folded up in the final sixteenth to the wire.

Footnotes
PROFESORRIDESAGAIN was loose on the lead inside on the first turn, was unopposed up front along the backside, was headed outside at the quarter
pole, spurted away mildly by mid-stretch and prevailed by a nose while drifting out driving to the finish line nearing the wire. VINI VIDI VICI tracked the
frontrunner on the rail in the early stages, shifted out to bid two wide at the quarter pole, chased the leader while encouraged right-handed in upper stretch,
began to move in with a vigorous hand ride in the final sixteenth but could not get past at the wire by the shortest of margins. QUANDALE stalked near the
rear between foes two wide, improved smartly through runners along the backside, was nudged three wide, moving closer in the final turn, closed in under
right-handed urging in the two path at the furlong pole and got up, right at the wire to capture the show award. ASHUKA settled on the fence in midfield on
the first bend, moved closer on the rail to track in the third flight inside with three furlongs to go, edged closer on the rail by the quarter pole, shifted out
under left-handed asking in mid-stretch, jumped the tire tracks approaching the sixteenth pole and was caught right at the wire when easing up late due to
the leaders drifting out when crossing the finish line. INDY COWBOY was floated out five wide prompting the pace early, settled three wide near the rear
down the back stretch, improved smartly, saving ground on the fence in the far turn, battled inside for a small share in upper stretch but evened out late.
ROCK IT RED sat just behind the pacesetter between runners in the two path in the early stages, chased the top pair three furlongs out, angled outside in
the four path battling for the show money in upper stretch, could not continue late with others and faded at the furlong marker. OH PEANUTS was away
poorly on the start to trail by many, continued in last down the backside and did show some run down the lane to pass tired runners inside on the fence with
a sixteenth to go. HEY LUIGI settled three wide outside foes behind the leader in the first turn, could not match strides with others and was shuffled back by
the half, was roused but was going the wrong way through the far turn and had nothing to offer in the drive to the wire. LEFT IN MY DUST was away
awkwardly on the start to only be ahead of the rival who was off poorly on the break as well, made no impression down the backside and had nothing to
offer for the stretch drive. KING VIDA had some trouble navigating the first turn going four wide near the back of the pack, made a brief run around foes
three wide at the three eighths marker, could not continue on by the quarter pole and emptied out by upper stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING
THE START OF #10 OH PEANUTS WAS DECLARED TO BE A NON STARTER AND ALL MONIES REFUNDED, RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 VINI VIDI
