FADE TO GREY coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside
through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted out straightened away, edged clear under
a drive and held well and clear to the finish. SAVE TIME coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside into the first turn before tipping three then four wide
through the latter portion of that bend, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, shied out under a left handed crop and ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the
rest and along second best. GOODNIGHT MY ANGEL coaxed from the start, chased three wide through the first turn and then three to four wide down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path with half a mile to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
REFUSE TO LOSE bobbled slightly when coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide through the first turn before taking to the rail through the latter
portion of the turn and into the backstretch, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BELLACOSE displayed speed while sent hard from the start, angled in while going to the front then showed the way, controlled the action while inside on
the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole, drew off under the crop into the final
furlong, widened under a solid hand-ride until about the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. VEHEMENTE showed speed after
breaking alertly, was taken in hand off heels while crowded against the rail and beaten to the front near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased in the two path on
the turn, pursued the winner while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. BUBBE DEAREST was ridden
along well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the final furlong and narrowly earned the show. TRAIL OF GOLD was last to commence,
angled in towards the rear, was ridden along well off the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and just missed the show.
PAWTUCKETSHUFFLE was ridden along at the rear, raced in the three to four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to threaten.
LIGHTNING MAMA was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to rally. PRACTICALLY
SUMMER was ridden along on the outside, moved closer in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. AILANI chased the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
MALU coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn advancing to duel with the leader from the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command a furlong out and drew clear under a drive to prevail. DASHING DELLA established
the lead after a brief pace dispute with a pair, showed the way in hand three then two wide, had the aforementioned foe advance outside and dueled with
that rival from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, continued to knock heads and was displaced at the eighth pole, dug in under
threat getting collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the place honors. SHARPER GAL got bumped at the start by PERMED, who recovered outwards
from a stumble, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. ACCELERINA coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. TOOT YOUR HORN chased two to three wide down the
backstretch tossing her head unsettled facing kickback, got guided out five wide through the turn in the clear coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. PEBBLE LANE coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, got eased home through the final furlong. PERMED stumbled and struck the off side stall at the start
before bumping SHARPER GAL but lost only about a length or two to the front, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish.

VALUE AREA lost her footing slightly at the start, bumped lightly with a foe shortly thereafter then was squeezed back between opponents, angled in at the
rear, rounded the first turn in the two path, moved up with six furlongs to run to race just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, was given a tap of a down-turned crop from the right-side inside the three-sixteenths, switched to
a left-handed crop in pursuit of the leader coming to the furlong marker, drew alongside that foe in the final sixteenth and got up at the finish to narrowly
prevail. A PRIMERA VISTA was hustled to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way off the rail on the backstretch, vied two path to the inside
on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop while off the inside in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth, raced
under a strong hand-ride from that point to the wire and was denied while well clear for second. ICHIBAN bumped lightly with the winner just after the start,
raced in the four path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was coaxed along late on the backstretch, chased in the four then three path on the
far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. PROMISEHER AMERICA rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside,
was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the three then two path on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and had nothing left.

DECK OF CARDS was hustled from the gate then drifted out while going to the front, sped clear then showed the way off the inside, went around the turn in
the two path, spun three wide into the stretch under some urging, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging.
I'M BUZZY was urged along at the rear, moved from the three path to the five path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and improved for the
place. KILLY START was urged along off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased inside on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
weakened while clear for the show. THERESASILVERLININ was urged along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back while
remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and tired. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE dropped back while hard ridden on the outside, moved from the five path to the
three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and was no factor. OBRIGADA was carried out early then chased the leader on the outside,
went around the turn in the three then four path, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SHE'S AWESOME was hustled from the gate then
urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the stretch and capitulated. ICY REPLY
had the rider lose both his irons at the start, regained the right-iron near the three-quarter pole then the left-iron with about five furlongs to run, was urged
from that point, went around the turn in the three path, spun into the stretch in the four path and came up empty. JACKIE THE JOKER was urged along well
off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
MY SHEA D LADY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, took
over command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive to prevail. SOHANA coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the
inside, widened away midway down the backstretch and took to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just
off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front inside the three-sixteenths and ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. BARONESS
BOURBON coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under a prolonged drive with nine-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages. TOUR JETE stumbled at the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch, weakened. AMY'S LIGHT chased three then two wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch, tired.

Footnotes
MATURITY DATE brushed with a foe while five then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, rallied three then four wide on the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch then took the advantage, drifted in while kicking clear around the three-sixteenths pole and proved much the best under strong urging.
THE TACO LADY was hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, moved clear near the
nine-sixteenths pole, was roused in the two path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the three path then lost the advantage to the winner, moved out
behind that foe around the three-sixteenths pole and proved no match but held the place. LOOKING FOR GINNY bumped hard with a rival after the start
then checked, settled well back while in the two to three path on the turns, was ridden along on the second turn and finished with good courage to get the
show. COQUITO went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LUNA LOVE saved ground on the first turn, was
well placed behind the leading duo, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, chased into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
BLIND SPEED brushed with the winner while four wide on the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled well off the pace, was urged along in the two
path on the far turn and was no factor. THEDREAMCONTINUES showed speed in the four path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, dropped
back near the nine-sixteenths pole, came up empty in the three path on the far turn and stopped. DON'T TOUCH ME (IRE) brushed the outside of the gate
at the start, bumped hard with a foe early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, saved ground on the far turn and faltered.
