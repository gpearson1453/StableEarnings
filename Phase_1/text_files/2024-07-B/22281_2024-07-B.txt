Footnotes
ALOHA BREEZE opened clear early, saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win as the rider pleased. DAFFODIL SWEET saved ground early while
being allowed to settle, angled out to be 2-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well for second in a steady effort. OUR LYLA GRACE was unhurried
early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. JAMIES INHERITANCE was forwardly placed while racing thre-wide but
lacked a rally. YOUNG LIFE LAURA chased ALOHA BREEZE while racing two-wide and weakened slightly late. TIZZY TWISTER dropped back early,
came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.

GODSEND dueled for the lead from the outset while racing two-wide and prevailed under strong handling. IT'S TURBO was reserved off the early pace,
rallied four-wide the final quarter and closed strongly. NINE ONE ONE prompted the pace while racing three-wide and held on well for third. LLOYDS
LOGIC vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and finished well in a good effort. TABLE BAY saved ground while being unhurried early, angled
out for room nearing the eighth pole and was gaining slightly late. EVER A REBEL settled in the middle of the field early, came five-wide into the stretch but
lacked a rally. A SKIP IN THE PARK was bumped at the start by OWHATARUSH then steadied shortly after the start in tight, dropped back and was unable
to recover. OWHATARUSH broke out to bump A SKIP IN THE PARK then moved up to vie for the early lead and tired. THE STEWARD CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

then was all out to finish in a Dead Heat for first with SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ under strong handling. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ angled in early to save ground while
being reserved off the pace, slipped through on the turn and finished fast to end up on even terms with ARMA D'ORO in a dead-heat for the win. NEIMAN
prompted PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY from along the outside, was four-wide entering the stretch and held on gamely during the drive for third. DESHAMBEAU
was forwardly placed early while three-wide, steadied leaving the eighth pole when PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY drifted out in from of him and finished willingly
when clear. MONGOLIAN MEMORY was prominently placed while racing four-wide but lacked a rally. MUNCEY dropped back early, came three-wide into
the stretch and improved his position late. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY saved ground setting the pace into the stretch, drifted out when headed leaving the eighth

Footnotes
BELLAREIGN was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly while racing four-wide nearing the quarter then took the lead entering the stretch and
quickly drew clear. DEVIL D' ORO was allowed to settle early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. MANY MEMORIES was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and rallied late. HARBOR LASS saved ground setting the pressure pace to the stretch and weakened. SENSIBLE LUTE
was forwardly placed early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in slightly but lacked a rally. TIA SUZI settled in the middle of the field early and went
evenly. ENGAGING SOUL dropped back early while saving ground and failed to be a factor. MY PERFECT TOWN prompted the pace while racing
two-wide and tired during the drive.
