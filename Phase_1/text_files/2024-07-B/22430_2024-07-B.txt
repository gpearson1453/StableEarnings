BET ON BOBBY sprinted to a early narrow lead in the first furlong then edged away to draw clear going into the turn and kept to prove best. OCEOLA
showed no early speed but moved up from two wide on the turn and shifted inside at the eighth pole with a late kick but couldn't catch the leader and proved
to be second best. NERVY vied for the early inside lead to the half mile marker then chased the leader around the turn and weakened late. EL DEAL ME
ACES raced off the pace from three or four wide through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch for a late run and improved position. SKIPPA
tracked the leader from the inside and failed to menace. CUSTOM PRAYER roused to contention from three wide through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE was reluctant to load into the gate, pressed the pace from two wide to the three furlong marker where she took command and
drew off in the stretch. MEAN AMERICAN vied for the lead from three wide around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, moved
between horses at the quarter pole for a late run but was no match for the winner and proved second best. BEYOND THE HYPE had an awkward start
leaving the gate and trailed the field to the five furlong marker then made a mild rail bid to the final turn and was only able to pass the tiring rivals. WA WA
WEE WA stalked the pace from four wide down the backstretch then tipped in to three wide around the final turn and was empty while racing widest of all.
JERSEY HOTTIE was unsettled in the gate but went to a pressured lead on the inside to the three furlong marker then chased the leader to the quarter pole
and gave way.

INFINITESIMAL stalked the pace from four wide through the turn then closed willingly and drew clear. HALF A BUCK went to the front to co-lead from two
wide to the eighth pole when he took a brief narrow lead before being overtaken by outside closer and stayed on for the place. FAMILY CREED raced off
the pace from three wide on the backstretch then moved up to challenge the leaders on the turn but couldn't match the pace but saved the show. G'S
STORM hopped slightly at the start and trailed the field to the half mile marker then moved up to go three wide around the turn, tipped out to four wide in
upper stretch for the late run to improve position. ROCK SOLID WORDS went to the front to co-lead from the inside to the eighth pole and weakened. PINK
HIGGINS was never a threat. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD saved ground to no avail.

WOODS N WATER was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved between horses near the three eighth pole and
engaged the leader in mid turn, cruised past and drew clear in the stretch. BIG BOO stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then had to
steady slightly on the turn but kept on and moved out to three wide in upper stretch for the late rally. CARLEA'S DREAM raced off the pace down the
backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the three eighths pole and took a brief lead on the turn but was collared near the quarter pole and
weakened. SUNDAY BREEZE was unhurried to the final turn then made a mild three wide bid and passed tiring rivals. SONYA KNOWS BETTER raced in
the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from three wide at the half mile marker and faltered. OAK HILL LG was through after a half.

CHARCO shot away from the gate to share the command from two wide, inched clear on the turn and won going away. LIL WOADIE was void of the early
speed to the top of the stretch, moved between horses at the eighth pole for the late rally. HOLY BAYOU raced within striking distance from the two path,
moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole but was outfinished. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON was forwardly placed from three wide and failed to menace.
CHAD'S FLASH rushed up the inside to share the command to the three furlong marker but kept on and tired in the stretch.

RIDGE raced off the pace but lacked the late response. CADILLAC COWBOY saved ground but was not a factor. CHI TOWN HUSTLER pressed the pace
from three wide to the top of the stretch and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive

RON'S LAVENDER stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then moved up around the turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch and cruised home.
HONDURAS PASSION raced off the pace on the inside into the stretch then shifted out to four wide at the eighth pole for a strong late rally. QUART HIGH
vied for the lead from three wide down the backstretch then took the lead at the three furlong marker but was collared at the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly. ON THE MONEY LUV pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole but lacked the late response and was empty. TRUST FUND BABY
raced near the back through the turn then made a late two wide bid in the stretch and closed well. LAST WINE FOR ME rushed up to an early pressured
lead to the three furlong marker and faded. MITOLE'S LADY saved ground and failed to menace. SHELLEY'S ROSE was forwardly placed in the two path
on the backstretch and weakened. THE LADY BULLS EYE trailed the field to midway through the turn but was not a factor. BALITRIX was always back. LA
LOMBRIZ raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn but failed to sustain the bid.
