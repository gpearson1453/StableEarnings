Footnotes
SHORTY MAC broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held the closers
safe through the lane. UP FOR IT tracked the pace from two wide into the turn, angled to the rail saving ground while cutting the corner turning for home,
tipped out in mid-stretch off the winner's heels and could not get to the winner. SWEETCATHERINEROSE raced mid-pack along the fence to midway on the
turn, chased the runner-up along the rail in upper stretch and continued willingly to be gaining late from the inside. RAISE YOUR GAME raced three wide in
the second flight through the turn and made a late non-threatening bid in the lane. AVATAL HERO unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, angled six
wide at the head of the stretch and showed good late energy. MADE TO HUSTLE pressed the pace while searching for a clear racing path down the
backside, made a two wide bid on the bend to threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. IN HER CUPS stalked the leaders down the
backstretch, made a four wide early move on the turn and weakened down the lane. SKY BUY was not a factor.

stalked the pace to upper stretch from three wide and kept-on gamely through the lane to be gaining in deep stretch. NUCCI reserved off the pace in
mid-pack to the head of the lane and finished well with a late rally. HIGHWAY QUEEN slow early to trail the field turning for home, angled wide at the head
of the lane and mounted a belated rally in the stretch. LONDON LADY rated off the pace while racing five wide and finsihed with mild late interest.
SOPHIA'S ROSE tracked the leaders fro mthe inside into the turn, rmade an early bid to challenge on the bend, angled out at the quarter pole to the five
path, and drifted in through the lane while tiring. LADYNESS failed to menace. LIL H tracked the leaders for a half and faded in the lane.

MAXIMUM EMILY pressed the pace for half mile, took control on the backstretch, opened a clear advantage on the final turn, widened the lead in upper
stretch and held well while taken in hand late. REZQUIA set a pressured pace for a half mile and kept-on willingly to be second best. NANASQUAN stalked
the pace throughout and failed to gain ground while holding the show. MAKE A SPLASH was one-paced failing to menace. LET'S GO MO trailed most of
the way and was never a threat. MOON POOL tracked the leaders from midpack for three-quarters and tired coming home.

SPEAK OF THE DEVIL set a pressured pace to the to p of the lane, dueled in the stretch with the runner-up, surrnedered the lead briefly and came again
gamely to prevail in a determined drive. BEE BY THE SEA stalked the pace for a half mile, made a steady rally on the final turn to engage the winner in
upper stretch, briefly took a lead in mid-stretch and was denied at the wire in a good effort. SIR SAHIB tracked the leaders to the quarter pole to be well
palced and finished willingly while unable to close ground on the top pair. A T M AWESOME pressed the pace to the far turn and weakened while keeping
on as best of the rest. SHANGHAI CANDY saved ground along the fence dt the far turn and made a mild rally passed weaker rivals in the lane. THE
GREAT CASBY went one-paced and failed to menace. BARLEEWON made an early bid on the far turn and flattened out. HURRICANE HIGHWAY was not
a factor. FORECLOSURE broke slowly to give the field a head start, rallied on the backside from six wide with an early bid and gave way.
