Footnotes
SHE'S A KRAKEN prompted the early pace, moved up two-wide to join VANDULIE nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one from that point and
prevailed in a hard drive. VANDULIE saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by SHE;S A KRAKEN nearing the quarter pole but was
unable to match strides with that one late. PARKER'S FIFTEEN was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch and held on
fairly well for third in a steady effort. ESCAPEFROMPARADISE was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten.
DRINKUP BUTTERCUP was allowed to settle early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CHROME'S BEST COPY was prominent early
while racing three-wide and tired.

drew clear. R BARRACUDA was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide on the turn, angled in nearing the quarter pole to be two-wide entering the stretch,
angled out slightly during the drive to split rivals and finished strongly. KLINKERBRICK was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out to be
four-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. ELDER MACK was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, came five-wide into the

SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, was carried out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be five-wide entering the
stretch, caught the leaders at the eighth pole and then was all out to prevail narrowly. JIN TONG was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out to
come two-wide into the stretch, caught the leaders a the eighth pole and just just missed in a game try. EL ALTO HOMBRE saved ground setting the pace
into the stretch, responded when asked and held on well for third. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was unhurried early while saving ground, slipped through entering
the stretch to off a mild bid and then went evenly late. SON OF THUNDER was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. DIRT ROAD RED prompted the pace from along the outside, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be four-wide and tired. FALSELY
ACCUSED was reserved off the pace while racing four-wide for six furlongs and gave way.
