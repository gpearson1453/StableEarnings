Footnotes
ATOMIC DROP stepped to the front and set the pace under pressure from outer rival early, moved clear on the backstretch, roused entering the stretch and
remained unchallenged while kept busy to the wire. TAISHAN stalked in the two path then moved inside, was closest in pursuit and took aim from off the rail
on the second bend, chased within striking distance through the lane but could not reach the winner. STOP AND A TRES tucked inside out of range, moved
off the rail on the backstretch, came back inside to save ground, steered out in upper stretch and finished a clear third. STONEVICIOUS tracked from inside
then in the two path, raced in mid-pack in the middle stages, ridden along through the far turn and improved position in the lane. BIG BUZZ unhurried in the
early going and moved into the two path, angled out on the far turn, raced in the six path turning for home and offered a mild rally. UPSTART YANKEE went
up to press from outside, chased the winner past the nine-sixteenths pole, lost ground on the far turn and weakened. BIG SPIN off slow to begin, trailed on
the inside, tipped out into the lane and was never a factor. WINE AND WHISKY stalked in the three then two path around the clubhouse turn, traveled in the
four path into the lane and lacked the needed response. IMPOSSIBLE TASK settled off the inside, passed rivals off the rail on the far turn, chased wide into
the lane and failed to menace. SUPERMAZEL chased in the three path early, lost positions on the far turn in the four path and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
GETAWAY CAR sped clear and moved inside, remained untested into the lane, lightly coaxed in upper stretch and padded the lead under confident
handling in the late stages. SMASH IT stumbled leaving the gate, chased after the lone speed off the rail into the turn, ran in the three then two path around
the bend, remained in range into the furlong grounds but could not make any headway on the winner. SOI NGERN chased along the inside, moved out a bit
leaving the bend, lacked the needed rally but managed to hold third. RANK came away slow and lagged behind early, took the turn in the three then four
path and improved position. DR RUBEN M stumbled and broke out, stalked outside rivals early, navigated the turn in the four then three path and lacked a
response when called upon. DEEPLY HIDDEN bobbled in the beginning, tracked outside a rival into the turn, lost ground and moved over to the inside,
cornered well into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TIGERHON (FR) ceded command to outer trio and took a stalking position on the inside, saved ground through the turn, waited for room behind the leader
in upper stretch, asked once gaining a clear path, fought with outer pair in deep stretch and proved best. FLEET FEET broke a step slow, stalked between
rivals in the two path, tipped out into the stretch, rallied three deep in the final sixteenth but got edged by the winner. NESSO'S LASTHARRAH vied for the
inside a pair of rivals, carried a short lead leaving the bend, shook free in upper stretch, met challengers on both sides in the late stages but could not hold
on. DANCING RINCA laid off the pace early, traveled in the two path then swung out late on the bend, put in mild late bid and rounded out the superfecta.
ANMER HALL settled outside DANCING RINCA early, took the turn in the three path, kept on trying between rivals and improved. MAS RAPIDO (GB)
brushed by inner rival leaving the gate, saved ground near the back, came off the rail into the lane, moved back inside in the drive and closed ground late.
KING APOLLO was off a bit slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside, moved out a bit into the lane, steered further out in the drive and came with a mild
late rally. PLEASE FOCUS broke out and brushed MAS RAPIDO (GB), went up to vie three deep for command, fought alongside inner rivals to the top of
the stretch, failed to kick on with the leader and could not re-rally in the furlong grounds. EDDIE'S LAST stalked in the three path, got floated out into the
drive and lacked a bid. INVINCIBLE fought between rivals on the front end to the top of the stretch, then weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
DE' MEDICI grabbed the lead and moved inward, set the pace under pressure from MUCINO then was headed by that rival on the backstretch, roused on
the far turn still battling with that rival, shook free at the top of the stretch and drew off under a drive. MUCINO bumped in the beginning, pressed the pace
from outside then dueled up the backstretch, ridden along battling with DE' MEDICI on the second bend, lost touch with the winner at the top of the lane,
then stayed on to secure second. MISCHELOF (CHI) traveled outside a rival at the back on the first turn, moved inside and made progress through the
second bend, hugged the rail into the stretch, moved out in the lane and gained third but needed to find more to threaten the top pair. TELOS bumped with
outer rival at the start, stalked off the rail, traveled in the four path entering the far turn, three wide into the lane and could not rally. I DON'T GET IT settled
next to the fence, ridden along in the two path on the second bend, tipped out in the lane and could not offer a response. PRINCE OF POWER raced keenly
chasing along the inside early then moved out a bit around the clubhouse turn, stalked the top pair from outside leaving the backstretch, chased between
into the lane and weakened. DARK MARCUS was reserved in the early stages traveling outside rivals, trailed along the rail into the far turn, eased off the
fence around the bend and passed a tired rival in the lane. GUCCI BOY tracked in the two path then outside a rival, rounded the far turn in the three path
and came up empty when needed.

final furlong, took over shortly after and drove clear. SOHO stepped to the front, showed the way along the inside early, felt a bit of pressure from IN
THEORY on the backstretch, maintained command through the far turn, headed at the eighth pole, relinquished midstretch and yielded in deep stretch.
ESPRIT ENCHANTE was off slow to start, moved to the inside and traveled in mid-pack, tipped two wide on the far turn, moved out further at the top of the
lane and finished determinedly to gain third. SHILOH'S MISTRESS pulled early between rivals, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, remained between
and two wide on the far turn and offered a mild response to whittle the gap late. CHARM YOUR WORLD got crowded leaving the gate, moved to the rail
racing towards the rear, pushed on through the far turn continuing to save ground, moved out in the lane and improved position, pulled up on the
backstretch and was transported off the track via equine ambulance. HIGHLANDS sat off the pace in the two path, angled out on the far turn, altered out at
the top of the stretch and improved position. CATALINA COCKTAIL stalked from inside, came under a ride on the second bend, asked right handed into the
stretch and lacked a rally. SHAMROCKIN dropped back and moved inside, trailed to the far turn, swung out past the quarter pole, got forced out at the top
of the lane and improved position. SHIN JIDAI (GB) raced two then three wide near the back early, moved up to mid-pack three deep on the backstretch,
spun four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. WHERE'S MY RING had to steady running on heels early on the clubhouse turn, sat in mid-pack two wide,
between foes in the middle stages, got shuffled on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and could not rally. AYE CANDY stalked outside a pair of
rivals, lost ground three wide on the far turn and weakened. SHE IS ROMANTIC tracked widest early, four wide on the clubhouse turn, chased four then

Footnotes
CAYUCOS showed good early foot to take control, showed the way a bit off the rail through the turn, roused when feeling HOT GIRL WALK looming from
outside at the eighth pole and drew away under hand urging. HOT GIRL WALK broke a step slow, chased five deep early, brushed with inner rival into the
turn, drew closer around the bend, entered the lane in the four path, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, loomed from outside at the eighth pole but got turned
away in the furlong grounds. PAVEL'S ETOILE forwardly placed outside a rival, took aim from the two then three path on the turn, got floated inward in
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages but churned on to hold third. EMPRESS OF GRACE coaxed along early chasing off the rail, brushed with HOT
GIRL WALK entering the turn, moved into the three path quickly, moved in a bit around the bend and weakened. GOBERNADORA ELY hustled along early
to a forward position, lost ground along the rail on the turn, then weakened in the stretch. CHILLY PHILLY sat off the pace, traveled three deep into the turn,
raced in the four path entering the drive and failed to threaten. BUDS N SUDS broke a step slow, ridden along early chasing off the pace, saved ground to
the stretch and was not a factor. PENNYPATTER broke a step slow, drifted out shortly after, lagged behind in the three path entering the turn, moved in a
path around the bend and could not make an impact. JUST A LITTLE CYNN broke a step slow, got crowded between rivals shortly after, traveled outside a
rival off the pace, raced two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
FORMIDABLE MAN bumped inner rival at the start, pulled early and ran up on heels approaching the first turn, drew closer while angling five wide around
the far turn, launched a bid in upper stretch, took over midstretch and edged away. GUY NAMED JOE traveled two wide well off the pace early, angled out
six wide around the second bend, rallied from outside but got outclosed by the winner. ROTHSCHILD chased three deep off the pace, moved up to
mid-pack on the backstretch, steered out further and gave chase five wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch, relinquished the lead in midstretch and
kept on to save third. BLUE EYED GEORGE unhurried in the beginning and steered to the two path then between rivals, ran into traffic past the
three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, waited for room around the bend, bumped into the stretch, bid between foes but lacked the needed late
punch and could not get by ROTHSCHILD for third. WE'RE IN TROUBLE tracked from inside then between rivals, moved inside in the middle stages, drew
closer leaving the backstretch, took aim while tipping out around that bend, bid two wide into the stretch, fought inside rivals to midstretch and faltered. KING
OF GOSFORD (GB) reserved inside, ran up on heels on the far turn, recovered and moved up then waited for on the inside, lacked room in upper stretch,
moved to a clear path and could not rally. SCATIFY chased two wide out of range, drew closer three then four wide on the far turn, bumped into the stretch
and weakened. SIMPLEXITY (IRE) tucked inside at the back, eased over to the two path on the second bend, angled out for the stretch and improved
position. ISLAND CRUISER forwardly placed in the early going, dropped back when crowded between rivals on the far turn and had little left for the drive.
ALL THAT GLORY bumped in the beginning, stepped to the front from inside, controlled the pace to the five-sixteenths pole then roused around the bend,
challenged from outside entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and gave way. CHARGE FOR GOLD tracked two then three wide around the clubhouse
turn, chased outside ISLAND CRUISER on the backstretch, got bumped on both sides entering the lane and faded.

improved position. DAGGER RANCH chased outside a quartet of rivals in the early going, moved into the four path around the bend and weakened. BRAVE

Footnotes
ISCREAMUSCREAM showed good early speed to take the front and moved inside, headed by OMAHA GIRL in the middle stages, held a short lead over a
trio of rivals leaving the far turn, put away OMAHA GIRL in upper stretch, fought with ZONA VERDE (IRE) through the final furlong and held gamely. ZONA
VERDE (IRE) settled in the two path, chased three deep leaving the backstretch, rallied four wide around the far turn, battled outside ISCREAMUSCREAM
through the furlong grounds and could not summon the needed late kick to get by. MEDORO broke a step slow, laid off the pace three then two wide on the
clubhouse turn, was on the move between rivals approaching the far turn, got knocked into inner rival early on the bend then had to wait when boxed in,
angled out into the clear near the stretch, closed well in the lane and earn the show honors. SAKURA BLOSSOM reserved in the early going and taken
inside, got bumped early on the far turn, tipped out and went between rivals, chased two wide into the drive, lacked a clear path and altered course at the
eighth pole, then kept on for a minor award. OMAHA GIRL raced up close to the outside of the early leader, drew alongside and headed the pacesetter in
the middle stages, battled two wide around the far turn, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and weakened. LOTERIE (IRE) tracked in hand on the inside,
moved off the rail and drew closer into the far turn, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, got crowded a bit at the top of the lane and weakened.
INVINCIBLE MOLLY (GB) bobbled leaving the gate, unhurried and traveled in the two path in the opening stages, came under a ride while angling out to the
five path on the far turn and could not rally in the stretch. SEA DANCER brushed the gate, taken back shortly after the start then raced keenly early on the
inside, ran into traffic at the five-sixteenths pole then angled out, moved back inward in the lane and was not a factor. RASCALITY fractious in the gate, well
placed along the inside, look to challenge the top pair from the rail but got put in tight and steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, continued along the fence to
the stretch and weakened. FLATTERY stalked two wide early, shifted in and bumped past the three-eighths pole, dropped back and trailed in the three path
into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
THORNE HOUSE chased briefly from inside then moved up to challenge for the lead, put a head in front dueling on the turn, shook free at the top of the
lane and powered away under mild urging. YELLOW BRICK broke a step slow, climbed a bit early and moved out, angled back to the two path early on the
turn, steered out to the five path leaving the bend and gained second. TRANCHE sped clear from outside then was challenged by THORNE HOUSE,
relinquished the lead dueling around the bend, yielded early in the stretch and churned on to save third. GYPSY TEARS chased outside rivals near the back
then moved up to mid-pack, drew closer while easing out to the five path around the bend and could not rally in the drive. NAVY MAN bumped with outer
rival early, stalked between rivals then off the rail, traveled in the two path then drifted out a bit on the turn and could not rally. MONEY RUN forwardly
placed three deep then outside the top pair, raced in the four path turning for home and weakened. TARANTINO sat off the pace on the inside, got put in
tight past the seven-sixteenths pole, trailed around the bend and could not make an impact after. MISTER ICEMAN got bumped, pinched between rivals
and clipped heels early, chased between foes near the back then off the rail, gained along the inside through the turn but flattened out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ATITLAN moved inside and took an awkward step over the track approaching the first turn, raced near the back through the early going, hugged the rail to
the stretch, lacked room at the eighth pole, gained an opening between rivals, surged late from inside and got up in time. BROHEIM raced keenly in hand
early between rivals, continued between foes on the far turn, was given his cue at the three-sixteenths, moved out in the drive, reeled in MIDDLEBURG and
led momentarily late but was outclosed by the winner. MIDDLEBURG set the pace on the inside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, roused at the top of
the lane and kicked away, continued clear into the final sixteenth and got run down from both sides. JOYRIDER unhurried in the beginning and moved
inside, traveled in the two then three path on the second bend, then angled out and unleashed a late rally to round out the superfecta. THE OLD NINE (IRE)
tracked three deep around both turns, tipped out into the lane, drifted out and interfered with rivals midstretch and could not produce a bid. ONE TIME
MARK rated three wide early, chased outside rivals into the far turn, moved out a bit at the top of the lane and lacked further response. BARTHOLDY saved
ground off the pace, traveled in the two path entering the lane, bumped with outer rival midstretch and could not rally. ROSTOVSKY broke a step slow, took
awkward steps approaching the clubhouse turn, traveled near the back in the two path, coaxed along between rivals into the second bend, tipped out to the
three path around that turn, got floated out midstretch and failed to rally. FAST CHAZ rated along the inside, coaxed along while saving ground through the
far turn and brushed the rail past the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the drive. EISENHOWER stalked in the two path, took aim two wide around the
far turn, bumped with BARTHOLDY midstretch and weakened. FAUSTO settled in the four then three path around the first turn, went three then four wide
on the second bend, lost his path, clipped heels and fell midstretch, was caught by the outrider following the race and walked off. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE OLD NINE (IRE) FROM FIFTH AND PLACED HIM UNPLACED FOR DRIFTING OUT MIDSTRETCH
AND FORCING ROSTOVSKY INTO THE PATH OF FAUSTO, CAUSING FAUSTO TO CLIP HEELS AND UNSEAT HIS RIDER.
