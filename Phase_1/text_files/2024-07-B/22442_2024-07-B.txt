Footnotes
AMITY ROAD prompted the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to take over, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best under
right handed crop urging. AWESOME LAUNCH was reserved early, came five wide off the turn and rallied well for the place award while no match for the
winner. SWIFT TAP was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and made a four wide mild bid by the quarter pole but could not sustain
that bid while being out-kicked for the place award. SYNONYM set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the quarter pole and gave way in the
drive. RUNANDSCORE tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. EARL OF DASSEL chased the pace four wide early and tired. EGOT A POKER
FACE pulled between rivals on the first turn and had to check in between rivals by the three quarter marker, then was two to three wide on the far turn and
tired.

EQUISTAR was away alertly to set the early pace in the two path, drew clear on the turn and widened the margin leaving the turn and then maintained a
clear advantage under mild urging to prove much the best. LAVINIA SPIRIT stalked the pace three wide and kept on to hold the place award. CHALICE
steadied leaving the nine sixteenths and dropped back to trail, then raced towards the inside on the turn, finished well on the inside to gain the show award.
DISCO FLASH was off slowly, then raced wide on the turn and came very wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. FIREBALL EXPRESS was rated along
the inside, swung out three wide leaving the trun and had no kick. LOUELLA STREET was well placed on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn
and weakened. DON DIVA stalked the pace four wide and weakened.
