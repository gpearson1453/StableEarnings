then drew off while drifting to the rail and was kept to the task. LAWN DART eased to the lead inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then was
no match for the winner and held the place safe. POQUITO ROSE well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the stretch, angled out and had a mild late gain. WATERLOO SUNSET unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled in into the
stretch and closed well for a share. CINCO DE MANDEE led in the early going, stalked the leader, moved to position three and four wide through the turn,

ahead late. MAKE THE BED well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, closed well and
edged up for the place in the final strides. ELUSIVE CHANGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened late and held the show. GLOBAL HYSTERIA unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and passes tiring
rivals. NOT TODAY GOVERNOR well placed inside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally.
