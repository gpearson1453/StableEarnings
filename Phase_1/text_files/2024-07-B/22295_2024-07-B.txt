Footnotes
BESKAR hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the moderate early pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker,
was well placed entering the turn and tracked the leading pair three deep nearing the quarter marker, swung to the four path for the stretch drive and battled
with HOT GOBLIN nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and made a final surge
to prevail. HOT GOBLIN engaged MONSIEUR in the early going and prompted that rival through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile, attended to
the pace between rivals entering the turn, took command past the quarter marker and led into the stretch, met the bid of BESKAR nearing the furlong pole,
battled that rival to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while holding clear for second. MONSIEUR broke alertly and assumed command away
from the start, set a contested pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way from the inside entering the turn and carved out moderate fractions
nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong marker and faded in the late stages. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NIJINSKY HALO sent leaving the start, assumed early command and showed good speed while setting the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well
rated along the bend and shook free nearing the quarter marker, drew clear into the stretch while in hand, widened the lead past the furlong marker, was
given a few reminder taps into the final sixteenth and was hand urged in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. IT'S A FACTOR hustled away from the
start, raced close up to the solid early pace and stalked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the turn and
saved ground nearing the quarter marker, chased NIJINSKY HALO into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to be
second best. LAST CALL VRON hesitated at the start and was away slowly, raced greenly while trailing in the early stages, saved ground along the turn,
could not impact the top pair in the stretch drive and ran on in the final sixteenth to earn the show honors. BIG BAD BERT away in good order, was
prominent in the early stages, got caught a bit in tight and checked nearing the half-mile marker, tracked the pace two to three wide into the turn and lost
position nearing the quarter marker, could not muster a response into the stretch and weakened. JAZZY BULL HORN tracked the solid early pace from the
inside, was taken outside of rivals entering the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, maintained an outside path into the stretch
and did not have a late impact. DORIS AVENUE raced close up to the solid early pace, was a bit green and drifted in in the opening furlong, chased outside
of NIJINSKY HALO heading to the half-mile marker and ran in pursuit of the pacesetter entering the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, could not
keep pace into the stretch, raced greenly nearing the furlong marker and came up empty in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TALBOT BAY squeezed at the start and broke a bit slowly, asked for early speed and tracked the decent pace from the second flight heading to the
half-mile marker, roused entering the turn, loomed four wide at the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth,
surged in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish for a good win. REGAL PATRIOT showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command
and set moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms under pressure to the quarter marker, set down for the drive and shook free
nearing mid-stretch, dug in while leading past the furlong marker, collared in deep stretch by TALBOT BAY and held for second at the finish. SATANTA
unhurried in the early running, guided two to three wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, swung widest for the stretch drive and ran
evenly to the furlong marker, finished well in the final sixteenth and a clear third. BALLYVAUGHAN GIG hustled away from the start, prominent in the early
running then took back to track the decent early pace, guided two to three wide into the turn then came in tight and blocked nearing the quarter marker,
found room into the stretch but could not muster the needed late response. GALLAND DE BESOS rated off of the decent early pace, tracked from the
second flight approaching the turn and gained ground while two wide nearing the quarter marker, saved ground into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
marker and outkicked into the final sixteenth. IMPERIAL HORNET forwardly placed leaving the start, rushed up in the early going and stalked the decent
pace three deep nearing the half-mile marker, stalked from the outside entering the turn and pressed the pace three wide heading to the quarter pole,
battled into the stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong marker and weakened. NOT MY RODEO forwardly placed away from the start, rushed up in
the early stages and pressed the decent pace between rivals approaching the half-mile marker, attended to the pace between rivals entering the turn, lost
position at the quarter marker, chased into upper stretch and gave way in the drive. SHARONA'S WILD BOY tracked the decent early pace from the inside,
saved ground into the turn and outrun approaching the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and could not muster a late response. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NO SECRET sent leaving the start, assumed early command and cleared the field into the first turn, set the pace while off of the rail and was well handled
while carving out decent fractions nearing the half-mile, dictated terms into the far turn and was confronted by DOO WOP DON at the quarter pole, battled
that rival into the stretch, repelled DOO WOP DON at the furlong marker, dug in while kept to task into deep stretch and held in the final stages for a
determined win. DOO WOP DON rated just off of the early pace, tracked from the outside and was guided four wide into the first turn, was well placed into
the backstretch run and maintained an outside path nearing the far turn, was roused four wide and loomed approaching the quarter pole, drew to even terms
with NO SECRET and battled that rival into the stretch, was repelled at the furlong marker, chased NO SECRET into the final sixteenth and was second
best. DRUIDIC prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead to NO SECRET and stalked outside of that runner entering the first turn, advanced into
the backstretch run and attended to the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, pressed the pace between rivals into the far turn, lost position into the
stretch, weakened in the drive and was clear for third at the finish. ENOS SLAUGHTER settled outside of rivals into the first turn, improved position along
the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, was outkicked into the stretch and passed a tired
rival in the final furlong. WE CAN settled leaving the start, raced two wide and between rivals into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run,
mounted an inside bid into the far turn and chased the leaders nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, was outkicked at the
furlong marker and gave way. TRINIDAD allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and was
not far back nearing the half-mile marker, was guided two wide into the far turn, trailed into the stretch and did not offer a late response. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) allowed to settle away from the start, went two to three wide into the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run,
advanced nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, was steered widest into the stretch and mounted a five wide rally at the furlong
marker, closed fast into the final sixteenth, reeled in ITS THIEVERY in the final strides and won the nod on the wire for a determined win. ITS THIEVERY
sent leaving the start, assumed early command and showed the way into the backstretch run, was prompted through moderate fractions heading to the
half-mile marker, shook free into the second turn and drew to a clear lead into the stretch, dug in while kept to task into the final sixteenth, was all out in the
final sixteenth, was nailed on the wire for the win and held at the finish for second. ESTABLISHED tracked the early pace from the inside, saved ground into
the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, shifted to the two path entering the far turn and chased the leaders heading to the
quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, finished well in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the top pair and was
clear in the end for third. UNION WAVE was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace outside of ITS THIEVERY and was well placed
into the backstretch run, advanced to prompt the moderate pace nearing the half-mile marker while between runners, chased two wide into the far turn and
ran in pursuit into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. HEAT N REHEAT was forwardly placed away
from the start, went widest into the first turn and tracked the early pace four wide into the backstretch run, advanced to prompt the moderate pace heading
to the half-mile pole, was well placed nearing the second turn and chased ITS THIEVERY approaching the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch,
could not keep pace past the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology
to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR was forwardly placed away from the start, rated just off of the solid early pace and tracked the leaders heading to the half-mile marker,
was roused at the three-eighths and loomed three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, drew to even terms with YES HE CAN and battled that rival heading
to mid-stretch, dueled gamely into the final sixteenth, came again in deep stretch and surged in the final strides to dead heat for the win. YES HE CAN broke
alertly and assumed early command, ceded the front to HAY JUAN and pressed the solid pace approaching the turn, contested the pace between rivals
along the bend, took a narrow lead past the quarter pole and met the bid of MY DOMINATOR into upper stretch, battled with that rival while on even terms
heading to the furlong marker, dueled into the final sixteenth and took a short lead in deep stretch, was unyielding in the final stages and gamely held for a
share of the win at the wire. OUR BOLD PRINCE tracked the solid early pace from the outside, was well placed approaching the turn, chased three wide
nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, could impact the leading pair in the final sixteenth and ran on in deep stretch to be a clear third.
ALMANERA (IRE) bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace heading to the half-mile marker, went two wide
into the turn and was outrun nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide into the stretch, did not offer a late response and passed tired rivals in the final
furlong. MR. T'S THIRSTY sent to be forwardly placed in the early running, got caught in tight nearing the half-mile marker and checked at that station,
tracked the solid pace fro the inside entering the turn, could not find a response into the stretch and gave way. HAY JUAN broke a step slowly leaving the
start, rushed up to contest the early pace, assumed command and disputed the solid pace approaching the turn, carved out quick fractions and led to the
quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch and stopped in the final furlong. GROSS PROFIT took back off of the solid early pace, was outrun into the turn
and trailed throughout. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ELCONDOR broke well and raced on the outside of a three-way speed duel with GOLD DRAMA and STRENGTH OF AUTISM, was always traveling well,
gained a short lead passing the quarter pole,held sway under strong handling and intermittent urging and just held off a determined STRENTH OF AUTISM
at the wire. STRENGTH OF AUTISM raced between horses contending the early pace, dropped off the pace on the turn, then tipped out three wide and
re-bid for the lead, battled gamely with ELCONDOR the length of the stretch, was cutting into the margin approaching the wire but came up short in a solid
effort. GOLF DRAMA was the inside horse of three contesting for the early lead, took a short lead past the half-mile marker, and held position through the
turn, started to weaken at the quarter pole, dropped out of it then tipped out in the clear to the three path, was kept to task and came back on under steady
right handed urging. GOTCHA LOOKIN was pushed on from the break to get forward position, tracked behind the dueling trio while keeping to the inside
path, was always close up then tried to launch a bid from the three furlong marker, got boxed in for a bit, then came under heavy pressure near the quarter
pole, got a seam to run through at the top of the stretch had to steady briefly near the furlong pole but kept to task and was making slow gains close to the
wire. ALPHABETICAL ORDER got bumped, pinched back and forced outward at the start, getting away very awkwardly, was last through the early stages
then found his stride near the five furlong pole but had to be pushed on in an attempt to get into a contending position, got caught four to five wide into the
stretch and almost made contact with HALF THROTTLE near the three sixteenths pole, did run on some down the stretch but was unable to make up the
needed ground. HALF THROTTLE tracked behind the speed duel about three wide down the backstretch, launched a bid from the three furlong pole, made
some mild improvement then went four wide into the turn, nearly ran into ALPHABETICAL ORDER near the three-sixteenths pole, then flattened out and
was no factor in the late stages. MR BIG BUCKS broke off balance and veered outward making solid contact with ALPHABETICAL ORDER, then lacked
any early speed and was near the rear of the field early on, lost contact with the field before the turn, went wide through the turn and into the stretch and
was never a factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
