Footnotes
JADES JAY went clear around the first turn to set an open pace in the two path down the backside, came under a ride as his advantage widened early
around the far turn, continued to inch away in upper stretch, shortened stride in the final sixteenth, but held safely. MISTER COOPER had a slow start, laid
off the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn before angling out nearing the quarter, swung from the seven path into the stretch,
and rallied on his left lead for place. TITAN got a bit keen rounding the first turn, stalked in the three path down the backstretch, was roused into the far turn,
floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. LAST RUN chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the far turn, and
finished evenly. RAPSCALLION trailed inside, floated out to the five path midway around the far turn, and did not factor from the six path down the lane.
DYNAMIC EMPIRE laid in range in the two path but faded turning into the stretch, was pulled up jogging back and transported off the track in an equine
ambulance. DECISIVE PRIDE raced in midpack in the three path but weakened turning into the lane. RED ABARRIO rated in the three path but never
threatened. YASUR had an awkward start, raced wellback in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
BELLAVININO stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front in midstretch and drew off under left-handed urging.
OCEAN STAR had her head turned at the start, ducked in and bumped ELEANOR RIGBY, saved ground off the pace, made progress at the rail around the
far turn, angled out in upper stretch and ran on for the place. PRETTY SHY broke out and bumped with WIDERTHANAMILE at the start, pressed the pace
two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and lost second late. WIDERTHANAMILE bumped at the start, steadied along through
the opening quarter mile, raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CORAL DREAM had her head turned at the start and was shut off, raced
well back two and three wide and never threatened. ELEANOR RIGBY was fractious in the starting gate and was outrun inside. BLINGING BURR was rank
rounding the first turn, chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. ASTROLITE briefly unseated the rider in the post parade but
was never loose, set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
YES I'M A BEAST showed the way in the two path, was roused early around the turn, opened slightly passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path at the
top of the lane, and continued to draw clear. CONCRETE GLORY prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed midway around the turn, lost touch with
the winning pacesetter while floating out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but chased on for place. FEAST chased inside, received a right handed cue
in the three path midway around the turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. LIGHTNING TONES trailed in the two path
and made no impact from the four path in the stretch. GONE NUTS tracked in the three path, was ridden along the rail around the turn, but drifted out in the
final furlong, and flattened. HABERDASHERY raced wellback in the five path and never threatened.

Footnotes
HUB CITY stalked the pace in the four path, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. GODDESS MINERVA had her head turned at the start,
broke in and bumped COMMENCEMENT, set the pace in the two path to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on well to hold the place.
COMMENCEMENT was bumped at the start, raced in range inside, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final furlong. BOHO LADY
prompted the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane. TIMELY REWARD trailed while racing well off rail.

Footnotes
ADIOS ASHER prompted the pace in the four path, was driven in the three path around the turn, bid on his left lead from the four path in upper stretch,
stuck his head in front passing the eighth pole, switched to his right lead shortly after, and drew clear. TIZ A TALE laid up close in the two path, was roused
along the rail midway around the turn, swung from the three path into the stretch, and kept on to get up for place late. NEOPHYTE bumped with an inner foe
at the start but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue approaching the quarter, dug in in upper stretch, but evened out
in the final furlong to show. THENORTHREMEMBERS rated in the four path, angled out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and mildly
stayed on. FROSTED FAITH tracked in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, but flattened in the six path down the stretch.
UBIQUITOUS raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden from the two path into the turn, but failed to bid along the inside down the lane.
IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK bumped with an outer foe and steadied at the start, trailed in the two path, floated out to the five path midway around the turn, and
did not threaten. APOCALYPSO chased in the two path but failed to menace.

BRIDLE A BUTTERFLY was reluctant to load, settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer late on the turn, swung four wide turning for
home, kicked in and won going away. ITZA BOSS settled off the duel inside, angled three wide turning for home, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole
and was clearly second best late. NESHUME was reluctant to load, dueled at the rail to midstretch and held well enough for the show. TORCH IS PASSED
hit the starting gate but still broke on top, dueled two wide to midstretch and tired. ENTERDADRAGON failed to menace while racing two wide. DEETZ
played no factor while racing three wide. FOREVER MISCHIEF was outrun inside.

PRACTICALLY DARK trailed in the two path, swung five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in the final strides. ZYDECEAUX set the
pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch, drifted out through the final sixteenth and was nailed. SOUND OF THE BEAST chased the pace four and five
wide and kept on through the lane to gain the show. TURBO saved ground in range, was bumped near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. PAY
ZONE chased the pace three wide between foes, bumped with TURBO near the quarter pole and weakened. MAGICAL WARRIOR prompted the pace in
the four path and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
SWOONATRA set the pace in the two path, waited confidently rounding the far turn, was roused while tipping out to the four path at the top of the lane, and
kicked on to hold sway. GOODBETTERBEST tracked in the two path, was roused from the three path passing the three-eighths mark, took aim while
floating out to the six path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. SWEET SWEETFANTASY rated in the three path, was ridden between foes in the two
path around the far turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. U LITE UP MY LIFE bumped with an outer foe
at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, was coaxed along around the far turn, but got stymied turning into the stretch, and made no impact.
SUDOKU TERRY trailed in the two path, was driven along the rail around the far turn, cut the corner to move up entering the lane, but flattened in the final
furlong. GREY PRINCESS bumped with an inner foe at the start, moved up three wide around the first turn to stalk the pace in the four path down the
backstretch, was driven into the far turn, but faded. NOW SHOWING laid up close in the three path but weakened on her left lead in the stretch.

Footnotes
DANIEL SUN raced well back two wide around the first turn, was sent along outside down the backstretch, seized command early on the far turn, drew clear
and angled in soon after, widened in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. YOU TALKIN TO ME saved ground in range, steadied entering the far turn,
raced two wide between foes around that bend, tipped out in upper stretch and won the duel for the place. IRWANI (ARG) trailed inside, advanced four wide
around the far turn, rallied widest but was outfinished for the place. MILLENNIUM CONDO dueled two wide for five furlongs, chased the winner two wide
around the far turn and weakened in the lane. TIZ A PRINCE raced off the pace outside, was tending to lug in throughout, bumped URANIUM near the
three-quarters pole, steadied entering the far turn, made some progress four wide around that bend but faded while lugging in through the lane. URANIUM
was bumped midway around the first turn, raced two and three wide and never threatened. BIRD WILDCAT played no factor while racing two wide.
UNCAPTURED BOY stalked the pace two and three wide and retreated through the lane. COSMIC SPECULATION dueled at the rail for five furlongs and
wilted.
