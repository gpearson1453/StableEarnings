SALAGADOOLA broke slowest, advanced inside, took over after the half and drew away under mild urging. GOOD PENNY settled behind dueling leaders,
went after the leader in the stretch but proved no match. BEYOND A MILLION lacked speed then finished with some late energy. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM
prompted the pace outside then was finished after five furlongs. NOT A TRACE led narrowly for half mile then gave way. SCOTT ALAIA raced close up
between rivals and stopped. NANA FANNY trailed throughout losing contact with her field.

CORONA CAMPIONE dueled inside then drew away eagerly through the stretch under some pressure. LIL' LATE LUCK lacked speed then advanced well
along the inside to gain place. KHOZY COLBY chased wide just off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. STEAL THE DEAL trailed early then offered
some late energy. JAVA'S LUCKY LADY forced pace outside for half mile and gave way. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY saved ground close up then began fading
on the turn. CHARLIZE CHUB dropped far behind and was never in contention. BAY BAY BIRDIE flashed speed and stopped abruptly.

BAY raced outside in second flight and gave way in stretch. AUNT BERRA lacked speed and never in contention. RAICHU urged close up along the inside
and gave way. ALL HAIL MO clipped heels into the far turn and never a factor. RIVERVIEW heels clipped into far turn and lost contact.

TOP OF THE STREET stalked the dueling leaders three wide then edged to the front in the final yards following a long drive. TRUMPET CALL dueled in
two path, led narrowly to midstretch and continued gamely to the wire. JACKSON ROAD alternated for the advantage inside and battled to the finish.
HUMBLE JOE chased off the pace then narrowed gap too late. ONLYGODCANJUDGEME lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. CRACK THE
CODE trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. CURLINS CRUZIN moved wide off the pacesetters, made a brief bid on the turn then gave way. HOT
LOVE broke very slowly, rushed up then gave way readily.

foes and weakened. EASY DAY forced the pace three wide between rivals and faded. NEW COMMISSION chased off the leaders and was never a factor.
