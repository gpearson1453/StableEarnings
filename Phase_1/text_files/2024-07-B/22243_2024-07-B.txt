Footnotes
PSYCHEDELIC SHACK set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear lead in the turn, widened when called upon in upper stretch and was never
threatened in the lane while in hand late. CAPT. CANDY broke awkwardly to be at the rear of the field, raced up to stalk the leaders through the turn and
finished willingly as second best. OLAZABAL reserved off the pace to the top of the lane, angled eight wide to mount a late rally and be along for the show.
NITRO TIME pressed the early pace, continued to chase the winner on the turn and weakened in the drive. TWIXTER trailed throughout and was never a
threat.

Footnotes
BOOK RUNNER broke alertly to take command from the gate, opened a clear lead while well rated down the backside, maintained that advantage to
midway down the lane and held the closer safe in deep stretch. KISSTHEMOON crowded while racing in tight quarters in the second flight into the first turn
to be shuffled to rear of the field, steadily advance down the backside to be in striking position turning for home and was gaining late in the drive. WE DONT
NEED ROADS stalked the leaders to the far turn, rallied from three wide on the bend to be prominent turning for home and was unable to sustain the bid
through the lane. WE'RE EVEN tracked the leaders down the backside from the fence, lost position on the far turn and rallied passed weaker in the lane.
TIZ SPEEDY was wide into the first turn while racing at the rear of the field, chased down the backside and failed to mount a closing bid. GRATED
COCONUT prompted the pace for the first half mile, lacked a response when called upon into the final turn and faded coming home.

MIDNIGHT AWARD stalked the pace down the backside, rallied into the turn from between horses to quickly emerge on a clear lead and was never
threatened in the lane coming home much the best. KING TSUNAMI tracked the leaders while always well placed, rallied from four wide through the lane
splitting rivals to gamely gain the placw. BOLD LICORICE reserved off the pace while four wide down the backside, circled seven wide at the head of the
lane and closed well. IRA THE ICON unhurried in the early going, raced up the fence into the far turn to save ground cutting the corner at the head of the
lane to loom and finished evenly unable to sustain the rally. CHUCK ADAMS prompted the pace for the first five-eighths and lacked a closing rally.
IMPAZIBLE PRINCE well placed in striking distance while racing five wide, mounted a bid on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. PLUOT set the
pace under constant pressure to the final turn and gradually gave way in the stretch. HE'S FANCY FREE raced wide into the first turn and never posed a
threat. CELESTIAL JOY (GB) raced mid-pack and faded. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was outrun.

AGAINST THE ODDS stalked the pacesetter to the top of the lane and closed willingly to wear the runner-up down in deep stretch. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY
set the pace on a clear early lead, dug-in when challenged turning for home and was outkicked late in the lane. CHAIN REACTION reserved off the pace to
be mid-pack the first half mile and mounted a belated bid to be along for the show. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE raced mid-pack down the backstretch, lost
positon on the bend and came on again late in the drive. STAR WEAVER trailed early and made a steady gain passed weaker rivals. YES SIR ROBERT
tracked the leaders through the turn to be well placed and flattened out in the lane. FEDERAL CASE raced in contention to the turn and steadily faded. MR.
PETE prompted the pace for a hlaf and weakened. JETTIN OUT was no factor.

MARGIN OF AIR pressed the pace for three-quarters, took command in mid-stretch, drifted out while tiring through the lane and held sway. STRAWBERRY
TREAT broke in at the start, then was reserved off the pace for the first half, gained ground along the fence in the far turn, rallied to take second inside the
eighth pole, prevailed by a bob late for the place. WILD VINE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, weakened in upper stretch when engaged by the
winner, surrendered second inside the sixteenth pole and surged again late to miss the bob at the wire. JAYJAYDEE tracked the leaders to the quarter pole
and lacked a closing kick. NAZARENO was not a factor. The rider on number four claimed foul against the runner up number five for alleged interference
out of the gate, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was disallowed and the race was made official as is.

HAPPY UNION unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, commenced a rally on the turn from the rail steadily gaining ground, angled out to the four
path turning for home to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and pulled away late in the drive. DESI'S REWARD set the pace on a clear, well rated lead to
the top of the lane, dug-in when challenged in the stretch, was no match for the winner late but kept-on willingly to be second best. KESTENNA (GB) slow
early to be the trailer well off the pace, angled seven wide turning for home and made a mild rally to be best of the rest. CARLY HUSTLE tracked the leaders
from striking distance to the far turn and lacked a clsoing resposne. HI HEELED WARRIOR stalked the pacesetter for a half mile and steadily faded from
contention. SPECTACULLARI was not a threat.

BULLITINA raced up the fence while in hand to take command shortly away fro the gate, opened a clear lead on the turn and finished unchallenged in the
lane a convincing winner. CITY OF LONDON stalked the winner through the turn, could not gain on that one and came home willingly as a clear second
best. MITI FAST FLOWER trailed early in a well bunched field, rallied up the rail on the turn in an early bid and failed to sustain the rally finishing evenly.
LADY GABRIELLE pressed the pace from three wide to the turn and dropped back as a non-threat.
