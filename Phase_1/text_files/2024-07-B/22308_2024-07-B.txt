Footnotes
CAMILO stalked the pacesetters for the first five-eighths, rallied gaining ground on the far turn, split rivals turning for home to engage the leader in upper
stretch, took control midway down the lane and held the closer safe. EXPRESS STAR broke a step tardy to be at the rear of the field by several lengths
away from the gate, continued unhurried to the far turn, circled the field coming for home and closed well belatedly to be gaining at the wire. DIZZY KITTY
set a pressured pace for the first half mile, disposed of the pace presser on the final bend to open a clear advantage, responded when challenged in upper
stretch and could not hold on late. HIGH STAKES pressed the pace for a half, could not go with the pacesetter on the far turn and weakened coming home.
HOMER JONES went one-paced never posing a threat. SPERANZAS WILL showed brief speed to contend early and steadily faded to the rear.

Footnotes
ICONA MAMA pressed the pace through the turn, took command turning for home and drew away unchallenged in the lane. COURAGEOUS ARI stalked
the pace into the turn, was set to an early drive, angled five wide at the top of the lane and kept grinding to be along for the place. ART NOUVEAU unhurried
early to be at the back of the pack, rallied on the turn circling the field, drifted out through the lane while failing to sustain the rally finishing evenly. HAZARD
PAY set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. LIZZIE BABY raced between rivals in contention for the first three-sixteenths,
dropped back nearing the turn and was not a factor from there. TONI MARIE hustled up the fence early to be well placed and faded on the bend.

Footnotes
ERLAN stalked the pacesetters from the rail to midway on the turn, tipped out to the four path to engage the leader in upper stretch and pulled clear in a
determined drive. WHERE YOU WAS tracked the leaders from three wide on the bend, angled six wide at the head of the lane and made a steady gain
through the stretch. YARDMAN unhurried early to be the trailer, cut the corner turning for home when the filed fanned across the track, and rallied willingly
up the fence but was unable to gain on the top pair. KHOZANDO chased the leaders from five wide on the turn, was fanned eight wide at the head of the
lane and showed mild interest through the lane passing weakened rivals. LEONARD'S LEGACY set a pressured pace to midway to the top of the stretch,
responded when challenged to mid-stretch and weakened inside the eighth pole. CLEMSON TIGER reserved off the pace down the backside, made a bid
while splitting rivals early on the turn and flattened out turning for home. BEAR CREEK pressed the pace for a half mile and gave way.

ARAK set a well rated pace, slowed the tempo down on the backside, responded when called upon turning for home to open a clear lead and held the
closer safe in a well managed ride. HAIG POINT tracked the leader down the backstretch, saved ground rallying along the fence in the far turn and closed
well to be gaining in deep stretch. EL SOLITARIO slow early to trail for a half mile, rallied on the turn to circle the field from seven wide and rallied mildly to
be along for the show. TEMPLET prompted the pace for three-quarters and tired in upper stretch. GIANT PAYDAY raced near the rear of the field
throughout and never posed a threat. SECRETARY OF WAR stalked the pace for five-eighths, rallied five wide on the turn and flattened out coming home.
BLUEBERRY reserved off the pace in mid-pack through the turn, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a closing kick.

UNCLE KENNY tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied five wide to steadily advance to challenge in the final eighth and prevailed in the drive.
MACKENZIE'S NOVVA unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field, commenced a rally nearing the final bend, circled six wide coming home
and finished well belatedly. SPY NOVEL stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, rallied on the final turn to take the lead in mid-stretch and was
out-finished late in the lane. HOLD MY BEER BRO reserved off the pace for five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and finished with good late interest. SHY
DA RUNNER set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead for the first half mile, responded when challenged on the turn, battled to mid-stretch and weakened
in the final eighth. BANDOOLA failed to menace. INSCRUTABLE trailed most of the way and was never a factor. ROBO WARRIOR pressed the pace to the
far turn and gave way.

SAND AND SEA set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon to quickly open a clear advantage and finished unchallenged in
hand as much best. YANKEE DOLLAR stalked the leader throughout, failed to gain on that one as no match and finished willingly as second best. SHE'S
DANCING tracked the pace down the backside, rallied from the inside on the far turn to threaten and failed to sustain the bid. BEECHNUT TROPHY
unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. MARKSMAN QUEEN (GB) raced mid-pack on the first turn, made an
early bid down the backside and flattened out. VALENTINA DAY raced mid-pack through the far turn and lacked a closing bid. BULSARA was not a factor.

TWILIGHT DANCER reserved off the dueling pacesetters in a clear pocket mid-field down the backside, commenced a rally into the far turn saving ground
along the inside, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole around the wall of pacesetters at the head of the lane, battled the runner-up through the stretch
and prevailed in a determined drive. HE'S A MESS unhurried in the early going to be well off the leaders, rallied on the far turn circling five wide, battled with
the winner through the lane and was denied late in the drive. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE taken in hand early to be near the rear of the field, rallied well in the
lane to be along for the show. FIERCE AND STRONG pressed the pace from between rivals through the first turn, settled back out of the pace duel down
the backstretch, circled the pacesetters on the turn to loom at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES was slow
early to trail, and showed some mild late interest in the lane without impact. GOING UP dueled on the lead from the rail throughout under constant pressure,
took the lead at the quarter pole and weakened in mid-stretch. PAYNTED WARRIOR pressed the pace from four wide to midway on the final turn and came
up empty. NICE ACE battled fro m between rivals on the lead for three-quarters, was eased in the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NEW WAYS TO DREAM stalked the pace through the turn while traveling comfortably, angled out five wide at the top of the lane to engage the pacesetter
in mid-stretch and pulled away to the wire convincingly. CHEROKEE CHATTER broke alertly to take command, set a well rated pace under pressure to the
turn, edged clear on the bend to be in command turning for home and could not hold off the winner. SO MOXIE unhurried early while under restraint,
steadily gained position through the turn and finished well belatedly. DOWN TO EARTH reserved off the pace in mid-pack, cut the corner turning for home
to be well positioned and rallied mildly in the lane. ULTIMATE BARONESS was slow early to trail the field and showed some late interest with a
non-impactful stretch bid. WILD LOOKER went evenly failing to menace. SONG OF INDY pressed the pace from the fence to the turn, kept-on to
mid-stretch and weakened late. RUNAWAY BREEZE was not a threat. STRAIGHT MADNESS was not a factor. KATESALUCKYGIRL tracked the leaders
from four wide to be well placed on the turn and had no response giving way in the lane.
