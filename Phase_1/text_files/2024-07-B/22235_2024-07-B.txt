MASTER OF MALICE rated along to race under a hold down the backstretch, made a three wide bid around the far turn and held late under strong urging.
COME RAIN OR SHINE was off very slow, raced off the early going after the poor start, moved up four wide around the far turn into the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. STARLIFTER settled off the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled four wide into the upper stretch and
moved up to improve position. INCISIVE KITTEN set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened. LAST OF BAD BOYS prompt the early leader
two deep from the outside and gave way in the drive. NOBLE GEM was allowed to settle early and failed to respond.

stretch to the outside of the winner and missed in a game effort. SINGLE LADY hopped at the start, raced near the back of the pack after the poor start,
moved up from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and rallied gamely to the wire. GOLD DIGGING BROAD raced mid pack early on, ridden
two deep around the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and was even with no closing run. BALI KUTA hard ridden along the inside around the

stalked the pace from the outside, checked between rivals near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. LIL SWEEZEY dueled near the rail and gave
way grudgingly. GLAMOURCENTS was bumped at the start, had a three to five wide bid in the lane and was even with no closing run. VONGOLE was
bumped at the start, ridden along the inside through the far turn, angled five wide and was even in the drive. JUDY'S FLYER was off slowly, raced at the
back of the pack after the poor start, saved ground through the far turn, shifted five wide through the drive and never threatened. MISTY SUNDAY broke to
the outside, bumped with rival, dueled two deep from the outside of rival and faded through the drive. LIZ DREAMIN was bumped at the start, drifted a bit
through the upper stretch and tired.

the wire. MOONSHINING stalked the pace, took aim four wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. BYRD OF EDEN lag early on, raced along the inside
around the far turn and never threatened. PASS THE CASH chased three deep from the outside and faded. VIENNA'S TWIRL coaxed along two deep and

Footnotes
WHERE'S RAY pressed two deep, dug in near the eighth pole and held game to prove best under strong handling. SMALL FIELD dropped back to race mid
pack, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and rallied for the place position. GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far
turn and kept on willingly to the wire. BRADITUDE sent along to clear over early, pressured through the far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
PICO D'ORO was slow early on, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch, waited for racing room near the eighth pole and moved up
through the drive. SWITZER raced two wide around the far turn, angled out six wide and was even with no closing run. MARCHED had an inside run and
lacked a rally. DEE JAY was off step slow, rushed up stalk the pace along the inside and weakened through the drive. FROGGY THE GREMLIN lost ground
and failed to respond.
