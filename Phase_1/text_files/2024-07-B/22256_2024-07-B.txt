Footnotes
MISTER MAFIOSO saved ground setting the pace and was fully extended to prevail. CHUCKANUT BAY saved ground chasing MISTER MAFIOSO, angled
out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished fast. CORN POP raced two-wide while being reserved off the early pace, angled out to be four-wide
entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CREATIVE BID saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and was gaining late.
NAPOLETANO was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. OVERLY FAST was allowed to settle while racing five-wide and lacked a
response when asked.

RUN SNAPPY saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. MIRROR IMAGE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to be
two-wide nearing the eighth pole and closed strongly. SUMMANUS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished well in a steady effort. TORPEDO AWAY was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PARTY FOUL
prompted the early pace while two-wide and tired. BLAZE OF DREAMS was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. I'M
CORFU bobbled at the start then dropped back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MR. FIREBALL was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, gained a slight lead entering the stretch and proved best under strong handling. UNCLE
LEON dueled for the early lead with BOSS OF THEMOSS from along the inside, dropped back slightly nearing the quarter pole then responded during the
drive and held on gamely for second. TAINO HOUSE was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole bit lacked
the needed late response. MARCH ON LINCH settled in the middle of the field early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. QUIET CHARM
prompted the early pace while racing two-wide and weakened. BOSS OF THEMOSS dueled for the lead from along the outside to the stretch and tired.
THIRD WHEEL was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor. ROLL DEM BONES dropped back while saving ground and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
LIBBY'S GAMBIT was reserved off the pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, split rivals entering the stretch then took the lead inside the
eighth pole and won drawing clear. SQUARE FUN was forwardly placed while racing four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch to join the leaders and
finished well for second in a game try. PRINCESS PAYTON was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch then angled further out nearing the eighth
pole and finished full of run. CANDIED JOULE was allowed tp settle, moved up along the outside on the turn, came six-wide into the stretch, gained a slight
lead nearing the eighth pole and then faltered late. SHE'S A KRAKEN was close-up throughout racing along the inside but lacked the needed late response.
BETTY LUTE settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide and failed to seriously threaten. HOT LAVA CAKE vied for the lead while three-wide,
came four-wide into the stretch and weakened. JIM'S JET vied for the lead into the stretch while racing two-wide and tired. VHAGAR dropped back early
while racing wide and trailed.
