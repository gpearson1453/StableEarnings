Footnotes
CAPTIVATED DRAMA took over the lead soon after the start and set the pace over close running WESTONS WILDCAT, held firm along the inside around
the turn and saved ground entering the lane, kept clear under steady pressure past the furlong marker, dug in gamely in final strides and held on.
WESTONS WILDCAT was off to a good start and remained forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, continued to track the pacesetter around the
turn, given cue two wide in upper stretch, sustained a steady bid then dug in gamely late, was inching up on the winner approaching the wire and just
missed. FIRE BRYAN tracked the pace through early stages, was ridden along three wide late on the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and
gained a share. RAYMOND raced in range along the inside, was ridden along the rail around the turn, sustained an inside bid into the final furlong then
evened out late.

CHANGE IT UP vied inside of SOUNDTRACK for the lead up the backstretch, continued to match strides into the turn, shook free turning for home, quickly
opened up just off the inside, continued to widen under steady urging then finished in hand late. SOUNDTRACK vied outside of CHANGE IT UP in early
stages, continued to battle into the turn, could not move on with eventual winner turning for home, ran on in upper stretch then started to weaken late and
just lasted for place. MS I SPEIGHT raced in the second flight up the backstretch, loomed a threat three wide near the quarter pole, flattened off the leader
entering the upper stretch, but kept on and just missed place. NELLIE THURSDAY raced outside off the top flight in early stages, moved up four wide to
race in close contention near the quarter pole, failed to kick on entering upper stretch and steadily weakened. CLEVER VICTORY lacked speed, raced in
the back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SUZZIE'S DARLIN sped to the lead heading into the first turn, set the pace over close pursuers up the backstretch, remained clear still unasked around the
final turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch, came under a drive, widened advantage and held sway. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL tracked the leader
along the inside around the first turn, edged closer late on the backstretch, came out a path and given cue two wide at the head of the lane, ran on gamely
in pursuit of the winner but had to settle for clearly second best. MUMBLEBEE raced three wide into the first turn, then rated in range up the backstretch,
was ridden along four wide around the far turn, was no match for the clear top pair in the lane but ran on and secured a share. MILLIGANMIKEANDME was
forwardly placed around the first turn and into the early backstretch, hustled along two wide between foes around the far turn, weakened out of the turn and
continued to tire in the drive. SING LUCY SING raced in contention tracking the pace, hustled along three wide around the far turn, weakened out of the turn
and faded through the lane. RISKY WHISKY raced in the back, had no response and steadily retreated.

ALEXIANA was off a step slow at the start, quickly advanced along the outside to move into contention late on the backstretch, was ridden along three wide
around the turn, swerved a bit greenly into upper stretch, straightened out for the drive, ran on gamely and got up late. GOLDEN BONITA sped to the lead
at the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued clear past the furlong marker then got overtaken late. GOTTA LOVE
LIFE chased along the inside in early stages, cut the corner entering the lane and ran on for a share. MIMOSA FOR LUNCH lost forward position after
opening stages, saved ground around the turn, angled out at the head of the lane and needed more for impact. SATADANITE SPECIAL was forwardly
placed racing just behind the early leader, sustained bid for rival around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MY HAPPINESS tracked the top pair around the first turn and up the backstretch, engaged the top pair entering the far turn, vied three deep, could not
match strides for the lead at the head of the lane, ran on, found more in reserve, dug in gamely, moved back up and edged away.
JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS pressed the pace around the first turn, vied for the lead with BAYLEYWICK up the backstretch, took on the added challenge of
MY HAPPINESS around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, responded, shook clear, ran on then got overtaken late. PEGGY RULES was rated
off the pace in early stages, crept up closer racing four wide around the far turn, hustled along three paths wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and
outnodded foe to take show. STYLISH STYLE got bumped at the start and came away last, raced off the pace around the first turn, moved up into
contention leaving the half mile marker, saved ground around the final turn, angled two wide for the drive, gained then lost show in final stride. SASSY AIN'T
I raced three to four wide entering the first turn and raced in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. BAYLEYWICK held a
slim lead around the first turn, vied for the lead with JAYDENQUEENOFHEARTS up the backstretch, took on the added challenge of MY HAPPINESS
around the far turn then tired in the drive. THAT'S OUR VISION raced in early contention near the inside then came up empty entering the far turn.

Footnotes
OKIE CLIPPER was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, engaged IN FORM for the lead entering the far turn, matched strides then
edged ahead to a slim lead late at the quarter pole, came two to three wide into upper stretch, widened advantage and kept to task. DRIFTER was allowed
to settle out of the gate and raced two wide into first turn, gained a couple spots and rated off the trio mid-way up the backstretch, picked up tempo two wide
around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and finished second best. GRANDSONSAM was unhurried and raced in the back through early stages,
swung four to five wide into the lane, sustained a steady outside bid and gained a share. COMMANDER REX raced four paths wide heading into the first
turn, tracked in contention up the backstretch, urged three wide around the far turn, ran on then flattened in the final furlong. AMERICAIN JOEY was
forwardly placed around the first turn then weakened in the early backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and lacked a
needed rally. IRISH RANSOM raced off the early pace, came two paths wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. IN FORM led the way around the first
turn, set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with the winner around the far turn then tired in the drive.
