Footnotes
SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS stumbled at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out steadily past the
middle of the racetrack despite right handed urging and edged clear in the final yards. DRIVEN FOR SUCCESS broke outward, was allowed to settle, rallied
four wide into the stretch, was carried out past the middle of the racetrack by the winner causing her rider to check late and got up for second. TWISTED
JUSTICE stalked the pace along the inside, shifted outside the winner at the top of the stretch, altered course inside the drifting leader nearing mid stretch,
loomed boldly in the four path and was outfinished. SEEYOUINMOTOWN trailed down the backstretch, swung wide and finished evenly. MAP TO MY
HEART chased the pace three wide through the turn, angled inside the drifting winner to the three path near the three sixteenths pole then faded.
WEEKENDING had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS FOR
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND PLACED HER SECOND.

TAHLEQUAH JOE prompted the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, made the lead then widened under mild right handed urging to win as much the
best while taken in hand late. MY HOMBRE rushed to the lead, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner while
clearly second best. BIG TIME FLIRT stalked the pace along the inside through the turn, shifted three wide entering the stretch then finished evenly.
