Footnotes
GRAND ROZZO tracked from off the pace and off the rail into the turn, five deep under vigorous scrubbing around the bend, slowly moved into contention
nearing the quarter pole, engaged the leader from his outside nearing the furlong marker, all out and under a stout drive won the battle to the wire. WESLEY
THOMAS craved out the early fractions, took a clear advantage around the turn, engaged by GRAND ROZZO leaving the furlong marker, fought on gamely
inside that rival to the wire. RUSSIAN HAMMER very slow from the gate, settled in towards the rear of the field around the turn, rallied late between runners
through the stretch. NO WALK INTHE PARK slow away from the gate, circled the field around the turn in the five path, under a drive and outside rivals
finished willingly through the lane. I HAD ENOUGH tracked the pace from along the rail, saved ground around the turn, angled off the inside leaving the
furlong marker, came home evenly through the wire. NET WORTH slow into stride, bid four wide around the turn, had no late kick. BIG TONE C chased the
speed from the inside, under urging had to steady slightly nearing the quarter pole, faded through deep stretch. LET IT RIDENESS pressed the pace from
the two path around the turn, gave way through the stretch. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY chased along the inside, in tight and brushed the rail around the bend,
weakened and retreated from the quarter pole.
