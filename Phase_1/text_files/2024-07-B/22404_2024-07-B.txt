Footnotes
ARGENTINA GIRL raced up the inside in the two path to take the lead after the first eighth, set a pressured pace while well rated to the top of the lane,
dug-in gamely while drifting out through the lane to repel the challenges of the two runner-ups in the final eighth. CLOSERTOTHEHEART taken in hand to
be just off the leaders along the fence in the early going, held up into the turn to pull back off the leaders to angle out to the clear midway on the bend,
circled the dueling leaders turning from home to rally five wide, battled through the lane from the outside but could not get passed the wiinner in a good
effort. TINA TINA TINA broke alertly to be the early leader, settled in hand three wide to press the pace to the top of the lane, rallied willingly while racing
between rivals the langth of the stretch and was out-finished by the top pair. G'S FIREBALL tracked the leaders from four wide in striking position for the first
half and lacked a closing response when called upon in the turn. HARPER BE GOOD was one-paced never posing a threat.

Footnotes
BETTER WATCH IT raced four wide in contention through the first turn, was well in hand down the backstretch while well placed in striking distance, rallied
turning for home to engage the leader inside the eighth pole and held off the runner-up in a determined drive late in the lane. BLIND EYE rated along the
fence in mid-pack down the backside, gained ground cutting the corner turning for home, waited for racing room in upper stretch, angled out to the clear
midway down the lane and finished full of run to just miss. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE settled along the fence just off the leaders down the backside, rallied
scraping paint along the fence on the far turn to take a clear lead in upper stretch and was outkicked in deep stretch in a good effort. LONGWORTH shuffled
at the start to the back of the field, saved ground while racing near the rear of the field to the top of stretch, steadied along the rail in upper stretch and re-bid
with late energy. FOURONEOHSMOKESHOW unhurried early for the first half mile, circled the field in the final bend to mount a mild bid in the stretch. MO
LUCKY chaeck in the first turn off heels angling out to bump rival, settled to rate four wide down the backstretch and rallied mildly in thee lane.
BURROUGHS CAY stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn and faded in the stretch. TABLOID CITY was steadied in the first turn when inside rival
checked off heels to be taken to the outside in his path forcing him wide on the bend, dropped back to be near the rear of the field through the far turn and
showed some late interest in the stretch run. LITTLE CAGEFIGHTER set a well rated pace for three-quarters and weakened when engaged on the far trun.
IS IT FIVE tracked the pace from four wide to the far turn, rallied to threaten on the bend and flattened out coming home. HEART OF FIRE was forced well
wide on the first turn resulting from the chain reaction to his inside, continued to chase from six wide down the backstretch and came up empty. PERFECT
PEACE raced along the fence waving ground for the first half and dropped back never having been a threat.

GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR was nudged up inside rivals leaving the chute and joined the pace fray, put a head in front heading to the three quarter pole
and sparred under rating and to the inside of UNCLE CAT, carried that battle around the turn and into the lane, began to drift a bit near mid stretch, edged
clear under a drive leaving the sixteenth pole and wandered outward through the final yards. UNCLE CAT , away alertly, disputed the pace outside the
winner, was floated out a touch inside the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and remained well clear of the others to secure the place. KING'S RIVER
rated close up between rivals, was coaxed along to hold a forward spot past the three eighths, shifted out four wide as the leaders widened in upper stretch
then failed to drum up a serious response. BROTHER BRAD settled early while three to four wide, edged up slightly four wide outside rivals leaving the far
turn, was under heavy pressure past the three eighths, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and faded. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL , excused from the post
parade, edged up while saving ground past the five eighths, had aim leaving the far turn, failed to kick on under a ride heading towards the stretch and
weakened. TOAST TO COAST , three deep with pursuit, faded in the final furlong. ROCKY DICE , off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride mid
turn, angled out and never threatened.

SUNNY BREEZE , away in good order, rated kindly off the loose leader, edged up then bid between foes leaving the far turn, poked a head in front soon
after, dropped in towards the rail and emerged in a tussle with CELTIC CONTENDER five sixteenths out, ceded to that one near the quarter pole, stayed on
under left handed encouragement, regained command heading towards the sixteenth pole then prevailed under steady handling. WILLY D'S settled three
wide and to the inside of a rival, advanced between runners into the stretch, worked outward past mid stretch, leveled off to a nice stretch leaving the furlong
grounds, closed gamely and just failed to reel in the winner. CELTIC CONTENDER relaxed three wide off the early lead, crept up within himself and bid
three deep leaving the far turn, poked a head in front dueling with the winner past the quarter pole, clung to a slim advantage after being put to serious
asking inside the three sixteenths, stayed on past mid stretch then out finished through the final seventy yards. PLAY HARDER lost ground four wide and to
the outside of WILLY D'S, was under strong encouragement past the five sixteenths, continued wide for the drive but came up empty. EL CAPI stumbled at
the break, regrouped, angled out and rushed up between foes leaving the chute, opened up while securing the inside, was taken on by outer foes exiting the
far turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, faltered, pulled up late when bleeding from both nostrils then walked off.

Footnotes
COAL MINE tracked the leaders from the rail to the turn, saved ground while closing in on the pacesetter on the turn, cut the corner commencing a rally in
upper stretch, tipped out midway down the lane to overhaul the leaders and pulled away clearly best. MYSISTERNANCY raced off to clear lead down the
backstretch while well in hand setting a well rated pace, responded when called upon turning for home to maintaain the advantage midway down the lane
and finished willingly shile unable to holf off the winner late. CANOODLE squeezed at the start when bumped by outside rival, gathered together to be three
wide between rivals into the turn and finished with a mild bid through the lane on hher left lead. SWEET TALIA broke alertly to be away quickly from the
gate, settled to a stalking position for three-quarters and lacked a closing kick in the lane finishing evenly. IRISH LACE bobbled leaving the gate, raced up
two wide to be in contention into the turn, was pinned in early on the bend from between rivals and lacked a response when called upon midway on the turn.
WATER WITCH broke inward leaving the gate to bump rival, raced up in contention from four wide between rivals early, dropped back to the rear of the field
entering the turn and was not a factor.

ST. JOHN'S taken in hand into the first turn to drop to the rail saving ground in the first turn, stalked the leaders from the fence through the far turn under
patient handling, cut the corner turning for home to surge to the lead in mid-stretch and pulled away convincingly. BOLT FROM ABOVE unhurried in the
early going to be three wide through the first turn, was reserved off the pace to the far turn, commenced a rally fiseven wide on the bend and steadily
advance to be up for the place. STELLAR LUTE hard held early to be the trailer, continued to be rated well off the leaders downt the backside, rallied
midway on the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch and closed well belatedly. MISSIONAIRE set a well rated pace through the far turn, drifted off
the rail turning for home kept-on willingly in the lane and weakened inside the final sixteenth. MACKILLOP tracked the pace from three wide for five-eighths,
made a four wide bid to threaten turning for home and flattened out in the final eighth. ALWAYS GAMBLING raced along the fence down the backside in
mid-pack, tipped out two wide into the far turn, lacked racing room for several jumps on the bend causing him to stall briefly and showed some late interest.
SWORE was caught wide into the first turn, raced forwardly to stalk the pace from three wide to the far turn, was set to a drive on the bend and failed to
respond. BEAN MACHINE prompted the pace around the first turn, continued to be close up on the backstretch whille pulling against restraint and came up
empty on the far turn. PRINCE KHOZAN taken in hand while still caught wide into the first turn, chased from four wide and failed to mount a bid.

Footnotes
APPLE PICKER rated patiently in mid-pack saving ground along the fence, tipped out splitting rivals turning for home, was set to a hard drive under strong
handling to collar the pacesetter inside the final sixteenth and be going away in hand at the wire as clearly best. MS. BUCCHERO fractious in the gate
pre-race, broke alertly to quickly be clear, widened the advantage on the turn, finsihed willingly through the lane while no match for the winner to be second
best. JOKE SISI (CHI) broke a step slow to be the trailer, was urged early while still near the rear of the field, circled five wide coming home under a
constant ride to gain the show. CHARRIERE tracked the pace from four wide into the turn, rallied mildly on the bend and finished evenly. HAPPY CLOUDS
brushed the outside of the gate causing the rider to lose his right iron, quickly recovered the sirrup, russhed up to stalk the pace, kept-on through upper
stretch and faded late in the drive. BELLA BETTINA broke inward leaving the gate to bump rival, trailed most of the way swinging wide at the head of the
lane and finsihed without posing a threat. SWEET ALYSSA bumped at the start, responded by keenly rushing up the fence to contend while a bit rank to the
turn and gave way coming home.

FROSTED DEPARTURE was sent clear soon after the break, set the pace under a light hold and towards the inner rail, moved away after being nudged
along past the five sixteenths, entered the lane about two wide, opened up a commanding lead under right handed asking in mid stretch, wandered outward
a bit in deep stretch and proved much the best while kept to some encouragement. TIME FOR TROUBLE dropped in early and settled off the pace, edged
up slightly past the five eighths, was put to a serious ride leaving the far turn, stayed inside into and through the lane and finished up with good energy to be
second best. AUTO GLIDE settled three wide while not too far back early on, came under pressure past the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane,
failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. AIN'T DA BEER COLD tossed his head leaving the gate and broke a bit outward, corrected and stalked the winner
about two wide, had aim leaving the half, failed to kick on under a ride leaving the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS vied outside FIVE DREAMS soon after the break then dropped in after clearing, was joined by outer rivals heading to the half, took
pressure around the turn, spurted clear when put to a stout drive in upper stretch, wandered outward through the final sixteenth and dug in tenaciously to
thwart FIVE DREAMS' resurgence. FIVE DREAMS had speed to the inside of the winner, rated back off that one and angled out, edged up between foes
nearing the half then forced the issue around the turn, drifted out a couple paths as the winner separated soon into the stretch, corrected and stayed on to
pursue past mid stretch, found more despite drifting out in the final sixteenth and closed gamely to bridge the gap. GORDIAN KNOT drafted back off the
pace in the opening furlong, saved ground into the stretch, eased out to work his way between runners in mid stretch then kept on with good energy.
PRINCE OF JERICHO eased back off the leaders early on, rated off the inside, edged up between foes into the lane, gave hard pursuit past mid stretch but
came up empty. LITTLE VIC bumped with SIBELIUS leaving the gate then steadied briefly, lost ground four wide, was under pressure around the turn and
passed tired foes. SIBELIUS , bumped at the break, edged up between foes soon after then bid three deep, prompted the pace leaving the far turn, failed to
kick on under heavy pressure into the lane and weakened in mid stretch. SEVEN'S ELEVEN edged up inside early on and gained a tracking spot, was
under asking mid turn, lacked a punch into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CORONATION TIME reserved in hand down the backstretch tracking the leaders from four wide, rallied on the turn to engage the leaders at the quarter
pole, assumed command turning for home, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and pulled further away through the lane under confident handling. A B C
YA rated off the pace in mid-pack, was put to an early drive early in the turn, circled six wide at the head of the lane and finsihed with good energy to be
second best. RIGHT QUICK stalked the leaders from the fence, waited for racing room on the bend, angled four wide to the clear in upper stretch and rallied
mildly to be along for the show. MINIMO crowded at the start to be the trailer, lacked early foot to be at the back of the field, angled wide in upper stretch
and made a mild, grinding bid through the stretch. SOMETIMES I DO rated off the pace along the rail, steadied slightly at the five-sixteenths pole and
passed tiring rivals in the stretch. UNDER THE OVERPASS raced up the fence to take the lead after the first eighth, set a pressured pace to nearly the
quarter pole and weakened turning for home. BAJAN BOY broke outward several lanes when bobbling away from the gate, was on the early lead, settled to
press from two wide and steadily gave way on the final turn.
