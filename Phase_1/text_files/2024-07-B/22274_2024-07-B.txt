IT TAKES HEART bobbled at the break, dueled briefly with SELF ISOLATION before easing off to prompt that foe from the inside, came under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go and seized command inside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to prevail. SELF
ISOLATION coaxed from the gate, dueled briefly from the three path and then shook away to show the way narrowly between foes, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got headed inside that station and swung three to four wide for home, ran on to chased the
winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. MY FIRST LOVE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and improved position and just secured the show honors on the wire. EVERLYS GIRL coaxed
from the start, prompted the pace four then three wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, got shaken
off and then kept on to come again and miss the show honors by a nostril. REIGNING CHICK coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. CARBON coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, suddenly came under a protective hold when the rider sensed something amiss at the five-sixteenths, got guided to the
outside at the quarter pole and was expertly eased up and pulled up near the three-sixteenths, then was subsequently transported off the course in the
equine ambulance.

Footnotes
NANO MAN was hustled from the gate then contested the lead while coaxed along, dropped just off the pace late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to
the three path on the turn, gained in the four path into the stretch, made a bid outside of two foes at the three-sixteenths pole, disposed of those two
opponents into the final sixteenth and moved clear under good handling. KING PUCK settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the
four path on the turn, angled out while asked for his best in upper stretch, chased outside in the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while unable to
threaten the winner. CLANCY FANCY pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, fought with two rivals while remaining on his
inside lead in the stretch, swapped to the proper lead late and was outfinished then just missed the place while able to get the show then was reported to
have bled. HE HAS IT ALL disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, dropped in leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, fought with two foes under
a drive until near the sixteenth-pole then weakened. FRATELLINO stumbled at the start and was last to commence, settled towards the rear under coaxing,
raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. OUTTAWATERBURY dropped back on the outside, raced in the
two to three path on the turn and was no factor. MAZZEI broke out a bit and near the rear, settled outside under some urging, was roused for more while in
the three then four path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and came up empty.

Footnotes
SILVER SATIN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out
straightened away as ON THE HILL came inwards, dug in under a drive taking command near the sixteenth marker, drifted out two paths late herding ON
THE HILL and gamely fended that foe off to prevail. ON THE HILL coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command with three-sixteenths to go coming inwards to look the aforementioned foe in
the eye, dug in under a drive and was collared near the sixteenth marker, then got herded out a bit late while fighting on between foes to the finish in the last
jumps. YO BANANA BOY broke out at the start bumping BOSS TWEED, chased just off the inside getting steadied off the leader and growing unsettled off
that foes' heels from the nine-sixteenths through to the half mile pole, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and went six to seven wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly to latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the finish while along clear for the show honors. BAD LARRY coaxed from the gate,
chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide
into upper stretch, weakened. BOSS TWEED got bumped at the start while under coaxing from YO BANANA BOY, who broke outwards, showed the way in
hand just off the inside and then along the inside patiently handled until under threat spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, got set down at that
station, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
BOBBY THE TANK angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while challenged on the turn, responded
well when asked near the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear near the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage
into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS settled off the pace,
was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained inside into the final sixteenth, moved out late and safely
secured the place. BONNE CHANCE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two then three path, moved out in upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three
path with three furlongs to run, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. SAFALOW'S MISSION stumbled badly at the start, raced well off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, swung into the stretch in the five path and failed to threaten. SOLO IN PARIS was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace,
moved out near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the four path and failed to respond. VIN SANTO was hustled from the gate, dropped back fast
while hard ridden, raced in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and showed little. G MUNNING was hustled from the gate then
well placed just off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch then dropped back along the rail into the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
UNION DOLLY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch and tipped out finding a developing path between foes three wide a furlong out, rallied on through to take command just inside the eighth
pole, inched away under a drive and held safe to prevail. RILEY JEAN chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick closing in tandem with
GOLDEN ROCKET and just bested that rival for the place honors. GOLDEN ROCKET chased two to three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick closing in concert with the aforementioned foe but was ultimately bested
for the place honors while along clear for the show. MASTEROF THE TUNES coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and then just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to improve position through to the finish. REFLEXIVITY (IRE)
coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and swung three wide for home, offered no response. GIRLS WEEKEND broke out at the start bumping PAROLA SICURA, dueled from the two path
with RECONCILE to her inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command a furlong out, got
caught just inside that station and weakened in the late stages. PAROLA SICURA got bumped at the start by GIRLS WEEKEND, who broke outwards,
chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, lacked
optimal room along the rail in behind RECONCILE, bumped that rival in the hind end spinning her out to the two path a furlong out and weakened in the late
going. RECONCILE coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of GIRLS WEEKEND from the get go coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, yielded the front near the eighth pole, then got bumped and spun out to the two path at that station by PAROLA SICURA while tiring
through to the finish.

INCENTIVE PAY settled off the pace under some urging, was taken in hand outside the half-mile pole then tossed his head off heels, released the brakes
while moving from the two path to the rail on the turn, rallied strongly coming to the quarter-pole, made a bid into upper stretch then took over inside the
three-sixteenths pole, shook clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady handling. DAPPER MOON was fractious in the gate,
broke in then hit the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, shifted from the rail to the two path early on the turn, moved out while picking up
stride in upper stretch, angled further out inside the furlong marker and finished with good energy to garner the place. PERFECT FORCE was hustled from
the gate then urged along in the front half of the field, raced in the two to three path for most of the turn then shifted to the four path, was driven into the
stretch in the six path, pursued the winner in the final furlong and earned the show. FILOSO was carried in early then steadied when SOCIAL HOUR passed
in front, raced on the outside while put to urging, rounded the turn in the five path and improved position. RANGER BATTALION unseated the rider in post
parade and ran loose for about three-sixteenths of a mile before being apprehended by an outrider, moved up then chased on the outside, traveled around
the turn in the four path, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened. SOCIAL HOUR angled in while showing speed, tracked then chased the pace on the outside, pursued the leader in the three
path on the turn, made a bid in the four path into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and tired. AUTHENTIC
GALLOP was hustled to the front, vied in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three path then lost the advantage and gave way. COOPER
chased the pace on the inside, dropped back fast late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to
threaten. TRACK RANGER was ridden along at the rear, raced in the three then four path on the turn and was no factor.

FULL SCREEN broke in at the start bumping ARRO SMASH in tandem with DEER DISTRICT, chased seven to eight paths off the rail down the backstretch
before tucking briefly to the two path at the half mile pole, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and went four wide
at that station, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out, dug in under a drive and was up in the final jumps to the finish. FEDERAL JUDGE established the
front just after the start and showed the way in hand four paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and then along the
inside midway, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside and
was caught in the final strides to the finish. COSTA TERRA chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and closed well through to the finish. GUN IT coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DEER DISTRICT
broke out at the start bumping ARRO SMASH in concert with FULL SCREEN, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, tipped out four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALTERNATE REALITY chased just
off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT
TROUBLE chased four then two wide coming under coaxing midway on the turn, angled tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
ARRO SMASH broke awkwardly striking the off side stall at the start, then got bumped between foes who each broke his way, chased six to seven paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch in retreat
and faltered in the stretch.

MAJOR DUDE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, found
room along the rail when the pacesetter whom was his stablemate vacated the fence in upper stretch, rallied to get the lead inside the furlong marker then
moved clear under steady urging. HARLAN ESTATE raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch,
chased in the three then four path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path, pursued the winner in the final furlong and willingly got up for the
place. CASH EQUITY (FR) saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two then three path on the far turn, swung into the six
path entering the stretch and improved with good courage to just miss the place while up for the show. ATONE established a forward position early, rounded
the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, was asked in the three path into the
stretch, took a short lead outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner inside that marker and weakened. PIONEERING SPIRIT lunged at the
start then was squeezed back while in tight between foes early, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused in the three then four
path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, moved out in the final furlong and improved while reaching his best stride too late.
ANDTHEWINNERIS went three then two wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into
the stretch, raced behind traffic inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. BELOUNI (FR) was taken under a tight hold while just behind horses
early, navigated from the two path to the four path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, stalked in the three path on the far turn, was asked in the four
path into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. STEADY ON moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
asked near the quarter-pole, came off the rail in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
POUNCE broke out at the start trading a bump with LEMON MUFFIN, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out among a wall of rivals, seized command with seventy yards to go
and edged away in the late stages. OVERSUBSCRIBED (GB) brushed the near side stall at the start, tracked the pace under a firm hold in mid pack while
in the two path, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and was patiently handled through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch placed to urging had
to pause and take a very brief and light hold near the eighth pole off the heels of SWEET REBECCA, gained clearance inside that station and was roused
on through finishing willingly for the place honors. VIVE VEUVE settled unhurried just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole and angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the show honors in the late stages. GAVEA (GER) coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits, came under light coaxing just outside the quarter pole and was set down taking the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host and stubbornly clung to command until caught with seventy yards to the finish, then was able to
preserve the last major share safely on the wire. SWEET REBECCA crossed in a path after the start forcing GALA BRAND to steady off her heels, raced
three wide through the first turn and then chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out continuing three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DE REGRESO coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside through the
far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the rail straightened away and weakened in the late
going. MANAMA GOLD stumbled at the start, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. GALA BRAND coaxed from the gate, got steadied just after the start off heels when
SWEET REBECCA tucked directly in front, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, went three wide
through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LEMON MUFFIN broke in
at the start trading a bump with POUNCE, who broke outwards, chased along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch before going two to
three wide through the far turn, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.
MAGIC CROSS broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn and then three to four wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
THORPEDO ANNA lunged outward at the start then hit the gate and was off slow, moved up quickly between horses then brushed with a rival nearing the
first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, stalked the leader on the outside while well out in the track, ranged up in the three path on the final turn, took
over at will just inside the five-sixteenths pole then moved clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew away under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was
flagged with a right-handed crop while kept to the task into the final sixteenth and proved much the best while hand-ridden to the finish. CANDIED moved
from the rail to the three path on the first turn, was coaxed along in third position, moved from the two path to the three path early on the far turn then shifted
to the four path under strong urging, came under the crop late on that bend, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. INTRICATE brushed
with the winner nearing the first turn, dropped in entering that bend, moved from the two path to the rail before the three-quarter pole, settled at the back,
saved ground under urging on the far turn, swung into the four path entering the stretch and failed to threaten while clear for third purse-money. LESLIE'S
ROSE went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way while well off the inside, moved in leaving the backstretch, was asked
in the two path on the final turn, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out around the
furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
EL REZEEN tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled and advanced mildly to be just off the pace when cutting the
corner roused into upper stretch, took over straightened away, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. VINTAGE VINO
grew fractious and broke open the stall door just after BOURBON OUTLAW did the same and inspired ARTEMPUS to do the same, raced two to three wide
in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and got forced to check in the two path when ARTEMPUS came
inwards directly in front, got re-engaged by the rider and angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close outside just latching on the
winner as he hit the wire. DE LA CRUZ settled just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FACTOR ANALYSIS coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside
through the first turn and then three to four wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths tucked back to the two path through the far turn,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. THE JACKAL saved ground near the rear of the field patiently
handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, closed well to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages. ARTEMPUS broke
thru open the gate prior to the start just after BOURBON OUTLAW and VINTAGE VINO did the same, lost the rider and walked through and was taken back
around the gate, remounted and reloaded, broke on top and briefly showed the way until eased off along the inside through the first turn, chased just off the
inside past the stands and then two to three wide through the second turn carrying out FACTOR ANALYSIS briefly to his outside, chased three wide down
the backstretch and through the far turn, came inwards impeding VINTAGE VINO just inside the five-sixteenths forcing that rival to check off his heels and to
the inside of him, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. CAESAR'S GHOST coaxed from the gate, established the front and dueled in hand along
the inside of FOUR TOP, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch leaving the rail open for EL REZEEN and
yielded to that foe straightened away, then tired through to the finish. BOURBON OUTLAW grew fractious and broke open the stall door prior to the start
inspiring a pair to do the same just after, chased along the inside early on and then two to three wide thereafter coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, cornered three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. THIELEN saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
cut the corner into upper stretch, made no impact. FOUR TOP dueled in hand two to three wide with CAESAR'S GHOST to the inside, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.
