EDGE OF GLORY controlled the pace, repelled a stretch challenge and drew away under a drive. MAJOR CAM trailed far behind, advanced inside but
proved no match for the winner. MISTER MOORE urged just off the leaders, angled out on the final turn and faltered. GAMERUN lacked speed, rallied wide
on the final turn and was no threat. CARNIVORE settled off the leaders then began fading on the final turn. WILKINSON WARRIOR saved ground off the
leaders and stopped. JAY'S DELIGHT pressed the winner for half mile then gave way readily.

Footnotes
PIT BOSS led narrowly under pressure then edged clear in the final furlong under steady handling. SHERIFF RONNIE battled the winner to the final eighth
and continued willingly to hold place. ROMAN EMPIRE reserved inside, moved out in the stretch and closed well. SECRET PATH saved ground off the
leaders then flattened out in the stretch. RERALLY broke slowest and raced far back then gained inside late. SAINT MARCO dropped back early and was
never in contention. YES SIR COLONEL lacked speed inside and was never a factor. KINGSVILLE prompted the pace three wide for half mile and gave
way.

gain in the stretch. PEYTON'S COLLEGE dropped back outside and finished with good energy. SHELL BELLE lacked speed, chased wide and finished
willingly while no threat. GAVICHI hustled to narrow advantage inside then weakened in the stretch. PEARLS AND HEELS awaited room inside on the turn,
split rivals in the stretch and closed. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE lacked speed, angled inside and lacked a response. LEAN ON E bid four wide on the turn then
gave way in the stretch. MATTY BO was bumped about early, rushed up to duel then faded in stretch.

FENWICK JACK broke slowly, saved ground throughout squeezed through late and was up in the final yards. SCAMP WALKER broke slowly, swung
extremely wide in the stretch and rallied too late. CHECKING BOXES prompted the pace outside, reached near even terms in midstretch and continued
gamely. MY MAN WOODY hustled to the front inside, widened on the turn then tired late. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then narrowed gap without
menacing. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN urged early, raced off the leaders and faltered. MILAGROSO moved close up outside then faded wide through the
stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CUPID pursued the loose pacesetter then wore down that rival in the stretch. LOVE TO EAT sprinted clear opening half mile, was collared
midstretch but continued gamely. FROSTED DIAMOND advanced outside on the turn and closed strongly late. TEMPEST RISING saved ground off the
leaders and went evenly in the stretch. ROYAL PARTY dropped far behind and was never a factor. ONE OF THE ONES lacked speed and failed to
response. SUNDRIA broke in a complete tangle, rushed up inside then gave way.

ADERO stalked the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch and drew away eagerly while kept to his task. IRISH CORK dropped back early then made a
steady advance in the stretch. MARKET MAVEN settled off the pace inside, bid closer before the half and finished gamely. WINDSOR GOLD set clear pace
for half mile, vied through final turn turn then weakened. LOOSE ENDS raced in clear off the leaders , swung wide in the stretch and lacked a bid.
PRAETORIAN GUARD dropped far behind inside and was never a factor. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER flashed speed for half mile then weakened after half
mile. RIDIN WITH BIDEN was squeezed back just after the start and trailed.
