Footnotes
SQUIRE CREEK established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and held well to the finish. NIGHT EFFECT coaxed from the gate, chased inside early
on and then two to three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of
the rest and along second best. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four
wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. SUPER CHIEF broke out at the start and bumped LUCENCY, chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LUCENCY got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe, chased five wide throughout coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run and weakened in the stretch. SIN NOMBRE bobbled at
the break, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped five to six wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
IRISH TENOR moved in while showing speed on the outside of a foe, went to a solo advantage outside the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn,
was challenged near the five-sixteenths pole, shook off an opponent near the quarter-pole then responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch,
remained on his inside lead in the drive and drew off under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY settled off the pace, dropped
back leaving the backstretch, was roused in the three then four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the seven path and improved to just get the
place. BUSTINO SANTINO chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, was driven into the stretch in the five path, chased the winner into the
final furlong and proved no match then just lost the place while clear for the show. THE COMMISH broke a step slow, rushed up under urging on the outside
then chased the leader, traveled around the turn in the three path, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BRACA was bumped soundly at the start, raced off the pace under coaxing, moved in outside the half-mile
pole, lost position behind SPOOFY as that foe dropped back from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted from the rail to the three path
shortly thereafter then came under encouragement, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. EGYPTIAN QUEST dropped
back to the rear of the field, angled in late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came out to the six path into upper stretch and
failed to threaten. SPOOFY broke out and bumped soundly with a rival, showed speed on the inside of the winner, dropped off the pace outside the half-mile
pole, fell back some more while climbing into kickback into and early on the turn, rounded the bend in the two path under a bit of extra left-rein pressure,
angled out at the top of the stretch, reached the six path near the three-sixteenths pole, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
SLIGHTLY BUSY was hustled to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, shook off a foe while inside on the far turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path, drifted out under pressure outside the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging.
PLAYFUL LASS raced in the four path on the first turn, was urged along off the pace, rallied while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn,
gained fast late on that bend, pursued the winner on the outside into the final furlong, came inward outside the sixteenth-pole then moved back out and
weakened but was well clear for the place. JACKPOT JULIE saved ground while dropping well behind on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along
in the two path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the four path then drifted out and was no factor. ADA MAY raced in the three path on the first turn,
pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, dropped back a bit late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, fell back late on that bend
and tired. SERIOUS LADY went around the first turn in the two path, dropped back on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and faltered then was
eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCE JAMES moved up while hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when
asked for his best in upper stretch, drifted out while battling with the runner-up inside the furlong marker, dueled with that foe to the finish and gamely
prevailed under strong urging. RAM broke out a bit at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved in near the five-eighths pole, started the turn in the two
path, angled to the six path going around that bend, gained in the seven path into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid coming to the eighth-pole, dueled
outside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. PROVEN HOPE was coaxed along on the outside, dropped in leaving the
backstretch, moved from the five path to the seven path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the eighth path and earned the show while no match for the
top two. HATCH chased the pace on the outside then in the five path on the turn and weakened. LORD CAPTAIN was fractious in the gate, broke out at the
start, dropped back while climbing then fell to the rear, moved from the two path to the three path early on the turn, swung into the stretch in the five path
then moved further out and improved to just miss the superfecta. GOLDINI broke out then hit the gate and was off slow, raced towards the back under
urging, went around the turn in the four to five path, dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN came outward
while hustled from the gate, moved up then pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on
even terms for the lead, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. DADDY KNOWS was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace,
floated from the six path to the eighth path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the nine-path then drifted out and came up empty. KHOZY MY BOY was
coaxed along off the pace, went around the turn in the three then two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
POCA MUCHA broke out at the start trading a bump with SISTER LOU ANN, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, steadied
near the quarter pole to take the inside route into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, then went clear under a drive to prevail. BE MY
SUNSHINE four wide through the dog legged first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path with nine-sixteenths
to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place
honors. HOT FUDGE coaxed from the gate dueled from the two path with SISTER LOU ANN to her outside and widened away from the other pair of rivals
down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the
front straightened away, got eased home through the final furlong when tiring through to the finish. SISTER LOU ANN broke in at the start trading a bump
with POCA MUCHA, engaged HOT FUDGE in head to head combat while three to four wide down the backstretch and widened away as a pair, tucked to
the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive and was eased
home to the wire.

Footnotes
BOLD AMBITION went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, vied inside to the two path
on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop and was
given one pop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the finish while best. DARK DEVIL went three then two wide on the
first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, chased while racing from the two path to the four path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path,
pursued the winner to the finish and willingly earned the place. ALWAYS BE SMART was hustled from the gate, dropped to the three path on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the four then five path, came into the stretch in the seven path
and improved to just get the show. HOULTON was hustled from the gate then eased back along the rail on the first turn, raced just off the pace under
restraint, chased while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the four path and tired then lost the show. GLINT
moved around just as the gate opened and was off a bit slow, saved ground while settling near the rear, shifted out from the rail to the three path on the far
turn, dropped to the two path into upper stretch and failed to threaten. CONFABULATION raced inside to the the two path on the turns and was no factor.
STATELY ORDER raced in the three path on the first turn, settled near the back, went around most of the far turn in the three path, dropped to the two path
then the rail late on that bend, steadied off heels after turning into the stretch and was no factor. MAGICAL ROAD rounded the first turn in the two path, was
hard held just off the pace between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the three path to the five path on the far turn, spun into the
stretch in the six path and capitulated. SALACIOUS moved from the five path to the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged
along passing the five-eighths pole, dropped back four then five wide on the far turn and retreated.
