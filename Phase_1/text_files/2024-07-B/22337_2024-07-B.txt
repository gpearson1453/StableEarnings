Footnotes
FREEDOM ATTACK bumped with QUIERO DINERO leaving the gate then raced off the pace from off the rail to mid stretch and made a late three wide
surge to draw clear in the final yards. PROBLEMATICA broke outward leaving the gate and brushed with RESOLUTION then sprinted to a clear lead but
was caught in the final yards. QUIERO DINERO bumped with RESOLUTION and FREEDOM ATTACK leaving the gate and bobbled slightly, raced near the
back through the turn while saving ground and made a late rail bid to be up for the show. RESOLUTION bumped with QUIERO DINERO and was brushed
by PROBLEMATICA then stumbled slightly, she trailed the field to deep stretch but made a late gain for the show. HIGHWOOD chased the leader to eighth
pole and tired. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF RESOLUTION CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF PROBLEMATICA
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START, AFTER A STEWARD REVIEW THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ALLOW THE CLAIM OF
FOUL, SO NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
STERLING LUCK was allowed to settle around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch from two wide then tipped in to make a rail bid on
the final turn, angled back out to two wide at the quarter pole and closed willingly. ELODINE shot away to a clear lead to midway through the stretch then
was overtaken in the final sixteenth to be outfinished but stayed on to be second best. ANOINTED OF GOD was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack
through the final turn then made a late rail bid to be up for the show. JOYZELLA stalked the pace to the final turn and faded. CHIQUITA REINA tracked the
leaders from off the rail down the backstretch, looked to make a bid by going three wide on the final turn and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but was
not a threat. MISS MADALINE was unhurried to the first turn and trailed the field throughout while being outrun.

stretch and split horses in the final sixteenth to draw clear. SUPORB went to the front to a pressured lead from the inside then edged away near the end of
the turn but was collared in mid stretch and saved the place. SHEZA HOOT broke outward leaving the gate, saved ground through the turn then angled out
to midtrack in the stretch for a late rally and missed the place. TAP N TWINE vied for the early lead from three wide but fell back on the turn tried to make a

Footnotes
DOROTHY CROWFOOT was close to the pace early but fell back going into the turn and lacked room on the inside, angled out to two or three wide to split
horses in early stretch to drive past the leaders and cleared late. FRANKEL BABY raced within striking distance from three or four wide, made a three wide
bid on the turn but couldn't catch CLASSIC PERFORMER and was outkicked by DOROTHY CROWFOOT late but stayed on to be up for the place.
CLASSIC PERFORMER vied for the early lead from three wide then moved in and dueled around the turn with BEAUTY OF THE NILE and edged away in
upper stretch but was overtaken late to be outfinished. RIETTA pressed the pace from the inside but was shuffled back going into the turn, angled out to
three or four wide in the stretch for the late gain but was not enough. BEAUTY OF THE NILE hustled to the lead and dueled around the turn with CLASSIC
PERFORMER, fought gamely to mid stretch but weakened late. TOP LOOK remained back. SHORT STRAW raced off the early pace but fell back on the
turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
LADY HELENA rushed to contention, engaged the leader midway through the turn and took the lead before the quarter pole, drew clear and just lasted.
HOLY IMAGE chased the leaders through the turn from two wide then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch to close well and just miss the win.
SAPPHIRE NIGHTS shot away to a clear lead but was collared near the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely to mid stretch and tired. I'M BOX OFFICE
raced four wide to the turn then tipped in while moving up and was no match for the top three but was best of the rest. SEQUAYA raced near the back while
saving ground but was not involved. BRIANA HARPER raced off the pace to the half mile marker then faded through the turn and was done.

Footnotes
ANOTHER MYSTERY trailed early then steadily advanced from two wide down the backstretch, angled out to four wide at the three furlong marker while
still moving up, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch for the late run to draw clear. BAL A KAZOO tracked leaders from the inside to the three furlong
marker and dropped back on the turn but made a four wide rebid in the stretch to be second best. LEADING THE CHARGE raced in the middle of the pace
to the final turn then made a rail bid and took a brief lead in the stretch but was outkicked late. VOTE NO was unhurried around the first turn and trailed the
field through the final turn, made late bid in the stretch to improve position. HARD TO FATHOM raced off the pace from two wide down the backstretch,
moved up to challenge the leader in upper stretch but lacked the response. CODE NAME was away alertly to set the pace while being rank around the first
turn took a clear lead to upper stretch but was eclipsed and tired. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL stalked the pace from two wide down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and took the lead at the
quarter pole and won going away. MAIDEN ROCK was allowed to settle near the back through the final turn when asked at the quarter pole she had her
best strides late to be second best. EMITYAAZ raced in the middle of the pace to the final turn then made a rail bid into the stretch but was outfinished.
MORNING LINE NEWS tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response.
SUMMER AT THE SPA went to the front to an unchallenged lead down the backstretch then was headed at the three furlong marker and fought gamely to
the top of the stretch but tired. DIXIE LOVING was unhurried and never a factor. SIGNATURE STREET raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick. PLACE PICK 8 -

Footnotes
ALVIN raced off the pace on the inside then angled out to four wide near upper stretch and made the late rally under a determined drive. EASY FAST raced
at the back to the turn then moved up from three wide to take the lead at the quarter pole and drew clear but was nipped nearing the wire. MINING CAMP
went to a pressured lead from the inside through the turn and fought gamely in the stretch drive but shifted out near the eighth pole and faded. ICE AXE
raced near the back on the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn but was outkicked in the stretch. RED MOSCATO vied for the lead from three wide
to the turn then dropped back and was not a factor. TALLAPOOSA was reluctant to load but went to press the pace early from two wide to the quarter pole
and dropped back. A JOCKEYS OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF MINING CAMP CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF EASY FAST
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.
