THE TEAM leaving the quarter pole disputed the issue from that point but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was
unhurried early, moved up to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and rallied late. SPROSTON was reserved off the pace while saving ground, slipped
through during the drive but lacked a rally. ALL THE KING'S MEN prompted the pace to the quarter pole while two-wide and weakened. PROUD LION was
forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired.
