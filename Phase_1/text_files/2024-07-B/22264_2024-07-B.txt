PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
maintained her advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened while widening late. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE away alertly and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering he final turn, and finished willingly one out
from the rail in the drive to hold off her stablemate for the place. MINI MARKET stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. MISS ACCELERATE stalked
the early pace while racing three wide into the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but needed more while finishing three wide in the drive.
FLYING MISS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable
to make a serious late impact. HARTLEY MANOR away well and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, struggled to
keep pace entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ARTISTIC
JEWLER through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, got the better of her pace rival entering
the lane, and was all out to fend off a late surge by ICE BREAKER in the final strides to prevail. ICE BREAKER broke sharply and stalked the early pace
while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
rail entering the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to just miss. ARTISTIC JEWLER away well and moved up two wide entering the stretch
the first time to force the issue from the outside of DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER entering the stretch the first time, continued to press the pace two wide in the
run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the lane, and finished three wide in the drive to garner
a share. AMANDA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance midway down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. WALKINTHEWALK unhurried early while trailing the field
entering the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. BAKZONE stalked the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, held
her position into the backside, but began to weaken nearing the final turn, and had little to offer late.

backside, maintained that advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while being ridden out in the late stages. YOU DON'T
OWN ME stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly from along the rail in deep stretch to get up for the place in the final strides. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled well off the early pace while racing four
wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for a share. COBRA JET
away well and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished
willingly two wide from between rivals in the stretch drive. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied from just off
the rail entering the final turn, and finished full of run five wide in the drive. SELF SERVING settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. ANOTHER GUINNESS stalked the

ERLICH stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn while
maintaining his position, eased off the rail to mount a three wide bid entering the final turn, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, and held off an
extremely determined TEX HANLEY in deep stretch the prevail. TEX HANLEY was pinched soon after the start, and taken in hand while trailing the field
three wide entering the first turn, continued with a wide trip through the second turn and in the run down the backside while improving his position, rallied
smartly four wide through the final turn, battled for the lead into the stretch and just missed following a stretch long battle. FRANKIE MACHINE tracked the
leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
shifted four wide in mid stretch and closed willingly to just miss. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY broke sharply and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering
the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of TEXAS MOONSHINE in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was
overtaken leaving the turn, and outfinished late. BROOKYS TAPIT away alertly and stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering the lane the first time,
maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. PARKER POINT stalked
the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, dropped back in the run to the final turn, saved ground through the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TEXAS MOONSHINE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the
first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of ENGLISH BAY TEDDY in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but
weakened in the late stages.

CEREBRO away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, maintained his
advantage into the final turn, and widened his advantage late while under confident handling. BACK SHACK broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
first turn while racing two out from the rail, began to advance soon after entering the backstretch to force the issue three wide into the final turn, and closed
four wide in the drive to hold the place. STAR ENTRY settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his
bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to get up for a share. TIZ VICIOUS away well and tracked the pacesetter in the run
to the first turn while appearing to jump a shadow or something passing the wire the first time, continued to track the pacesetter two wide in the run to the
final turn, rallied one out from rail through the final turn from between rivals, and finished three wide in the drive while being outfinished late. CHICKASAW
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final turn, and finished with late
interest two wide in the drive. BROKE AN BROKEN settled off the early pace while racing two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. STRAIT OF GEORGIA settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering
the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon late.

Footnotes
BETTER TONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail the field entering the first turn, continued to bid his time at the back of the pack through the
second turn, began to advance from between rivals in the run down the backside, launched a four wide bid entering the final turn, assumed command in mid
stretch and drew clear late. ACCORDINGLY broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
pulled his way into a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to prove second
best. DIVAANY settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the
backside, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. EXTRA INNINGS
away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide from the inside of ACCORDINGLY through the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages while finishing at the rail. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT
settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn,
and improved his position over the final furlong without seriously threatening. DAPPER DON settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. CHAMPIOSA stalked the early pace while
saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was
outfinished late. CRYPTO MUNNY lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, was always well back and failed to
make an impact. DON W away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the stretch the first time while
saving ground at the rail, set a pressured pace from the inside of EXTRA INNINGS in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with that rival
approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
