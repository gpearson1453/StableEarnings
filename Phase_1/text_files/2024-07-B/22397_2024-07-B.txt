Footnotes
DREAM PRINCESS took control early and moved inside, showed the way under pressure from COUNCILWOMAN JILLY early then held a short lead over a
pair of rivals at the halfway point, dueled with FLATTERWITHJEWELS into and around the far turn, resisted to the sixteenth pole and edged clear late.
FLATTERWITHJEWELS stalked from inside then moved a bit off the rail, bid between the top pair at the halfway point, dueled around the far turn and into
the lane, battled down the lane but faltered in deep stretch. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY prompted the pace outside DREAM PRINCESS then three deep at the
half-mile pole, could not keep up with the leaders with three furlongs remaining, chased three then four wide on the turn and managed to hold third.
DRAMATIZER tracked five wide into the clubhouse turn then moved in a few paths around the bend, trailed to the far turn while moving to the inside, shifted
to the two path and failed to menace in the lane. PERSUASIVE LIPS stalked four then three wide early, dropped back to last three to four wide also on the
far turn and tired in the stretch.

CHROMEFLASH stalked three deep, drifted four wide on the turn, rallied to the front midstretch, drove clear and was in hand approaching the wire.
DESERT ROCKET was off a bit slow to begin, raced three deep then two wide into the turn, gained while angling to the rail at the quarter pole, tipped back
out in upper stretch, had to put the brakes on when lacking room midstretch, then split rivals and finished gamely for second. CAPITAL OUTLAY closest in
pursuit in the early going, rounded the bend in the two path, challenged from outside a furlong out but got outkicked by the top pair. DON'T HIT ME BASH
tracked out of range early, moved closer inside then two wide on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, kept trying in the late stages but needed to find more.
WESTERN GRIT cleared from outside and cut across, set all the pace to the stretch, confronted at the eighth pole and yielded. NO MORE DING DONGS
stalked WESTERN GRIT from inside, roused into the stretch, put to left handed but weakened in deep stretch. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK raced mid-pack
outside a rival, navigated the turn two to three wide and failed to rally. MISS JO'S CURLIN off slow and trailed early, saved ground through the turn, angled
out at the top of the lane, passed a couple rivals but was never a factor. SHARP WONDER dropped back under coaxing, raced between rivals then moved
inside, moved out a bit on the turn and could not make an impact. HANK WILLIAMS broke a bit slow, settled next to the fence, roused past the quarter pole
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MCKINZIE STREET dueled with EMERALD BAY briefly then cleared at the half-mile pole, challenged again by that rival with three furlongs remaining, put
EMERALD BAY for good at the five-sixteenths pole, drew away into the stretch and remained well clear under a left handed crop and strong handling to the
wire. EMERALD BAY dueled briefly from outside then chased the leader past the half-mile pole, latched on from outside at the three-eighths pole, could not
keep up with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole and finished willingly for a clear second. CURVINO chased off the rail then angled to the rail, saved
ground while falling out of range on the turn, came off the fence in the lane and held third. UNCLE DUDE chased off the rail then climbed early and dropped
back off the pace, entered the turn along the rail, looked to advance but had to wait behind a pair of rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into
the lane, steered out and could not get by CURVINO for the show. B GRAYSON tracked out of range off the rail, took the turn two then three wide and
weakened. CANO FOR THE WIN steadied cautiously on the inside early, trailed into the turn, angled three wide off the fence around the bend and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
PARENTING grabbed the early lead and set the pace with HERO STATUS to the outside, pressured by rivals on both sides at the nine-sixteenths pole,
overtaken by ARROWTHEGREAT past the half-mile pole, dueled into and around the far turn, regained the advantage past the quarter pole, put away inner
rival in upper stretch, showed the way clear into the final sixteenth and held off the late run from HERO STATUS in the closing moments. HERO STATUS
pressed from outside early, back off to stalk the top pair at the halfway point, bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with the top pair
with a quarter mile remaining, three wide in pursuit turning for home, back back on late but could not get by. ARROWTHEGREAT stalked in hand from the
fence around the first turn, went up to challenge early on the backstretch, took over past the half-mile pole, dueled around the far turn, gave the lead back to
PARENTING past the quarter pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on from inside for a clear third. ULTIMATE GAMBLE broke a step
slow, tracked four wide around the first turn, moved inside a pair of rivals at the halfway point, angled out to the three path around the far turn and came up
empty. REDLINE chased two then three wide around the first turn, three then four wide on the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
CODE DUELLO forced the pace from outside up the backstretch, fought on even terms past the five-sixteenths pole, put away HELLADIC in upper stretch,
threatened by a pair of rivals to the outside in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. HOT BOX bumped outer rivals leaving the gate, stalked the top pair
along the rail, took aim two wide leaving the turn, tipped outside the leader at the top of the lane, challenged between foes in deep stretch but could not get
by. GIVE ME THE LUTE stalked the pace outside rival, moved to the three path on the turn, bid three deep in the final sixteenth but could not summon the
needed late kick. TIME TO PARTY dropped back on the inside early, made some progress saving ground around the bend, steered out in the lane and
finished with a mild rally to round out the superfecta. HELLADIC antsy in the gate, showed good early speed and held a short lead under pressure to the
turn, headed by outer rival past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
COMMANDER (FR) got bumped on both sides at the start, traveled between foes at the back, had to steady off heels at the three-eighths pole, shifted to
the rail, tipped out at the top of the lane and improved position. JOHNNY DRAMA bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace between foes then angled to the
inside, crept closer while easing over to the two path around the turn but flattened out in the drive. JETOVATOR laid off the pace four then three deep early,
navigated the turn four then three wide, moved out and lacked further response. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN broke a step slow on the outside, settled three
deep at the back, went three then four wide on the turn and was never a factor. AWESOME RHYTHM chased from off the pace between foes, went two
wide through the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
DANZING CAT tossed her head to lose a step at the start but quickly went up to challenge outside rivals for the lead, cleared at the half-mile pole then
angled in, drew away past the five-sixteenths pole, asked right handed leaving the turn, led well clear into the final sixteenth, grew weary late but was able to
hold on. SABRES chased out of range on the inside, tipped two wide around the bend, split foes at the eighth pole, came with a late run but ran out of time.
RESPECT THE CROWN chased off the rial then three deep into the turn, roused around the bend, moved out in the lane, could not produce a bid but
churned on to save third. NORAH'S PRINCESS climbed early chasing off the rail in mid-pack, took the turn three to four wide, kept trying through the lane
and just missed the show. SAPADILLA vied inside rivals briefly then chased past the half-mile pole, saved ground and was asked right handed leaving the
turn, came out a bit at the eighth pole and weakened. BIG HOPES raced two wide at the back into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the lane and
kept on to improve position. DISCREPANCY sat at the back three deep early, gained four then five wide on the turn but flattened out in the furlong grounds.
ACCLAIMED PREACHER traveled four deep at the rear, went five wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend seven wide, moved inward in the lane
and proved no menace. ILA VEIW TOO raced inside rivals at the back, trailed along the rail then two wide on the turn and was never a factor. SILVER
LIGHTENING vied between briefly then chased past the half-mile pole, faded on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
STYLISHLYACCLAIMED forwardly placed three then two wide early, kept off the rail and was ridden along three wide into the lane, drew alongside the
leader in midstretch and drove clear. GLORIOUS LIFE took control and moved inside, set the pace under pressure into the backstretch, shook free at the
quarter pole, confronted by the winner midstretch, clung to a narrow lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded shortly after. BLAME THE CLASSIC stalked the
pace along the inside, coaxed through the far turn, cornered well into the lane, lugged in and hit the rail in upper stretch, then finished willingly while moving
off the fence and gained the show. VODKA VODKA brushed with inner rival at the start, closet in pursuit early then drew alongside the leader into the
backstretch, could not kick on with GLORIOUS LIFE at the quarter pole, weakened in the late stages but saved a minor placing. FIGHT BACK stalked three
deep between foes then had to check off heels prior to the first turn, moved into the two path, traveled in mid-pack between in the middle stages, continued
two wide on the far turn, steered out in the lane and lacked a bid. WAR SWIFT fractious in the gate, stalked between then got put in tight approaching the
first turn, moved to the inside, saved ground through the far turn and could not rally. VOLS unhurried in the early going and traveled two then three wide
around the clubhouse turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch and lacked the needed response. WASTING ACES broke inward, started to pull early on the
inside, continued to fight the rider around the first turn and up the backstretch, chased two wide to the stretch and failed to menace. RAZEN THE STAKES
off slow to begin, traveled on the inside near the back, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. BRUISER came away slow, trailed to the stretch
and passed tired rivals. RATLEFF brushed leaving the gate, raced outside a rival near the back then off the rail, traveled four deep around the far turn and
could not make an impact. HIGHPLAINSDRIFTER tracked four deep early then three deep on the clubhouse turn, remained wide to the stretch and came
up empty.

SHOT OF COURAGE raced up close in the two path, stalked the leaders to the far turn, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared three wide into
the lane and drew off. DADDY JUSTIFY traveled in mid-pack on the inside then came off the rail a bit around the clubhouse turn, moved into range in the
middle stages, chased two wide then a bit off the rail into the lane, finished determinedly along the inside, moved out at the sixteenth pole and gained
second. MONGOLIAN CHAMP got bumped on both sides early, chased four to five wide on the clubhouse turn, moved up from outside on the backstretch
challenged three deep at the half-mile pole, chased after the top pair off the rail on the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, lugged in at the eighth pole and
gained the show honors. PALAGIO settled four then three wide early, launched a bid approaching the half-mile pole, dueled into and around the far turn,
overtaken at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. ARROMAX broke a step slow and settled inside, moved out on the backstretch, came four wide into
the lane and lacked the needed response. SUPREME COAST had to check hard off heels on the first turn, chased off the pace up the backstretch, rounded
the far turn in the two path and could not answer the call. ALOHA CHROME chased off the pace two wide into the first turn then climbed and dropped back,
trailed up the backstretch, entered the lane four wide and was not a factor. FLYING BLIND bumped with inner rival early, chased five then four wide early
toward the rear, navigated the far turn three then four wide and failed to menace. STREET TALKER showed speed four wide into the first turn then moved
inward and pressed the leader into the backstretch, led briefly approaching the half-mile pole but was quickly overtaken, dueled to the far turn, could not
keep up around the second bend and weakened. LE MANS bumped with outer rival early, forwardly placed off the rail into the first turn then took over and
moved inward, dropped back quickly on the backstretch, eased into and around the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

JOHANNES closest in pursuit in the two path, drew alongside the leader entering the lane, quickly took over in upper stretch and drew away. DICEY MO
CHARA (GB) stalked between rivals then settled off the pace in the two path, traveled three deep into the far turn, moved out in the lane and bested the
rest. BALNIKHOV (IRE) allowed to settle at the back along the fence, trailed up the backstretch and far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, altered out at
the sixteenth pole and rallied for the show. MASTER PIECE (CHI) raced off the pace on the inside, moved into range on the backstretch, continued to save
ground through the far turn, got boxed in upper stretch, tipped out and kept on for a minor award. EASTER (FR) was off slow in the beginning and coaxed at
the back for a bit, traveled near the back under reserve while pulling early, raced outside a rival into the far turn, tipped out into the lane and produced a mild
rally. DU JOUR stalked outside rivals leaving the chute then moved into the two path, tracked three deep at the half-mile pole, continued three wide to the
stretch and lacked a bid. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) unhurried in the early going from the two path, moved to the inside on the backstretch, stayed on the fence
through the far turn, lacked room from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole, then found room and improved position. BALLADEER cleared and steered across
to the inside, showed the way unchallenged to the quarter pole, tested by the winner entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. THERE
GOES HARVARD stalked the pace from the rail position, moved off the fence on the backstretch then traveled between foes at the half-mile pole, continued
to give chase between rivals on the far turn and down the lane, got put in tight at the sixteenth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
NEEZER DALTON stalked the lone leader up the backstretch, ridden along on the turn and challenged from outside past the five-sixteenths pole, took over
inside the quarter pole, cleared into the lane and drew away. WE'LL DO IT LIVE stalked three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, was closest in
pursuit of the winner with a furlong remaining but had to settle for a clear second. PERFECT IN GRAY sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch,
challenged by NEEZER DALTON around the bend, resisted to the quarter pole, then gave up the lead, chased the winner into the lane, weakened in the
furlong grounds and managed to hold on for third. SUPER ENTICING lacked early speed and trailed before moved up slightly outside a trio of rivals,
remained wide through the turn and raced five deep turning for home, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. PACE LANE bumped with
outer rival leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack inside pair of rivals, saved ground on the turn, steered off the fence in the drive but failed to threaten.
SMILE BABY SMILE stalked off the rail then between rivals, started to weaken two wide on the turn and faded. SATELLITE HEART broke slow and bumped
with PACE LANE, raced toward the rear between foes, chased two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. ANNA'S WISH saved ground well off the pace
and failed to menace. PUTT FOR DOUGH traveled in mid-pack three deep early, raced four deep into the stretch and never responded to urging. BELLA
VIENNA raced in mid-pack between foes on the backstretch, rounded the bend two to three wide and came up empty. BEAU SOLEIL sat off the pace and
went three deep into the turn, ridden along keeping off the rail, entered the lane four to five wide and was never a factor. ROSE OF JERICHO brushed
leaving the gate, raced three deep toward the rear then off the rail, trailed into the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
MOMENT'S PLEASURE brushed the gate and bumped with outer rival at the start then bumped again shortly after, raced up close in the two path, bid two
wide at the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch and shifted in at the eighth pole, drifted out then back in a bit and held well. WORTHY OF MAGIC
showed good early foot and angled inward, led clear to the far turn, pressured by MOMENT'S PLEASURE around the bend, maintained a short lead to the
top of the lane, lost command in upper stretch, floated in slightly by the winner at the eighth pole and stayed on to the wire. COURT SNORT traveled
mid-pack on the rail, tipped two wide and waited between rivals on the far turn, give her cue at the top of the stretch, finished with a late rally but could not
get by WORTHY OF MAGIC for second. DONTMESSWITHTESS was positioned well off the pace on the inside, remained on the fence through the far turn,
ran into traffic entering the lane, roused once in the clear and closed well to earn a minor award. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES pulled early on the inside then

then three deep into the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn and faded out of contention. LADY MARY LOU had to take up when losing
