Footnotes
BURTON WAY went to a clear lead to set the pace, drew off on the final turn but tired badly late and just lasted. AMANI'S TIGER prompted the pace from
two wide down the backstretch then moved in to save ground around the final turn and dug in late to battled outside of ASPINRING COMEDIAN down the
stretch and just missed. ASPIRING COMEDIAN raced off the pace from three wide around the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch,
moved out to three wide at the quarter pole, shifted back inside at the eighth pole to battled inside of AMANI'S TIGER down the stretch with good late effort
but was denied. ADMIT NOTHING saved ground to no avail. ADIOS JOE stalked the pace from four wide around the first turn then steadily faded and was
outrun.

Footnotes
ANAITA raced near the back then circled the field from five or six wide on the turn to take the command in early stretch and drew clear. ABOVE THE LIMIT
sprinted away to the lead then edged away on the turn but was collared in early stretch but kept on to be second best. ROYALLY BLUE raced near the back
on the inside, swung out to mid track in upper stretch for a late rally to be up for show. MARIAN CROSS (GB) raced close up on the pace while going four
wide around the turn but was outkicked. GRACIE DIAMOND prompted the pace from the inside, made a milde bid in the stretch but was outfinished by the
late outside rivals. MUSICAL DESIGN broke well to be placed off the pace from three wide but didn't have the late kick. CAST NO STONES had no early
speed and was never a threat. WEST ABBOTT raced off the pace in the two path but had no late response. Due to a timer malfunction in this race the first
quarter time is under review.

CROOKED DREAMS rushed up the rail to a pressured lead but kicked clear near the quarter pole and won going away. RUSSIAN HAMMER raced in the
middle of the pack from three or four wide then shifted inside to save ground around the turn while steadily advancing on the leader but couldn't catch and
chased winner home to be second best. I HAD ENOUGH pressed the pace from two wide to the end of the bend then weakened but stayed on for show.
NET WORTH trailed the field through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch for a late bid to improve position. WEMBY stalked the pace from
four wide to the turn then moved in to three wide around the turn but lacked the late response. PAPA DO PAPA DO raced near the back while saving
ground to the turn then moved out to two wide on the turn, tipping out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid. PRINCE FRED raced off the pace from
three wide to the turn then retreated. WOW WISH was hustled early then stalked the pace from three wide, angled in to save ground around the turn but
was not a threat. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

SWEET SUMMER LOVE saved ground through the turn then moved between horses near the eighth pole and drove past the leader to draw clear late.
MAGNOLIA WIND stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then moved up to take the command midway through the turn but was caught in the last
sixteenth but stayed on to be second best. LITTLE HOT MESS tracked the leaders from four wide to the turn then tipped in to three wide around the turn,
shifted in to make a rail bid in the stretch to be up for the show. BOUNTY KILLAH pressed the early pace from the inside then fell back on the turn, angled
out to four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick. SMOKIN SISTER broke well to go to a pressured lead to the turn, edged way briefly before being
caught midturn and gave way. A LOTTA MOXIE raced near the back through the turn then made a mild inside stretch bid but was not a factor. NOBLE
OBSESSION raced near the back going two wide on the turn but showed little. TIZZ THE G trailed the field and gave a dull effort. Due to a timer malfunction
the quarter time is under review.

MR MAC QUHAE raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide to vie for the lead at the half
mile marker and took the lead in upper stretch and drew clear. GHOST STALKER raced off the pace from three wide around the first turn then moved up to
take the lead at the half mile marker, drew clear midway through the turn but was collared in upper stretch and flattened out. DEEP FAITH tracked the
leaders from the inside around the first turn then made a middle move from two wide to be along for the show. ZIPPER ZAPPER pressed the pace from the
inside around the first turn then was allowed to settle off the pace down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn but failed to menace.
HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved up from three wide around the final turn to make a mild late bid but was
not enough. MY DANNY BOY shot away to take the early pressured lead from two wide to the half mile marker then was overtaken and pressed the pace to
midway through the final turn and faded. EKATI'S VERVE chased the field and was never a threat.

FUN NOTION vied for the early lead from three wide then fell back on the turn, re-engaged the leader in the stretch to battle outside of KING KONTIE to
deep stretch and cleared late. KING KONTIE hustled to a clear lead on the turn but was headed in the stretch and battled inside of FUN NOTION to deep
stretch to give way grudgingly. SCIENCE (IRE) saved ground to the turn then moved up on the turn and saved the show. SAVAGE DRAGON pressed the
pace from the inside early then had to steady going into the turn and lost action, went three wide into upper stretch and brushed with WORA but made a
mild late bid to save the fourth place finish. WORA stalked the pace from four wide through the turn but failed to menace. CODE OMAHA raced near the
back and passed tired one in the stretch. GOLDEN ARM was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOCA ROYALTY rated inside off the duel, full of run waited behind the trio of leaders, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive.
GIA'S FUEGO dueled three wide into the turn, inched to the front leaving the quarter pole, unable to match strides with the winner fought on between
runners through the wire. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA slow away from the gate, under urging along the inside around the bend, darted outside rivals in upper
stretch, and rallied late for the show. AFLEET DIVA dueled between runners into the turn, bid between leaving the quarter pole, out kicked through the
stretch. VANISHING FAITH raced off the pace and three wide into the turn, bid outside rival around the bend, in range nearing the furlong marker faded to
the wire. BALI MOON slow into stride, came under urging around the bend, came up empty through the wire. ONE TOUGH DAME dueled inside into and
around the turn, under constant outside pressure, gave way through the stretch. VIKING QUEEN chased along the inside, under a drive around the bend,
never threatened through the stretch.
