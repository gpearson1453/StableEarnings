WE WILL CONQUER slow into stride well handled, widest run stretch along in time under steady handling to the wire. EL GUNNER broke awkward, rushed
inside, held up through the turn, angled out and ran on gallantly to the front through the stretch in a game effort and probably the best today. BOSPHORUS
BLUE three wide speed to turn, led into stretch, inside run weakened. ONE FOR MY BROTHER raced along evenly with late response when needed in the
