GREATHEART well placed behind the top pair near the fence, given his cue at the five-sixteenths pole, surged clear with a quarter mile remaining, kicked
away under left handed urging in upper stretch and held gamely nearing the wire. ZIMBA WARRIOR chased three then two wide outside a rival on the first
turn, dropped back a bit in the middle stages, raced in range two wide then along the inside on the far turn, moved out in the drive, closed well in the final
fifty yards but could not get by the winner. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) reserved in the early going and moved inside, trailed up the backstretch, passed a
pair of rivals into the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane and gained the show. ABADON pressed from outside, moved up to duel on the backstretch, fought
with inner rival to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the new leader with a quarter mile left to run, chased in the three path turning for home,
continued to churn on through the final furlong and got edged for third. SLEW'S JOY grabbed the early lead and showed the way while racing keenly in
hand under pressure from outer rival, headed on the backstretch, dueled to the five-sixteenths marker, relinquished the lead to the winner, chased two wide
into the drive and weakened. GRANADA FLAVOR trailed under coaxing early, took the first turn three then four wide, moved into striking distance in the
middle stages, rounded the far turn five then four wide and flattened out in the lane. CROSS EXAMINE unhurried in the opening stages and moved into the
three path, stayed off the rail to the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BRAVESTONE stalked in the four path, drew alongside the top
pair at the half-mile pole, could not keep pace and chased after the new leader four then three wide, moved in a bit entering the lane and faded.

A VOTRE SANTE vied three deep early then dueled outside JUST TRUST ME leaving the backstretch, fought head to head through the turn, inched ahead
in upper stretch and gamely prevailed. JUST TRUST ME vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then dueled into the turn, battled with A VOTRE SANTE
around the bend, fought back along the fence down the lane and finished gamely in defeat. EL ONDEADO showed early speed between rivals, chased the
top pair past the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend two then three wide, finished willingly in the final furlong and whittled the gap on the top pair late.
MR. MACHUPICCHU bobbled a bit shortly after the start, climbed a bit chasing in range from inside, angled out for the turn, spun four wide into the lane and
could not rally. GIANT LUTHER climbed a bit and dropped back off the pace, got put in tight on the rail and steadied entering the turn, saved ground to the
stretch and improved position. DYNODAVE dropped back under coaxing on the outside, traveled two to three wide before angling out late on the bend and
kept on to improve placing. VALENTINES CANDY lacked early speed, trailed along the inside then moved into the two path around the bend and passed
tired rivals. ESCAPE PLAN shied from rival breaking inward at the start, raced in mid-pack off the rail then angled in entering the turn, eased out and came
three wide into the stretch, then weakened in the drive. KANGAROO COAST coaxed from the gate, tracked off the inside, navigated the turn four then five
wide and weakened. SMILING MIKE lost his path at the start, traveled outside a rival in mid-pack into the turn, exited the bend in the two path and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
PALEO'S PRINCESS dueled from outside to the turn, cleared inner rival early on the bend and moved to the rail, put to left handed urging in upper stretch,
switched to the right hand in the final sixteenth and remained clear to the wire. RECINTO ROMPERE dropped back and trailed into the turn, checked behind
rivals at the quarter pole, angled to the inside in the lane and rallied from the fence to earn the place honors. SHE'S A JOKER raced in range from the two
path, tipped out at the top of the lane and got edged for second. WOODBINE WAY stalked the top pair from inside, altered out and bumped ADAAY IN ASIA
(GB) into the turn, moved back to the inside around the bend and flattened in the drive. AVENTAPP settled from inside, ran into traffic and had to alter out at
the quarter pole, moved out further in the lane and needed to find more. SHE'S GOT A WAY chased from off the pace, traveled three wide then tipped four
wide leaving the bend and could not threaten. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) stalked the dueling pair outside a rival, got bumped and moved to the three path into
the turn, chased two wide into the drive and weakened. CORUSCATION dueled from inside, checked in tight entering the turn, trying to get out around the
turn but was corrected enough by the rider and faded in the lane. GRITTY GIRL threw her head and rubbed the gate to spot the field a few lengths, moved
up outside rivals, took the turn three wide but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
INDISPENSABLE settled six then five wide around the clubhouse turn, chased between into the second bend, rallied three to four wide on the far turn, drew
alongside the top pair with a furlong remaining and dug in late to inched ahead for the victory. ABITMISCHIEVOUS sent to the front from inside, led two
wide then a bit off the rail around the first turn, cleared past the five-eighths pole, pressured again by CANADA GATE nearing the half-mile pole, cleared into
the far turn, confronted once more by CANADA GATE the five-sixteenths pole, maintained command into the stretch, fought with a pair of rivals through the
final furlong and yielded grudgingly in the end. CANADA GATE away well in the beginning then pressed from outside early, chased the leader past the
five-eighths pole, latched on again near the midway point, lost contact into the far turn, came with another attack at the five-sixteenths marker, fought
outside the lead to upper stretch, battled between rivals in the late stages and could not summon the needed late kick while proving a game third.
WINTERFELL bobbled leaving the gate, chased four wide into the clubhouse turn then angled to the two path, asked at the seven-sixteenths pole,
continued two wide to the stretch and weakened. VISCERAL tracked four then three wide early, remained off the rail and was asked right handed in the
three path leaving the far turn, then also weakened down the lane. MONGOLIAN GOLD tucked inside off the pace, raced at the back in the middle stages,
rounded the far turn along the rail then in the two path and failed to menace. BATTLE CRUISER chased five then four wide early, dropped back under
urging on the far turn still keeping off the inside and had little left for the drive. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES off slow to start, trailed in the five path then moved
into the three path around the clubhouse turn, raced outside a a rival at the rear on the backstretch, trailed five wide into the stretch, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN bumped with outer rival at the start, showed the way early with MIRINDA alongside, clear that rival leaving the backstretch, saved ground
through the turn, roused at the top of the lane, carried a comfortable lead into the final sixteenth, grew a bit weary late but was able to hold. DORIE MILLER
threw her head and came away slow, trailed on the inside into the turn, ridden along while passing rivals from the fence, tipped out at the top of the stretch,
came with a late rally but ran out of time. BOLD CHOICE traveled in mid-pack on the inside, cut the corner into the lane, moved off the fence and showed
late effort to close the gap on the winner. MIRINDA bumped with BABY KRISTEN at the start, pressed that rival from outside early, chased after the leader
into the turn, remained closest in pursuit from the two path to the stretch and finished evenly in the late stages. SASSY PRANCELOT traveled outside a rival
off the pace, lacked room and steadied on the turn, chased in the two path exiting the bend and kept on trying in the furlong grounds. QUICK KATE sat off
the pace, raced along the rail then angled three wide on the turn, moved back inside and closed the gap late while unable to threaten. GIANT KID broke a
step slow, raced near the back in the two path leaving the backstretch, angled widest on the turn, tipped outside a rival in the drive and was not a factor. O
MANDY stalked off the rail, chased out of range three wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. DONITA ROSE stalked off the inside, lost
ground four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
SPLASHED IN GOLD sped to the front and moved inward, coaxed along through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, showed the way under right
handed urging into the final sixteenth, came under heavy pressure from SUMMER CHIEF late but was able to hold on. SUMMER CHIEF got knocked into
rival inner rival at the start, coaxed to a forward position, asked right handed midway around the bend, chased within a length of the leader with a furlong
remaining, drew alongside late but could not get by. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN chased the leader outside a pair of rivals, rounded the bend four then five wide,
took aim three deep into the final furlong but finished evenly late. OCASEK broke in and bumped SUMMER CHIEF, chased up close between foes, took the
turn three wide, followed the leader between rivals into the final furlong but weakened in the final sixteenth. DORADUS broke out, raced near the back in the
early going, navigated the turn five then six wide and improved position. NEXT TRICK chased inside rivals under coaxing, climbed between the half-mile
pole and seven-sixteenths marker, dropped back on the turn, hugged the rail to the stretch and kept trying through the lane. SIR ROCK got bumped from
outside at the start, raced in mid-pack outside a pair of rivals, took the turn three then two wide and lacked the needed response. EDDIE'S WAVE sat in
mid-pack between rivals, lost ground two to three wide on the turn and weakened down the lane. WINSITWELL broke a step slow, climbed early near the
inside, came off the rail a bit around the bend and failed to menace. LISA'S DOCTOR S stumbled leaving the gate, traveled outside a rival at the back,
stayed off the rail to the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH sped clear and controlled the pace on the inside, coaxed along while easing over to the two path on the final turn, asked right
handed in upper stretch, switched to the left hand midstretch and widened under hand urging. REINCARNATE closest in pursuit from the two path, coaxed
along in the middle stages, came under a ride and was asked left handed on the last turn only to watch the winner start to draw away, continued under a
drive to the eighth pole, then was lightly coaxed through the final furlong to finish a clear second. SALESMAN (IRE) stalked three deep to the final bend,
spun four wide into the drive and held the show. DUAL THREAT went four wide into the first turn then settled in three path at the back of the field, continued
off the rail around the clubhouse turn, lagged behind in the middle stages, went four wide into the last turn, angled down to the inside and failed to menace.
CALM SEA rated along the inside, stayed in range up the backstretch, moved out to the three path around the final turn, came up empty in the lane, was
