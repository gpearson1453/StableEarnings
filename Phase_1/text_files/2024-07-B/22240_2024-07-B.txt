Footnotes
DEFIANT GIANT rated close inside on the first turn, started his bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the far turn, dug in under steady
handling and took over late yards. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced
close four wide on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. ZIGGY STARDUST settled off the rail the opening turn, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BRADLEY DO RIGHT raced with the early pace two deep
and gave chase past the nine sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the eighth pole but relented inside the sixteenth. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM raced with
the early pace two deep then took the lead passing the nine sixteenths pole and was pressured into the backstretch, contested even terms on the far turn
but flattened stride mid-stretch. ONE CANDY CASTLE stalked the early pace three wide, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at
the five sixteenths and faded in the four path on the far turn. ON A WHIM raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
DADSNUMBRONEHELPR took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on
the turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. JUBA'S HEART gave chase and raced close near the rail on the turn, then dueled to clear second past
the eighth pole. BOLD ROCK broke sharply then gave early chase outside, raced close off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. IM THE
DIRECTOR chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. BAIL IS DENIED gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and
flattened stride. BLUSHING KAYLA lunged inward and made sharp contact with Manny Too leaving the gate while her rider lost his irons in the process.
BABY BOSS ALLEN exchanged contact with DIRECT APPEAL leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three
path. The latter exchanged contact with Baby Boss Allen leaving the gate then saved ground. OUR BRIGHTEST STAR gave early chase but steadied
between horses in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the turn and weakened in the lane. MANNY TOO was bumped soundly
leaving the gate and moved to the outside.

Footnotes
GRAN ANDREWS rated off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head
of the lane, dueled through the final sixteenth and took over late yards. ADVANCE CASH rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and kept the advantage to late yards before relenting. SOUTHERN DISTRICT saved ground close
to the early pace, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. ONLY GET'N BETTER settled
off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened stride in the
lane. BLAMEITONTHEFUN settled off the early pace outside then stalked three wide into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
faded in the four path on the far turn. SCOTCH NO ROCKS rated close off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened passing the five
sixteenths pole. MY SLICK NICK saved early ground, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
SHOOT THE BREEZE settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and drew close in the four path on the far turn, was carried out and
bumped twice nearing the head of the lane while taking the nod, then lugged in under a hard right right rein and drew off the final sixteenth. UNCLE PRESS
stalked the early pace two deep, chased leaving the three eighths pole, challenged two deep at the five sixteenths and took the lead at the quarter pole,
drifted outward toward the head of the lane and made contact with Shoot The Breeze twice approaching the eighth pole, was shut off mid-stretch and had to
settle for second. RACING HOT LINE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole and improved steadily, raced off the
rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn but flattened stride while lugging in. BLAZE FOR DAZE was taken to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail into the far turn and weakened leaving the turn. TUP'S TO TAKE steadied after
the start then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn. HERE'STHEBREADMAN
raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. CEDAR RUNS FIBER stalked three wide on the first turn then gave
way leaving the seven sixteenths pole. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Shoot The Breeze for interference in
mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Uncle Press.
