Footnotes
HIDEWRIGHT AWAY took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, was mildly urged approaching the three eighths pole, drew off at the rail on the far
turn and proved much the best; mostly of her own initiative. SOMEBODY LOVES ME dropped well back while saving ground, bid past the seven sixteenths
pole and improved steadily in the five path on the far turn, then dueled to clear second past the eighth pole. SAFFRON ducked in leaving the gate and made
contact with Avalanche Is Comin then saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
then flattened stride in the lane. HONEY PLEASE angled in entering the first turn then stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. AVALANCHE IS COMIN was bumped leaving the gate then drifted into the first turn and
settled close through the turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. CHAMPAGNE PLEASE
was forced out and steadied off the heels of Honey Please into the first turn, raced off the rail through the turn then gave chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

LOST WEEKEND saved ground off the pace and closed the gap from the three eighths pole, bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
then dug in to take over the final yards. DR JACK FLYER drew clear and tapered to the inside to show the way, came under pressure at the quarter pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled leaving the turn, but was caught in the final yards. AGAIN WE MEET saved ground racing well
back then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and dueled through the
stretch for third. SAM WHEAT rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished
in the stretch duel for third. SMOKIN SMITTY rated close off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded in
the three path on the far turn. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, but flattened in the four path on the far turn. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but weakened approaching the far turn.

GABRIEL SEVEN, reluctant to load, drew clear while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail, was met mid-stretch and dug in at a slim disadvantage from that point, but put his nose in front just under the wire. RIVER
CROSROAD RVF saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, closed to even terms mid-stretch
and had a slim advantage from that point, but missed the nod under the wire. MOVING PICTURES stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. ROAD SLEW raced in the three path the first turn, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, improved in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. Z U AT THE RACES exchanged contact with Allen
Can Do It leaving the gate then rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and weakened in the lane. MY HANDSOME MAN raced in the six path the first turn, left the turn wide and showed little response. ALLEN CAN DO IT
exchanged contact with Z U At The Races leaving the gate, raced in the four path on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. THE
GREAT GAZOO settled close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far
turn.

Footnotes
DREAM LEADER tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and held
well under steady handling. QUINN ELIA raced in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three
path, dug in leaving the turn and cleared second later yards. ADDY MAE tapered in and stalked two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and relented in the stretch duel for second. SHAMELESS VISIONS rated off the pace inside, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and finished evenly to improve her position.
TINA'S BACK veered out leaving the gate and raced wide on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the five path on the
far turn. OWE YOU ONE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. FLATTERING WAY
was shuffled back at the start then saved ground. BUTTERFLY WORLD was hustled to contention and rounded the first turn about the three path, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, weakened in the three path on the far turn, then carried out and steadied off the heels of Shameless Vision leaving the
turn.
