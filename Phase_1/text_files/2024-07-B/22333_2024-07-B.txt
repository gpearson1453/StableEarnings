Footnotes
FREEDOM ROAD stalked the dueling leaders from along the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, covered and waited in some traffic late in the turn,
lost some position turning for home, tipped out three wide when clear in upper stretch, challenged three wide inside the furlong marker and kicked clear late
under moderate handling. GOLDEN CANDY dueled up front closest to the inside, put that rival away when straightened for home, dueled with a second foe
past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late while stubbornly holding the second spot. CALL ME ICE MAN within striking distance,
advanced on the dueling leaders in the three path turning for home, put a head in front a furlong out, also had little for the winner late, outkicked for the
second spot. MALIBU COWBOY dueled up front outside the runner up for just over a half, steadily weakened through the lane. SAN COSTANTINO last
away, moved outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally through the stretch. SUMO fell back to trail after the start, was not involved toward
the inside.

Footnotes
RIO CHAMA broke well, showed the way early, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, began to edge clear of the other speed past the furlong
marker, held a clear advantage late, enough left to hold off the runner up in the final strides. MISSED THE TURN broke in good order just behind the winner,
raced in the second flight into the turn, covered up in traffic through much of the bend just off the rail, eased out a bit for room in upper stretch, late kick to be
getting to the winner late, clearly second best. TWILIGHTZONE dueled up front outside the winner into and through the turn, could not match strides with
that same rival through most of the stretch, caught late for the runner up spot. PROBALE TEN bumped at the break, recovered to race in the second flight in
the four path and outside the runner up, set down for the drive, came up empty for the stretch run to finish up evenly. SCOTCH CHOCOLATE raced one
paced in mid pack to also be found lacking in the drive. GREY SHADOW broke out, bumped with PROBALE TEN, raced well out in the strip, four to five
wide through the turn, lacked a closing response as well. WILEY WILLARD last to leave, failed to threaten while racing out in the strip. LUCKY DAY was
finished early, well back.

Footnotes
TRANSLATE outrun in the early going off the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, angled in and slipped through along the rail into the straight, steered
back out when straightened for home and finished strongly to be in time. LADY IN HEELS forwardly placed early along the inside, steadied into and through
the early part of the turn, continued to save ground through the rest of the bend, moved out three wide for the drive, challenged outside of the first flight past
the furlong marker, brief lead late, proved no match for the winner. STRESSED broke sharp, showed the way into and through the turn, continued to hold a
pressured advantage past the eighth pole, could not match the top two late. KITTY QUICK pressured the leader from the outside for a half, weakened from
between rivals the final furlong. STARRY HOPE last to leave, lacked early foot, moved out, came five wide for the drive, found lacking in the run to the wire.
TEAKETTLE in the second fight outside, remained within striking distance while four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. MAZAL EIGHTEEN fell back
to trail after the start, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SETTLING STORM broke back, was used a bit to assume a forward position while four wide into the first turn, patiently tracked the leader onto and up the
backstraight, continued that pursuit through the final bend, reeled that same rival in past the furlong marker and proved best under steady handling.
ABSTRACT MOMENT took control just after the start, set an unpressured pace the middle five furlongs, responded when the winner came calling with a
furlong to run, then relented to that one the final sixteenth, held sway late to hold the place. KEEP IT SEXY broke well, settled in mid pack along the inside,
lost some position when idling in the far turn, called on for some run entering the stretch, staged a mild rally while remaining inside, getting to the runner up
late. MALAWNIA lacked early foot, continued back the middle half mile, came three wide out of the final turn, rallied through and inside of traffic to improve
position. CAINUDOTHETWIST raced in mid pack, mid closer while between horses final turn, saw that progress stall through the lane to finish up evenly.
MARIANO devoid of speed for five furlongs, advanced three wide through the second turn and also flattened out through the stretch. WILMA FLINTSHIRE
broke back, made little impact while racing off the inside. JASSAI three wide when with the main body through the first turn, moved closer after a half then
gave way in the drive. WARRIOR'S DEFENSE in the second flight early, gave way in the drive. PRACTICAL MISS began a steady retreat after four
furlongs. AIN'T NONCENTS last away, fell well back after a half as well.

Footnotes
VIRGINIA FITZ displayed good speed to clear toward but not to the rail early, continued to show the way in the two path through the turn, extended that
advantage in upper stretch and was not threatened to the wire under steady handling. BUY TOM A BEER bothered just after the start, raced back while
saving ground, continued along the inside into the stretch and rallied up the rail to earn the place. BUOYANT within striking distance along the inside early,
steered out three wide by late in the turn, lacked a serious closing kick to be outfinished for the place, finished up best of the rest. COURAGEOUS MISSION
behind the early pace outside, stalled in the run through the turn, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. GO TO BINGO broke
out, was straightened to race in the second flight while along the inside, turn, came up empty for the stretch run. WAR HUMOR chased the winner for three
furlongs off the inside, had little left for the stretch drive. BULL RIDER lacked speed off the inside, was never a factor. LUCKY CAT last to leave, remained
always back. LISTENING finished early and was well beaten.

LUTE WARM last away, moved out when settling behind the pace, remained on the outside within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, crept
closer and challenged three wide final turn, kicked steadily clear through the lane. WONDERFULL LADY (FR) back off the pace while saving ground,
continued toward the inside into the far turn, steered out to be three wide when moving a bit closer, proved no match for the winner through the stretch,
clearly second best. SIGN OF PEACE chased the leader early, advanced with the winner to challenge inside that one and between horses second turn,
weakened in the stretch while narrowly lasting for the third slot. KATIES A LADY sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace inside, headed and fell back
late in the final turn, moved out, trying to come back for third. EIGHT DANZAS dropped back after the start to trail, was never a factor.

Footnotes
GREEN BEANS away in good order toward the inside, dueled into the turn closest to the rail, held a narrow advantage with a furlong to run then edged clear
late while consistently drifting out. RESTRIKE in the second flight early while between horses, fell back through the turn, angled out a bit for room upper
stretch, angled back inside a drifting rival past the furlong marker, finished up willingly to earn the place. MR. LEFTY in the second flight while racing four
wide into the turn, moved a bit closer by late in the bend, stalled through upper stretch, drifted out a bit with a furlong to run, lasted for the show. AWESOME
FANTASY void of early foot after breaking back, asked along while angling out five wide turning for home, displayed a mild amount of late interest well out in
the course to improve position. AGENT KELLY also broke back and lacked any speed, fanned out six wide by AWESOME FANTASY as that one was
making a move late in the turn, also bettered position through the stretch. OPTIMISTIC NATE alternated up front while outside the winner, continued on
equal terms upper straight, floated out a bit by that same foe, first to blink and faltered late to lose several positions. COUSIN GIORGOS mid pack while
racing inside, lacked a closing response. WE GOT THIS tired while racing four wide into the stretch. CONTRIVANCE in the second flight while racing three
wide, in some traffic into the turn while outside the runner up, weakened through the stretch. DIALED IN A PANIC was not a factor. TAP YOUR HEART
broke well, raced forwardly early along the inside in heading up the second flight, shuffled back into the turn, gave way in the drive. SWIFT DANCER broke
in a tangle, remained always back.

Footnotes
QUOKKA outrun while in hand toward the inside, continued unhurried into the far turn, began to advance soon after, continued to rally up the rail and closed
with good late energy to be going clear late. ELUSIVE also void of any early foot, continued to see them all through the final turn along the inside, steered
three wide for the drive, also came with a good late run to finish up willingly. DIABLO DADDY in the second flight off the inside, asked for some run when
going after the leader late in the final turn and into the stretch, challenged that one late but proved no match for the top two in the waning strides. DANCING
MISCHIEF in mid pack and in traffic early, came in the two path for the drive, lacked the needed late closing kick. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER settled in mid
pack while racing off the inside, came up empty in the drive to also be found lacking in the late going. EL GUAPO broke on top, well clear into and through
the first turn, extended that advantage up the backstretch, continued to lead by a wide margin into upper stretch, caved in late. PAPA FUNNY in the main
body while outside, five wide into the far turn, four wide exiting, failed to rally. BALI ROLLING TIDE remained back in failing to menace. BEYOND
REPROACH settled in the second flight, backed up through the stretch. ANGEL OF ATTACK chased the runaway leader for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
KATAKANA void of speed, began a steady advance after a half, rallied three wide into the lane, continued with good resolve to the finish up be up in time.
BANANA SPLIT within striking distance for six furlongs, advanced and challenge outside the two leaders into the lane, long drive three wide, put a head in
front late but was nailed in the final strides from the outside by the winner. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN pressed the leader from the outside, extended stretch
battle between horses and inside the runner up, proved stubborn to the end. STARCRY settled in mid pack along the inside, lacked a winning kick through
the stretch. TINS off a step slow, trailed while saving ground, continued inside, shifted out a bit for the drive and improved position without posing a serious
threat. BOLD LOOK lacked speed, continued to race back, improved slightly while also never dangerous. PASSING BAYOU broke on top, set a pressured
pace along the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, faltered. DOGWOODS JUNE settled off the pace and the inside in the
run through the first turn, dropped inside for the second bend, failed to muster a rally. DESTIN FOR DRAMA five wide into the first turn when off the pace,
improved a bit the third quarter, once again was five wide through the second bend, faded. STORM CREED forwardly placed for a half, backed up. LADY
TOURIST in some traffic through the first turn, was finished after a half then continued to give way through the stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
MIRARI vied for the early lead two wide and then went on to set a slow pace along the inside, dawdled along while being well handled, then came two wide
off the turn and was sent down and held well to prove best under a drive. RAGTIME LADY was allowed to settle early, three wide on the turn and came four
wide off the turn and made a bid but could not get to the winner while being second best. DETERMIND PRINCESS tracked the pace on the inside and
made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed more late while clearly besting the rest. DETERMINED FIRST broke in at the start, tracked the pace two to
three wide and made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out the final furlong. REBEL CONSORT was taken back early, saved ground on the far turn,
cut the corner leaving the trun and had a belated rally on the inside. KRONE was squeezed back at the start, then reserved early, two wide on the far turn
and had no rally. WARIDI CANDY was bumped at the break, then pulled between rivals into the first turn, then pulled and was hard to rate on the first turn,
then settled and saved ground on the far turn, swung out five wide and had no kick. NAVANI vied for the early lead on the inside into the first turn, then
moved out to stalk the winner two wide and tired after six furlongs.
