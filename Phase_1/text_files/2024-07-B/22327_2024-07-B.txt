I'M HEADING EAST reserved off the pace while saving ground along the fence through the turn, rallied in upper stretch tipping off the rail around the
pacesetter and prevailed over that one in a determined drive. MAGIC LIFE broke alertly to take command from the gate, opened a clear lead to upper
stretch, was unable to hold off he winner but finished willingly as second best in a good effort. BOCA unhurried in the early going to be the trailer, made a
steady gain coming home to be along for the show. ORPHAN EXCHANGE stalked the pace to the head of the lane and lacked a closing bid. SUSIE'S
SAVER was away from the gate slowly at the start and never posed a threat. OUTFACTORED prompted the pace chasing the pacesetter to the quarter
pole and gave way in the stretch.

RESIST THE DEVIL stalked the pacesetter through the turn and closed well to prevail in deep stretch. HENRY'S WORLD set the pace for half mile on a
clear lead through quick fractions and could not hold off the rallying winner in a good try. TAPSOLUTION tracked the leaders to the top of the lane and
finished willingly while unable to gain on the top pair. DR RAGS raced mid-pack throughout and showed some late interest with a mild non-impactful bid.
CREATIVE CHOICE trailed to the top of the lane and passed weaker rivals in the strretch. HE'S ON THE FLY was not a threat. MUTTLEY failed to menace.

ROZAY SUMMER unhurried in the early going to trail, commenced a rally from three wide on the far turn, was carried out briefly by BEADS at the top of the
lane, angled inside that rival to take the lead inside the eighth pole in strong drive. LITTLE MISS MUNNY reserved off the pace for five-eighths, mounted a
six wide rally turning for home, altered course inside the drifting leader in mid-stretch and finished weillingly. BEADS tracked the leaders while well in hand
down the backstretch, rallied four wide at the quarter pole to take command in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane and finished evenly unable to
sustain the rally. BIANCA stalked the pace down the backside, closed ground early on the far turn to be prominent and lacked a closing response. FIT AS A
FIDDLE tracked the pacesetter from two wide down the backstretch, made an early bid into the far turn and flattened out. MAHJONG GIRL set the pace on
a wide advantage down the backstretch and came up empty on the final bend.

home to draw away in the lane and was geared down nearing the wire a convincing victor. PHOBIA reserved off the pace through the first turn, steadily
closed on the leaders into the far turn, rallied at the top of the lane to finish willingly as second best while no threat to the winner. SEA URCHIN stalked the
pace for the first five-eighths, rallied on the far turn to threaten nearing the quarter pole and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid. YEAH TAKE THAT
prompted the pace through the first turn, dropped back off the leader on the backstretch and went evenly. COLD PLUNGE trailed most of the way and was
never a threat. HALON was not a factor.

BALLAD OF WARRIOR reserved off the leaders while well in hand in a clear pocket to midway on the turn, rallied from four wide nearing the quarter pole,
was forced six wide at the top of the lane by the runner-up and closed best of all to prevail. SPEIGHT THE SNOW tracked the pace from the inside through
the turn, angled out five wide for racing room at the head of the stretch forcing the winner further out, and finished willingly as second best unable to match
the winner in deep stretch. OL' NELSON broke alertly to take the lead under constant pressure for the first three-eighths, dug-in when new challengers
appeared in upper stretch and gamely held the show. HIGHS N LOWS stalked the pace from three wide, rallied to engage the leader in upper stretch, briefly
took the lead in mid-stretch and was outkicked late in a good try. LAKE CUMBERLAND unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field and
showed good late interest in the stretch. AND THATS MY STORY failed to menace. RANSOM MONEY went one-paced never proving a threat. NICOLE'S
WILL pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened coming home. VINO COURAGIO was not a factor.

CITY LEADER stalked the pace while well held from three wide down the backside, rallied on the far turn to engage the pacesetter turning for home, took
the lead in mid-stretch and just held on late. SON OF LIBERTY broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well rated pace to the far turn, dug-in
when challenged turning for home, surrendered the lead midway down the lane and surged again in the final strides to just miss in a game effort.
COOPERSTOWN reserved off the pace to the far turn, rallied circling five wide to rally down the lane and be gaining inside the final sixteenth.
INAPPROPRIATE unhurried early to be near the back of the field for three-quarters and showed late interest to rally belatedly. RAPA NUI was well placed
just off the pace from the fence to the quarter pole and lacked a closing kick. PREGAME went evenly failing to respond when called upon. SNIP THE
ROSES was not a threat. DISASTER RECOVERY prompted the pace to the far turn and gave way.

CROWNED JEWEL prompted the pace while under stout restraint in the early going, made a two wide bid to challenge the pacesetter at the quarter pole,
dueled with that one through the lane and edged clear in the final sixteenth. CHANGE THE HOUR set a pressured pace, responded when engaged by the
winner in the turn, battled through the lane and weakened late while just holding on to the place. HOLLA AT YOUR BOY reserved off the pace from the
fence to the top of the lane, angled four wide to the clear in upper stretch and finished willingly to be gaining late. VERY DEBONAIRE slow early to be the
trailer, circled the field from five wide in the lane and finished with good interest to just miss. NEON DEION failed to menace. TWELVETWO stalked the
pace through the turn to loom from three wide turning for home and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROUNDBBALL stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, rallied at the top of the lane to take command in mid-stretch and finished in a determined
drive to prevail. KATHLYNS PHALANX was well placed prompting the pacesetter to the turn, and rallied mildly in the lane to gain the place. HOPE SHE
COMES unhurried to race near the rear of the field to the quarter pole, angled wide and closed well with a belated bid. NEXT DOT set the pace under early
pressure, opened a clear lead on the turn and weakened through the lane. ELLYMARIE reserved of the pace down the backside, commenced a rally
entering the turn, was caused to steady entering the turn lacking racing room, made a bid tuning for home and flattened out. FIGHT IN THE DOG failed to
menace. WHISKEYSTREETBLUES was not a threat. SHACKLED BY LUST raced in contention to the turn and came up empty.
