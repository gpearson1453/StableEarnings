DEVIL'S POOL sprinted to a pressured lead from two wide, floated out in upper stretch but kept on to draw clear. LUCKY GEM broke inward leaving the
gate then pressed the pace from the inside to early stretch and weakened. CLEVER RACE broke inward leaving the gate and trailed the field to the quarter
pole, moved out to two wide in the stretch but was never a threat. DIAMOND EMPRESS broke outward leaving the gate and chased the leaders from three
wide throughout but tired near the end of the bend.

turn to draw clear in the stretch. LEXINGTON DIVA stalked the pace from off the rail to mid turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch for the late rally
to be second best. RUN DREAMING hustled along to press the pace from three wide to the three furlong marker then fell back slightly going into the stretch
but had the late kick to be up for the show. SAINT ISABEL spinted to a pressured lead from between horses to the half mile marker then pressed the pace
from two wide to upper stretch where she floated out and tired. MARK WITH AN E saved ground to no avail.

FABLED RULER raced near the back to midway down the backstretch then launched a bid near the half mile marker going four wide around the turn to run
down the leaders near the quarter pole, dueled down the stretch on the outside and was up in the final jumps to win the nod. ROCKALL pressed the pace
from between horses to the nine sixteenths pole then settled off the pace to the turn, moved out to three wide at the three furlong marker and engaged the
leader near the quarter pole then took the lead at the eighth pole and battled down the stretch inside of FABLED RULER but was denied. TAYSOM sprinted
to co-lead from three wide to then nine sixteenths pole then move in and inched away mid turn but was collared at the quarter pole and battled to deep
stretch and gave way grudgingly. PRINCE COSMO went to the front to co-lead from the inside to the quarter pole when TAYSOM edged away but fought
gamely to deep stretch and weakened late. JIMMIE'S HALO trailed the field and was outrun.

FLASH N CLASS prompted the pace from two wide and took the lead midway through the final turn, was headed near the quarter pole and dueled down the
stretch inside of PARTY AT JAYS then dug in with a late kick to draw clear in the final sixteenth. PARTY AT JAYS hesitated leaving the gate then rushed to
contention on the first turn, settled off the pace down the backstretch from two wide then moved out to three wide at the three furlong marker to make a bid
on the leaders and dueled down the stretch outside of FLASH N CLASS but was outkicked. DOSS was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then fell back slightly on the final turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made a late gain on the place. GO BROTHER GO was void
of speed spotting the field sever lengths on the backstretch then made a late stretch run to gain ground but was not a factor. KINGPRIN sprinted to a clear
lead around the first turn then was challenged down the backstretch and was collared midway through the final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
B MINOR hopped at the start and spotted the field several length while racing four or five wide on the backstretch then moved up from two wide around the
turn, angled out to three wide at the quarter pole for a win rally. MANNY'S KAT sprinted away to the lead and drew clear on the turn but was caught in the
final yards to be second best. OVERBORE tracked the leaders from three wide down the backstretch but lacked a response but was the best of the rest.
BAD BRAD showed little. CORKED stalked the pace from three wide to the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
APPROPRIATED FUNDS tracked the leaders from mid pack down the backstretch then moved up from two wide around the turn, moving between horses
at the quarter pole, angled out to four wide at the top of the stretch and took the lead at the eighth pole, fended off the late inside closers for the win.
ENCHANTED NILE hustled along to vie for the lead from the inside on the backstretch then fell back on the turn and slipped through in upper stretch for a
late inside run but was not enough. MY FRIEND AMY was off a step slow and trailed the field to midway through the turn while saving ground then moved
up entering the stretch and found an opening in the two path near the eighth pole for a rally but was too late. MISCHIEVOUS GAL rushed up to vie for the
lead from two wide on the backstretch then matched strides with MISS PRIOURITY to the eighth pole but was outkicked by the late closers. MUSIC
MISTRESS raced in the middle of the pace to the turn then moved up while going five or six wide into the stretch for a mild bid to improve position. LETS
DECLARE PEACE stalked the pace from four wide through the turn and lacked the late response. MISS PRIORITY roused to a challenged lead, matched
strides outside of MISCHIEVIOUS GAL to the eighth pole and weakened. ALPINE MIST was always back.

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET went to the front to press the pace around the first turn then took command at the six furlong marker and drew off on the backstretch
but was kept to task in the stretch drive. SHAMAYIM hopped leaving the starting gate then was allowed to settled around the first turn while saving ground,
steadily advanced up the rail on the backstretch but had to steady going into the final turn, angled out to the two path and continued his bid, shifted back
inside in early stretch to make the late gain on the winner to be best of the rest. INTO WISHING tracked the leaders from off the pace to midway through the
final turn and was outkicked in the drive. KID SHELLEEN stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn
but flattened out. RUSSIAN TANK trailed the field and was never a threat. SPARKIN showed the early speed around the first turn and slowly faded.
