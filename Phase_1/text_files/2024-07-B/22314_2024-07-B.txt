Footnotes
I FEEL THE NEED slow early lagged to the far turn firing there while circling out six wide into upper stretch hitting stride to win going away. UNFAITHFUL
WAYS gave a quick five wide move on the far turn taking the lead in upper stretch being overpowered late from the outside. LUCKY STEPPER tracked the
pace vying in the four path down the lane finishing well. VINTAGE SPARKLE slow early lagged to upper stretch passing some late near mid track.
BANDEENA played no factor. UNCAPTURED FAITH sent clear set the pace through the backside being hooked along the inside on the turn faltering near
the rail down the lane. HERE COMES LOVIE stalked the pace chasing on the far turn fading in upper stretch. FUELED UP stalked the pace bidding
between horses on the far turn wilting abruptly in upper stretch. DEL MAR FLASH raced evenly evenly through the backside then gave way rapidly on the
far turn. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
