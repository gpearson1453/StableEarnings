the early pace three wide, then went up to duel for command two wide on the turn, came three wide off the turn but was outfinished. JACK'S LILLY chased
the early pace and was two wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn but had no kick while gaining the last spot in the superfecta. MADELINE'S

Footnotes
CHALICE prompted the early pace three wide, then went up to press the pace two wide on the turn, made a three wide bid off the turn and drew clear in the
final furlong to prove best under a drive. WHITE HEAT set the early pace from the inside, then was pressed and dueled with the winner off the bend, proved
to be no match for the winner while saving the place award late. BOSSY KATE was reserved early, came wide into the lane and rallied. MOR MOR MOR
was off a step slow, then advanced towards the inside, moved out on the turn and came five wide off the bend and had a mild late gain. GRAN PATRONA
tracked the early pace three to two wide, then dropped to the inside leaving the turn and had no kick. KEEP IT SAFE tracked the pace from the inside,
eased out and came three wide off the bend and faded in the final furlong. BUILT'IN ABILITY was settled early and lacked a rally. RED BETTY was off a
step slow and never factored. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL was reserved early and three wide down the backstretch, made a five wide move by the quarter pole, came widest off the bend and
made a bid to vie for command by the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best under a drive. CRAZY KATER was well placed on the inside, cut the
corner leaving the turn and finished willingly to be on even terms for the place award. LINGFIELD PARK stalked the early pace two wide, made a four wide
bid off the bend but hung in the final sixteenth while being on even terms for the place award. LAKE NAKURU was off slowly and relegated to trail the field,
advanced with run on the inside on the far turn, waited for room by the quarter pole, cut the corner and advanced on the inside to the furlong marker, then
moved off the inside late to have a mild late rally. ET'S MAGIC MAN was reserved early on the inside, moved out by the half mile marker three wide,
advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide off the bend but flattened out late. PRATT was settled two wide early, between rivals on the turn and
had no rally. HROTHGAR was settled on the inside and then was in traffic by the furlong marker and had no rally. BOURBON CURRENCY dueled for the
lead two to three wide and weakened in the drive. JACK SLYE dueled for the lead on the inside, came two wide off the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
CAMULUS was well rated on the outside, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then dueled for command by the furlong marker and slowly edged clear
late to be best under a drive. GUARDIAN PRINCE was well placed along the rail throughout, made a inside bid off the bend and dueled with the winner by
the furlong marker but was outgamed late while being clearly second best. MASK PATROL tracked the early pace and was in between rivals on the turn,
shifted out by the quarter pole, came five wide off the bend and was along for the show award late. FAST FREEZE KAZ pressed the pace three wide, then
was in between rivals by the quarter pole and faded in the final furlong. KISS THEM DEADLY set a pressured pace on the inside of a rival while racing in
the two path on the turn but weakened in the drive. CAPITAL CONQUEST was settled early and saved ground on the turn but failed to respond.
