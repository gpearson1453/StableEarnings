Footnotes
ZIGGLE POPS (GB) jumped well while saving ground, steadied behind WEST NEWTON when that foe hit fence six, was forced in then had to be guided
out to make it around the next cone, continued to save ground off the pace, drafted inside while awaiting room on the final turn, was roused at the
quarter-pole, found plenty of room and rallied inside of the leader in upper stretch, closed well to get the advantage just inside the furlong marker, had the
rider lose his crop just before taking the advantage and drew away to prove much the best. PICKANUMBER (IRE) went to the front while off the inside,
jumped outward over fences two and three wide, was well rated while showing the way, came under encouragement while near the inside on the final turn,
came out into upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was headed by the winner and proved no match but gamely held the place. FREDDY
FLINTSHIRE struggled over fence two, was reserved while inside to the two path, came under urging late on the final turn, chased in the stretch and
narrowly missed the place while well clear for the show. L'IMPERATOR (FR) struggled over fence two, was reserved on the outside in the two to three path,
rounded the final turn under urging and lacked the needed response. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) jumped well towards the front, was urged along on the final
turn and came up empty. ABAAN was reserved in the two to three path while jumping well, saved ground while drafting behind the leader on the final turn,
brushed a flag midway through that bend, was asked at the quarter-pole and failed to respond. WEST NEWTON (GB) tracked on the inside, jumped inward
over fences two and three, continued to save ground while tracking the leader, hit fence six hard and had the rider lose his left-iron for several strides before
regaining footing, moved out around the next turn, was urged along after fence seven and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BROUGHTY FERRY just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the eighth pole, got herded out three to four paths inside the sixteenth pole and then got the crop of JUST MUSIC
flashed in her face and was up in the final jumps to prevail regardless. JUST MUSIC lunged at the start and broke on top despite it, chased just off the inside
and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the
sixteenth pole, came under threat and came out and herded the aforementioned foe three to four paths and switched the crop to the right hand flashing it in
the face of their main danger and was caught and nailed in the final strides. ENIGMATIC coaxed from the gate, showed the way easing off along the inside
through the first turn before coming under a firm hold down the backstretch in front despite reluctance to do so, settled into a rhythm through the far turn and
shook away near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was caught nearing
the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. LA VITA SOFIA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, improved position to the finish. YO PUEDO three then two wide through the first turn, chased two
to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. THORNY three wide through the first turn, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. GRACEFUL ROSE four then three wide through
the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a bid swinging five wide into upper stretch and then faltered in the
stretch.

Footnotes
JAVA BUZZ quickly sped clear, dictated terms under some extra left-rein pressure in the two path on the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper
stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth and proved much the best while kept
to the task. KREESA bumped with a foe just after the start, chased the pace between horses, bumped hard with a rival outside the half-mile pole then
steadied, saved ground on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and improved to just get the place. OKALOOSA chased the pace between
horses, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved out, pursued the winner in the final
furlong and proved no match then lost the place while able to get the show. MUSICAL MAESTRO raced between horses, was taken in hand outside the
half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed kick. ROYAL KING bumped with an opponent just after the start, chased the
leader between horses, bumped hard with a rival outside the half-mile pole then steadied, traveled around the turn in the the path, shifted to the five path
into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. BUCKORTWO was sent hard from the inside, checked sharply when put in tight outside the
half-mile pole and dropped back, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. SANDRONE bobbled at the start, moved up under urging on the outside,
made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. KORRONGO chased the pace, raced between
foes passing the half-mile pole, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and came up empty. PALLINO
was hustled from the gate then dropped back under urging, went around the turn in the two to three path, swung out into the seven path entering the stretch
and failed to respond. BETTER LUCK was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the three then four path, turned into the stretch in the six
path and was no factor.

SUN KISSED SOIREE along the inside through the first turn, raced just off the inside through the stretch the initial time and through the second turn, chased
two to three wide thereafter coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied lugging in and forcing SICILIAN
PRINCESS to steady in tandem with JITTERBURG nearing the eighth pole, then lugged in again and forced JITTERBUG to take hold and alter out a path
inside the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. JITTERBUG tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out and forced SICILIAN PRINCESS to steady in concert with the aforementioned foe just
inside the three-sixteenths, then got forced to take hold and alter out a path a furlong out, surged late but was ultimately staved off at the finish. PAST
TENSE got bumped at the start by SICILIAN PRINCESS due to pressure from ADDRESSABLE MARKET, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide in
closest aim of the leader, took over with seven-sixteenths to go and tucked inside through the far and final turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and spun along the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages while along clear for the
show honors. AUTUMN'S TURN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and passed
tired rivals. MISSION OF HOPE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. SICILIAN PRINCESS got bumped solidly at the start by ADDRESSABLE MARKET and in turn bumped PAST TENSE, tracked the front two to
three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got steadied at the three-sixteenths when
JITTERBUG tipped out and SUN KISSED SOIREE lugged in, then weakened in the final furlong. ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) broke out at the start
bumping SICILIAN PRINCESS solidly into PAST TENSE, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. MS SEDONA broke out at the start brushing the off side stall at the start, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired. SUMMER FESTIVAL established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, yielded the
front with seven-sixteenths to run and retreated through the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. There was
a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the first two finishers. After review, the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared
official.

Footnotes
RAGING SEA was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under encouragement while inside to the two path on the far turn, gained through a large
opening to make a bid inside the pacesetter into upper stretch, took over just inside the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the
final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead late and proved best under steady handling. SHOTGUN HOTTIE bobbled slightly at the start, was taken in
hand along the rail before the first turn, moved from the rail to the two path early on the that bend, settled outside on the backstretch, chased in the four then
five path on the far turn, pursued the winner in the final furlong and willingly earned the place. MISTY VEIL was hustled to the front, showed the way while
off the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole then moved to the three path, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired. JUST KATHERINE rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three then
four path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. VENTI VALENTINE stumbled severely twice at the start and was off slow, spotted
the front several lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, tossed her head while tugging on the bit entering the backstretch, continued at the rear,
was urged along in the two path on the far turn then spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond then was protected by the rider in the final furlong.

Footnotes
VIRGIN COLADA was reserved towards the rear while saving ground, moved to the two path midway through the far turn, was roused four wide into the
stretch then angled further out, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly while moving in some into the final sixteenth and got up to prevail.
RUNNING AWAY went to the front while into the bit under restraint, showed the way off the rail, was challenged by PANACHE on the far turn, shook off that
foe under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained clear until the sixteenth-pole, swapped leads back and forth at that juncture and was
caught while able to get the place. RARE ART was taken under restraint early then reserved while racing in the three path on the turns, swung into the five
path entering the stretch, had the rider lose his crop while gaining outside the furlong marker, rallied under a strong-hand ride to make a bid late but missed
while able to secure the show. SHARP SMILE raced between foes in the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in two path on the
far turn and lacked the needed kick. PANACHE was reluctant to load, rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in
the two path on the far turn, battled outside of the runner-up under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. YESTERDAY was
well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path while asked on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the three path, pursued the leader
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. THUNDER PRINCESS saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced inside on the far
turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. WILD AND FREE raced in the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was asked in the three path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the four path, remained on her inside lead in the drive and came up empty. ARISTELLA
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused while in the two then three path on the far turn and failed to threaten. READY TO
BATTLE brushed the outside of the gate at the start, traveled around the first turn in the four path, settled on the outside, was roused in the four path on the
far turn and failed to respond.

AWESOME CZECH got bumped at the start by BOXED WINE, who broke outwards, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, seemed to want to tip out from in behind the leader against STARTS NOW and then had the leader
drift out and remained inside, rallied up the inside to take command near the sixteenth pole as the leader continued to drift out and prevailed at the end.
LAKESIDE GETAWAY showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch,
inched away under a drive drifting out four to five paths from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when displaced from the front, then ran on to safely
preserve the place honors. BOXED WINE broke out at the start bumping AWESOME CZECH, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. STARTS NOW three then two wide
through the first turn, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
kept on under a drive and was outfinished in the late stages. BUSY MORNING just off the inside tracking the front from just off the pace, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. ROAGNA brushed the off
side stall at the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three to four wide thereafter, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths
and offered up a bid, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. DOWNTOWN CHANNEL traded a bump with LET'S CONNECT at the
start, then pinched that foe back lightly in tandem with FIRSTTIMEINFOREVERE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BUNNY HONEY three wide through the first turn, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. ARTEMIS GIRL just off the inside through the first turn, chased four
then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and made no impact. LET'S CONNECT traded a bump with DOWNTOWN CHANNEL at the start, then bobbled soon after when pinched back
between foes, chased three wide through the first turn and then four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. POSEIDON'S MIST four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
IMMERSIVE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path early on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole then moved to the four path,
took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe in the final sixteenth and prevailed under good
handling. SALTED stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved in at the rear, went around the turn in the two then
three path, moved to the four to five path near the quarter-pole, drifted to the seven path into upper stretch and finished with good energy to get up for the
place. SPUN CANDY went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her inside, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths pole under
urging, dueled with the winner into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. KISS ME SLOW dropped back while urged along,
saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. BLACK DOG stumbled outward
at the start then bumped soundly with a foe but broke with the body of the field, was urged along off the pace, raced in the two then three path on the turn,
was driven into upper stretch in the five path and lacked the needed response. TRADING SECRETS jostled with an opponent early, was urged along on the
outside, dropped from the five path to the three path early on the turn and failed to rally. DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO bumped soundly with a rival at the start
then jostled with a foe early, moved out then was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the four then five path, turned into upper stretch in the
six path and failed to threaten. LAUGHING LADY pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back late on that bend,
spun into upper stretch in the four path and tired.

Footnotes
HUSH OF A STORM went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, rallied six
wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. LET'S GO BIG BLUE was rated in a good
position on the inside, came off the rail late on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, made a bid between horses in upper stretch, battled with foes
into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner. LOCKE AND KEY rounded the first turn in the three path, settled off the pace,
moved closer while three then four wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get
the show. BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved closer in the process, waited some behind traffic in
upper stretch, was roused between horses while just off the pace into the final furlong and was also out-kicked then just missed the show. ROUGH DRAFT
settled on the outside while racing in the four path on the turns, was urged along on the final bend, turned into the stretch in the five path then made a bid,
battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. NEURAL NETWORK took a few awkward strides along the rail early, saved ground on the first
turn, settled at the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, moved closer while in the five path into upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick. LIAR'S POKER was hustled from the gate, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two then three
path on the far turn, waited behind traffic near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BORN DANCER was hustled from the gate, raced in the
three path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the four path then made a bid
between horses, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. SELL SOMETHING saved ground towards the rear, moved to the two path late on the
far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no factor. UNION TRAIL went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the
advantage into upper stretch and gave way. BAR FOURTEEN prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was given his cue on the far turn, battled
under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. DREAMPOINT broke out at the start, raced in the two to three path on the turns, spun into the
stretch in the four path and failed to respond.
