Footnotes
ANDREA set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. VUELA PALOMA stalked the pace from the rail, angled four wide near the quarter pole,
could not match strides with the winner but kept on willingly to gain the place in the final strides. NEODERA prompted the winner in the three path, could not
keep pace with that foe in upper stretch and lost second late. GIDDY UP BABY failed to menace while racing two wide. DEL ROSARIO was reluctant to
load, was bumped at the start, raced well back inside, swung five wide in upper stretch and never threatened. ANY MOMENT hit the gate and bumped DEL
ROSARIO at the start, chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. SUGGESTIONBOX was very reluctant to load, broke slowly and trailed in
the three path.

Footnotes
SUNROOF was unhurried around the first turn, moved up to stalk in the four path early down the backstretch, came under coaxing going into the far turn,
bid midway around that far turn, kicked on while dueling with the inner pacesetter into the stretch, and inched clear of that foe in the final sixteenth. GOOD
BRIGHT FLAMES showed the way along the inside, was roused from the rail into the far turn, dug in from the two path in upper stretch, but was edged out
by an outer foe in the final furlong to place. MY ROYAL VOW laid up close in the three path, was roused to bid between foes passing the three-eighth mark,
but flattened in the final furlong for show. R AWESOME SAUCE tracked in the two path, came under a ride midway around the far turn, swung out to the six
path turning into the lane, but faded. VELOCISSIMA rated inside but never menaced. STRATEGY QUEEN got rank at the start and trailed throughout
around the three path.

the quarter, received a right handed cue in the two path at the top of the lane, kicked away in upper stretch, and held sway. LOVE ACTUALLY chased in the
two path, angled out to the four path under a drive turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. LA CANTERA (IRE) was hustled from off the pace in the

bumped with an inner foe multiple times leaving the gate, raced wellback in the three path and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. THE

Footnotes
TALKIN TIPSY set the pace in the two path, inched clear under confident handling around the turn, was roused from the two path turning into the lane,
continued to get away in upper stretch, shortened stride late, but held safely. OH DARLIN stalked in the four path, was roused into the turn, got bumped out
to the six path turning into the stretch, but ran on for place. CHOOSE JOY had her head turned at the start, chased in the three path, was driven in the two
path around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show, pulled up jogging back and was precautionarily transported
off the track in an equine ambulance. FULMINATE tracked in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of
the lane, but flattened. MUSIC CITY STAR trailed inside and did not factor. ADMISSIBLE rated in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and did not threaten. DRUM ROLL pressed the pace in the three path, was coaxed between foes midway around the turn, bumped an outer foe
while swinging out to the five path at the top of the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
POLA OF TROUBLE hit the starting gate, raced well back outside, advanced five wide around the turn, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth
pole and powered clear. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS tracked the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, took the lead inside of the pacesetter in
midstretch, could not withstand the winner in the final sixteenth but held clear of the rest. BONNIE SANDRA pressed the pace in the three path, bid between
foes in midstretch but was outkicked. CHILLING FACTOR chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. TWIZZLE set the pace in the
two path and tired in the final furlong. THANK THE ACADEMY played no factor while racing six wide. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) chased the pace inside and
faded. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL was outrun while racing four wide.
