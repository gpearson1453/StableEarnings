Footnotes
SUZZIE'S DARLIN sped to the lead at the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and widened advantage around the far
turn, saved ground entering the lane, was ridden along in the upper stretch, responded willingly, drew off and finished ridden out. SOPHIE'S STAR secured
inside position around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch, was no match for pulling
away winner but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. FULL MOON BEACH bumped twice at the start and raced three to four paths wide entering
the first turn, rated in range of the early leaders, hustled along three to four wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and ran on to secure a
share. SUPER EMPIRE was forwardly placed racing just off the pacesetter, had no response when called upon around the final turn and steadily faded.
COMFORTS JAZEL raced four wide into the first turn, lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into upper stretch and never menaced. I GOT A
NAME raced in range two wide up the backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and retreated.

WARREN L sped to the lead at the start and held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch then edged ahead entering the
far turn, held firm over pursers near the quarter pole, saved ground entering the top of the stretch, roused for more, responded gamely, widened advantage
and kept clear under steady urging. BIG LUKE saved ground around the first turn, remained inside and tracked the pace up the backstretch, ridden along
the rail around the final turn, angled out two wide approaching the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished clearly second best. FINISH UP was
forwardly placed around the first turn then settled back between rivals positioned in range of the early leader, given cue three wide near the quarter pole,
came three paths wide into upper stretch, ran on and cleared show. MINECRAFT MANIAC raced three wide into the first turn, tracked the pace up the
backstretch, moved up into close contention at the quarter pole, failed to sustain bid and faded in the lane. TIME GOES ON pressed the pace up the
backstretch, continued forwardly placed into the far turn then came up empty turning for home. FREDDY J rated not far off the pace, hustled along four wide
mid-way around the final turn and had no response.

flattened out. I'M AN OAK sat off the compact top flight along the rail late on the backstretch, saved ground then tipped two wide for the drive and needed
more for late impact. HASTINGS SUNRISE was forwardly placed then dueled with GOLDEN LUNA around the turn, ran on to the furlong marker then gave

Footnotes
FLAT HANBY slightly hopped then got bumped at the start and came away last, quickly picked up the pace and raced two to three wide around the first turn,
settled nicely while being rated off the second flight mid-way up the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the far turn, took closer order, responded under
right handed pressure entering upper stretch, roused forward to the lead near mid-stretch, took command under confidenmt handling and finished clear.
SPECIALSORTASTORM sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the
far turn, saved ground entering the lane, fought on and held a slight edge at the furlong marker, could not hold off the challenge from the winner past
mid-stretch but stayed on and just lasted for place. DAWSON'S STORM secured inside position around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn, angled three wide entering the head of the lane, responded under pressure, edged closer late and just missed place. TEE OFF
TIME was forwardly placed around the first turn, tracked in contention into the backstretch then flattened near the half mile marker, launched a four wide
rebid entering the head of the lane and finished with interest. SINCERELY MINE bore out around the first turn, continued wide and trailed the field, moved in
closer while remaining far back, came four wide into the far turn and never threatened. LEGEND OF GOLD lacked speed and raced well off the pace, saved
ground around the final turn and never factored. CASA LIMON was forwardly placed in early stages, came up empty after a half, retreated and jogged in.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED LUNAR vied for the early lead then shook free and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, had more left in the tank when
called upon, widened advantage and kept to task. BIG TIPPA raced in contention up the backstretch, moved up into striking range near the quarter pole,
hustled along two wide in pursuit of UNBRIDLED LUNAR into upper stretch, sustained bid and finished clearly second best. FLATHEAD FINALE rated just
off midpack through the early going, urged four wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained a share. LADY RAZORBACK dueled for the lead
with the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides entering the turn, chased along the inside and weakened in the final furlong. HOT
SHOT SHOPPER moved up closer along the inside entering the turn then angled out near the quarter pole, came two wide into stretch and weakened.
VANALEE tracked up the backstretch, raced three wide in contention at the quarter pole then faded in the lane. KATELYN'S MESS failed to move into
contention. I BILEVE raced in the back throughout.
