DANCE MY WAY never far back, rallied four wide into the stretch, was bumped repeatedly by the runner up, brushed that one repeatedly through deep
stretch and proved best in a game effort. MOMENT TO SHINE set a pressured pace two wide, drifted out entering the stretch bumping the winner
repeatedly, was brushed repeatedly through deep stretch and finished second best. MANAGING MISCHIEF pressed the pace three wide, was in tight
behind the runner up entering the stretch, altered course four wide and came on again late in a determined effort. CASTLE MAGIC traced outside and found
her best stride late. GRACIE DANCE pressed the pace along the rail into the stretch and faded late. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND
THE RIDER OF MOMENT TO SHINE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
