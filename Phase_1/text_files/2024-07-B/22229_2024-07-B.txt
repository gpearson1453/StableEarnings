Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT KITTY was backed out of the gate then reloaded, came away in good order, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed
the way on the inside of a rival, inched clear in the two path on the far turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, drew off under a couple taps of a
right-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker and proved much the best while kept to the task under a hand-ride to the finish. CINDERELLA'S
CAUSE was hustled from the gate, raced in the four then three path on the first turn, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on
the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SARATOGA KISSES tossed her head while
between foes nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was well placed on the inside of an opponent, dropped back under urging while
saving ground on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. RACING COLORS saved ground on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the show. LAVON was coaxed to
establish forward position, raced in the three then two path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the far
turn, floated five wide into the stretch and tired. WAITWAITDONTTELLME went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. BERNIETAKESCHARGE
bobbled between horses nearing the first turn, fell back while dropping from the two path to the rail on that bend and was pulled up then transported off the
track via equine ambulance.

TIPSY RUNNER angled in while settling off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the
final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. BOSS OF ALL was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn,
took the lead in the three path at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. SUPERS LUCKY LADY
was well placed just off the pace, drafted while moving from the inside to the two path late on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, moved out in
upper stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able to get the show. CALL ME PENNY broke awkwardly

in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. VALENTINE GIFT chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, floated into the
stretch in the five path and tired. QUIESCENT showed speed and went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the

Footnotes
THE BIG TORPEDO established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside uncontested, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and was geared down in the very late stages to the wire. COURTLY BANKER
grew fractious in the gate inspired by SIX FORTYFIVE who did the same and broke open her stall door, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place
honors clear of the rest. FIDELIGHTCAYUT bobbled at the break recovering inwards, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. B D SAINTS coaxed from
the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, took to the inside straightened away and weakened. CABLE READY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. SIX FORTYFIVE grew fractious in the gate prior to the start inspiring COURTLY BANKER
and then SOLO EMPIRE to do likewise, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the
far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SOLO EMPIRE grew fractious in the gate just after
SIX FORTYFIVE did, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered three wide at the top of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SQUINTS was well placed just off the pace, saved ground behind horses on the turn, steadied inside the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the
three path then angled out while roused, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up in the final stride. IRIDESCENT was hustled from
the gate, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the four path for most of then turn then dropped to the three path, shook clear into the stretch then came
under a left-handed crop, led under a drive until the final stride but was denied on the wire. STINGY stumbled at the start, settled under some urging, moved
off the rail near the nine-sixteenths pole, angled from the two path to the four path early on the turn then shifted to the five path later on that bend, gained
into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole then was switched to a right-handed crop, pursued the runner-up to
the finish and finished with good courage for the show. TOMMY TWO SOCKS was urged early then raced just off the pace, raced in the three path going
around most of the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole, raced between foes into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SWEET
SODDY J broke out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue while in the five then four path on the turn, turned into the stretch under
the crop and tired. CRUSADING broke in and was off a step slow while corrected by the rider, was urged at the rear, moved from the three path to the five
path on the turn and failed to rally. SONOFASHIP was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied in the two path for most
of the turn, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole and stopped.

ABIENTOT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth pole, dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. WILL
REIGN chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick. BRINDI (IRE) got bumped at the start by MOON GATE, who broke outwards, chased three then two wide patiently handled until set down angled
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to flirt with command near the sixteenth marker, dug in and ran on to secure the show honors. MOON GATE broke out at
the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch,
took over with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. GOOD CONDUCT
grew fractious in the gate prior to the start and was backed out and reloaded, brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and showed late interest closing well through the final sixteenth. NEVER REALLY
KNOW (IRE) coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, got paused with three-sixteenths to go as FLIRTING WITH TIME drifted in tightened up the rail and offered up a brief
bid, then weakened in the late going. GATHERED coaxed from the start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
RESERVE CURRENCY was coaxed along in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the three path on the far turn then chased,
had the rider lose his crop while making a bid at the quarter-pole, took over while dropping in some in upper stretch, was given two smacks of an open-hand
from the left-side in the final furlong and drove clear to prove much the best. PURSUIT OF POWER broke in and bumped with a foe, dropped from the two
path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the far turn, made a bid along the rail into the stretch, battled with the
winner until near the sixteenth-pole, swapped leads back and forth around that point and was outfinished but held the place. OWN THE FIELD dropped from
the two path to the rail early on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under encouragement in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and finished with good courage to just miss the place while clear for the show. NIGHT EFFECT was sent
hard from the gate, raced in the three then two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths,
traveled around the far turn in the two path, lost the advantage while between foes in upper stretch and tired. LUCENCY was hustled from the gate, went
around the first turn in the four path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, was urged in the three path on the far turn, dropped
back between horses in upper stretch then moved out and weakened. PRINCIPE D'ORO brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, moved from the
rail to the three path on the first turn, was hard held while reserved off the pace, went four then five wide under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. PROVEN HOPE bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the three then four path on the first turn, settled well off the pace, moved from the four
to the six path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the eighth path and failed to threaten. FURIOUS ANGER brushed with a foe at the start, raced inside
to the two path on the turns and was no factor. REFUAH traveled in the four path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was carried out near the
five-eighths pole, went around the far turn in the five path, floated out to the seven path into the stretch and failed to respond. TWO FOR CHARGING was
coaxed from the gate, rounded the first turn in the five path, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn, dropped back near
the five-sixteenths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
PROCTOR STREET saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, raced in the two then three path for most of the far turn then was
roused while shifting five wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid inside the furlong marker, dueled gamely
with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GRAYOSH raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved off the
pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the far turn in the three path, rallied five wide into the stretch, took the lead outside the furlong
marker, led into the final sixteenth while under threat from the winner, dueled determinedly with that foe to the finish and just missed while clear for the
place. DESTINY STAR stumbled at the start then was sent hard, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on
the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. DANCING DEAN was fractious in the gate, dropped from the
three path to the two path early on the first turn, was unhurried towards the back, dragged her way closer near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the far
turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, chased behind foes into the final furlong then moved out some and also finished willingly but just missed the
show. EXPATRIATE rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. WRIGLEYVILLE brushed with a foe at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was asked three wide on the far turn, made a four wide bid at the quarter-pole then took a short lead, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker
and weakened. CAMERA raced in the three to four path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, moved to the lead near the nine-sixteenths pole,
was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. MIXOLOGIST broke a bit awkwardly and brushed with a foe,
raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked pace on the outside, dragged her way forward while puling hard on the bit near the nine-sixteenths, was
asked in the two path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. CENTURIA (IRE) raced in the two then three path on the first turn,
settled off the pace, moved closer while shifting out around the nine-sixteenths, went around the far turn in the four path, turned into the stretch in the five
path, remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. TAKEMETOTHEBEACH dropped from the two path to the rail early on the
first turn, showed the way with a clear advantage on the backstretch, lost the lead near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the far turn, chased in upper
stretch, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and capitulated.

Footnotes
HEY TOBY bobbled at the break recovering inwards, then established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch confronted by VERY STORMY, dug in engaged in head to head combat and
came out and brushed his main foe at the three-sixteenths, dug in gamely fending off his main danger through to inside the sixteenth marker, then shook
away late to prevail safely at the end. VERY STORMY chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling from the three-sixteenths when brushed by the
aforementioned foe through to inside the sixteenth marker, then got repelled late while well clear of the rest to be along second best. BRACA coaxed from
the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. TOMSCHICKENFINGERS hesitated at the start leaving the
gate last and conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then tucked to the two path through the turn,
came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SENEGAL coaxed from the gate,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. ALBEDO chased just
off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. IN MY SHADOW
coaxed from the start, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the half
mile pole, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SAKA SHOCKA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, tired.
