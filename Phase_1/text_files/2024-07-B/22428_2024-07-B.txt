Footnotes
EURO SUPRISE shared the lead just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, floated out some for the drive, drew clear under urging and held sway under
steady handling. WILLOW RIDGE was kept close, moved to the inside into the turn then rallied belatedly along the rail in the lane. JOEY B broke slow and
somewhat awkwardly, advanced from outside to vie for the lead three wide on the turn then slowly wore down for the drive. MADE TO FIT in contention
early from outside, angled out for a clear path on the bend, came widest into the stretch and had no late bid. AFRICAN WARRIOR vied for the early lead
outside EURO SUPRISE, was caught in tight quarters between rivals on the turn, shuffled back leaving the quarter pole, checked behind rivals leaving the
bend then faded.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY hesitated then broke in the air, moved up from inside, waited for room on the turn, got through two wide leaving the bend, took over
midstretch, drew off under mild urging and was clearly much the best. HOT DAME prominent just off the inside, did not keep up on the bend, angled out
widest at the top of the lane, rallied belatedly but swept past LICHITA for the place deep stretch. LICHITA was soon clear of the others, challenged from
outside after two furlongs, moved clear on the turn, could not hold back LIL BIT TIPSEY midstretch and slowly wore down along the rail in the late going.
BEIRUT BEAUTY advanced three wide on the turn to close the gap on the leader, drifted out some entering the stretch and could not sustain her bid.

Footnotes
FANCY HILL rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, widened command under a mild drive in the lane, gradually drifted
out as she began to wear down but held on. MISS TENA MARIE settled outside, picked up her pace four wide on the turn, rallied belatedly the last eighth
but got up for second in time. CITY SHACK also without early speed, steadily progressed along the rail once on the turn and found best stride too late, as
well, inside the final furlong. COCKTAIL CUTIE was sent to dispute the pace inside FANCY HILL but off rail, gained the rail into the bend, did not stay with
the latter, swung out to path three entering the lane and leveled off the last furlong. BELLA FRANCESCA moved to the inside for a clear path midway on the
backstretch, stayed in path three through the turn, moved back inside, again for racing room inside the final eighth and showed late interest. MISS DUTTON
crowded leaving the chute, chased from inside, angled out when her path was taken midway on the backstretch, was just off the inside through the bend
and had no significant stretch response.

Footnotes
D' YANK shared the early lead from inside, dropped back nearing the turn, angled out, came into the lane four wide, rallied inside the last eighth and got up
in time under a well-judged ride. SWAGGY GEORGE contested the pace between horses on the backstretch, gained the rail into the bend, floated out some
entering the stretch, moved clear briefly inside the furlong marker but slowly wore down in the late going. TAPIT SAM vied for the lead from outside
SWAGGY GEORGE to upper stretch, yielded some, lacked the needed late kick but was easily best of the others. MODAZZLE failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. BAM BAM CAM stayed well off the inside throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN TRAFFIC moved to the inside early on, advanced two wide on the bend, angled outside ELENA MAE upper stretch as she took over second,
was gradually drifting out in the waning yards but got up in time. ELENA MAE advanced between rivals to vie for the lead with a half mile to go, gained the
rail into the turn, floated out as she moved clear entering the stretch, lengthened command, was all out in the late going, was outfinished but proved easily
best of the rest. BROOKE'S ALL IN prominent from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive, drifted out upper stretch, was
straightened with a furlong to go, took over third inside the last eighth then could only hold her position. SCAPITURE a step slow at the break, soon trailed,
was just off the inside on the turn, also fanned out some for the stretch run and improved position from between rivals. SHORT STRAW broke in stride and
was quickly clear of the others, challenged from both sides nearing the end of a quarter mile, began to yield leaving the turn and shortened her stride
considerably deep stretch. KALL KAT hesitated then broke outward, veered in then back out a few strides later, chased from outside, came into the lane
from path five and had no late bid. CAT TALE BREEZE showed early speed from inside but gave way after two furlongs.

Footnotes
TROY OUNCE broke on top, floated out some going to the first bend, gradually floated out as he drew away from the rest on the backstretch, was roused
while just off the inside after six furlongs, drifted out entering the lane, gradually drifted out as he widened his lead and proved clearly the best.
RUNNINGFORCASH prominent just outside TROY OUNCE, angled inside the latter nearing the last furlong, was no match for TROY OUNCE in the late
going but pulled clear for second. LAND MARK DEAL moved to the rail shortly after the start, raced in contention from inside, had every chance in the
stretch but leveled off in the late going. ARROW STRIKE was an early factor running widest of all, did not stay close while four wide on the second turn,
fanned widest for the stretch run and made up minor ground the final furlong. IRISH DECLARATION also moved to the inside early on, dropped from
contention on the backstretch and had no stretch bid.

Footnotes
PHILIPSBURG (IRE) a step slow at the break, was hustled up and moved to the rail after entering the main track, shared the lead, floated out some as he
drew clear entering the lane, steadily drifted out but held sway. LARRY THE POET vied for the lead from outside, was three wide on the bend, was forced
out further by LAKE MILLS into the stretch, moved clear for second, gradually angled out to stay clear of the drifting PHILIPSBURG (IRE), lacked the extra
needed in the late going, was steadied behind the latter with twenty-five yards left and finished in hand. HIGHLY PERFECT chased from outside, lost
ground widest through the turn, lodged a mild bid in the stretch and caught LAKE MILLS for third nearing the wire. LAKE MILLS reluctant to load, displayed
early speed between rivals, angled out as PHILIPSBURG (IRE) came out entering the lane, was no match for that one and LARRY THE POET in the drive
and began to wear down inside the final eighth. BRIANS WAY prominent just behind the early speed, did not keep up and stayed off the inside through the
turn, angled outside LARRY THE POET at the top of the stretch and had little left. MAC PANDOWDY was also a step slow at the start and saved ground to
no avail. UH OH IT'S MAGIC a step slow at the break, as well, chased from just off the inside, angled out some on the bend, moved out behind BRIANS
WAY into the stretch and proved empty.
