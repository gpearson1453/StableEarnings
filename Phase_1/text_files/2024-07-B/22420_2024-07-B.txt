Footnotes
MAJORITY OPINION raced off the pace on the inside to the quarter pole then angled out to three wide upper stretch and drove past the leaders to a clear
win. CUSTOM'S CLEARED pressed the pace from two wide to mid stretch then took a brief lead near the eighth pole but couldn't fend the outside rival and
was second best. BIG NICKEL tracked the leaders from the inside then made a late stretch run to be up for the show. MARDI GRAS MAMBO showed the
good speed but was collared at the eighth pole and tired. AMPITUP vied for the early lead from three wide to midway through the turn and tired.
UNINSPIRED trailed the field and dueled inside of REXINATOR but was never a factor. REXINATOR trailed the field and dueled outside of UNINSPIRED
but was never a threat.

Footnotes
PAYTON'S INDIAN sprinted to the clear lead to the turn then was challenged at the three furlong marker and dug back in at the quarter pole and drew off in
the stretch. CECE WAVE raced in the middle of the pack then moved up on the turn and angled out to four wide in upper stretch to make a late rally.
CALLING rushed up the rail to be in contention, moved out to three wide at the half mile marker, tipped in to the two path to the quarter pole but lacked room
and split horses entering the stretch but was outfinished by the outside closers. LITTLE Z was reluctant to load then hopped in the air leaving the gate,
settled in the middle of the pack and made a late mid track rally. STEAL ME OVER showed no early speed then made a rail bid on the turn and into the
stretch but faltered. GYPSYROSELEE stalked the pace from four wide and moved to engage the leader near the quarter pole but weakened. I'M ALL
MIXED UP prompted the early pace from two wide then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and gave way. CHATAIN'S FLYER was void of the
early speed then trailed the field and had no late kick.

Footnotes
FRAN'S STAR hustled to the lead from three wide down the backstretch then edged away on the turn to draw clear and held. PRINCE PERFECTA stalked
the pace from four wide around the first turn then moved between horses to vie for the lead from two wide through the final turn then gave the late kick to
save the place. MY STORY tracked the leaders from the inside on the first turn then moved off the rail going three wide at the three furlong marker while
moving up then made a late gain on the place in the stretch. LAB'S RULER was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn and move
out to three wide at the eighth pole for a late rally. DUE WE DARE was allowed to settle around the first turn then steadily advanced from four wide down
the backstretch but flattened out in the stretch. COMPUTERIZED broke well and prompted the pace from the inside to the quarter pole and tired. A STAR
ON THE RISE raced in the middle of the pac around the first turn then retreated giving a dull effort. ASTRONEER raced in the middle of the pace around
the first turn then dropped back.

and passed tiring rivals. CONNOR TALKSTRASH vied for the lead from the inside to near the three furlong marker and tired. PRINCE DARE raced near the
back early then rushed up the rail on the turn but gave way. FIRST CAPE remained back. MO'Z STAR L RANSOM vied for the lead from five wide to the

Footnotes
LUCKY MOON DOG dueled for the lead from between horses to the turn then matched strides outside of CLASSIC WARRIOR to mid turn, edged away
slightly and continued to fend off the challenge and held on. CLASSIC WARRIOR rushed up the inside to duel for the lead with LUCKY MOON DOG, fell
back slightly on the turn but kept challenging in the stretch and gave way grudgingly. VERO CAMPIONE trailed the field to the turn then made a rail bid on
the turn and angled out to five wide in upper stretch for the late rally. COLT'S BRIM raced close up on the pace while racing three or four wide then moved
out to four wide in upper stretch to make a mild bid to improve position. CLEARLY A JET dueled for the early lead from three wide to the five sixteenths pole
and faded. ZAPAWAY raced in the middle of the pack while moving up on the inside on the turn, moved out to three wide at the quarter pole but was
outkicked. ANGOLA VACATION was always back. FLASH FREDDIE raced near the back and never made a bid.

Footnotes
NORAH G went to the front to set the pace from an unchallenged lead throughout and drew off in the stretch. BOX OF PICTURES saved ground around the
first turn then advanced from two wide to the quarter pole, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. ALLIACEOUS was
allowed to settle around the first turn then advanced on the backstretch from three wide, angled in to save ground around the final turn and tipped back out
to three wide at the eighth pole for the late kick. TINCANDANCE was unhurried to the final turn then made a three wide bid into the stretch and passed tiring
rival. CERTIFIED GEM stalked the pace to the top of the stretch and gave way. WHOLELOTTAMO was reluctant to load then raced off the pace on the first
turn then retreated. CUTE DINERO QUEEN raced off the pace to the final turn then faded.

Footnotes
JACKED shared the command from the two path to the quarter pole then edged clear and drew off in the stretch. YELL COUNTY off pace from four wide on
the backstretch then moved in to go three wide around the turn but couldn't catch the winner but was second best. OBVIOUS CONCLUSION tracked the
leader from the middle of the pack on the inside then moved up going between horses at the sixteenth pole for the late rally. DARIO raced off the pace while
saving ground around the turn but failed to menace. STREAKIN DEACON shared the command from the inside to the quarter pole and tired. CHIEF
HARLAN was void of speed and was never a threat. SIMPLICATED was always back.
