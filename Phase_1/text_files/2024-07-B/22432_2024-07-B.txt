STARSHIP MACYS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. SCENIC
VIEW rated outside the leader, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner
and held the place safe. RUNAWAY MOM well placed and off the rail, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch, drifted in and closed for the show. LIGHTNING ROUND tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, then
could not gain and held a share. ALL ABOUT KATHERN passed a tiring rival. SWITCHRATTLENROLL was never involved.

SHORESY rated on a long lead, held sway without challenge to the final yards and lasted under steady pressure. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. CARIBBEAN
NIGHT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, then angled out further for clear racing room and evened out.
READY SHE IS well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened the final furlong,
holding a share. AMPLIO ESQUEMA was no factor.

FORGOTTEN PEACE tracked the pace, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made
a steady gain and drew off late. RUSTY MY BROTHER sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then
was no match for the winner, while best of the rest. HALF BIRTHDAY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide
into the stretch and closed well for the show. POSH PLAYDAY unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. HONEY BELLA was a brief factor and faded inside.

SPAN OF CONTROL mid pack and inside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, dueled while drifting out badly,
edged ahead and held. DR RAGS tracked the pace in the early going, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
dueled with the winner being carried out by that one and lacked the needed late kick to prevail. BEACH HOLIDAY mid pack, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, then was carried out in the late going and could not gain.
AESTHETICALLY mid pack and inside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. MEAN
TWEETS unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled in late and evened out. UNCLE JOCK well placed
and outside, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. MUTTLEY stalked the pace on the inside, saved
ground through the turn, cam through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. KEYSTONE HANK passed tiring rivals. JOSH'S
HONOR set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. GREY CHARMER was no factor.

through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out slightly, straightened, then closed fast late and missed. GUACO unsettled in the gate, lunged at
the start, was allowed to settle, moving up inside through the turn, came through inside the stretch, made a steady gain and was outfinished for the place.
HOUSEBUILDER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, weakened late and held a share.
WROTE IN STONE tracked the pace in the early going, lost some ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. HEY PADRE
ran evenly. REVERE NOTE rated outside the leader, lost some position through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

E MINOR tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide, made a steady gain and
edged up in the final strides. STREAMSONG mid pack and outside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed. FLAWLESS BOURBON eased to the leader, held sway unchallenged to the final yards, then weakened and held
the show. TEMPUS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. FRED GEORGE (IRE) mid pack and between, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a
steady gain and missed a share. SELASSIE ran evenly, inside. TAP THE SKY well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. EPIC KNIGHT was never involved.

Footnotes
HAIG POINT mid pack, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain
and edged up in the final strides, finishing on equal terms with BAKENEKO. BAKENEKO hopped at the start, rushed up to be well placed outside, gained
position two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain, edging up in the final strides and finishing
on equal terms with HAIG POINT. JO JO HANS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
made a steady gain, edged ahead late and was outfinished. PATRIOT DRIVE well placed and inside, angled out into the second turn, moved up three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. SIR TERRE allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. CLEAR FOR ACTION sprinted away from the field, held sway unchallenged to the
second turn, stayed on, then weakened late. J P CORNETTA mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the
stretch and ran evenly. LEGIO passed tiring rivals. SEA SPLENDOR mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came
through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. MARSAC well placed and outside, lost some position on the two path through the
second turn, then faded the final furlong. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was never involved. C THE KING was no factor.
