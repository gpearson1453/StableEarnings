Footnotes
SKIPPERINI asked bit to maintain forward position past the wire the first time, covered up early in the first turn, moved out to be clear and three wide by
midway up the backstraight, asked along late in the final bend, roused with a left handed crop in upper stretch, engaged the leader from the outside with
less than a sixteenth to run and wore that rival down. WICKED FINN forwardly placed into the first turn, moved a bit closer onto the backstretch, engaged
the leader far turn, put a head in front soon after, shook clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner, well clear of the others. LEAVE IT
TO KITTEN prompted the early leader, fell back in the run up the backstretch, saved some ground second turn, staged a mild rally to be up for the show
while between horses at the wire, no threat to the top pair. RUNAWAY HARRY broke running, set a clear pace into and through the first turn, rated through
a soft half mile split, responded briefly when the runner up came calling early in the second bend, faltered when headed by that one soon after. SACRED
RIDER lacked early foot, failed to mound a challenge when called on for the drive. BAIL OUT broke back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLOUDS OF WHITE last to leave, dropped to the inside soon after, in hand in the run up the backstretch, continued to be patiently handled along the inside
in some traffic late in the final turn, got through, rail bid, proved best under steady handling late. SANDPIPER MEMORIES unhurried early while outside the
winner, continued to bide time with that one second turn, lost some ground to that same rival into the stretch, rallied from between horses to finish up
willingly while too late. LADY DOMINANCE tracked the pace from along the inside, two path into the lane, brief wait then altered course to the outside
behind a drifting CUPIDS DREAM, also was going rather well at the end while between the top two at the wire. CUPIDS DREAM kicked clear to set the
early pace, a bit keen in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold a narrow advantage through upper stretch, drifted and weakened late. LEA RO
pressured the leader from the outside, had little for the stretch drive while widest through the lane. LA PANDA settled back off the pace, failed to muster a
response in the drive.

Footnotes
PHOTO FINISH stalked a busy first flight into the turn while under confident handling, advanced on that trio midway on the turn, challenged four wide with
five sixteenths remaining, gained the advantage and drew clear while being steadily kept to task. COMPASS FIRE back off the pace and the inside, followed
the winner in the four path around the early leaders turning for home, could do little with that rival in the late going, clearly second best. LOVE UNLIMITED
void of early foot while racing off the inside, staged a mild, belated rally to be along for the show, not a threat to the top two. CORINTH with the first group
while contesting the pace three wide, steadily weakened through the lane while last the longest of the early frontrunners. MS HAYLEY void of any early foot
while along the inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. LOVIELEE set or forced the pace while closest to the inside for almost four
furlongs and gave way. CLASSIC DIVA contested the issue up front four just under a half while between horses, also backed up when the real running
began turning for home.

SAY YOU LOVE ME came in just after the start, raced forwardly in prompting the pace from the outside, four wide when chasing the leader into the lane,
displayed good resolve to reel that one in late. DELICATE bumped at the break, quickly recovered to clear into the turn, continued to set the pace, remained
clear past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. LAWS OF A NATION steadied soon after the start as the winner was coming over,
lacked early speed, staged a mild rally to gain the show, not a match for the top pair. HOLY JOANIE hopped at the start then ducked in to bump with the
runner up, was slammed by MAGIC MARK soon after, recovered quickly to head up the second flight early off the inside, three wide and between horses
inside the winner turning for home, had little left the final furlong. SPICE GAL fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack speed, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while not a posing a serious threat. MAGIC MARK broke in, slammed HOLY JOANIE a stride after the break, settled behind the pace inside,
moved out into the two path late in the turn, came up empty for the stretch. GOLD DART back off the pace, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LAWS OF A NATION AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE
START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
THINK BIG settled off the pace toward the inside, began a steady advance just before a half, challenged entering the stretch and kicked strongly clear while
kept to pressure in a track record tying performance. D'ORO UNBRIDLED unhurried early off the inside, three wide when advancing a bit late in the turn,
proved no match for the winner through the lane, clearly best of the rest. STREET EARNINGS narrowly set the pace while closest to the inside, offered little
resistance to the winner when that one challenged late in the turn, also proved no match for the runner up the final furlong. COACH CAMPBELL settled off
the pace while along the inside, moved a bit closer by continuing to save ground into the stretch, flattened out a bit the final furlong to finish up evenly.
ICETECA off a step slow, trailed early as a result, improved position on the outside from well back while never a serious threat. FLIGHT ON RACE DAY
pressured the pace from the outside in the two path for five furlongs and gave way. ENRICHED forward placed outside, was giving way while getting out
late in the turn, well back stretch while very wide. STORE FRONT was finished early, also was well back in the end.

Footnotes
EASTERN EMPRESS (GB) settled behind the leader along the inside while in hand, confident handling up the backstretch and into the far turn, tipped out to
the two path exiting the final bend, engaged the leader approaching the furlong marker and wore that foe down under firm handling to be edging clear at the
end. UNION SUIT broke running, set a clear pace through the first turn and onto the backstretch, shrugged off nearest pursuer just as the winner was
begging to advance late in the final turn, dueled with that rival before relenting late. RUNAWAY DIVA prompted the issue up front off the inside, three wide
and between horses while outside the winner entering the straight, had little more for the top two, saved the show. KARA AND COLLEEN lacked early foot
while inside, closer midway on the final turn, angled out to be four wide turning for home while widest of the lead flight, flattened out in the final furlong.
FAIRE PLAISIR went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. EDGE OF TOWN last to leave, remained back. TRENDY raced in mid pack and
three wide, inched a bit closer into the far turn, gave way midway on that bend and then stopped through the lane to jog in.

Footnotes
AMBIVALENT raced in the second fight while outside, four wide exiting the final turn, set down, closed with good determination while remaining outside to
be in time. REMUDA last away, contested the pace three wide, held a narrow advantage into the lane, put away the remaining early speed inside the furlong
grounds but was unable to contain the winner in the waning strides. FRONT RUN THE FED lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground while
moving somewhat closer turning into the stretch, encountered some traffic in upper stretch, stayed inside, rallied up the rail to gain the show. CLOUDY in
the second flight inside, waited in some traffic turning for home, displayed some mild interest when clear the final furlong. ALOGON vied up front early while
between horses, remained on equal terms with the runner up into the stretch, first to blink of that pair inside the furlong grounds, continued to weaken and
lose additional position. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY in the second flight while between horses for over three furlongs, came up empty for the drive. SPIRITED
SOL back off the pace well out in the course, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. MASEN (GB) flashed speed while closest of the first flight
along the inside, faltered through the stretch.

Footnotes
JUDGE DAVIS outrun early while widest up the backstretch, remained four then five wide through the turn when beginning to advance, continued with good
courage to be up in time. MAYA PRINCE back off the pace while toward the inside, saved ground through the turn, steadied when cut off by BARZINI when
that one beat him to a hold along the rail in upper straight, regathered, set down, finished up willingly to earn the second spot late. BARZINI behind the pace
while racing just off the inside, remained in the two path into the stretch, dropped to the rail nearing the furlong grounds causing the runner up to steady,
advanced up the inside but was caught late by that same rival for the runner up spot. BOUNCER pressed the leader from off the inside, came between
rivals into the stretch, remained prominent past the furlong marker, lacked the needed late punch. LUCCI in mid pack while off the rail, came three wide for
the finished up evenly to be also found lacking in the late going. POWER ATTACK away in good order set the pace toward the inside, continued hold a
narrow advantage with a furlong to run, folded in the remaining run to the wire. RUDDY BUDDY broke back, trailed well behind, was not a factor.
CHILDERS pressured the issue up front three to four wide through the turn, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
THE PROCESS forwardly placed under a light hold along the inside,crept a bit closer second turn, moved out and engaged the leader when straightened for
home, kicked well clear under steady handling. ST JAMES THE GREAT void of speed after moving to the inside, continued to save ground into the second
turn, improved by cutting the corner into the stretch, rallied while continuing along the rail to be clear for the place. OISHI in mid pack while along the inside,
made a mild advance into the far turn, continued with a mild rally through the lane to annex the show, no threat to the top pair. TYPHOON LAGOON broke
well, settled off the pace and the inside, continued one paced in lacking a closing response. ADMIRAL'S WAVE in the main group while off the inside,
moved closer three wide in the far turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. SILVER FRONT chased the loose leader for five furlongs off the
inside, gave way. VINSANITY bobbled slightly at the break, quickly recovered to set the pace, continued to show the way into the far turn, briefly raced on
equal terms with the winner when that one challenged into the straight, readily folded when headed. SWING LOW off a step slow, remained back.
VIGORISH also broke back, lacked speed, had nothing for the drive.
