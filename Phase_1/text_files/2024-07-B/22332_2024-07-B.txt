Footnotes
DA GHOST saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and drew off in
the stretch. EL TOMATE raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
two path and chased on in the lane, no match for the winner. CAPALA raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the far bend in the four path and finished evenly. UNIQUE PATH was away from the gate slowly, raced in the four path around the first turn,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the five path and never threatened.
RAMBLINGAMBLINMAN raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second turn and showed no kick.
PREPAREDNESS raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path
and faded from there. ONE LUCKY BOY led the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the
three path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT was away from the gate slowly, raced at the back of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the
four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, kicked clear and held that margin to the wire. RETIRED KATHY raced at the back of the pack in the two
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late. TWIRLING SAVI saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far bend and improved position in the lane. MORGS WORLD bumped lightly with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the two path early,
settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and improved position from the rail to
the wire. DESERT GLOW saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and
weakened in the final furlong. VALENCE raced in the two path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. OCTANE (BRZ) raced in the two path early, pressed the pace up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the lane. DIPLOMATICA raced into traffic and was forced to check in the
opening strides, raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the three path and tired
from there. TWELVE STARS raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid.

BAY BOSS led the way on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, dug in in the lane and just held the win. DE ANGELO
tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, swung out to the four path coming around the bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and gained ground late on the outside to just miss. ASK ARTHUR raced off the pace between horses early, navigated the bend from the two path, began a
bid entering the stretch and improved position from there. FLASH HUMOR chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and was outfinished in late stretch. CATALINA CRUSH tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path
and was outkicked in the lane. PALACE ATTAINED chased the leader between horses through the opening stages, came around the bend in the three path
