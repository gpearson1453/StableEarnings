LIKE WATER chased the pace saving ground while being coaxed on, continued its inside bid into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. LADY
RADLER dropped back to trail early, raced three wide between near the three sixteenths pole and closed in mildly. MATTITUDE moved up three to four
wide around the far turn, aim into the upper stretch and flattened out. GENUINE PERIL set a pressured early pace outside of rival, checked between just

PATRIA vied two deep, dug in near the rail deep stretch and prevailed in a determined run under all out pressure. SOL HOPE chased the pace, raced two
wide between through the far turn, shifted out four wide and finished gamelly to the wire. YOU'RE THE ONE tracked the early pair three deep from the
outside, dug in deep stretch between and finished gamely to the wire. OUR STRONG VOWS chased the pace setters under steady urging, raced four wide
around the far turn and had not enough while racing from the outside. PUPPYMONKEYBABY pressed the pace from the inside, shifted a bit off the inside
through the drive and weakened. FOREVER UNCAPTURED urged along early, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened. HYDRA was off slowly,
saved ground and never threatened.

WHERE'S CHARLIE settled back early on, made a three wide through the far turn and edged up late under strong encouragement. ZAINO stalked the pace,
ridden along near the inside around the far turn, shifted out three deep and finished gamely to the wire. COUNTRY ECONOMICS tracked the early leader
near the inside, took command midway on the far turn, led nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. CONFLICTED was unhurried early on,
raced two to three wide through the stretch run and needed more. Z RACES showed good early speed, collared midway through the far turn and gave way.
AGENT MOR lost ground to race far back and never threatened.

rated along the inside, shifted out four wide through the drive and finished gamely to the wire. RECOGNIZE ME raced four wide around the far turn, was
with the second flight early on, moved up from the inside around the far turn, angled back out five wide through the upper stretch and moved up to improve
position. INSIDE THE BOX dropped back to race mid pack, moved up from the inside around the far turn and improved position late. MAINSTREAM
SELLOUT raced two deep through the far turn, angled out through the drive and had not enough. FLORINDIA showed good early speed, challenged
midway through the far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS void of early speed, raced six wide into the upper stretch and
lacked a rally. MORENA DANCER raced four wide around the far turn and never menaced. GRANDMA'S PUDDING stalked the pace from the far outside,
raced three to five wide around the far turn and faded. FASHIONISTA saved ground and never menaced.
