GOLDEN WIND was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. JOEYBONES was unhurried early
and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. JAVA POWER was in range, hustled along on the
turn and from the four path through the stretch was up for show. FRAC CITY stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. TIPSY FOX was in touch but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

GHOSTLY PERFECTION was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. DAISYCREST was off the
pace, had a mild gain from the inside on the turn and was up for place. BAD ZEZE set a pressured pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. I'M PHANTOM was up close and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
FAITHFUL GIFT stalked the early leaders from the outside but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. AZIEL was
in touch but pulled up on the turn and transported from the track via the Equine Ambulance. FEROCIOUS QUEEN was in touch but stumbled on the turn,
lost the rider and walked off. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY RESULTED IN I'M PHANTOM BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST.

QUARKY was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. IT'S GAME KNIGHT was hustled early, had a
good inside position on the turn and held place. UNION COLONEL was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
needed more. HARDWARE GAP was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. SENSIBLE
PORTIONS was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. EQUAL JUSTICE forced early pace and was a factor on
the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. RELOAD BULLET was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

BOXER BRIEF settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. BAILS HIM OUT showed speed from
the outside, had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and held place. BOUND LUCKY was in range and roused from between foes on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. PARTY OF NO was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch leveled off. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was in mid
pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. LOQUACIOUS was well back, had a mild gain on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SOFIA'S SLUGGER was up close early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

PLUIE D'AVRIL tracked the early leader, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. DONNARUMMA settled
off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. SWEET SERENADE was unhurried early and a
factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MIMI'S HOLIDAY was in range and roused on the far turn but had no
response. SPIRIT BELLE set the pace but lost ground on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off. DOODLE DANDY was well back, showed nothing,
eased to the wire and walked off.

AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was in touch, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch prevailed. SAILINGTHEISLANDS
was in mid pack, saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. BEST AND FINAL was off the pace, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. FINAL RUN FOR LOVE tracked the early leaders from the outside and
moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. YOU SEE ME stalked the early leader and raced evenly from the inside
on the turn but had no late kick. OPEECHEE was in range but chased on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
SCREEN LEGEND set the pace but was headed midway through the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
CHROME'S BIG BREAK was hustled early from the gate, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. DEVIL IN HER HEART was unhurried early,
gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. CRUMLIN BIRD was in range and a factor on the turn but evened
out in mid stretch. SPRING HIGH was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. FRERET
was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. EASY ACCESS showed no speed, trailed the field
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. NEW YORK MINT was up close and had a good position on the turn but from
the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. HEADING WEST was in touch but lost ground on the turn and was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER ON HEADING WEST AGAINST CRUMLIN BIRD AND NEW YORK MINT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS NOT
ALLOWED.
