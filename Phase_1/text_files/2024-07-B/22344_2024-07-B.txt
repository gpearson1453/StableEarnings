HOLD ME ONLY raced close to the pace in an outside trip, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. BURNZ DA BOSS pressed the pace
along the inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch, began to inch away and was outclosed. ARIMONY raced close to the pace,
lacked room on the turn, attempted to split rivals in the upper stretch, couldn't get through, altered course and surged to get up for show. STYLE BENDER
set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel, was unable to sustain his bid and was caught for third. MICKEYS GOLD pressed the pace,
challenged three across on the turn, dueled for the lead, weakened in the drive and fell back. REIGN OVER ME trailed the field, saved ground to the turn,
went widest in the drive and was outrun.
