Footnotes
KILWIN stalked behind the top pair around the turn, tipped outside of them in upper stretch, ranged up to bid in the final furlong and drove past. WAUNEKA
prompted outside of the leader, bid nearing the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer bidder leaving the sixteenth pole,
then lasted for place late. VIXEN was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe the steadied out of crowded quarters at the start, raced at the rear in the
two path, shifted five wide entering the final furlong and offered a good late kick. OKLAHOMA LOGIC broke sharply, set a pressured pace along the inside
around the turn, got headed by an outer prompter entering upper stretch and gave way. BOUTWELL TIME was bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked
speed along the inside, shifted to the two path around the turn, split foes leaving upper stretch but failed to menace. TEQUILAANDTHERAPY chased from
midpack four wide, tucked two wide into the bend before shifting back four wide nearing the lane, but lacked a bid. RISUKO pursued from midpack along the
inside and gave way. TOTAL HEART broke out and troubled an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, but yielded nearing the lane and faded
between horses. FUN TO RUN chased briefly then faded in the three path around the turn.

Footnotes
PENS STREET pursued from midpack in the two path, split foes whlie tipping out passing the three furlong pole, took aim outside of the new leader and
from the four path turning for home, bid in midstretch and drove past. BEST SELLER stalked two wide, bid while well in hand in the three path around the far
turn, led passing the five sixteenths pole, but was confronted by an outer challenger in midstretch and got bested. MY GOOD FORTUNE brushed with an
inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to two path, advanced between horses turning for home and ran on mildly among foes. KLIMT'S
MUSE broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, picked up stride in the two to three path around the far turn before swinging to the five path
entering the lane, but flattened out. SWEET AMY set a clear pace in the two path, offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the five sixteenths pole
and weakened. CHIQUITA MOSCA broke a beat slow while brushing with an outer rival at the start, trailed early on, lost contact with the rest approaching
the far turn, yet regained stride to improve position in the lane. MIDNIGHT TANGO tracked along the inside, chased around the turn and faded. JUMP INTO
THE FIRE broke outwardly at the start, tracked three deep, but faded in the four to five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
NORMANDY COAST set the pace inside of a pair of pressers into the turn, drew clear leaving the five sixteenths pole, then lasted for place late. OY
GEVALD chased forwardly along the inside, gained place from outer rivals entering the lane in the two path, closed in determinedly on the clear leader late
but came up short. HEAVENVILLE chased from midpack two to four wide, then safely managed show while proving no match for the top two. BORROWED
TIME pressed three deep into the turn, but faded between horses nearing the quarter pole. RAVE RUNNER broke on top, led keenly leaving the chute,
prompted two wide and between horses into the turn, but gave way with three furlongs to go. PATRIOTIC JERRELL lacked speed along the inside and
made little impact. FINANCIAL WHIZ pursued two wide and between horses approaching the turn, then failed to factor. BLAKE JAMES never got involved
from the four path. BRERETON'S BAYTOWN was a bit hesitant to load, then got outrun in the five path.

HERCHEE pressed three to two wide around teh first turn, bid turning for home, struck the front entering the lane, inched clear in the final furlong and held
sway. KATHEEB tracked along the inside, shifted out four wide turning for home, advanced to take aim on the new leader leaving upper stretch, but drifted
out while slowly closing in and needed more. HAMMERSTEIN set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge around the far turn, got headed by that
bidder entering the lane, then gave way yet lasted for show. FORTUNE SELLER laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the four path in upper
stretch and ran on late to miss show at the wire. BANJO CHRIS pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased around the far turn and
lacked a bid. REALIGNMENT stalked two wide before tucking to the inside around the first turn, then chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. POOL
GUY was slow into stride, trailed along the inside and made little impact. STORMS HOME bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two to three path and failed to factor. THIS TIME broke a step slow and bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked three deep, took closer order down
the backstretch, pressed the top pair into the far turn, but faded turning for home.

outer rival loomed a danger, sparred with that one late and got nailed. LADY CHAI broke outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace in the five to four path,
crept closer turning for home, stayed on along with an outer rival to offer a late show bid and edged that position. CLIQUE sped clear early on, showed the
way in the two path, but was caught by an outer pair at the furlong grounds, weakened and lost show late. MOMBAYLA broke slowly and trailed early on,
advanced in the five path around the bend, then ran on but needed more for show. FLIGHT TO PARIS lacked speed in the three path, trailed turning for
home, picked up stride five wide and surpassed inner rivals entering the lane, but failed to menace. LEGACY DEFINED chased forwardly along the inside
but steadily gave way. QUEEN CLANCY leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path and failed to factor. JAZZ PARTY
brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between foes, steadied approaching the three furlong pole, swung out to the six
path entering the lane and failed to threaten. KISS ME AGAIN laid off of the pace along the inside and faded. VIBE CHECK brushed with an inner rival at
the start, pursued from midpack in the four to three path and tired between horses. CRANK IT UP was brushed between horses at the start, lacked speed
three wide and among foes into the turn, then weakened.

Footnotes
LUCKY SPEECH showed the way along the inside, led from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held late. BIG
BRASS BED laid off of the pace two wide before moving to the inside around the first turn, saved ground before splitting foes three wide entering teh final
furlong, rallied and edged place while closing in on the leader late. HEART SPIN tracked along the, loomed a danger traveling well behind the leaders
around the far turn, bid for place while pursuing the clear leader into the final furlong, dueled for that position with an outer bidder late but got outfinished.
STEPHANIE'S CHARM raced forwardly along the inside before steadying behind the leader into the first turn, tugged to press along with an outer rival
around that bend, prompted among foes around the far turn, chased the clearing leader into the final furlong, then yielded place between horses. ALYBAER
tracked in the three path, shifted four wide turning for home before getting fanned five wide in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. LAST CALL stalked three
wide, pressed around the far turn, but faded four wide and between horses in upper stretch. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS laid off of the pace along the inside,
then two wide around the far turn, shifted out six wide in upper stretch and failed to factor. CALL ME TONI dropped back from between horses after
breaking a beat slow at the start, saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. UMEBOSHI pursued three wide and failed to factor. BAG LADY was outrun two
wide and eased through the final furlong.

BRU NA BOINNE stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, tipped out to take aim outside the new leader in upper stretch and drove past at the
sixteenth pole. PEACOCK LASS pressed three deep, bid turning for home, led into the lane but was bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole.
FLASHY LASS tugged between horses leaving the first turn to vie two wide, then between horses around the far turn, got headed by her outer counterpart
entering the lane, yet kept on. DEAR LADY vied along the inside, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer rivals around the far turn, but gave way entering
the lane. QUEEN LECA (URU) pursued from the three path and failed to factor. SUNNY ISLE BEACH laid off of the pace in the two path and made little
impact. IN MY OPINION broke outwardly, then got outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
PHAROAH'S WINE set the pace, led from an outer bidder around the far turn, repelled that challenge in midstretch, drifted out many paths in the late stages
and held sway. FANTASTICAL stalked outside of the leader while rank under restraint around the first turn, bid around the far turn, but got turned away in
midstretch, sustained pursuit while getting herded out in the late stages, and lacked a re bid. SMOOTH WAVES steadied after taking an awkward step
approaching the first turn, stalked along the inside and chased the leading pair home to be best of the rest. CAIRO STREET pursued from midpack along
the inside, steadied behind rivals entering the backstretch, then saved ground to no avail. LOW COUNTRY MAGIC trailed in the three path early on,
improved position down the backstretch, then failed to menace. SENSE OF PEARL tracked two wide and failed to factor. FLOORED laid off of the pace
along the inside, checked behind foes entering the backstretch and made little impact. OFF THE LAM laid off of the pace two to three wide, gained entering
the backstretch, stalked into the far turn but weakened drifting to the six path entering the lane. THE RIDER OF FANTASTICAL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
