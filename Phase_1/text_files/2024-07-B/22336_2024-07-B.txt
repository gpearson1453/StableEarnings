Footnotes
COAL BATTLE raced within striking distance, came around the turn four wide, made a bid and drove clear down the stretch. RUNNING RAGGED dueled on
the front end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late and was a clear second. YORKTOWN PANTHER raced near the middle of
the field in the beginning, made an inside bid and proved no match for the top two. DUBAIAN MONEY was reluctant to load, pressed the pace and lacked a
late kick. SEVENTH DEAL broke in, raced near the back in the early part, improved position, but was no factor. MISCHIEVOUS SMILE raced evenly near
the back, while having an outside trip and was never a threat. TAP THE TEQUILA raced evenly near the back and was never close. DEFTLY DONE broke
out, raced in the back and showed little. SHOHEI challenged for the early advantage and dropped back.

Footnotes
YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and got up for the win. CAUSEWAY
BENNY shot to the front, moved to the rail, led until deep in the stretch, couldn't hold off YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU for the win. OUR MAJESTIC raced near
the back in the early going, made a mild inside bid and proved no match for the top two. CUNIMBUS raced within striking distance, saved ground around the
turn, weakened and lacked a finish. BABY'S LAST DANCE pressed the early pace and was finished early. DR SPECK showed early speed, dropped back
and finished evenly. MAJESTIC PALACE raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside and weakened. ASHES IN THE OCEAN
always raced near the back and was never a threat. ZESTINY lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside and was outrun.

JESS'S RAINBOW raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the home stretch, while drifting out and drove clear. LAWLESS
TIMES lacked early speed, made a steady gain, while saving ground, angled out at the head of the final stretch, made a bid, steadied late and was a clear
second. THAT IS AWESOME went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and lacked a finish. COME WHAT MAE raced within striking distance, came
around the second turn on the outside, put forth an even effort and lacked a late rally. MOR KISSES raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even
effort. SANTANGELO pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. MISS LONELYHEARTS lacked early speed, came around the second turn on
the outside, raced wide down the lane and was no factor. TEXAS TWINKIES lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn and was never close.
KAPPA HILL broke out, trailed the field and was never a threat. THE JOCKEY OF #3 LAWLESS TIMES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 JESS'S
RAINBOW FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION,

DASHYNS DREAM went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, pulled away down the home stretch and finished well. HONORARY GUEST pressed the
pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. LAYLA'S SONG raced within striking distance, made a bid 3/4
pole and weakened. HAL'S DREAM trailed in the early going, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, entered the home stretch wide, tried
to make a bid, but couldn't gain ground on the leaders. AKIANE'S SOLDIER raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and faded.

Footnotes
HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE dueled on the front end, saved ground, drove clear down the lane and won under steady urging. ITZCOATL raced within striking
distance, entered the home stretch wide, made a late gain and was a clear second at the wire. ROCKY BOY lacked early speed, made a wide gain and
finished willingly. MY UNCLE BILLY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SEEKING A SOLDIER challenged on the front end and faded
down the home stretch. KNIGHT'S GOLD vied for the early advantage and dropped back. BAY MOBILE lacked early speed and was never close. JOEY'S
FAST PLAY broke slow, trailed and was eased to the wire.
