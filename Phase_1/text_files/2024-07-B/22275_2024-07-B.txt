Footnotes
SHOOTIN' AMY emerged from the group to have a clear advantage by the half, set the fractions while pressed outside throughout the turn, spurted away
straightening for home and was kept to the task to the wire to hold safe comfortably when crossing the finish line. FEDOROVA broke sharp to have the lead
at the start, tracked the quartet outside by the half, stalked on the rail through the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole to mount a rally five wide at the top of
the stretch and valiantly chased the winner home but was second best on this day. ALPHA GAMMA GIRL was in the mix up top after the break in the two
path between foes down the backside, watched the lead trio when reined in entering the turn, waited on the fence under a snug hold behind the engaged
threesome around the bend, skimmed the fence at the top of the lane and finished up willingly to be a non threaten third. BABY MADELEINE was away
slowly to spot the field down the backstretch, finally caught up to rivals inside when shifting out to the five path for a clear run at the top of the lane and
finished with good intent for a minor share at the wire. CHIPOTLE PEPPER tossed her head at the break, recovered to prompt the issue four deep on the
outside down the back straight, moved in to bid for the lead three wide by the quarter pole, had no more to offer in the three path by the furlong marker and
faded between foes in deep stretch. KIKITSA pressed the pace early on in the three path between runners, continued to vie for the lead with rivals on both
sides at the quarter pole, could not quicken with horses turning for home and retreated in mid-stretch. TENTOMIDNIGHT was head of only the poor starter
down the backside, travelling outside rivals in the five path, could not make any headway going three wide around the bend and could not play a role outside
horses in the stretch running.

Footnotes
NOAHS ARK was quite content to sit behind the pacesetter in the first turn, settled in a good rhythm measuring the frontrunner down the backside, was
nudged to go midway on the final bend, quickly went on by for the lead at the quarter pole and coasted home for the impressive score. REBELIOUS was
near the rear three wide in the first turn, trailed the field along the backside, began to extend his stride, passing runners outside at the quarter marker and
closed in but could not reel in the winner at the wire. PROUD RONIN took control right from the break, set the pace down with little pressure applied from
rivals down the backstretch, was collared by the winner at the quarter pole, had no resistance to give in upper stretch but did stay on determinedly to hold
for third money. MY MUNNINGS MODEL travelled five wide outside rivals in the first of two turns, stalked between horses in the third tier down the
backstretch, offered a mild turn of foot from the three eighths pole until the top of the stretch outside of foes and evened out at the furlong marker to settle on
the fringes. HATMAKER GIZMO tracked on the rail in the early stages, could not accelerate when alongside the eventual winner while on the rail at the
three furlong marker and flattened out on the fence in upper stretch. QUIET SUNDAY stalked four wide between horses in the first turn, settled outside foes
three deep in the third flight along the backside, was roused at the three furlong but offered little response through the final turn and failed to menace in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
SALT comfortably watched the contesting duo down the backside, kept a close eye while on hold sitting just off the front two throughout the turn, moved in
to loom boldly in the five path at the top of the stretch, seized control at the furlong marker and under only mild urging held off all runners to the finish line.
BEAUTIFUL CRAZY settled inside tracking the front two along the backside, continued to wait behind the engaged pair around the bend, burst through
runners, finding a seam in the two path at the three sixteenths marker, chased the winner in vain to the wire but could not reel her in late. SCAT GIRL
stalked near the rear on the fence after the start, saved ground through the turn making little progress, swung out widest in the eight path at the top of the
lane and closed in the capture third money just before the finish line. MOBULA had a slim lead on the rail down the backstretch, began to edge away from
the early speed foe through the turn, was headed outside by rivals turning for home, fought on stubbornly inside until the sixteenth pole and gave way late to
settle for a minor share. CAN'T BUY CLASS was allowed to settle at the back of the pack in the beginning, started to pick up runners on the outside with
three furlongs remaining, shifted out in the six path for the drive but lacked a rally down the stretch. ONE MORE DOLL forced the pace outside down the
back straight, chased the frontrunner throughout the turn, bid between horses in the three path briefly at the top of the stretch but yielded by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH TALK was lightly bumped at the start, was forwardly-positioned stalking outside three to four wide, bid at the quarter pole, was in command at
the top of the stretch, drew clear when asked and held safe. ROYAL HUDSON broke inwardly, tracked from inside through the first turn, switched out
heading up the backstretch, was put to urging while advancing four wide at the five-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but secured the place. SIR
SAMUEL settled off the pace inside a foe near but off the rail, advanced steadily up the backstretch along the rail into the far turn, waited in behind runners
briefly then was guided out a bit past the five-sixteenths, needed room again in upper stretch and altered out seven wide, finished well but was too little too
late. PENNER ASH (IRE) tracked the leaders in behind off then on the rail, went evenly in the stretch. JUST START ME UP set a pressured pace inside,
came out a bit leaving the far turn, weakened in the stretch. DEVELOPING THE WAY unhurriedly brought up the rear, was still well back coming to the top
of the stretch and kept on well enough to pass tired rivals. JAY BIRD exchanged light contact at the start, forced the pace from outside, came up empty.
FOREST STAR exchanged light contact then bumped the inside foe at the start, was kept wide up the backstretch racing well back, shifted in late on the far
turn, was never near enough to threaten. ENCHANT ME was near mid-pack off the inside, put to urging six wide on the far turn, faltered in the stretch and
was not persevered with late.

SHOTGUN WEDDING hounded the pace outside in the early going, took over control by the half mile marker outside, edged clear in upper stretch and
under a vigorous ride late with right handed encouragement held on by a diminishing margin at the finish line. READY FOR CANDY was reluctant to load at
the start, settled in the third flight outside horses down the backstretch, moved in smartly throughout the turn, was blocked by a wall of runners looking for a
seam in upper stretch, angled out to the sixth path to have a clear lane with three sixteenths to go and closed in resolutely but just could not get there in
time. KEYTOTHEPARK was nestled on the rail in the third tier stalking, improved position moving well on the fence in the turn, hugged the rail turning for
home to be a major player in the stretch run, shifted out to bid at the furlong marker but needed more late to threaten the top pair at the wire. NORTH YORK
was away alertly for the lead, dueled inside up front into the turn, chased the winner on the rail three furlongs from home, raced a little greenly through the
lane, never wavered though and just missed out winning the duel for third money with that solid debut. STARRY NIGHT co-trailed on the inside in the
beginning, was hard ridden trying to stay involved around the turn, started to reach for more ground while looking for a seam behind rivals in the five path in
upper stretch, angled to the rail with a sixteenth to go and finished up with purpose inside in deep stretch. OUR LADY PEACE was another one who was
reluctant to load, travelled in the second flight between horses down the back straight, continued to track the leaders between foes on the turn, shifted out
four wide looming menacingly at the top of the stretch, could not continue the rally and wilted with an eighth left to run. SNATCHED tracked on the fence
along the backside, shifted just off the rail in midturn, moved in between horses in the two path at the three eighths marker to be in the hunt up top by the
quarter pole, could not find another gear to the wire and weakened with runners on either side with a furlong remaining. YORKTON ROSE was away slowly
to begin, co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, took closer order around the bend to be in range for a share in the five path straightening out for the
drive but failed to fire in the stretch running. BAYTOWN SHINJUKU tracked three wide outside rivals in the early going, closed the gap on the leaders
through the turn, was floated out widest to the seven path turning for home but could not get into contention driving to the finish line.

MY BOY PRINCE reared at the start and lost his path, moved forward keenly heading to the first turn then tucked in behind the leaders, stalked three to four
wide, was put to urging near the five-sixteenths still racing three to four deep, took the lead in mid-stretch, edged clear by the sixteenth pole and held while
drifting just a bit. RAFAROO settled off the pace outside three wide early, advanced five wide coming to the quarter pole, drifted in through the stretch, was
second best. FRIENDLY GHOST soon led racing two to three wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace nearer the fence, was hounded through the far
turn but kept on well in the lane to secure show honors. PIPER'S FACTOR forced the pace from outside racing mostly three wide, weakened in the stretch.
JOKESTAR unhurriedly brought up the rear from off the inside, was nearer the rail through the far turn beginning a mild rally, came out in the stretch and
kept on evenly late. NO MORE OPTIONS led them early heading to the turn then took back content to track from inside, was well-placed still close up
heading to the far turn, lost ground on that bend, was guided out past the five-sixteenths, swung eight wide turning for home and ran on. BEAUTIFUL SKY
was never near enough to threaten racing on or just off the rail.

Footnotes
SOLO ALBUM went quickly to the lead, set the pace under light rating tactics racing inside and shadowed by a rival, drifted out a bit in mid- to late-stretch
and just held under steady handling. FOREVER DIXIE settled at the rear, rallied in behind just off the inside in upper to mid-stretch, altered out nearing the
sixteenth pole seeking room and continued to gain from between runners but just missed. FASHIONABLY FAB settled mid-pack two to three wide, moved
rapidly splitting rivals at the five-sixteenths and shifting five wide by the quarter pole, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but kicked on evenly late while
being brushed very lightly near the sixteenth pole. OCEAN CLUB pressed the eventual winner from outside, drifted out turning for home, brushed with a rival
in late stretch, was outkicked. RO TOWN reared and bumped a rival at the start, advanced keenly inside against the rider's restraint who tapped on the
brakes in behind foes at the three-quarters, saved ground throughout, kept on up the rail in late stretch but needed more. BATUCADA was a bit keen on the
first turn moving forward four wide, stalked the leading pair up the backstretch, was ridden along by the three-eighths, failed to rally. TITO'S CALLING was
bumped hard and bobbled at the start, angled in then switched out off the rail bringing up the rear, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
CRUDEN BAY was unhurried to co-trail on the inside down the backstretch, was travelling well tucked in on the rail in the third tier saving ground through
the turn, angled out under left handed encouragement at the furlong marker in the four path and with a well timed late surge got up for the victory in the
shadow of the wire. WAR BOMBER (IRE) had a good trip nestled on the rail behind the leader in the early stages of the race, burst between rivals to seize
control by the eighth pole, tried in earnest but could just not fend off the winner in deep stretch with that solid effort. IRONSTONE was bounced around
between foes on the break, stalked outside runners in the third flight three wide around the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive to the finish line, kept on
trying to the end and got up in the last jump for third money. CAPTURE THE LION was content to track the stablemate outside down the backstraight,
shadowed the leader between horses throughout the turn, bid for the lead in the four path at the top of the lane and battled on to the wire to just miss
winning the show duel in the end. FIRST EMPIRE broke in to begin, assumed the lead down the backstretch setting a comfortable pace up top, continued to
show the field the way around the turn, was headed outside in upper stretch, fought on stubbornly until the furlong marker and faded, losing a couple of
placings late. SARATOGA FLASH broke outwards at the start, settled in midfield three deep along the backside, prompted three wide outside the leaders
around the bend, was in the hunt five wide straightening for home but could not make any impact tiring down the lane. FLAG OF HONOUR (AUS) was
throttled down in the backstretch when losing forward rail position at the three quarters marker, reengaged to track the front duo between horses through the
turn, was urged left handed turning for home trying to keep pace with rivals, offered little response in upper stretch and was empty for the drive to the wire.
NOT NORMAL co-trailed on the outside but was headstrong while fighting the rider down the backside, settled outside horses in the third flight through the
turn, shifted out to the five path for the drive but had little to offer in the stretch running.

KIN'S CONCERTO shifted in early with good forward position saving ground while tracking in behind the leaders, moved out off the rail on the far turn to
pass the tiring pacesetter, angled five wide in upper stretch, took aim and drove past inside the final seventy yards. CAITLINHERGRTNESS was well-placed
stalking just off the leaders three to four wide, moved to challenge taking the lead at the quarter pole, drifted out late hooking up with and inside the eventual
winner, was outfinished. HURRICANE CLAIR broke outwardly brushing a rival lightly, was a bit headstrong into the first turn two to three wide between and
in behind rivals having to tap on the brakes near the three-quarters, settled down soon after stalking in behind, angled six wide in upper stretch, finished
strongly but rallied too late. A LITTLE FRISKY was caught five wide in the early going, made a rapid advance still five deep on the far turn to reach striking
distance, evened out in late stretch. LUNCH WITH BERNIE was coaxed forward from the break and moved near to the leader shifting in three wide heading
into the turn, stalked that rival before taking over past the seven-sixteenths and shifting in a bit once clear, was challenged by an outside rival nearing the
quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. WAR PAINTER angled in and settled at the rear racing off the inside, advanced between foes past the
three-eighths and under urging soon after, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, ran on in the stretch to improve. MY GIRL DELLA eased back from between
runners entering the first turn settling mid-pack three to four wide, came out seven deep in upper stretch, ran on evenly. VUCCHELLA was brushed lightly at
the start, settled off the pace mostly two to three wide, was strongly ridden three furlongs out but was never near enough to threaten while going evenly. BA
DEE YAH raced in the back half of the field going mostly four wide through both turns, was asked by the quarter pole but failed to threaten. SHAMANS GIRL
was caught four to five wide on both turns racing at the rear, was never near enough to threaten. LOOKIN TO CONQUER set the pace inside, was done
three furlongs out and gave way. INUDATION leapt and lunged inward at the start, raced at the back inside early, moved out going three to four wide
coming to the quarter pole, failed to menace. HOLIDAY IN JAIL stumbled badly at the start, saved ground inside early and two to three wide on the far turn,
was never a threat. BRAVO KATE raced just off the inside and was ridden along by the half, had no response and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
READY TO JAM travelled four deep in midfield on the turn, began to uncork a rally six wide at the top of the lane, was full of run when encouraged left
handed in mid-stretch and drew off convincingly in the final sixteenth. SASSY MELISSA was allowed to gallop along trailing the field down the backstretch,
began to sharply pick up runners three wide on the outside with three furlongs left to go, angled out widest to be in the seven path for the drive, could not
reel in the winner who was long gone but did close in strongly to nail the runners up share at the wire. LIVIN ON LUV settled kindly on the rail behind the
contesting pair throughout the turn, angled out to the four path with a string chance turning for home and fought on determinedly with horses on both sides
to capture the show money. HOT CARGO tracked the pacesetter in the early going, moved closer to force the issue outside around the bend, took control in
the three path at the top of the stretch, could not find another gear when urged at the furlong marker and faded to be on the wrong end of a three way photo
for the place share. MICHELE M. was away slowly to begin, stalked near the rear on the fence down the backstretch, wait for room to move while inside at
the three eighths marker, closed the gap smartly on the rail by upper stretch to be in the mix for a share of the prize but stalled with a furlong to go.
BAYTOWN LOVELY was unhurried, ahead of only one runner at the half, could see the field when straightening out for home and passed tired runners in
the lane. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES settled in mid-division between runners in the early going, was looking for running room while in the four path behind
rivals at the top of the lane, shifted in trying to find a seam at the furlong pole but could not get involved late. ALLISTON took command up top along the
backside, had a slim advantage running around the bend, dueled inside until the eighth pole and retreated in deep stretch. VEERY was well in hand three
wide tracking the front duo around the turn, angled out five wide in range of the leaders turning for home but could not find more late and folded at the
furlong marker.

Footnotes
RED MOOD was situated three deep outside runners in the second flight down the backside, took aim on the leader three furlongs from home, posed the
only threat in the four path turning for home and surged late to get up just before the finish line. WHISKEY N ICE broke outwards to begin, was the quickest
down the backstretch, continued up front with no challengers around the bend, kept on trying to the wire but was caught just before the wire by the winner.
SPECTACULAR FORCE broke in at the start, stalked near the rear two wide outside foes, came under a ride three wide with horses on either side in
midturn, started to rally smartly by the quarter pole, was fanned out while gathering momentum in the seven path for the drive and showed good late energy
to close in for the show award. IRON PYRITE stalked in the third flight outside rivals in the early stages, improved when circling around runners three wide
at the quarter pole, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane but could not pose a threat in the stretch running. SCAT HUMOR stalked at the back
having only one foe beaten down the backside, made a sharp move four wide around horses midway on the turn, was floated out the be widest in the eight
path straightening for home, could not sustain the rally and stalled at the sixteenth pole. WORK IT BABY travelled between runners in midfield down the
backstretch, started to pass runners inside with three furlongs remaining, shifted outside at the quarter pole, continued to angle out to be six wide for the
stretch run, dueled for a minor share in the lane but faded in the final seventy yards. SOMETHING BORROWED stalked near the rear on the fence, saved
ground while edging closer to the leaders throughout the turn, shifted out in the six path for the run down the lane and finished with intent to the wire.
HOULIHAN was in tight on the break, tracked outside in the second flight in the beginning, closed in with three furlongs remaining, was in the hunt with
runners on both sides in the three path at the top of the stretch but backed away at the furlong marker. NO LAYUPS chased the pace down the backside,
was roused into the turn, could not quicken with others outside making a move, tried to rally up the fence in the lane but was checked off the rail at the
furlong marker and could factor afterwards. PLAYFULLY FRAC'IN travelled on the rail in the tracking flight in the back straight, made little impression when
roused midpoint on the turn and gave way with a furlong remaining. YOUSANGTOME travelled four deep outside foes in mid-pack along the backside, was
roused but offered little turn of foot at the three eighths marker and was empty for the drive to the finish line. MAIKEN THE VIKING trailed the field by many
down the back straight, lost contact with the filed around the turn and could not be a factor down the lane.
