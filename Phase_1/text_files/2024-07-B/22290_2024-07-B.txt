HOLD OUT was sent up early between rivals to contest the pace, took over entering the clubhouse turn, set the pace on the inside, responded when
roused, dug in gamely inside in midstretch, turned back a bid from the runner up and held well for the win. GOVERNOR DUTTON vied inside for the early
lead, took back off the pace, tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, bid at the furlong marker and came up second
best. MAXIMATCH pulled early on, then stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn and finished evenly. PORTIS pulled while racing three wide in the
early stages, settled two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. TIME TESTED trailed the field and did not factor. CURLIN'S

IT CAN BE DONE vied two wide from the outset, continued alongside MAILMAN MONEY on the backside, dueled with that rival on the far turn, put a head
in front in upper stretch, dueled heads apart through the lane and inched away in the final yards. MAILMAN MONEY vied inside for the lead, dueled on the
far turn, battled heads apart into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail through the lane and battled determinedly to the end. NAPOLEON'S WAR pulled in
the early stages racing outside of the leaders, then stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and weakened in the stretch. ENAHM
raced close up between horses in the early stages, then tracked the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and tired. NO SALT raced close up on the rail in
the early stages, then tracked the pace, chased inside on the far turn and faded.
