Footnotes
KADRI sped up to the inside of rivals and took a short early lead, emerged in a battle to the inside of CHARMED (GB) after a furlong, vied under rating into
and around the turn, was put to firm asking near the three sixteenths, wandered outward a bit through the final furlong then proved resolute under a drive.
CHARMED (GB) , a bit fractious pre race, was loaded without his rider, came away in good order and attended the pace outside the winner, battled on near
even terms into the stretch, stayed on while floated out some inside the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. BOSS IS A PAL stalked the dueling
leaders while in the clear, came three to four wide for the drive, edged closer leaving mid stretch, shifted in some late but flattened through the final yards.
CASH NOW , off the pace and in the clear, circled three wide into the lane but could only offer a mild rally. SPEAK UNITY broke a step slow, lagged back off
the pace while saving ground then lacked a serious stretch kick. MONSTER MASON , off the pace, shifted out four wide for the drive but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
VIENNESE WALTZ lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses and was up late.
SOCIETY BALL stayed near the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch and around the turn, found a narrow opening inside BOBBYNESS in mid
stretch, gained a short lead late and just missed. DAZZY , four deep leaving the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead in mid stretch and
finished willingly. I CAN DO IT , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, moved to the four path entering the stretch and flattened out between horses.
BOSSYNESS bumped BROOKLYN GIRL when bearing in at the break, set a pressured pace near the inner rail, moved to the two path in upper stretch and
gave way in the drive. BROOKLYN GIRL , bumped leaving the starting gate, was no factor. MIDSUMMERS EVE prompted the pace outside BOSSYNESS
and faltered.

BLAME THE TUX took command soon after the start and secured the inside, handled outside pressure while nicely rated, spurted away after being set
down near the three sixteenths, kept on under solid encouragement inside the furlong grounds then held firm. THATAWAY , away alertly, prompted the
pace outside the winner, could not quite quicken with that one once asked in upper stretch but continued on well through the final sixteenth to be clearly
second best. NORTHERN TICK TOCK settled well back while saving some ground, eased out and was nudged upon leaving the far turn, circled four to five
wide into the stretch and found his best too late. QUINCANNON , keen early behind the leaders, settled and stalked inside through the backstretch run,
shifted out four wide for the drive but came up empty in deep stretch. SNEAKING SUSPICION bore out at the break, corrected and settled outside a rival,
raced between runners in upper stretch but failed to generate a serious run. BENNY HAVENS was rated back from between horses in the opening furlong,
dropped inside soon after, was under asking leaving the five sixteenths but failed to kick on. CROSSLAND stalked outside a rival, took closer order near the
five sixteenths, angled three wide with pursuit into the stretch, lacked a punch soon after and faded.

Footnotes
FLAT DISCOUNT saved ground on the turn stalking the disputed pace, found room along the inner rail entering the stretch, gained a short lead in mid
stretch and dug in tenaciously. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , caught in close quarters at the start, circled the turn four deep while prompting the pace, bid for the
lead at the head of the lane and battled gamely through the stretch. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL remained along the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. MIT MAZEL , rushed to the lead along the rail leaving the backstretch, disputed the pace, drifted to the two path turning for
home and faded. GOLD TIME VIXEN raced in the two path around the turn, moved four wide in upper stretch and was not a factor. SWEET HEIDELBERG ,
sent down the backstretch, disputed the pace in the two path between horses, failed to keep up entering the stretch, drifted wide and weakened. NO MORE
MASK disputed the pace in the three path between horses for three furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
BARBADIAN RUNNER settled off the early pace, was put to a ride outside a rival near the three eighths, moved up three wide into the stretch, shifted in as
the leader drifted near mid stretch, forged to command towards the inner rail with a sixteenth to go and drew out. SUMMERINTHECOUNTRY sped clear
after about a sixteenth of a mile, dropped in and set the pace, was joined from the outside mid turn, dueled into the lane, shook clear under a drive past the
three sixteenths, wandered about soon after, could not resist the winner's inside charge but stayed well while on his left lead. LITTLE BIT RISKY edged up
three wide near the half and prompted the leaders, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, sparred into the lane, failed to match strides past the three
sixteenths, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded. FLASHY DUDE , off the pace while saving ground, moved up a bit near mid stretch then
failed to sustain. NOLA BOSS had speed to the inside of SUMMERINTHECOUNTRY, rated back off that one and angled out, moved up two wide near the
half, chased the duelers into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths then weakened. ROCKET SCIENCE was outrun.

Footnotes
ATLAS STRONG , reserved along the inner rail to the far turn, eased off the rail mid way on the bend, swung to the five path near the three sixteenths pole,
led late and lasted. ONCOURTCOMMENTATOR , unhurried for six furlongs, swung to the seven path in mid stretch and rallied outside rivals. ANGEL ART
stalked the pace, was in hand waiting for room leaving the far turn, split horses to sprint clear in mid stretch, finished willingly but was not good enough.
CATCH THE KITTEN remained along the inner rail on both turns and in upper stretch, was taken to the three path in mid stretch and gained late. NAVAL
EMPIRE lacked speed, moved to the six path in upper stretch and came up empty. DETERMINED SAIL set a pressured pace along the inner rail and
weakened the final furlong. CONGRESS HALL was not a factor. ESPERANNNA prompted the pace outside DETERMINED SAIL and faltered.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S APPEAL sped clear early then dropped in to set a rated pace, handled some outside pressure from I'M GITTIN THERE, spurted clear under
some nudging past the five sixteenths, kicked away after being put to stout asking inside the three sixteenths, switched leads a couple of times through the
final furlong and remained clear while confidently handled late. I'M GITTIN THERE , away alertly, prompted the pace outside the winner, stayed on to give
hard chase from the three sixteenths, dug in gamely through the final seventy yards and saved the place. DEEDS OF LOVE settled off the pace and off the
inside, angled out mid turn, came five wide for the drive and closed steadily. GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS , off the pace while saving ground, was under
pressure remaining towards the rail in upper stretch and churned on. BOURBON WILDCAT stalked the pace between foes, failed to kick on leaving mid
stretch and faded. ROYAL WHISPER , fractious and a bit reluctant to load, was away last after breaking inward, corrected and rushed up inside rivals,
steadied near the half, stayed inside to make a mild run past the quarter pole, lacked a punch leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.
FUHGEDDABOUDIT , three deep chasing the pace, raced a bit wider in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ITALIAN SYMPHONY hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, waited for room leaving the far turn, moved to the two path at the head of the stretch, took
command approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. LONGBRANCH LOU stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn
three wide, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. THE PADDOCK PASTOR bumped with MARIO'S ON POINT after breaking awkwardly,
was snugly rated for six furlongs, swung to the five path in upper stretch and offered a belated response. GENERAL'S DUTY , rated outside horses to the
far turn, was set down four wide entering the stretch, had a mild advance to mid stretch and gave way on his left lead. HANKSDIVININGROD , inside horses
most of the race, failed to rally. ALWAYS FUN set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. MARIO'S ON POINT bumped
with THE PADDOCK PASTOR leaving the starting gate then was outrun. WITHOUT PRETENCE prompted the pace two wide and faltered.
