Footnotes
MISTER MOSCATO dueled inside, settled near the half-mile pole, angled to the three path at the three-eighths pole, bid at the eighth pole to be clear and
lasted under mild urging. EGYPTIAN KING broke in the air, saved ground, moved to the four path on the far turn, rallied late and missed. SPUNS SON
saved ground, rallied late between rivals and was caught for the place. NAPATREE stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole and faltered in
the stretch. LEFT POCKET MONEY dueled outside of the winner, was clear near the half-mile pole and faded in the stretch. CAPTAIN'S FLAG stalked the
pace inside, bid at the half-mile pole but faded in the stretch. GAELIC NATION (IRE) raced evenly. URSO GRAYDAR saved ground to no avail. JACKS R
WILD was not a factor. KLIMTSTER stalked the early pace in the three path before fading.
