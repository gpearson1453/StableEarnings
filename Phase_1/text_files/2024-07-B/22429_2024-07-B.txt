at the three-eighths pole, rallied at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. MARY LOVES LOUIE saved ground, was rank around the first turn,
saved ground and gave way in the stretch. POOTOOGOOK was jostled at the start, stalked the pace inside, moved to the three path at the quarter pole and
faded. INNISFREE LASS saved ground, bid at the quarter pole and faded. LA ORGULLOSA was bumped at the start, was carried out slightly at the first
turn and lacked a late bid. RUN IN GOLD raced well back, bid five wide at the three-eighths pole and faltered in the stretch. J'S NAUGHTY ANGEL pressed
the early pace in the three path, was steadied near the seven-eighths pole, angled out on the 1st turn, rushed up to stalk the pace in the three path and
gave way on the far turn. THE STEWARDS QUICKLY DISMISSED AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF CROWNED WITH GRACE AGAINST

RUN AWAY ROJO dueled inside of one rival, then another and won the head bob under steady urging. MIDNIGHT WEST stalked the pace in the three
path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of the winner and was outnodded. WOODCOURT stalked the pace between rivals, angled to the three
path in early stretch, rallied and missed. TRES SOLES was unrushed inside, raced in the five path around the far turn and lacked a late bid. MR CHAOS
dueled outside of the winner and gave way at the quarter pole. FOWLER BLUE was through early.

Footnotes
MR CORN raced in the three path, rallied at the quarter pole and was clear late under strong a hand ride. PORKYISMYNAME stalked the pace in the four
path, vied between foes, then couldn't hold off the winner. MY MISTER PERFECT was unrushed inside, angled four wide at the three-eighths pole, rallied
and missed the place. MOTION TO ADJOURN stalked the pace inside but couldn't close late. QUALITY DANCER was unrushed early and rallied belatedly
in the four path. BOZAANO raced evenly inside. CHARMING VICTORY stalked the early pace in the four path, bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the three
path and faded in the stretch. MORE THAN A IMPACT raced evenly. THISCATSABULLET led inside and gave way in the stretch. MONEY MONDAY

for the place. TANEYCOMO saved ground and faded in the stretch. INSTINCTUALLY stumbled badly at the start, raced five wide and improved position
late. MICHIGAN LEFT pressed the early pace between foes, stalked the pace in the three path and faded in the stretch. MAMA'S BOY and WARING
bumped with each other at the start, stalked the early pace and faded in the stretch.
