Footnotes
SUDDEN SHIFT bore in bumping APACHE at the start, went up to duel for the lead two wide after a quarter, matched strides into the stretch, inherited the
lead in the final yards as the leader suffered an injury and drew clear under strong handling. MURTAGH dueled with the winner along the inside into the
stretch, opened a length advantage before the furlong marker, suffered an injury nearing the wire, held on for second and was vanned off. AMERICAN
NIGHTMARE stalked the pace and finished evenly in the five path. HAD RIGHT failed to menace. FRANCO was no factor. VENETIAN DREAM had good
early speed and was through after a half. APACHE was bumped at the start and never threatened. SHELL FIRE trailed, suffered an injury at the half mile
marker, pulled up and was vanned off.

early, found his best stride late along the inside then two wide. GRETCHENS MANE MAN was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch,
shook clear before the furlong marker then was outfinished in the final stages. MISTER ZAZU broke inward bumping GRETCHENS MANE MAN at the start,
prompted the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened late. AQUAVIT had brief speed. DRILL'S BOY stumbled at the start and was no factor. This

MOBIL MISSION never far back, moved up steadily three then two wide to make the lead in upper stretch and finished full of run in the four path to win
going away. WEEKEND RETREAT unhurried early, rallied in the six path through the stretch and finished clear for second. BUMPKIN drifted in bumping
PLUM TUFF a few strides out of the gate, set the pace along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. SWAYBACK MOBIL slow early, passed tiring
rivals outside. STRIKING LAD was no factor. PLUM TUFF was bumped and stumbled shortly after the start, chased the pace two wide and gave way in the
stretch. ITSMYLUCKYCOYNE chased the pace three wide into the stretch then tired. VERNON'S BEST was always outrun. EL CHAPIADOR was no threat.
TURKODANCER showed little. EQUITY CAT was through after a half.

Footnotes
CENTSOFWANDER prompted the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch
under right handed urging to win as much the best. DISCLOSURE never far back, rallied through deep stretch four wide and got up for second. MR CLINE
lugged in bumping R CARDINAL PRINCE at the start, saved ground dug in late two wide and missed second. AULD LANGE SYNE stalked the early pace,
loomed boldly three wide into the far turn, kept on into the stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. R CARDINAL PRINCE was bumped at the start
and failed to menace. NAPA DUDE was no threat. NO ANGEL away alertly, set a slow pace along the rail for four and one half furlongs, steadied a bit
entering the far turn, kept on until upper stretch then flattened out.

upper stretch and finished determinedly. SIOFRA away alertly, set the pace along the rail until mid stretch then weakened. COMPLEXITY GIRL veered out

loomed boldly nearing the furlong marker and finished second best along the rail. INCESSANT offered a mild bid three wide in upper stretch then leveled
off. BLAZING ZENNA allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the three path. LA REINA DEL NORTE broke slowly and was no threat. SWEET
BELEN chased the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. J P'S GLADYS had brief speed. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and

Footnotes
MIESHA never far back, closed willingly three wide in hand through the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then drew off and won easily.
WORK'N ON A BUZZ allowed to settle, moved up steadily outside rivals to make the lead midway on the far turn then was no match for the winner. STICK
AROUND unhurried early, finished best of the rest outside. LADY ITCH was no threat. SHE'S A SOLDIER pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse
turn, made the lead at the half mile marker, set the pace until midway on the far turn then came up empty. WINDY VALLEY sprinted to a clear lead soon
after the start, set the pace along the inside for a half then folded.
