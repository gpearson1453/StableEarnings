Footnotes
BUTTERFLY QUEEN bobbled after the break, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied farthest outside,
closed willingly in deep stretch and was best late. BAZZARINA raced off the pace between rivals throughout, waited for room, rallied in the two path in upper
stretch and finished well inside in the final furlong. PINK ROSE stalked two or three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied between rivals in the final
furlong and got the nod for third. LISA'S PALACE set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, shook free again in upper stretch, then drifted out while
weakening and just missed for the show spot. WHAT'S GOOD tracked on the inside, then chased inside on the far turn, made a mild bid and was outkicked.
ARMONIA raced three or four wide off the pace, four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SPUNFORFUN raced two wide
off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. THUNDARA pulled early while racing three wide, then stalked two wide, chased on the far
turn and faded. FANCY SCEPTER raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
