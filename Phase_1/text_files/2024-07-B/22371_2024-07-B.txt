Footnotes
PROUD STARLET vied for the lead inside a trio of rivals holding a slim advantage, cleared at the three-eighths pole and drew away under hand urging
around the bend, padded the lead further in upper stretch, asked right handed in the final furlong and remained well clear to the wire. USHA was a bit
fractious in the gate and had to be remounted, went up to vie for the lead three deep between rivals, chased after PROUD STARLET past three-eighths pole
three then two wide on the turn, shifted in when switching leads past the eighth pole and kept on to best the rest. THOUGHT PROCESS vied four deep to
the turn, chased the winner four then three wide around the bend, flattened in the late stages and got outkicked for the place. NATIVE CHARMER chased
along the rail into the turn, tipped out approaching the quarter pole and weakened when called upon. WHAT ABOUT Q tracked from outside then moved
into the three path nearing the turn, came four wide into the lane and also weakened. MCKECHNIE fought between rivals on the front-end, lost contact with
the leader at the three-eighths pole, moved over to the inside around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
WITHOUT BORDERS showed early speed then ceded command while remaining up close to the outside of the top pair early, took aim three wide into the
stretch, dueled into the final furlong and drove clear in deep stretch. QUEEN'S CODE vied for the lead with outer rivals then dueled along the rail leaving the
backstretch, gained a clear lead around the bend, pressured by WITHOUT BORDERS in upper stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth.
PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) coaxed along in range early, moved inside for the turn, cornered nicely into the lane, followed the top pair with striking distance
through the final furlong but went evenly late for third. BEER MONEY bothered by QUEEN'S CODE soon after the start, traveled along the inside towards
the back, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. COACH CRONIN laid off the pace and moved inside, tipped three wide leaving the bend,
lugged in at the eighth pole and could not threaten. PASS THE BATON bumped back at the start, trailed on the fence into the turn, angled outside a pair of
rivals on the turn, lugged in upper to midstretch and failed to menace. DEFENSOR FORTIS brushed leaving the gate, raced near the back outside a rival
into the turn, remained two wide to the stretch and lacked the needed response. JOURNEY D' ORO vied between rivals then dueled two wide leaving the
bend, failed to keep pace with the leader around the bend and weakened down the lane. DANCE MAN tracked off the the leaders off the rail, rounded the
bend three then four wide and also weakened.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPRESS tracked the top pair from off the rail, rounded the bend three then four wide, rallied and reeled in the runner-up past the sixteenth pole
and won going away. GYPSY LYNN stepped to the front and showed the way with WHY BEHAVE alongside, disposed of that rival at the five-sixteenths
pole, opened up into the stretch, held a rapidly diminishing lead into the final sixteenth and yielded to the winner. AWESOME TAYLOR sat well off the pace
up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then tipped back out approaching the stretch, offered a mild response when
called upon and edged SWEET LAYLA RAE for third. SWEET LAYLA RAE chased from off the pace, took the turn two wide and got outkicked for the show
honors. KEEP YOUR COIL hard to load behind the gate, chased from inside out of range, drifted out to the four path past the quarter pole and failed to
menace. WHY BEHAVE pressed from outside, chased two then three wide past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the drive. MORNING ADDICTION
threw her head and was off very slow, ridden along briefly then took hold approaching the five-eighths pole, eased into and around the bend, pulled up into
the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SHOW OF FORCE grabbed the early lead from the rail, took pressure at the midway point, shook free on the far turn, cornered nicely into the lane, held a
comfortable lead to the sixteenth pole, grew weary late but was able to hold. SABERTOOTH settled early three wide then moved over to the rail, ran up on
heels at the half-mile pole, tipped two wide on the second bend, moved back inside at the top of the lane, came off the fence in the final furlong, closed in
fast but was too late. GAME WARRIOR sat off the pace in the two path, drew closer outside rivals in the middle stages, rounded the four turn four then three
deep, could not summon the needed rally but churned on to hold third. LEGITIMATE gave chase in the two path early, between rivals on the backstretch
and far turn, ran into traffic late on the bend, kept on trying once gaining a clear path but could not threaten. CANYAHEARMEKNOCKIN away quickly and
was forwardly placed in the two path into the first turn, applied pressure from outside at the halfway point, lost touch with the leader at the five-sixteenths
pole, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and faded. FREEDOM OF SPEECH off slow and lacked early speed, moved to the inside, trailed up the
backstretch, made some progress inside to two wide and improve position in the lane. BRUMMELL settled inside then tipped out to the three path around
the clubhouse turn, raced outside rivals early on the backstretch, coaxed along at the half-mile pole, went two, three, then four wide on the far turn and could
not make an impact. FLYIN PRIVATE stalked the pace from inside, lost ground on the far turn along the fence and tired. CARDINAL SPIRIT raced up close
outside the top pair into the first turn, stalked outside rivals up the backstretch, got crowded between rivals midway around the bend and dropped back, then
tired in the lane. MUSCLED dwelt when the gates opened, trailed two wide into the clubhouse turn then passed a rival into the backstretch, drew a bit closer
in the middle stages, stayed off the rail and came three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
PRETTY CECY chased in range under coaxing, rounded the bend in the four path, drew alongside the top pair past the eighth pole, dueled late and got up
in the closing moments. RAPIDA pressed from outside, lost touch briefly leaving the backstretch, latched onto the leader again around the bend, chased
behind that rival three wide into the lane, challenged once more at the eighth pole, took over approaching deep stretch but got edged by the winner nearing
the wire. CLOUDY WOMEN broke out a bit then went up to take control, pressured by RAPIDA up the backstretch, inched ahead nearing the turn,
pressured again by RAPIDA around the bend, cleared into the stretch, confronted by RAPIDA again at the eighth pole, fought into the last sixteenth and
yielded to the top pair. READY TO DARE tracked outside rivals then stayed out wide to the turn, navigated the bend in the five path and could not rally when
called upon. WALK'N THE BEACH away quickly then chased off the rail, lost ground when she began to climb from the kickback, dropped back three wide
around the turn and had little left for the drive. EMPRESS LORRAYNE hopped at the start, trailed early then went between rivals past the half-mile pole,
traveled two wide then angled out to the five path around the bend and was never a factor. LUCKY NEA hustled from the gate, raced up close then began to
climb early, saved ground through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CONNIE SWINGLE stalked the pacesetter inside STAY AND SCAM into the turn, got bumped and hit the rail early on the bend, saved ground to the stretch,
moved out and brushed STAY AND SCAM at the top of the stretch, drew alongside ELM DRIVE with a furlong remaining, drove clear into the final sixteenth
and remained strong to the wire. ELM DRIVE coaxed from the gate then got put in tight between rivals early, ridden cautiously behind
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ, saved ground through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and rallied for second. STAY AND SCAM broke well and steered over
to stalk outside CONNIE SWINGLE, bumped that rival early on the turn, continued two wide to the stretch, was brushed by CONNIE SWINGLE moving out
at the top of the stretch, could not summoned the needed late kick in the furlong ground but kept on to regain the show honors. ITZEL sped clear to show
the way early, set all the pace from inside to the lane, given her cue in upper stretch, yielded to the winner midstretch and flattened to fourth. EVER SMART
traveled outside a rival towards the back, raced two wide then moved to the rail around the bend, steered out in the drive and failed to threaten. ANTIFONA
(FR) trailed early on the inside, moved out to pass a rival on the turn, found the rail again and was not a factor. RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ got floated in by
STAY AND SCAM and checked at the half-mile pole, rounded the bend in the two path and weakened in the lane. ANTIQUE SILVER antsy in the gate,
raced towards the back and moved inside early, fell back to last on the turn and could not make an impact. THE RIDER ABOARD
RUNNINGWITHTHEBOYZ CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST STAY AND SCAM FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EARLY IN THE RACE. FOLLOWING A
REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DR. VENKMAN came away well then ceded command to ARABIAN KNIGHT, closest in pursuit from the two early, challenged from outside at the half-mile
pole, dueled and took over on the far turn, put away inner rival entering the lane, continued clear to midstretch, jumped slightly over the tracks at the
sixteenth pole and was able to keep the runner-up at bay. KATONAH stalked the speed from the rail, lost ground into the far turn, drew closer while easing
over to the two path late on the bend, took aim from outside entering the final furlong, finished willingly but had to settle for second best. EXPRESS TRAIN
trailed three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, continued at the back in the middle stages keeping off the rail, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, drifted
four wide into the lane, chased within range at the eight pole but flattened in the late stages. ARABIAN KNIGHT coaxed from the gate, cleared DR.
VENKMAN and moved inside to set the tone early, took pressure from said rival at the half-mile pole, dueled from inside on the far turn and relinquished the
lead, lost touch with the winner into the lane and weakened. NEWGRANGE coaxed from the gate then settled in the three path, moved into range on the
backstretch, dropped back three then four wide on the far turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
HALFWAY LINE (GB) traveled in mid-pack along the inside, raced between foes and got bumped into the far turn, moved back to the rail and followed the
leader into the stretch, tipped out and challenged with a furlong remaining, kicked clear from inner rival and won going away. SMART CODE dueled inside a
rival into the first turn then cleared around the bend, took pressure leaving the backstretch, cleared again at the quarter pole, challenged HALFWAY LINE
(GB) at the eight pole, yielded midstretch and stayed on to hold second. FAUSTIN coaxed from the gate, dueled from outside briefly then stalked two wide
around the clubhouse turn, bid form outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the leader past the quarter pole, kept trying down the lane and held the
show. HOTROCKET (IRE) raced near the back early on then trailed inside a rival, angled out leaving the far turn, steered back to the inside in the lane and
missed third. LOTTERY PICK sat off the pace through the earl going, angled out on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and offered a mild response
when asked. OTTOMAN PRINCE (IRE) reserved in the two path, chased three deep between rivals and bumped entering the far turn, eased out and came
five wide into the lane and could not rally. BAD UNCLE BARRY stalked in the three path then moved to the two path around the first turn, ridden along three
deep on the second bend and weakened in the drive. ZIO JO broke well, took up early, steadied between in tight on the first turn, bumped between rivals
and steadied into the far turn, ridden two wide into the lane and failed to menace. FLY THE SKY false broke to come away last, trailed two wide early then
went outside a rival, steered out and exited the far turn in the five path and was never a factor. EYE ON RY chased four deep around both turns and
weakened. MONGOLIAN ALTAI stalked along the inside, pushed on through the far turn while continuing to save ground and tired in the lane. GIOVINAZZO
chased outside a pair of rivals and checked early on the first turn, raced mid-pack three then four deep in the middle stages, came six wide into the lane and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON brushed outer rival leaving the gate, vied four deep up the backstretch, took over three deep around the bend, put away inner rivals at
the top of the stretch and edged away under mild urging and flagging of a right handed crop. CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR fought three deep for the lead up
the backstretch, battled between foes in the two path around the turn, could not go on with THE CHOSEN VRON at the top of the lane and stayed on to hold
second. JACKSTOWN brushed by THE CHOSEN VRON to lose a step at the start, stalked the top quartet well off the rail, went five wide into the turn,
driven four wide into the lane, chased within striking distance through the final furlong but lacked a late bid. SEE THROUGH IT vied between rivals to the
turn, got put in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole and had to idle briefly, ridden along chasing the top trio two to three wide to the stretch, moved out
midstretch and churned on for a minor award. ANARCHIST vied inside a trio of rivals up the backstretch, fought along the rail to the top of the stretch and
weakened. HAPPY JACK raced at the back off the inside, took the turn four to five wide and could not rally when called upon. GIANT GAME chased three
wide into the turn, trailed five wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
BALTIC FIRE rated from inside, coaxed along on the far turn continuing to save ground, moved out in upper stretch, reeled in the winner under hand urging
and edged past late. SHE'Z THE LAW dueled from outside briefly then cleared and moved to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch and far turn,
given her cue entering the lane, urged right handed past the eighth pole, led clear into the final sixteenth but could not fend off the winner. THEA tucked
inside and became rank on the clubhouse turn, chased inside a pair of rivals in the middle stages, hugged the rail through the far turn, put to right handed
urging in the lane and finished well near the fence for a game third. REHEARSAL (IRE) fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow and brushed with inner rival,
reserved in the two path then between rivals, ran up on heels at the three-eighths pole, angled four wide, tipped out further in the lane, finished well and got
outclosed for third. SPANISH CARA (IRE) off slow from outside, traveled two wide ten outside a rival on the first turn at the back, went three wide into the far
turn, swung five wide turning for home, summoned a mild rally but got outkicked in deep stretch. WILLA T broke through the gate and was reloaded, stalked
two then three wide between rivals, followed those same paths taking aim around the far turn, chased within range through the drive but finished evenly late.
QUEEN BERKELEY settled along the rail near the back, trailed into the stretch and produced a mild rally. ASHLEY fractious in the gate, dueled from inside
then ceded command to the SHE'Z THE LAW, rated in the two path then raced keenly tugging the rider closer to the pacesetter, moved inside in the middle
stages, tipped two wide leaving the far turn and faltered in the final furlong. BOTTLE ROCKET (FR) broke a bit slow, unhurried on the inside, raced outside
a rival into the far turn, driven two wide into the stretch, moved out and failed to threaten. STEP IT OUT (IRE) broke a bit slow and brushed with outer rival,
pulled two wide on the first turn, stalked between up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two to three wide, looked to show late effort but lacked room
behind ASHLEY in deep stretch and could not regain momentum. MISS MANDALAY (GB) broke a bit slow, raced two to three wide in hand off the pace,
mid-pack three deep leaving the backstretch, made progress three to four wide on the far turn and flattened out in the late stages. BLUE FASHION popped
the gate opened, stalked three then four deep around the first turn, moved up close from outside in the middle stages, chased two wide around the far turn
and faded down the lane.
