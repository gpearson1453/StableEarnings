through the final furlong and just missed at the end. SHAKIN THE BELLE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, dug in under late threat and was nailed by a pair on the
wire. HOURS IN A DAY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. BEACH BLANKET coaxed from the start, showed the way along the inside early on before being displaced by COWBOY LUKE
inside the five furlong marker, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid but was outkicked. COWBOY LUKE bobbled and was bumped at the start by CONNIVING and in turn brushed PICCATA PRINCE, chased along

and came under threat to the outside, dug in and was collared near the sixteenth pole, weakened in the late stages. PICCATA PRINCE got brushed at the

Footnotes
TWO JAY'S WAY was sent hard from the gate then well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the
five-sixteenths pole, made a bid in the three path at the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and
prevailed under strong urging. JANSSEN bumped with a rival at the start, dropped from the five path to the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on
the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, made a bid in the four path at the quarter-pole, fought outside of the winner to the finish and missed
while well clear for the place. JAKE'S ORCHARD dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, took
the advantage leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was headed in the two path near the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened while able to hold the show. IRIE MAN went around the first turn in the four path, settled on the outside, rallied four wide on the far turn, made a
bid near the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the stretch in the five path, dropped back outside the furlong marker and tired. STANLEY ROUGH was bumped
on both sides at the start, dropped in on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged while inside to the three path on the far turn, moved out near the furlong
marker and failed to threaten. TRIPLE WORD SCORE was urged along in the two path on the first turn, settled under some urging, dropped from the two
path to the rail late on the far turn, swung out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BARRON'S BOUNCE dropped from the three path to the
two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged in the three path for most of the far turn then shifted to the five path, turned into the stretch in the
six path and was no factor. CAN'T STAND DISCO moved from the four path to the two path while going to the front on the first turn, showed the way on the
outside of a foe, lost the advantage leaving the backstretch, dropped back in the two then three path on the far turn and retreated. FOUR EYES broke out
and bumped with a foe, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled towards the back, was urged along in the five path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SPINNING COLORS raced in the three then two path on the first turn, stalked the pace under a snug hold, made a bid outside of the pacesetter near the
seven-sixteenths pole, vied two wide on the far turn, took the advantage while asked for her best in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and
proved best under steady handling. CAN'T FOOL ME traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was unhurried near the rear, moved from the two
path to the five path while getting closer on the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and improved to get the place. MUNNY GRAB dropped back
after the start, tossed his head under tight restraint nearing the first turn, saved ground while reserved at the back, moved closer on the far turn, shifted to
the two path late on that bend, was roused four wide into the stretch then angled out, passed the furlong marker between foes and finished with good
energy to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. IM JUST KIDDIN went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, traveled
around the far turn in the two then three path while let out, swung into the stretch in the five path, chased between horses into the final furlong and lacked
the needed kick then just missed the trifecta. OVERACTING was hard held between foes in the three path on the first turn, raced off the pace under tight
restraint, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. SPOOKY LADY went to the front,
dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, vied inside of the winner while along the rail on the far turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. BERNT AGAIN settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn,
moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. SNOWY EVENING raced. LADY OF THOROTON raced in the five to six path on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was asked in the five path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the six path and failed to respond. AUTUMN GLORY lugged
out from the four to six path on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, came up empty in the five path into the far turn and faltered then was
eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SPIRIT WIND bobbled at the break and broke forward despite it, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside,
tucked closer to the rail through the turn to shut down a lane to the inside while leaving a tight seam, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got placed to
a light drive near the eighth pole and came under an intermittent left handed crop while gamely holding safe to the finish. ACCEDE chased along the inside
and then just off the inside patiently handled until roused angled four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a bid to threaten inside
the final sixteenth but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish. CLEARLY UNHINGED chased along the inside, swung three wide into upper stretch on hold and
very patiently handled until set down just outside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive running on willingly to the finish while along for the show honors.
MUNNYS GOLD eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch in the early going showing the way briefly, crossed inside to the three path with
nine-sixteenths to run, chased three to four wide through the turn in closest aim of the leader on hold until let out spinning four to five wide into upper stretch,
then weakened in the late stages. STERLING SILVER three wide in pursuit, got set down angled out six wide at the top of the stretch, made no late
headway.

powered clear under steady handling. BOURBON DAY saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn,
swung out into upper stretch then moved further out, rallied in the final furlong and finished with good energy to get up for the place. MAXWELL ESQUIRE
went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole
then came under a drive, lost the advantage to the winner at the furlong marker and weakened then was caught for the place while just able to save the
show. AMERICAN DIAMOND settled while inside to the two path, was asked on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved out, pursued the
leaders under a drive into the final furlong, raced between horses into the final sixteenth and just missed the trifecta. BAY STREET MONEY was hustled
from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was roused in the three path on the final turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to rally. STREET READY was hustled from the gate then became eager when taken in hand early, raced in the three path while tossing
his head rankly on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, gained in the four path on the turn, chased under a
drive into the final furlong and tired. LANDBISCUIT broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked in the three
path on the far turn, gained to make a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and also

Footnotes
TONGUE TWISTER got pinched between foes and forced to steady at the start under the wire the first time, settled along the inside near the rear of the
field, tipped to the two path near the seven-sixteenths and advanced through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and then tipped out an additional path straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth and took command a
sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. QUITE CONTINENTAL coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes and had LU'S REDEMPTION coming inwards and
was bumped into SAVING MEMORIES a furlong out, then ran on to secure the place honors on the wire. LU'S REDEMPTION settled tracking the front from
just off the inside and just off the pace, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command coming inwards and bumping the aforementioned foe at the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared between rivals a sixteenth out, then
got bested on the wire for the place honors while clear for the show. SAVING MEMORIES four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, dug in under threat and was
collared and then bumped at the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS got squeezed and forced to steady at the start
when rivals put the squeeze on her and TONGUE TWISTER, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out five wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. HOLDER CLOSE chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, offered no response. WAR TERMINATRIX bobbled at the break, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got headed straightened away and weakened. ADULT ENTERTAINER coaxed from the
gate, was off heels of a rival early on along the inside, chased inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. ROOKIE LEAGUE chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and tired. ALOTTA JAYS three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing three
furlongs out, cornered from the two path into upper stretch and tired.
