Footnotes
REINA ISAMAR broke sharply, took command early and increased the margin under a mild hand ride. SHESA VALIANT MISS broke well, maintained
position then drifted from the outside to the rail in the final furlong holding second while no match for the winner. LUNA SPECIAL broke a beat slow, finished
well. A BANDIDO CHOICE was a bit slow into stride and was outrun. DASH VAL BAY fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly, losing all chance and was no
factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC CHROME lunged at the break and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, tracked the decent pace heading
to the half-mile marker, was steered outside of rivals and loomed four wide nearing the quarter marker, roused five wide into the stretch, vied for the lead at
the furlong pole, took command at mid-stretch, shook free from the runner-up and drew away under hand urging in deep stretch. GREATFUL ATTITUDE
rated nicely away from the start, was well placed in the early going and stalked the decent pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, pressed
the pace three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled for the lead with MAGIC CHROME into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was second best. UNION COACH prominent away from the start, engaged with LUNA LINDA in the early going and pressed that rival through
solid fractions heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace between rivals into the turn, battled into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker,
weakened in the drive and was clear in the end for third. LUNA LINDA sent to establish the early lead, set a solid pace from the inside, was pressed to the
quarter marker, overtaken into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and faltered. HOT BETTY showed brief early speed, saved ground
into the turn and lacked a response in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
BLAZING PEME showed good speed from the break without being pushed, was well handled on the lead through the turn despite pressure from LURKING
FEAR to the outside, responded when set down at the top of the stretch and held clear to the wire. ELEGANT BOY broke a beat slowly but was hustled
forward into contention, tracked behind the dueling leaders down the backstretch, looked to make an early move on the turn but had to wait for room at the
five-sixteenths marker, got clear run passing the three sixteenths pole, finished well but could not reel in the winner while finishing well clear of the next
horse. I AM AMADEO raced on the outside of the trio tracking the dueling leaders, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide into the
stretch and finished with good interest under strong handling. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM was a little slow into stride but got into a good rhythm and raced close
up between horses in the tracking group, became boxed in on the turn then struggled to keep up with the rest turning for home, came back on a bit under
steady urging and gained a placing near the finish. LURKING FEAR broke well and was a constant shadow to the outside of BLAZING PEME to the turn,
gave way at the quarter pole and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. SHAMROCK GHOST broke slowly, was always outrun and never a factor. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SMILIN RUBY broke out a bit and bothered a neighboring rival at the start, was a bit keen in the early going and tracked the pace from the outside
approaching the half-mile, stalked the moderate pace three wide into the turn, took command while in hand leaving the quarter pole, drew clear at the
furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and pulled away in the late stages to be much the best. AZUCAR CANELA broke out leaving the start
then was squeezed between rivals and was off slowly, allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, raced widest into the turn and gained ground
four wide nearing the quarter marker, a bit green into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive but stayed on into the final sixteenth and
was second best. VALERIE prominent away from the start, chased the moderate early pace from the inside, maintained a rail position into the turn and
pressed the pace heading to the quarter marker, outrun into the stretch, could not impact the top pair in the drive and held safely for third at the finish. R
MARILYN LONHRO allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, angled widest into upper stretch and could not muster a response in
the stretch drive. BRONZE'S FLOWER hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the
way while off of the rail entering the turn and carved out moderate fractions while pressed to the quarter pole, overtaken into the stretch, chased SMILIN
RUBY to the furlong grounds then gave way in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
DESERT RUMBLE broke well and was contending for the lead heading into the first bend, ceded the lead and was content to track just behind the leaders,
tracked between horses to the far turn, launched a.bid with three furlongs to run, took command in upper stretch and won clear. RIVER MARKET bobbled at
the start but recovered quickly then dueled CLASSY through moderate fractions to the far turn, opened up on the field passing the three furlong marker,
came into the stretch with the lead but had DESERT RUMBLE contesting the issue on the outside, could not go with that rival but held on for second with
open lengths back to the third horse. ACHROMATIC was last away and trailed the field through the early stages while not too far back, started a sustained
rally for the five furlong marker, gained some ground through the turn then flattened out in the stretch, finished one-paced but outlasted the rest to gain third.
CLASSY hustled for the lead the dueled with RIVER MARKET through moderate fractions, then was unable to go on when that foe quickened passing the
three furlong pole, came under a stiff drive and had little to offer in the stretch. HANG ON was close up for a half-mile then quickly dropped far behind the
field, came under a ride and was no factor form that point. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
CONEJO MALO broke alertly and vied for the lead away from the start, engaged with SIX HOT GRANDS and contested the early pace inside of that rival
heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, battled with SIX HOT GRANDS into upper stretch and held
that foe at bay nearing the furlong marker, determinedly dug in past mid-stretch, was kept to steady urging into the final sixteenth and held in deep stretch
for a game win. SIX HOT GRANDS broke out at the start but was away in good order and vied for the lead away from the gate, contested the early pace
outside of CONEJO MALO and took a narrow lead heading to the half-mile, dueled into the turn and disputed a moderate pace approaching the quarter
pole, battled CONEJO MALO into the stretch, fought gamely into the final furlong while on the left lead, was held at bay in deep stretch and was a clear
second. KLIMT A. P. forwardly placed away from the start, took back and tracked the decent early pace from the outside, mounted a three wide bid on the
turn, chased the leading pair into the stretch, could not impact the top two in the drive and stayed on to be a clear third. FRANK THE CAT broke in at the
start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and settled while not far back in the early stages, raced two to three wide into the turn and improved position at the
quarter pole, continued his advance into the stretch, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. BEAR ENCOUNTER broke a step
slowly away from the start, allowed to settle in the early going, guided three wide into the turn, slipped to the inside into upper stretch and did not offer a late
rally. TRIBAL STAR rushed up to contest the early pace, pressed the leading pair from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn
and lost position nearing the quarter pole, lacked a response into the stretch and gave way. THIRSTY LOV forwardly placed away from the start, raced
close up to the early pace then got caught a bit in tight nearing the half-mile marker, took back and was guided outside of rivals into the turn, chased three to
four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and dropped back. ALIBI TERHUNE broke awkwardly leaving the start and
spotted the field to begin, lacked early speed, trailed into the turn and did not factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
