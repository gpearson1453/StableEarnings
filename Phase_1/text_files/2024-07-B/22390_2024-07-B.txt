Footnotes
TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE threw his head leaving the start and was slow to begin, unhurried in the early stages, gained ground at the half-mile marker, loomed
along the inside at the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, widened the lead into the final sixteenth and won
as much the best in the first career win for the jockey. MAMARANDO settled along the outside entering the first turn, maintained an outside path through the
backstretch run and advanced three to four wide into the far turn, went widest into the stretch, drifted in past the furlong marker, was no match for the winner
in the final sixteenth and got up for the place honors in the final strides. DADDY'S HONEY sent leaving the start, showed the way into the first turn then
ceded the lead to INTRUSIVE and stalked that rival through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, assumed command into the far turn, was
confronted by TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE at the quarter marker, could not match strides with that foe into the stretch, weakened in the drive and just missed for
second. JUNIORS KITTY allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run, was taken outside of rivals into
the far turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker. PRINCESS LUC was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the pace two to
three wide into the first turn, was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, lacked a response in the stretch drive and
gave way. INTRUSIVE stalked the early pace outside of DADDY'S HONEY, gained command into the backstretch run and set a moderate pace
approaching the half-mile marker, was overtaken into the second turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and came up empty in the late stages. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT was allowed to settle and tracked three wide in the third spot not far from the pacesetter while traveling very well, cruised up to challenge
NIGHT PROOF for the lead passing the quarter pole, was set down at the head of the stretch with that rival battling back on the inside, gained the
advantage with a furlong to go and edged clear. NIGHT PROOF came away well and got a good position early, tracked just behind OH GREAT (IRE)
through the early stages, took over the lead passing the five-sixteenths pole and was challenged to the outside by SUNNY SPOT, responded to strong
handling in upper stretch and held even then weakened near the furlong marker but was able to hold second. COOPERKLIMT raced mid-pack through most
of the race, launched a bid from the three furlong pole under heavy pressure, was slowly gaining ground on the leaders through the stretch run despite
racing on the left lead but was not quite good enough. OH GREAT (IRE) was hustled to the front and allowed a fairly uncontested lead through the first half
mile, tried to slip away heading into the turn but was taken on by NIGHT PROOF, gave way passing the five-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. PLAYBOY
STYLE lacked speed, went three wide through the first turn the stayed out in the four path down the backstretch being pushed on a little to keep contact with
the field, got into striking position heading into the far turn then attempted to rally under a stiff drive from the seven-sixteenths pole as the pace of the race
quickened, came into the stretch four wide and had trouble changing leads, lost momentum and beat just one to the wire. WALKING BOSS was not asked
for speed from the gate and trailed the field through the first turn, got closer on the backstretch run then struggled to keep up as the pace quickened with
three furlongs to go, and was unable to improve. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
CODE RIBBON rated nicely off of the moderate early pace, raced widest into the turn and gained ground while four to five wide nearing the quarter marker,
circled the field into the stretch and was full of run at the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, surged in
deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a determined win. TESSA (GB) stalked the moderate early pace from the outside, was guided three to four
wide into the turn and loomed at the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled A ROUSING BABE nearing the furlong grounds, fought
gamely past mid-stretch, matched strides with CODE RIBBON into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for second. A ROUSING BABE
sent between rivals leaving the start, assumed a narrow early lead and set a contested pace heading to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and
carved out moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, met the bid of TESSA into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, fought gamely into the
final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding safely in the end for third. LADY'S SERMON sent leaving the start, went up and contested
the moderate early pace outside of A ROUSING BABE, chased the pacesetter two to three wide into the turn, ran within aim into the stretch, chased into the
final sixteenth and lacked a late response. MO TOWN GAL was squeezed at the start and broke a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace while not far back,
saved ground into the turn and mounted an inside rally into the stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. MORO
FIRST CLASS took back off of the moderate early pace, was guided outside of an inner rival into the turn, could not muster a response in the stretch and did
not factor. THE GREAT HAYNES tracked the moderate pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ANN LOVES MARK seized the early lead with MAXWELL ST BLUES in close pursuit, opened up a clear advantage going into the turn then had to fend off
a challenge by that rival passing the five-sixteenths pole, went clear again in the stretch and held off a fast closing HARNEY LANE coming on the outside.
HARNEY LANE broke well then was content to track the leading pair through the early stages, responded when set down with three furlongs to run, came
three wide at the top of the stretch and finished willingly but came up short. MAXWELL ST BLUES stalked ANN LOVES MARK through solid fractions, made
a run at that one near the five-sixteenths marker but was rebuffed, kept on down the stretch but was passed late for the place. CARSON JEN broke outward
at the start and lost some ground having to correct, raced close up to the turn then made a mild bid on the inside through the turn but came up empty in the
stretch run. DANCING NURSE broke outward, fell behind early while lugging out, raced wide through the turn, continued to lug out on last bend and was
eased in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ALPINE SERMON was squeezed at the start and broke a step slowly, recovered and tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, raced between rivals
into the turn then came in tight and was boxed in at the quarter marker, found an opening into upper stretch and rallied nearing the furlong marker, closed
determinedly along the rail into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and held well in the final strides for a good win. REGAL REDWOOD
prominent leaving the start, stalked the moderate early pace from the outside, chased between rivals into the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch and
battled WINTER SOLDIER heading to the furlong pole, fought gamely while between rivals into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and held
for second at the wire. WINTER SOLDIER allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the moderate early pace from between rivals, was guided outside of
rivals entering the turn and loomed three to four wide at the quarter marker, mounted a four to five wide rally into the stretch and vied for the lead at the
furlong marker, stubbornly battled while on the left lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for
third. CARDINAL TRICK sent leaving the start, assumed early command then ceded the lead to ROJO PEQUENO, stalked the pace from the inside then
lost position along the turn, angled four to five wide into the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. AUTISM INCLUSION chased the moderate early
pace from the outside, was well placed approaching the turn and gained ground three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain that run into
the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ROJO PEQUENO forwardly placed leaving the start, rushed up to gain early command and set the pace
heading to the half-mile marker, cleared to the rail and opened the lead entering the turn, set a moderate pace approaching the quarter pole, was overtaken
leaving the turn and faded in the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
UNION HARBOR tracked close up in the two path just behind the leaders, bided time through the turn when boxed in to the stretch, tipped out to the three
path for clear run in the stretch, produced a strong rally under steady handling and intermittent urging, gradually wore down CHANNEL OF LOVE and
TOM'S TREASURE inside the sixteenth and was up in the final yards. CHANNEL OF LOVE won the scramble for the early lead then allowed PARTHENA
to take over after passing the five furlong pole, got back on even terms near the three furlong marker, dueled that foe to the head of the stretch, took the
lead from the three-sixteenths, battled gamely on the inside of three contesting the final outcome, was headed by TOM'S TREASURE in the late stages but
came back on with good courage under strong handling to gain second in a game effort. TOM'S TREASURE was reluctant to load, broke well and raced
mid-pack three wide in close range of the early leaders, bid for the lead three wide passing the quarter pole, battled with CHANNEL OF LOVE in the stretch,
had a narrow advantage with a sixteenth to go but could not hold off UNION HARBOR to the outside and was out-gamed for second by a resurgent
CHANNEL OF LOVE on the inside. MOON RUSH broke last and trailed the field early despite the best efforts of the rider, was kept in a drive and made up
some ground racing three wide through the turn, loomed a threat in a four wide bid at the top of the stretch but had trouble changing leads and faded.
PARTHENA broke a step slow then rushed up to take the lead passing the five furlong marker, led the field through the turn then came under pressure
when CHANNEL OF LOVE made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole then had little to offer in the stretch run and tired. ADDY PEARL was close up for a
furlong, raced near the back of the field down the backstretch then began to back up approaching the seven-sixteenths pole and was not a factor from that
point. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER broke alertly and assumed early command, sped to a clear lead and set a decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, was well
handled while showing the way along the turn, drew off into the stretch and was kept to task into the final furlong, felt mild pressure from oncoming rivals
and held safely for the win in deep stretch. LITTLE LILIANA took back off of the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and mounted a four
wide bid at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth, was able to mildly pressure the winner in deep stretch and held
for second at the finish. A DIME FOR ME was crowded at the start and away slowly, settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and
chased the pacesetter heading to the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, finished well into the final
sixteenth and missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. TAKES A VILLAGE raced close up to the solid early pace, chased from the outside
approaching the turn, attended to the pace three wide into the bend, was outkicked into upper stretch and faded in the drive. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA broke
in at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, was hard sent in the early stages and chased the decent pace from the inside, was well placed approaching
the turn and chased the pace to the quarter marker, could not find a response in the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. MATCHLESS settled off of the
decent early pace, trailed approaching the turn, ran in pursuit three to four wide nearing the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch drive. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
