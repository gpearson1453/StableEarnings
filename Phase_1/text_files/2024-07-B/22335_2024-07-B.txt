Footnotes
BATON pressed the pace to the second turn, assumed command and drew clear in the drive under steady encouragement. SPECTRIER raced close to the
pace, saved ground to the far turn, angled out and closed steadily to finish second best. MINEOLA MIKE broke sharply, set the pace to the second turn,
weakened in the drive and held safely for show. BOLD MEDICATION stalked the pace to the second turn and flattened out. POLAR WIND raced close to
the pace towards the outside of the pack, tired into the turn and gave way. STARDUST ZIGGY saved ground, trailed the field and lacked a response. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MISCHIEFNESS advanced along the rail to the second turn, shifted out, closed willingly, wore down her rival and drew clear late. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT
settled off the pace, closed steadily and got up near the wire for place. MYA C set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, led to late stretch, was
unable to sustain her bid and was caught for second. AMERICAN PEACHES was unhurried early, bid along the rail entering the stretch, was within range
and hung late. TURBO MILLIE broke awkwardly, was void of early speed, bid off the rail, had little left and failed to threaten. RED RIVER SUSI was not a
factor. LITTLE NUTTER showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. SHORT OF DINERO showed speed to the second turn and tired. This race had
a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
POLTERER pressed the pace, assumed command into the turn and drew off in the drive under mild urging. TRUCULENT settled off the pace, raced off the
rail, angled out on the turn, bid six wide and earned place while no match for the winner. FLAT OUT FLYING was crowded at the start, moved up outside on
the backstretch to stalk the pace, bid willingly, came up empty late and just held for show. RON DON SCORESE saved ground to the second turn, shifted
out, offered a mild bid only and was outnodded for third. SOPHOS was transported off the track via an equine ambulance. SUNSET TOWN set the pace, fell
back into the turn, tired in the drive and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROUNDTOP stalked the pace along the inside, bid off the rail entering the stretch, closed steadily, assumed command late, inched clear and held while fully
extended. AMERICAN MEMORIES set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, inched clear, veered in at the gap, was headed and just lasted for
place. ZEVON raced close to the pace towards the outside, put in a steady bid, didn't have enough late and was outnodded for second in a game effort.
JUAN VALDEZ broke out, saved ground mid pack, bid along the rail on the turn and finished well. WE LIVE THIS GAME was crowded at the start, in tight
early, raced mid pack and lacked the needed late rally. SABI broke in, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and leveled off.
DRILLING FOR GOLD failed to menace in an even effort. CHANGING THE KARMA was not a factor. ROBAIRE was outrun and not urged late.

Footnotes
RAY'S GONE ASTRAY rated back off the speed into the turn, waited for his que nearing the quarter pole, eased out for clear running room in upper stretch,
accelerated quickly through the final sixteenth, and kicked clear under the wire. MORALES LITTLE KID vied between runners into the turn, advanced in the
two path around the bend, shook clear leaving the quarter pole, solo leader leaving the furlong marker, caught by outside rival in deep stretch, second best
on this day. STORM CAT EYES vied from the three path into and around the turn, under a drive in upper stretch, flattened out through the final furlong.
MINNY SPEIGHTSTER slow into stride, moved up between runners around the turn, running on his left lead came up empty through the stretch. THIRD
CITY chased the pace from the outside, bid four wide around the turn, weakened through the stretch. LILENGTHATCOULD tossed his head, and walked
out of the gate, under stout handling into the turn, never threatened. ART'S LAST DANCE vied inside into the turn, dueled around the bend, gave way
through the stretch.
