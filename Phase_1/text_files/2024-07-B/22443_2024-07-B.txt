Footnotes
JACKIE A unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off in the final yards. LORD OF
LEGENDS set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. WAPITI WAY well placed and
outside, lost some position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF
stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to head the leader through the turn, bid outside of that one into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share.
THE COOKIE MAN tracked the pace, gained position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded. DUDLEY was never
involved.

STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the final yards and lasted under steady pressure.
CASANOVA KITTEN unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place in
the final strides. CERTAIN well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain, then lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished for the place. HE'S A GOOD DANCER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, evened and gained a share. GENERAL WINSTON tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. WARRIOR'S CAUSE stalked the pace on the outside,
lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
BERNIN TUNE rated back outside early, moved up to gain a short lead into the second turn, then dueled with ATROCIOUS through the lane, holding the
advantage throughout. ATROCIOUS rated back from between rivals through the first turn, gained a striking position into the second turn, dueled with the
winner through the lane and could not gain the advantage, while clearly best of the rest. SECRET TREASURE tracked the pace, angled out through the
second turn to move up three and four wide, fanned widest into the stretch and closed for the show. MIDNIGHT COUNCIL unhurried, looped three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and passed tiring rivals for a share. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE stalked the pace from between, then
faded inside through the second turn. WISECRACK WARRIOR set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then faded the
final furlong. DERBY CHILD was never involved. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF ATROCIOUS AGAINST THE RIDER OF BERNIN
