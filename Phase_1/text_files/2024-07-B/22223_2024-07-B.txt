Footnotes
HE'S ALL EARS broke forwardly, pressed the issue early off the inside, advanced on the leader to duel through the turn, shook off that rival when
straightened for home, edged clear under steady handling. TEXAN FARMER last to leave to be away slowly, continued to lack speed early, moved out,
began to rally three wide midway on the turn, continued willingly to the wire to be in time for the place while getting to the winner in the final strides. MAGNA
PUNCH broke alertly, set a pressured pace up the backstretch inside, dueled through the turn with the winner, could not match that one in the drive, caught
late for the runner up spot. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE in the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. MR SEEKER lacked early foot out in the
strip, three to four wide turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. MAJOR PAYNE in mid pack early while racing outside, four to five
wide turn, tired through the stretch. HUSHED in the second flight early three wid3 and behind the two leaders, began a steady retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
SODDY DAISY dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate for the lead up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed turning for home and
pulled away under a single left handed crop. POLLY TIZ stalked the dueling leaders in the three path, set down for the drive late in the final turn, rallied to be
clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. EURA NORTHERN SKY broke on top, narrowly showed the way past the wire the first time, dueled up the
backstretch while remaining inside the winner, could not keep up with that one through the stretch, caught for the place. HEY ROXY fell back to trail after the
start, continued back in failing to mount a rally.

Footnotes
SPLITSECONDECISION broke back, unhurried into the first turn, began a steady advance soon after, ranged up outside the the leaders late in the final
turn, took over and kicked clear under steady handling. COIN PURSE bobbled at the start, recovered to move up and duel on the outside into and through
the first turn, pulled away from the other speed midway on the final bend while remaining in the two path, proved no match for the winner, remained clear for
the place. GOSPEL FREELY fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to lack speed, managed a belated rally to annex the show while getting to the
runner up late. SLICK CITY GIRL went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. GOSPEL FAITH broke on top, showed the way early, dueled
inside the runner up the middle part, fell back off that rival far turn, asked along, crept closer while continuing along the rail, attempted a rebid while in tight
quarters with a furlong to run, took up, lost action, bumped foe and fell quickly back. AZUSA STREET lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground in
the second turn, bumped with a faltering GOSPEL FAITH turning for home, also fell back to lose all chance. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE INCIDENT LATE IN THE FINAL TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
LENA'S SHADOW with the pace from the start inside, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, slipped away to a larger advantage into the stretch,
fully extended to keep the fellow pacesetter at bay in the late going. RIVER LIBERTY set or forced the pace in the two path, fell back off the other speed
turning for home but hung around stubbornly. COZZOLANI broke on top, fell back to race in the second fight, displayed some mild late interest to finish up
best of the rest, no real threat to the top two. EXCETERA raced n the second group, came up empty for the drive. BEHOLD THAT WORD dropped back
steadily after the start, continued to lack interest, crept a bit closer turning for home but lacked a further response to trail home through the lane.

KYEMBEA broke on top, dueled the opening five furlongs, edged clear far turn, responded when confronted by a pair of rivals turning for home, held the
runner up safe to the wire under firm handling. WRISTBAND unhurried in the early going, continued to lag up the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide late
in the final turn, failed to follow through with that threat through the lane to be outfinished, remained clear for the place. CLEARLY A JET forwardly placed
toward the inside, remained within striking distance up the backstretch, angled to bother WILD WING late in the final turn when moving closer to the top two,
steadied when in a bit tight between those two entering the stretch, fell back, remained well clear of the others. WILD WING behind the leaders while under
some encouragement early, moved closer to the winner after a half, saw that progress stall through the final turn, bothered when CLEARLY A JET angled
out with a furlong to run, continued evenly through the lane after recovering. HELLO MR COPELAND last away, trailed most of the way, lacked a serious
bid. DUANES SONNEY BOY dueled up front outside the winner early, gave way before a half, continued to fade and trailed home to be well beaten. A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF CLEARLY A JET AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE FINAL TURN
WAS NOT ALLOWED.

IMPUDENT forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, continued forward, went after the leader with just over a quarter remaining, took over, clear
far turn, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. DIAMOND GAL also prompted the pace early, moved with the winner to challenge
backstretch, could not match strides with that one in the run to the wire, clearly second best. HOLY AMA trailed early while between horses, moved a bit
closer in the run up the backstretch, bothered, steered out far turn, four wide into the lane, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. LADY
RASHEN went one paced throughout while saving ground, lacked closing punch. CAVIAR APPEAL off a strep slow, raced four wide through the first turn,
advanced to race closest to the winner into the far turn, weakened in the drive. GOSPEL EXTRA broke sharp, was clear past the wire the first time,
continued to show the way onto the backstretch, was giving way when headed into the far turn when steadied in some traffic, continued to back up to the
wire.

Footnotes
SPANISH HOMBRE alternated up front inside the winner, could not match that one the final three sixteenths, continued to weaken to lose a couple of
positions through the stretch. MAJOR CONTENDER in a bit tight at the start, forwardly placed early, fell back along the inside onto the backstretch, came
again for the show while closing the gap on the runner up late. LIMBO'S PROMISE moved up to join the fray soon after the start, dueled onto the
backstretch, shook clear in the far turn, roused into the lane while continuing to hold a daylight advantage and slowly increased that advantage to the wire.
HUNTER QUICK settled in the second flight, moved closer in the second turn while off the rail, made no more progress on the winner through the stretch,
held sway for the place. MAJESTIC LOVER void of early foot, improved position toward the inside then angling out late, not a serious threat. WILBERT went
one paced in lacking a closing response. HIT ONE OUT last away, trailed throughout and was not involved.

Footnotes
CLINTON QUARINTINO outrun in the early going, strongly encouragement late on the backstretch, advanced along the inside second turn, continued to
rally up the rail through the stretch, in time at the wire. LEGEND'S JOURNEY away well, set or forced the pace along the inside, drew clear late in the final
turn, raced in the two path into and through the lane, nailed in the final strides. LONE TREE with the pace in the two path, dropped back off the runner up in
the second turn, narrowly lasted to gain the nod for the show. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY in the second flight for three wide, displayed some mild late interest
while angling in a bit to challenge for the show late, missed. C J'S LEGACY broke back, raced in mid pack at one pace, continued evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing kick. BERRYVILLE BULLET behind the pace well out in the strip, four wide in the first turn, fell back to briefly trail backstretch, passed
some tiring rivals in the drive without posing a serious threat. TIZNOWS GRANDSON off a step slow, remained back in failing to threaten. ALPHABET
ADAMS in the second flight early off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. BONES BRUIN refused to break from the gate.

Footnotes
MISTER WAYSIDE close from the start, pressed the issue in the two path into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, disposed of that rival far turn,
responded when confronted by the runner up soon after, shook clear of that one a sixteenth out to prove clearly best. FLY TO THE BANK in mid pack off the
inside, carried seven wide by a bearing out MISSIN HOLLYWOOD into the first turn, recovered and launched a big move three wide to challenge the winner
from the outside late in the second bend, could not match strides with that one the final sixteenth, enough left to save the place. HE SAID WAIT in the
second flight while racing toward the inside, asked along far turn, steered out around a tiring rival midway on that bend, came three wide for the drive,
finished willingly late to be getting to the runner up. TOMMYHAWK broke back, void of any early foot while saving some ground in the first turn, continued
inside, steered out a bit when advancing late in the second bend, continued willingly to the end while too late. SWEET MEDICINE last to leave, lacked early
foot off the rail, fanned four wide out of the final turn, improved position with some modest late interest. DOCTOR TINK away in good order, dueled up front
inside the winner for five furlongs, gave way midway on the final turn. CONNORS OUTLAW broke out, settled, in the second flight early, was finished after a
half. FRIGERATOR in mid pack while racing off the inside, faltered in the second turn. MISSIN HOLLYWOOD in a bit tight at the start, bore out into the first
turn carrying the runner up well wide, remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
CUT ACROSS SHORTY outrun early inside, asked along late backstretch, brief wait into the far turn, regained momentum, inside bid upper, long drive,
narrowly best. MONEY EXPRESS sprinted clear soon after the start, maintained daylight in hand backstretch, responded after allowing the winner the inside
upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that one to narrowly miss. CANATLAN void of speed early, staged a rally into the lane to annex the show, not a
threat to the top pair. OOEY GOOEY CHEWY went one paced while racing outside most of the way, steadied far turn, proceeded evenly to the wire after
recovering. FORTY STRANGERS in the second flight early, four wide in the first turn, continued outside to be four wide again through the second bend,
remained back in failing to threaten. HE'S A ROCK chased the leader for just over a half and had little left for the drive. NOISE COMPLAINT hopped just
after the start to be off slowly, raced four wide through the first turn, continued outside while failing to threaten.
