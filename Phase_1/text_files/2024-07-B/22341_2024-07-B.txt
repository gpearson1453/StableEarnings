three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. LADY DELILAH

sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. MON PETIT CHOU was sent hard to the front, moved clear outside the five-eighths pole then opened
up a sizable advantage, went around the turn in the two path, came under a right-handed crop while shortening stride in upper stretch, drifted out under
continued right-handed pressure in the final furlong and was overtaken while clear for the place. CONDIMENT GIRL showed speed and pressed the early
pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, chased in the three then two path on the turn, gained on the tiring pacesetter into upper stretch, moved out
inside the three-sixteenths pole, pursued the top two into the final furlong and weakened while best of the rest. R FUNNY BIZNESS was urged off the pace,
angled out sharply near the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the four path, spun into the stretch in the five path and failed to threaten. RUN DEVIL

three path and tired. JOEY THE FISH dropped back fast under urging after the break, was hard ridden at the rear, rounded the turn in the four path and
showed little. MUCHO MAMA MIA was last to commence, raced towards the rear while ridden along, traveled around the turn in the three then four path and

IN THE CHASE broke alertly then was hustled from the gate, angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms in
the two path through the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under one pop of a right-handed crop into the final
furlong, was given one pop of a left-handed crop just inside the sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand-ride to the finish. MAN OF MISCHIEF chased
the pace between horses, went around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the five path, came under a left-handed crop outside the
eighth-pole, pursued the winner in the final furlong and finished with good courage to safely secure the place. SHAKEITFORTHEBIRD bumped with a rival
at the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, dropped back in upper stretch and tired while able to get the show. BRINK broke in and
bumped with a foe, angled in near the five-eighths pole, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted to the three path and failed to threaten.
BUTTAH bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the five path and came up empty. DOMINICAN
THUNDER was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, chased the leader late on the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground on the
turn and tired. BOOKITWITHHADDAD was urged along at the rear on the outside, rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor. BIG BROWN
DELIVERS broke in then brushed the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path and was no factor.

three wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the
eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task to the finish. GOT THUNDER chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the

MIDNIGHT to his inside, came under a drive with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and was shaken off straightened away, then
weakened to the finish. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT hustled from the gate, dueled from just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shook off his main pace rival and was confronted by the top one and overhauled just outside
the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. DOT'S DOLLAR coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under a ride
from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DOLOMITE settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, took over when asked into upper
stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear into the final furlong then switched to a left-handed crop and drew
away under steady urging. CRUISE TO CATALINA was urged along off the pace, raced in the three then four path on the turn, was driven into the stretch in
the six path and earned the place while no match for the winner. EASY PLAY was fractious in the gate, came away in good order and went straight to the
front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was headed by the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened while just able to hold the show. BETTER HUMOR ME chased the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. NEWSDLEY became restless in the gate when two foes were fractious, chased the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed
response. PERPETUAL PRAISE was ridden along well off the pace on the outside, traveled around the turn in the four path and was no factor. BIG HAZEL
was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LA BANQUERA was very fractious in the
gate, dropped well back in the field, went around the turn in the two path and faltered while never roused then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

hold in behind, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, had to alter out a path when RUN FOR THE HILLS tipped
out in front at the three-sixteenths, got roused when altered to the six path and offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside the leader, the rider hitting
the crop from the hands of FUTURE IS NOW's rider seventy yards from home when crossing crops and was up in the final jumps to score. DANSE

through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, angled in to the rail a furlong out, rallied up the inside and
was in a bit tight along the temporary rail when SECRET MONEY attempted to split foes between a tight seam, seized narrow and brief command seventy
yards from the finish, then got nailed in the very last jumps. FUTURE IS NOW hustled from the gate, vied inside a pair from the get go through swift splits
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole
bracing for flanking challenges from a host of pursuers, dug in under a right handed crop confronted and had the rider get his crop knocked from his hand to
the outside by the rider of DONTLOOKBACKATALL when crossing crops seventy yards from home just as DANSE MACABRE took over command to her
inside up the rail, fought on to the finish to preserve the show honors on the line. SECRET MONEY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied looking for a seam and angled in to the two path a furlong out, was in tight
with DANSE MACABRE to her inside a sixteenth from home, battled on to the finish and missed at the end. ZEITLOS traded a bump at the start with STAR

finish. KAUFYMAKER coaxed from the gate, vied from the two path between foes under coaxing from the three-eighths through swift splits, swung three
wide into upper stretch, got shaken off a furlong out and weakened to the finish backing out carefully among a host of rivals stacked across the track. RUN
FOR THE HILLS bobbled at the break and came under coaxing to vie three wide outside a pair, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four
to five wide into upper stretch, tipped out at the three-sixteenths forcing DONTLOOKBACKATALL to alter out a path, then backed out carefully weakening
between rivals to the finish. KERRY hustled from the start, chased along the inside, got steadied when DONTLOOKBACKATALL tucked inside in front near

Footnotes
MIZTERTONIC went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, commenced a battle with the runner-up, brushed with that foe at the eighth-pole, dueled in the
final furlong and just got up to narrowly prevail. KID KREESA went to the front, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was put to a drive while inside of the winner in upper stretch, brushed with that foe near the eighth-pole, dueled
gamely in the final furlong and was denied in the final stride while clear for the place. ENGLISH CASTLE went around the firs turn in the three path, settled
in the front half of the field, was roused in the three path on the far turn, pursued the leaders in the stretch and lacked the needed kick but improved to get
the show. KORU traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the four path on the far turn, pursued the leaders in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. MY LIFE STORY was a bit difficult to deal with during the warm-up, broke out at the start,
tossed his head while lugging in some early, was rated just off the pace on the inside, angled out while asked for his best in upper stretch, chased into the
final furlong and weakened. DAKOTA COUNTRY bobbled at the start, angled in early, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear,
was roused two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TIZ THE PRINCE brushed the rail
when put in tight by MY LIFE STORY early then steadied, saved ground on both turns and failed to rally. TEMPLE CREED was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, bumped with an opponent early, raced inside to the two path on the turns and failed to impact. WITHIN VIEW broke in and hit the gate
hard then bumped with a foe, bumped with another rival when getting pressure from an outside foe early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at
the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the far turn and never reached contention. ARTFUL DREAMER was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, bumped with a rival early, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten. CASH OR CHOCOLATE broke in and bumped with a foe,
settled towards the rear while inside to the two path and was no factor. SLOW DOWN BIG ANDY was hustled from the gate, raced in the four path on the
first turn, settled on the outside, moved from the three path to the five path on the far turn and faltered.
