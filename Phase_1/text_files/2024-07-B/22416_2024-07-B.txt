Footnotes
LIKE A SALTSHAKER bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked four wide, bid along with inner rivals into the turn, vied with a solo inner foe nearing
the lane, dueled neck and neck with that one through the lane and gamely prevailed. ONE COOL DUDE laid close up in the two path, bid along with outer
rivals into the turn, vied inside of the eventual winner nearing the lane, battled gamely with that one thereafter but was bested. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE
broke a step slow, tracked the leaders from the three to four path into the turn, gained show chasing the embattled leading pair entering the final furlong and
slowly closed in through the late stages. BORN FLAWLESS set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of outer bidders leaving the three furlong
pole and gave way through the lane. W W CRAZY was off a beat slow, pursued from the four to five path and failed to menace. COMMUNICATION MEMO
was brushed by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor. SIR OLLIE bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced
forwardly three wide and between horses, failed to sustain a bid along with those counterparts nearing the three furlong pole and weakened. ALL IN SYNC
leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, trailed in the two path, checked behind a foe passing the five sixteenths pole, shifted out and made little impact.
HYDRO FROST chased along the inside and tired.

LOTSANDLOTSOFCANDY broke outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, set a clear pace in the three path, kicked away from an outer tracker in
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over after feeling left handed crop at the furlong grounds, then widened under light hand urging.
ALDORA was bumped and forced outwardly by an inner rival at the start, trailed in the four to five path, advanced turning for home and ran on to edge place
at the sixteenth pole. BLUE SQUALL tracked the clear leader from the three path, took aim inching closer in the four path around the turn, but proved no
match while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, yielded and lost place at the sixteenth pole. AMY Z pursued from the two to three path and failed to
menace. TWIRLING GOOD TIME chased from midpack along the inside and gave way. TENENBAUM laid close up along the inside early on, but chased
into the turn and weakened.

LETSTALKABOUTME broke half a step slow, laid last of the remaining group, surpassed rivals ranging up in the five path around the turn, bid before forging
an advantage from VICTORIOUS NYQUIST leaving the quarter pole, then held sway from that persistent rival through the lane. VICTORIOUS NYQUIST
prompted two wide and between horses, forged an advantage in teh three path nearing the three furlong pole, but got headed by an outer challenge at the
quarter pole, fought on well thereafter but was kept at bay. TIME FOR MAGIC pressed three deep, sustained pressure in the four path around the turn, but
got outmoved by an outer bidder at the quarter pole, shifted out to the five path into upper stretch and stayed on mildly. YO LEVEN set the pace inside of a
pair of pressers, got headed nearing the three furlong pole, gave way shortly after and faded. BELLA ESTRELA pursued four to two wide under consistent
coaxing and failed to menace. DREAM ON STORMY chased along the inside and faded around the turn. CALATHEA stumbled at the start and lost her
rider, then walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SAGITTARIUS pursued from midpack in the two path, crept closer between horses turning for home, shifted three wide into upper stretch, rallied among
foes to split rivals in the final sixteenth, dueled with an outer co-bidder through the closed stages and prevailed. MONEY MEMOLO laid off of the pace two
to three wide, picked up stride fanning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to split rivals in the final sixteenth, bid along with an inner rival shortly after, dueled
late but missed. JON'S STREET BAND tracked two wide, pressed menacingly outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid nearing the lane, vied while
shifting out to the six path in upper stretch, led narrowly into the final sixteenth, but was bested by a inner pair of bidders late. TRACK OF MY TEARS set
the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one into the far turn, battled as a wider challenger joined the fray nearing the lane, fought on inside of a
quartet of foes leaving the sixteenth pole and yielded late. MUNYHUNGRY pressed outside of the leader, vied around the far turn, then between horses
nearing the lane, drifted out at the furlong grounds while sustaining the battle but yielded between foes late. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS laid unhurried along
the inside, then three wide around the far turn, floated from the four to six path into the lane and failed to factor. REJOINDER saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail. GLYNE BEACH stalked along the inside, chased in the two path into the lane and faded. SIX PACK MUMBLES broke slowly, quickly lost
contact with the rest of the field early on, was distanced around the far turn, pulled up in the final furlong and walked off. BOLT ACTION suffered an injury to
his left hind leg upon leaving the gate, was pulled up entering the first turn and taken off of the track in an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S FLAME tracked four wide, rallied to bid outside of the leader leaving the sixteenth pole and drove past. GLORIETTE showed the way while
traveling well in hand in the two path around the turn, remained under confident handling through upper stretch, came under a drive entering the final
furlong, held sway to the sixteenth pole, but met an outer challenge leaving that marker and was caught late. SOMBRA DORADA laid close up along the
inside, stalked along the turn, then chased evenly through the lane. HIGH FASHION KATE stalked along the inside before moving between horses at the
half mile pole, pursued outside of the leader and from the three path while applied mild pressure around the turn, but chased that rival in upper stretch while
delaying a lead change, changed over in the final furlong but yielded between horses. BALLADRY laid off of the pace in the two path and lacked a bid. END
OF INNOCENCE leaned out and brushed the gate at the start, raced at the rear in the five path and made little impact. DARK FURY lacked speed along the
inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
QUINN'S PROMISE prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, led leaving the five sixteenths pole, drove clear in upper stretch, shifted out
nearing the final sixteenth and held from an outer bidder. JEWELED DESTINY pursued from midpack four wide, crept closer in the three path and between
horses around the far turn to take aim on the clearing leader entering the lane, but drifted out while chasing in the final furlong, slowly closed in late but
needed more. TOTALLY JUSTIFIED tracked from midpack in the two path, then between horses down the backstretch, came under urging while chasing
around the far turn, split foes four deep entering the lane, gained show in upper stretch and chased the top pair home. HEREFORAGOODTIME bumped
with an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly tucking to the inside, chased around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, kept on between horses
and held fourth late. RUNNIN N GUNNIN laid off of the pace three wide, fanned from the four to six path entering the lane, stayed on to bid for fourth late
but missed. TAKE CHARGE MILADY saved ground off of the pace, improved past outer rivals in midstretch but failed to menace. REIGN CHAMPAGNE
stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, pursued from the four to five path around the far turn then yielded between horses. MAD ABOUT
MARIE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, was behind foes four wide in upper stretch and failed to factor. BREAD TO RUN showed the
way inside of the eventual winner while remaining a path off of the inside, got headed by that one passing the five sixteenths pole then weakened between
horses. PEANUT GALLERY was slow to go, trailed along the inside, improved in the four to six path around the far turn and failed to factor. QUEEN
MCKINZIE broke a step slow and bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path, then faded in the seven path around the far
turn.

Footnotes
MESERO broke slowly while last away, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, progressed turning for home before swinging to the five path entering
upper stretch, and rallied to reel in the leader in the closing stages. TREW VIOLENCE prompted two wide, vied around the turn, then between horses
turning for home, dueled with an outer SNAP CALL through upper stretch, inched ahead of that one in the final furlong, but was caught by an outer
challenger nearing the wire. SNAP CALL stalked outside of the top pair, bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer rival forced his hand, dueled with an inner
foe through upper stretch, but yielded reaching the final sixteenth, got outkicked then lasted for show. ROYAL BRO lacked speed in the three path, rallied
four wide to split rivals at the sixteenth pole, sustained progress late but missed show at the wire. G. ERIK broke slowly, lacked speed in the four path,
gained in the five path entering the lane, then sustained a rally to split rivals at the sixteenth pole. MY OWN bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued
from the four path, shifted to the six path entering upper stretch and chased evenly. THUNDERHAWK led from an outer prompter early on, got headed while
inside of a trio of rivals nearing the five sixteenths pole and gave way. SHAN tracked four wide, bid turning for home, but chased inner rivals into upper
stretch and tired between horses. SMOOTH N SILKY bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, but chased
between horses into upper stretch and faded. LUCKY MISCHIEF chased along the inside and faded. GUNS dropped back quickly after breaking towards
the front, lacked speed in the five to four path and never got involved. HISTORIC broke a step slow and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
OUT OF DEDUCTIONS pursued from midpack three wide, swung five wide picking up stride entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the leader at the
sixteenth pole, dueled and prevailed. TAPIT SHOES pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, led into the lane, inched clear in midstretch, met challenges
on both sides at the sixteenth pole, battled gamely but missed. EL KABONG was brushed by an inner rival at the start, got rank between horses into the first
turn, saved ground in midpack, rallied up the rail to bid at the sixteenth pole but needed more late. DESERT DUKE tracked two wide, tipped four wide into
the lane, chased between horses and offered a mild bid. SCOOBIE QUANDO brushed an outer rival at the start, steadied while rank along the inside in to
the first turn, settled off of the pace, shifted out to the six path and between horses in the final furlong and lacked a bid. KITODAN laid off of the pace two
wide, shifted to the six path into upper stretch, then stayed on willingly outside of rivals late. TATANKA was brushed by an inner rival into an outer foe at the
start, stalked along the inside, tipped three wide into upper stretch but lacked a punch between horses. AMERICAN MAYHEM showed the way inside of a
prompting rival, got headed by that one entering the lane and faded between horses. LINCOLN HIGHWAY trailed along the inside, improved in the four path
around the far turn before floating to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact.
