Footnotes
TUCKER TIME unhurried early while three wide, drove four wide at the three-sixteenth pole, was under handling late and drove clear. A LATE ONE
advanced inside nearing the quarter pole, lodged a rail bid at the head of the stretch and was along with time for place. JULIUS THE GREAT set the pace
while three wide, gained a short advantage, and gave way. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) prompted the early pace, was unable to move on with rival and
yielded late. BRATTON stalked the dueling pacesetters, and failed to threaten.

LORD OF BATTLE went four wide into the opening turn then contested the early pace, gained the lead in the far turn, opened up through stretch and was
geared down. OUR SUNSHINE was outsprinted leaving the opening turn, tracked the pacesetters, was no match for the winner in the stretch and passed
tiring foe late. CASSANO contended the early pace inside, was unable to move on with the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole and faded gradually
through the stretch. PASSAGE raced four to five wide in the opening turn, tracked four wide in the backstretch and tired. COUNTY WINDS chased in the
four path leaving the backstretch, and never reached contention. LUCKY LEGS was never involved.

NICE GUY EDDIE broke outward, contested the early pace outside of TENNESSEE MOSES, was set down for a drive at the quarter pole, headed into the
stretch, and held. BRODY'S PAL sandwiched leaving the gate, sat behind the leaders, responded to encouragement nearing the stretch and weakened in
the final yards. TENNESSEE MOSES dueled for the lead, held a slim advantage into the far turn, rallied determinedly inside, and gave way late.
THISCATSGOTSPEED jostled leaving the gate, trailed the field, lodged a rail bid then lacked running room inside at the head of the stretch and flattened
out. JUMP THE QUEUE jostled away from the gate, chased four to five wide in the backstretch, and tired.

Footnotes
BODEMONSTER sat in striking range, was in close quarters leaving the backstretch, set sights on FROSTEDBIRD nearing the quarter pole, closed
gradually under urging and won the nod. FROSTEDBIRD quickly cleared the field under a snug hold, responded to a challenge from BODEMONSTER,
battled through the stretch but lost the nod and finished on the wire with WRONG SPORT. WRONG SPOT hesitated at the start, rated off the pace while
four to five wide, asked to quicken in the final turn inside, shifted outside late stretch then finished at the same time as FROSTBIRD after a multi-horse
scramble to the wire. LONESOME CAT settled outside just off the pace, and lacked the kick that was needed. COUNTRIFIED angled to rail quickly into the
opening turn, stalked along the rail under a snug hold, and rallied mildly late. ATTENZIONE unhurried early and lacked a bid. ESTIFRAAD fanned three
wide, sat a the back of the pack, and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MONEY MUNCHER showed the way through the far turn, responded to a threat from ROCK CHALK and just held under a late drive. ROCK CHALK sat in
range along the rail, angled out two wide at the head of the lane, closed gradually under steady handling and just missed after a determined effort.
MOHAMAD launched an all out bid at the quarter pole, and flattened deep stretch. MUSTAFA settled outside while four wide, and offered a mild late bid.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR chased outside leaving the backstretch, and failed to threaten. CARRERA CABALLO prompted the early pace, and wilted.
