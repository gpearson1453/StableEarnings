Footnotes
MT LOGAN stalked outside close to the back of the pack, was ridden to go three furlongs out, smartly circled the field four wide around the turn, was a
menacing presence five wide at the top of the stretch, took control by the sixteenth pole and edged clear at the wire. HIGHLAND LIFE had slim lead down
the backstretch, battled outside up top through the turn, began to creep away for the sole lead at the quarter pole, was headed on both sides in mid-stretch,
could not fend off the winner outside but did stay on gamely to the best the rest in the end. MOON OVER EGBERT forced the issue on the fence to begin,
continued to duel inside for the lead around the bend, chased the pace by the quarter pole, re-rallied on the fence to bid again at the furlong marker but was
out finished late and held for the show money. TOWN'S WARRIOR bobbled soon after the start, trailing along the backside, caught up to runners three wide
going around foes by the quarter pole, angled out with momentum in the six path straightening for home and finished with purpose to settle on the fringes.
PRINCE OF THIEVES was in the mix up top in the three path in the beginning, at the half was reined back to have a good inside tracking trip, kept pace
with the engaged leaders throughout the turn, was in range of the front group, three wide at the top of the lane, shifted inwards at the furlong marker but
needed more late to be a factor at the finish line. COLONEL MUSTARD stalked inside near the rear, just started to extend his stride inside at the three
furlong pole when stuck behind a stopping rival, was shuffled back to last and was full of run on the rail in the stretch to finish up with very good late energy.
GEM QUALITY tracked four deep, watching the contesting trio outside, moved in three wide between rivals at the quarter pole to be in the hunt in the four
path turning for home but flattened out with a furlong remaining. SILENT TRIBUTE was very keen under hard restraint having the lead early on, vied
between runners in the two path along the backstretch, had no more to offer by the three eighths marker, backed away quickly on the fence through the turn
and cantered home, crossing the wire.

Footnotes
TAVALINE was bumped on the break, recovered to hound the pace in the early stages, bid for the lead three wide with five sixteenths from home, dueled
the entire length of the stretch and prevailed at the wire in a photo. SUPER SICILY seized the lead from the onset, set the pace while shadowed outside by
the eventual winner, was headed outside in upper stretch, continued to be unyielding on the fence to the wire but was nosed out at the finish line. VICTORIA
ELIZABETH was alone just behind the engaged duo through the turn, lost her path just when she was making a rail move turning for home, checked, shifted
outside to be five wide with three sixteenths to go but could not reel in the leaders late and settled for a clear but troubled third. SOUPER COP stalked three
wide outside foes down the back straight, improved when roused three furlongs out, shifted in to the two path when encouraged right-handed in mid-stretch
and finished up willingly for a minor role. NOT A LOST CAUSE broke inwards to begin, tracked in the second flight outside a rival down the backstretch and
through the turn, angled to the four path, in range of the top pair in upper stretch, continued to shift out to be six wide with three sixteenths to go, could not
find more and stalled by the furlong marker. POETIC AMY broke out on the break, was ahead of the only the poor starter down the backstretch, made little
impression around the bend and passed a couple of weary rivals in upper stretch. ROCKET RILEY was bumped on the start, settled on the rail in midfield,
was going the wrong way throughout the turn and could not reach contention in the running to the finish line. DIXIE MORNING stalked between foes near
the rear, offered a mild run three wide outside horses with three furlongs to go but had nothing to show for the stretch drive. SWEET CHARLIZE was
pinballed between foes to be last along the backside, could not recover after the poor start and trailed through out.

SCARY SPEEDY tracked on the rail down the backstretch, inched closer under a patient ride on the fence through the turn, shifted out with her sights set on
the leader in upper stretch and went on by at the sixteenth pole while winning under a hand ride. TABEI veered out on the break, took command down the
backstretch, set a comfortable pace through the bend, continued to be moving well up top in mid-stretch but just could not hold off the winner late. ROSE OF
SHARON was in the second flight between runners in the early going, closed in three wide at the quarter pole, had a chance up front in the four path at the
top of the lane but was no match for the top pair to the wire and settled for the show award in the end. HERETHEREVERYWHERE was forced out on the
start, trailed the field in the beginning while being nudged on to stay interested along the backside, continued to see the field but was closing in around the
turn, angled out widest in the seven path turning for home and finished up strongly albeit greenly through the lane. PICKFORD SWEET was ahead of only
one rival down the back straight, kept pace with the field around the bend, shifted to the two path straightening for home and finished with interest on the
fence in deep stretch. SECRET SOUL was situated close to the back of the pack outside a runner in the early going, made no headway through the turn,
angled four wide for the drive and finished up evenly to the wire. SUPER SHAMAN stalked near the rear on the rail down the backside, made no progress
around the bend and was one paced in the drive to the wire. EARLY STRIKE was pushed out by the inside foe on the break, settled in mid-pack four deep
along the backside, was roused for more three eighths from home, offered no response and emptied out in the stretch. HYPER ANGEL veered out sharply
on the break, was then urged right-handed soon after the start chasing the pace outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden but could not keep up with
others by mid-turn and stopped at the furlong marker.

ENCOURAGEACHOTHER settled off the pace, moved out from three to five wide on the turn racing mid-pack, bid near the eighth pole while lugging in a bit,
took the lead just after and drew clear under steady handling. GOLDEN BOSS was coaxed forward, set the pace from off the rail, drew clear in upper
stretch, was overtaken in mid-stretch and no match but clearly second best. REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY was forwardly-positioned tracking in behind the
leaders under light rating tactics, moved out in upper stretch under urging but could only run on evenly. GO GIFFEN settled toward the rear off the inside,
went in the three to four path on the turn, kept on in the stretch and improved position. ROYAL RIBBON broke outwardly, moved out from three to six wide
on the turn racing in the back half, needed more late. MAGIC MODIE chased from outside mid-pack racing three to four wide through the turn, failed to rally.
GENIUS OF LOVE was forced out a bit at the start, pressed the pace from outside, steadied in tight quarters near the eighth pole while weakening and
continued to fade thereafter. ALL FOR HONOR tossed the head and was a step slow at the start, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, was
never a threat. MAJESTIC APPEAL saved ground inside mid-pack, faded. SAVE THE DATE raced off the rail and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
I LOVE TO WIN was bounced around between rivals at the start, stalked in the third flight inside runners down the backside, started to smartly rally on the
fence at the quarter pole, shifted out, gathering speed four wide straightening for home and flew home in the final furlong to get up in time with an
impressive late turn of foot. ONEJABTOOMANY took command from the start, opened up through the turn moving comfortably, was clinging onto the lead in
mid-stretch but just could not find more late to fend off the charge by the winner a few jumps before the wire. TOP OF D MOUNTAIN broke in at the start,
tracked between horses in the early stages, shifted inwards two wide for the drive down the lane and willingly came on late outside to secure the show
award at the wire. ZIPPY GAMBLE tracked on the rail down the backstretch, continued to wait inside for the cue to move through the turn, shifted out to
loom three wide turning for home, chased the frontrunner in the stretch but faded late to settle on the fringes. GAMBLE'S DANCE co-trailed three deep
outside foes at the half, started to uncork its run outside rivals four wide with seven sixteenths from home, closed the gap around foes three wide around the
bend, shifted out in the five path for the drive to the wire and finished up mildly down the lane. PEACE POSEY stalked near the rear when between horses,
was taken a hold of when losing its path three wide between foes at the seven sixteenths marker, tried to re-rally at the quarter pole some but was one
paced in the four path down the lane. DANCING IN RIO was squeezed on the start, travelled in the two path between foes in mid-division, was shuffled back
midturn to trail the field and passed a few tired runners in the stretch while running on the rail. NO MALARKEY broke out to begin, settled on the rail in
mid-pack, could not make any improvement through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. J M R TACITA co-trailed on the inside by the half mile
marker, passed a rival midway on the turn and had little to show in the running to the finish line. SINFUL FORESTER broke in at the start, tracked three
deep outside down the backstretch, could not keep up, giving way to the pace trio by the quarter pole and retreated three wide between runners in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
TWISTED ROMANCE settled off the pace, swung six wide turning for home, shifted in several paths in mid-stretch, rallied inside foes to get up late.
PAINTED GLORY settled off the pace, fanned seven wide turning for home, gained steadily through the drive and got the nod for place. CATCH THE
DRIFT settled mid-pack off the inside, fanned six wide commencing a rally, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, led till late but was outfinished.
ENDURING got away well and had the early lead but ceded that to an inside rival content to stalk, drifted out a bit then was carried in a little in mid-stretch,
ran on. FRENCH LAUNDRY (GB) moved to the lead not long after the start, set the pace inside, weakened. MRS. C settled off the pace inside, moved out
two to three wide for the stretch run, steadied between runners when in tight near the eighth pole, ran on. WHY EM SEA AY was well-placed stalking
outside three to four wide, faded in the stretch. STOLEN VALOUR bumped with a rival lightly after the start, shifted in and moved forward, tracked inside
through the turn, lacked room along the rail in behind and inside throughout late stretch. GO WITH GUSTO got away well, settled off the leaders racing
mid-pack near the rail, came out eight wide in the stretch, failed to rally. SELEMENE exchanged a bump with the outside rival after the start then bumped
with the inside foe and steadied, was outrun. MIA MITOLE bumped with a rival soon after the start, raced outside foes three to four deep off the pace, tired.

Footnotes
FOURFIFTYFOUR was under a tight hold, sitting off the top two in the beginning, waited patiently behind a wall of chasing rivals through the turn, shifted out
when unleashed three wide with a quarter to run and determinedly wore down the leader in deep stretch for the score. NEVER SILENT broke out on the
start, quickly burst between horses to seize control at the half, set the pace around the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole, put away that
challenger away by the furlong marker but did not have enough late to fend off the late rush by the winner. MAGICAL TRICK stalked near the rear inside a
fellow runner, moved in when shifting outside for a rally midway on the turn, angled outside in the five path reaching for ground, with a strong late surge
closed smartly and just missed getting the place share in the end. PRIMA was bumped on the break, travelled four deep in midfield down the backside,
made an early move circling four wide around foes three furlongs from the wire, bid on the outside by the quarter pole, was repelled by the pacesetter with a
furlong to go and faded late losing the show award. SECRET LOAD trailed in the early stages, swung out five wide for the stretch running and showed good
late energy passing rivals to the wire. DUCHESS QUEEN tracked the lead duo on the rail down the backside, was nestled on the fence waiting to move, had
a chance for a share while saving ground entering the stretch but failed to fire down the lane. WILDFIRE was eager early to prompt the pace, was shuffled
back some at the half to stalk between in the third flight, was scrubbed on chasing the frontrunner with horses on both sides around the bend and tired by
the furlong marker. NOW IS A BREEZE stalked near the rear outside rivals, could not maintain position even though roused for more in midturn and failed to
menace in the stretch drive. FRIENDS FOR LIFE assumed command after the start, relinquished the lead by the half, chased the pacesetter through the
turn, was checked in tight quarters with two furlongs to go, could not regroup in the lane and played no role to the wire.

Footnotes
TIME TO DAZZLE got away well, appeared to be getting out a bit early, set the tempo in the clear, spurted away from all pursuers turning for home, was
asked at the quarter pole and held safe while being kept to the task. SIMPLY IN FRONT was bumped at the start, settled mid-pack, advanced while moving
out from three to five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. UPHILL DANCE settled off the pace racing two to three wide through
the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes, lugged out a bit near the furlong marker, kept on to be best of the rest. TRIPOLINA was a bit
headstrong pulling against the rider's restraint early but soon settled down and stalked in behind the eventual winner near but off the rail and inside a rival,
lacked the needed late kick. CREVALLE D'ORO was well-positioned mid-pack between runners, went three to four wide on the turn, came out five to six
deep for the drive, ran on but needed more. AIROSA broke outwardly, unhurriedly brought up the rear, saved ground on the turn under patient handling,
came out a bit in upper stretch then back in for room, kept on and improved position. SABATINI stalked from between runners three wide early, came out a
bit in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. GRECIAN GODDESS bumped a rival at the start, saved ground inside, failed to rally. MISS ROBERTS
(GB) shifted in early racing well back near but off the rail, angled seven wide at the top of the stretch, needed more late. WITWATERSRAND pursued from
about mid-pack outside mostly four to five wide through the turn, was floated eight wide turning for home, had no late bid. ECSTASY pursued the pacesetter
from outside runners four wide, steadily weakened. READY FOR SHIRL was forced to take the widest route out of the turn floating nine wide into upper
stretch, failed to menace.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE easily cleared to the rail for a comfortable lead in the first turn, continued to gallop along while unchallenged down the back straight,
was let out a notch when mildly pressured midpoint on the final turn to improve the margin up front and was tapped right-handed in mid-stretch and there
was no doubt who the winner was, coasting home for the impressive front running score. STANLEY HOUSE tracked outside in the first of two turns, was
content to sit behind the pacesetting winner down the backstretch, turned up the pressure when asked to go with three furlongs to the wire, was repelled by
the winner at the quarter pole, dueled for second place down the lane and re-rallied late to win the three way photo for second at the finish line. WICKED
DJANGO was unhurried to be near the rear in the first turn, made little headway along the backside, started to rally around runners three wide with three
furlongs remaining, dueled for the place share outside in upper stretch, poked his head in front for that battle with a sixteenth to go but settled for third
money between horses at the wire. PALAZZI hopped on the start, was allowed to settle at the back in the first turn, continued to see the pack down the
backside, started to go past foes three wide on the outside at the quarter pole, found his best stride late when in the six path down the lane, was closing in
smartly for the runners up share late but was on the losing end of a three way photo. JOURNEYMAN stalked near the rear for most of the race, could see
the field when in the two path straightening out for the drive in upper stretch and passed a few tired runners to the finish line. VOLCANIC was bumped
outside on the start, tracked on the rail in the first turn, settled, alone in the third flight down the backside, offered a mild run on the rail with three furlongs to
go, could not keep up with the closers outside who were starting to rally by the quarter pole and faded on the fence by mid-stretch. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB)
broke in at the start, travelled on the fence in mid-division along the backside, was roused three furlongs out, offered a brief run until the quarter pole
between horses and retreated with runners on either side at the furlong marker. COUNTY FINAL settled outside runners in mid-pack in the early stages,
was urged between rivals midway on the far turn, could not quicken with others making a move and yielded five wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOMUNNYFOR RO stalked outside near the back of the pack for most of the race, started to gather momentum in the four path behind the leaders in upper
stretch, found another gear with a furlong from the line and quickly burst between rivals three wide with a sixteenth to go to get up in time for the win.
WORLD SHOWCASE was away alertly to lead at the start, kept a close eye, watching the front pair while three wide along the backside, was shuffled back
a couple of positions at the three furlong marker, angled out widest in the eight path turning for home, was gaining on the leaders with every stride down the
lane but was outrun late by the fast charging winner just before the wire. SPARKLE'S LIL GIRL travelled on the fence in midfield, took the shortest way
around the turn in the third flight, closed in on the leaders four wide with a quarter to run, dueled for the lead with a sixteenth from home in the two path but
was no match for the pair of late closers just before the wire. MARDENE chased the pacesetter in the early going, moved in to loom boldly four wide in
upper stretch, edged closer with an eighth left to run, could not find more late and evened out in deep stretch for a minor share in the end. PRIVACY
SETTING (FR) took this field down the backside while on the rail, continued to set a fast pace up front throughout the turn, was clinging onto the lead in
mid-stretch drifted out under left-handed encouragement at the furlong pole, ran out of steam late and wilted with seventy yards to go from the finish line.
PRINCESS O DENMARK broke out on the start, settled in midfield between runners down the backside, save ground improving around the bend, shifted
out to have a chance for a small share in the three path by the three sixteenths marker, was checked losing its path on the rail with a furlong remaining and
still tried to catch rivals to the wire. SCORED watched the front duo while tucked in on the rail down the backside, kept pace just behind the frontrunner
through the turn, was in range if good enough just behind the leader in upper stretch, shifted in when driving on the rail with a furlong to go, had a chance for
a share of the prize on the fence with a sixteenth to go but faded in deep stretch. SILENT PASSION was pushed out on the start, settled on the fence in
mid-division, lost position running inside early on in the turn, made a quick move on the fence when turning for home to be in touch with the leaders but
could not sustain the rally by the furlong marker. INDIANA ROAD was in tight between runners on the break, settled in the second flight between runners
down the backside, closed in three wide on the turn, posed a threat bidding in the five path straightening out for home but weakened between foes at the
furlong marker. RACE DAY CHANCE was squeezed on the break to be ahead of two rivals down the back straight, made no impression around the turn and
passed a couple of tiring runners inside by mid-stretch. PRAIRIE SKY was squeezed on the break, tracked the contesting duo three wide outside foes down
the backstretch, had a stalking position in the third flight outside around the bend, angled seven wide for the drive but had little to show in the stretch run.
TIPSY'S EMPIRE was off a step slow to begin, had one rival beaten along the backside and could not get involved driving to the finish line. OUR STELLA
settled four deep in mid-pack outside foes early on, was going in the wrong direction through the turn and made no presence in the stretch running.
HUMBLE HEART bobbled soon after the start, trailed down the backside and could not be a factor in the stretch.
