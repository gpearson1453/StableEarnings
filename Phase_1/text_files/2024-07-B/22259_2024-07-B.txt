NOT AGAIN JACKIE stalked the early leaders from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, edged ahead upper stretch, moved clear inside the
last eighth and kept ORBITAL STARR at bay under steady handling. ORBITAL STARR hesitated then broke inward, was hustled along from inside, came
into contention on the turn, angled out widest upper stretch, closed well, took over second inside the final sixteenth but came up short for the win. LIMA
ZULU vied for the lead inside to the top of the lane then began to wear down. MY LITTLE TIPSY disputed the pace just outside LIMA ZULU, began to slowly
yield nearing the end of a half mile, his rider lost his crop in the lane and MY LITTLE TIPSY continued to fade. STOSH stayed off the inside and showed
little throughout.

Footnotes
STROPE pressed the early speed while toward the outside, advanced three wide on the turn, engaged the leaders inside the last eighth and edged ahead
with seventy yards to go. SPAN bumped at the start, quickly recovered to dispute the pace from inside, brushed a few times with RUN THE TABLE
midstretch, was slowly drifting out in the late going and had to settle for second best. RUN THE TABLE broke alertly, was soon challenged from inside, two
wide through the turn, brushed a few times with SPAN midstretch, began to gradually yield inside the last eighth and altered in for a clear path with seventy
yards to go. GRAYHOP moved to the outside early on, lost ground four wide through the bend then showed a willingness to run belatedly deep stretch.
HE'S A FINE MAN broke inward, bumping SPAN, was soon contesting the pace between the latter and RUN THE TABLE, was caught in tight quarters
between those two after travelling the first furlong, shuffled back then checked nearing the half mile pole then steadily faded while along the rail.

TALIS PARK GRAD shared the lead outside JACK VAN BERG from the beginning, was roused leaving the bend, moved clear upper stretch and maintained
full control under steady handling. PARKER settled just off the inside, angled out three wide upper stretch, rallied, dueled for second inside the final
sixteenth and prevailed for the place. D' YANK settled along the rail early, rallied after a half mile, battled for the place from inside deep stretch but did not
have enough nearing the wire. SOUPER FORTUNE forwardly placed from outside, was four wide through the turn then ran evenly in the lane. JACK VAN
BERG vied for the lead off the rail but inside TALIS PARK GRAD, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and gradually wore down inside
the last eighth. MKAR THE FAST hesitated at the start, showed little staying well off the rail and was in hand nearing the wire.

Footnotes
INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke on top and inward, was soon overtaken, rated from outside, let out into the bend, drew clear and held off DRAGGING MAIN
under urging. DRAGGING MAIN was settled in midpack, picked pup his pace along the rail on the turn, surged inside the final furlong, was too late but
clearly second best. OFF TO THE RACES vied for the early lead from inside, moved clear after travelling the first furlong, did not stay with INSIDE THE
CIRCLE on the turn, fanned outside that one into the lane and ran evenly the final eighth. ANUNKA also well back early, was just off the rail on the bend,
fanned out behind OFF TO THE RACES for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run the last furlong. KRUELESS bumped at the break, raced in
contention just off the inside, angled out some on the turn, came into the stretch just outside OFF TO THE RACES and flattened for the drive. UNCLE DICK
altered in some as INSIDE THE CIRCLE narrowed his path at the start, bumped KRUELESS then was checked behind INSIDE THE CIRCLE and was
never a factor. LAGRUE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. The rider of UNCLE DICK lodged an objection alleging interference from INSIDE THE
CIRCLE at the start. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that foul claim.

Footnotes
STALLONE moved up between horses to share the lead on the backstretch, gained the rail into the second turn, did not stay with NULLARBOR, came
again from inside the final furlong, edged ahead and kept the latter at bay. NULLARBOR bumped at the start, advanced outside to share the lead on the
backstretch, also angled in some into the second bend, moved ahead to be the lone leader two wide, floated out some upper stretch, was headed after
entering the last eighth, did not relent but drifted out in the waning yards. PAYNT BY LETTERS forwardly placed between rivals, advanced two wide on the
second turn, fanned outside NULLARBOR entering the lane, altered inside that one with a furlong to go, battled for third the last sixteenth and prevailed for
the show. CHEEKERS broke outward, bumping NULLARBOR, raced in contention toward the outside, went for the lead three wide on the second bend,
could not sustain his bid in the stretch, fought to keep third in the late going, lacked the needed late kick but was easily best of the others. SNOOZER
without early speed, angled toward the outside on the backstretch, closed the gap some from path three on the second turn, swung outside CHEEKERS into
the stretch and had no late bid. YOU'RE IN COREY moved clear on the rest on the first turn, was challenged from outside on the backstretch, was steadied
in tight quarters into the second bend, faded, angled outside upper stretch and had little to offer. KARAYEL broke on top, soon dropped back from between
horses, angled outside into the first turn, stayed wide the rest of the way and showed little.

Footnotes
SPANISH DOUBLOON soon shared the lead from inside, drew clear when urged upper stretch, started to slowly drift out approaching the furlong marker,
was challenged from from both sides deep stretch but dug in and held on. ST. LOUIE LOUIE bumped with BLUE NORTHER shortly after the break, jostled
with that one while in tight quarters reaching the end of the first furlong, advanced two wide on the turn, altered abruptly outside RACARINO for racing room
upper stretch, engaged SPANISH DOUBLOON nearing the final sixteenth, fought gamely but had to settle for second. ICONICUS settled inside, swung out
leaving the bend, angled to the inside as a path opened upper stretch and rallied belatedly in the late going. RACARINO prominent between horses, was
three wide taking the turn, fought for second in the lane, leveled off deep stretch but was clearly best of the rest. ONE PUTT RICHIE chased running widest,
altered out abruptly upper stretch to keep a clear path outside DENNIS'S PRIDE and improved position without threatening the final furlong. DENNIS'S
PRIDE raced in contention while toward the outside, was four wide through the turn, altered out abruptly to keep a clear path outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE
upper stretch and faded. BLUE NORTHER bumped shortly after the break, jostled with ST. LOUIE LOUIE at the five-furlong marker, altered in some then
faded along the rail after three furlongs. FASTNFURIOUS displayed early speed just outside SPANISH DOUBLOON but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
MISS TENA MARIE was urged along and taken outside early on, advanced widest through the bend, took over just inside the last eighth then continued to
open up while kept to task to the wire. COLLECT A LIL pressed from just off the inside, angled out some on the turn, threatened four wide with a furlong to
go but could only pull clear for second the final sixteenth. HER NAME WAS LOLA shared the lead from outside, floated out some as she was roused leaving
the turn, moved ahead briefly then flattened out the last furlong. BLAZE BEAUTY prominent from inside, retreated after a quarter mile, improved position
upper stretch, angled toward the outside after entering the last furlong and was closing in for third late. TILL vied for the lead inside HER NAME WAS LOLA
to the lane, gave way and drifted out deep stretch. MOONSHINE MOLLY pressed the early pace while toward the outside then gave way between horses
on the bend. MAIRSILS FIRST was a contender from outside in the early going but faded three wide after three furlongs.
