Footnotes
CANYON DEL ORO bobbled at the start to be off a step slowly, slipped through along the rail on the turn and inched clear in the drive. DECK HUMOR vied
to mid stretch, was outclosed and earned place in a good effort. ZENFULLY ZESTY pressed the pace, challenged four across on the turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. POOF HE'S GONE vied for the lead while racing well off the rail, was in tight between horses on the turn,
fell back and faded from contention. SHELL GAME broke in the air to be off slowly, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. JAZZ TOWN raced close
to the pace, angled in on the backstretch, rallied along the rail on the turn to challenge for the lead, swung out entering the stretch and stopped.

UNUSUAL WIN pressed the pace towards the outside, rallied three across on the turn, was carried wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and drew off
under mild urging. RAINBOW CREST led early, vied to the turn, swung wide, fell back and was no match late. EL PATO lagged early, put in a steady effort
and was along for show while no threat to the top two. SHUG'S ROCKET threw his head at the start to be off slowly, quickly advanced along the inside to
contend and stopped in the upper stretch. AWESOME ACCOUNT pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. CHECKSFORCHARLIE hesitated at the
start, ran up behind horses and was checked on the backstretch, angled in and lacked a response. ATTILA'S FLAK was eased and walked off.

ATTILA'S ACE stumbled and bumped at the start, advanced outside, rallied on the turn, swung eight wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and drew off
under mild urging. STORMIN ATTILA broke out, set the pace, was headed near the sixteenth pole, outclosed and no match late. ATTILA'S BOY bumped at
the start, pressed the pace to the turn, weakened, faded and held for show. SPLISH SPLASH pressed the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn and
gave way. KAMMYS KASH was outrun in an even effort. HORNS N HALOS raced inside and had brief speed only. CHARLIE DYNASTY trailed the field.
