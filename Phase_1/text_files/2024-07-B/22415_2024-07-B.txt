BETTERLUCKNEXTTIME moved to lead four-wide, took short lead into turn, opened up late turn, held well. HE KNOWS WE KNOW forced pace five-wide
early, well placed outside turn, second best. MR. SPLASH had inside speed, drifted out late backstretch while racing greenly, bothering
PRINCEOFTHEPRAIRIE and forcing that one to check, well placed inside turn, finished evenly. PRINCEOFTHEPRAIRIE pressed off rail early, bothered,
and checked late backstretch, rallied belatedly. SMARTICUS pressed between horses, steadied late backstretch as part of the chain reaction that started
with MR. SPLASH, rallied mildly. MINI GLAZED DONUT had brief speed between horses, dropped back, faded. SHIZETTE broke a step slow, bumped with
PRINCEOFTHEPRAIRIE, trailed.
