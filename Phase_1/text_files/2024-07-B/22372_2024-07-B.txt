four wide into the second turn and gave way. VAI GATTINA was unhurried early from between rivals and never fired. LADY RAVEN was outrun early, raced
six wide through the second turn and flattened out. BELLA MAMA was reserved early, went three wide into the second turn and retreated. OSO was taken

Footnotes
SPENCER TIARA vied four abreast into the turn, dueled outside WAMPY around the bend, kicked away from that rival in upper stretch, held sway through
the wire under a drive. TABOO MISCHIEF veered inward at the start, very slow into stride trailed the field into the turn, under a stout drive in upper stretch,
rallied late along the inside. MAXS PICK pressed between early on, lost ground around the bend, finished off evenly through the wire. WAMPY vied
between runners into the turn, dueled inside of SPENCER TIARA around the bend, faded through the lane. REPPAZZ vied inside into the turn, under a
drive and under pressure around the bend, gave way through the stretch.
