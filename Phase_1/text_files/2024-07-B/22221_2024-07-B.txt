COUPERIN at the furlong marker, dug in gamely inside and narrowly held on. COUPERIN cleared the field entering the first turn, set the pace on the inside,
dueled past the quarter pole, could not stay with the winner at that point, then altered course outside at the furlong marker, came again, dug in gamely to the
finish and just missed. THE COLORA KID stalked three wide, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a rally in the stretch. PRALINE'S CAT steadied
at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn and bested the others. CODE NAME BRODY steadied on the first turn, pulled reluctant to
settle, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and gave way. QUIET REBEL raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry and
Jockey Objection by the runner up against the winner, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
LIL JERSEY GIRL tracked the pace from the three path, eased into contention nearing the quarter pole, bid outside rival in upper stretch, kicked clear under
a drive. After the race was transported off the track via equine ambulance. SIPPIN' TIME broke sharp, vied in the two path into the turn, battled inside
through the lane, stayed on well for the place. LUCKY IN LOVE slow from the gate, circled the field around the turn, split rivals leaving the quarter pole, and
finished up willingly to the wire. LADIDA broke sharp from the outside post, settled in off the pace and outside for the run into the turn, put to task leaving the
quarter pole, had no late response. HER LUCKY LOTTO chased the pace from between runners into the turn, lost ground under a drive around the bend,
flattened out through the stretch. ESTRELLIS broke slow, urged hard to gain position along the inside, shied away greenly inside while under urging around
the turn, had no late kick. REECE'S DRAMA very slow start, unhurried outside into the turn, never threatened. SHORT SHIP , was a step slow away from
the gate, rushed up along the inside, vied with outside rival around the bend, and steadily faded to the wire.
