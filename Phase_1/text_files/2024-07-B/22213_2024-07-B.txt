Footnotes
SHUDABEENACOWGIRL went after the pacesetter on the turn then wore down that rival late in a long drive. CHANCE OCCURRENCE angled inside
moving clear in the opening quarter, led until late but was nailed at the wire. BOND'S BELLE bumped about after the start, chased very wide, angled inside
in the stretch narrowing the gap. MOONLIT MAGIC flashed speed along the inside then faded on the turn. STAY OPPORTUNISTIC raced just off the pace
wide between foes and faltered. GO CHLOE GO dropped far back racing wide and was never a factor. UDIDN'TPAY bumped about early, moved inside
then gave way readily. THE GIRL'S NO JOKE bumped early, rushed to contention then stopped abruptly.

BE READY moved clear early, vied before the half and finished willingly to the finish. OBSTINATE was urged close up inside for half a mile and retreated.

RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY rated inside, bid into the stretch. drew clear and lasted while tiring late. HIBACHI well placed outside the dueling leaders, was carried
out badly at the top of the stretch and closed strongly just missing. JEBOLOGIST hustled clear early, vied before half a mile, bore out into the stretch and
tired. HIDDEN PROMISE forced the pace outside, was carried out at the top of the stretch and faltered. CORKMAN broke slowly, raced far behind and was
never a factor. THE TWINS SNEAKERS raced wide off the pace and weakened steadily.

inside with good late energy to gain the place. BIG JOHN dropped well behind between rivals then closed outside. SHADOW BOX flashed speed between
rivals down the backstretch and faded. DREAM KNIGHT pressed the winner outside for half a mile and gave way. POWER AGENDA dropped back after the

turn, bid into the stretch then flattened out. THESEGUYSGOTGAME raced close up inside awaiting room then faded when clear. CHASING STARDOM

Footnotes
WHAT DOES IT TAKE sprinted clear from the outside, widened on the final turn then just lasted while tiring late. MALIBU STAR trailed early, advanced
inside, swung wide in the stretch and closed strongly. THISTLE settled off the pace inside and made a gradual gain in the stretch. TREBLE CLEF rated just
off the pace, faded before half mile wide and lacked a bid. LAYTOWN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter for three quarters and weakened. CLASSIC
UNION stumbled badly at the start, rushed to contention then faltered. SIMOVITCH dropped back outside, bore out on the final turn and trailed.

LEGAL DEAL dueled outside, led narrowly in midstretch and held on determinedly in the late stages. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE saved ground throughout,
bid into the stretch, rallied and just missed. MIDNIGHT CAT earned a narrow advantage inside then battled very gamely to the finish. ROAN MOUNTAIN
chased outside, moved wide in the stretch with a mild rally. DISTURBED saved ground just off the leaders then flattened out in the stretch. SPLENDOR
BEAUTY stalked the dueling leaders three wide, bid on the final turn then weakened in the lane. BATTER UP BUD dropped far behind and was never in
contention. IRISH HONOR lacked speed, angled out after half a mile and gave way.
