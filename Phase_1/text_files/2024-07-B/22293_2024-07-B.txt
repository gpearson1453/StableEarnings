Footnotes
JANES GIRLS rated off the clear top pair around the first turn and up the backstretch, picked up the pace around the final turn, came three wide into the
upper stretch, took over a slim lead at the eighth pole, dug in under steady encouragement and prevailed. MISS CLASSIFIED dueled inside of RUN FOR
HOME around the first turn and into the backstretch, shook free with five furlongs left to run, held clear around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane,
got collared by JANES GIRLS near the furlong marker, fought back along the inside and held place. JOYFUL IMAGE settled off the pace into the first turn,
continued to rate off the early leaders up the backstretch, came under a ride along the rail around the final turn, cut the corner then tipped two wide for the
drive, closed gamely and just missed place. MEDICINE SHOW was well reserved in the back, saved ground, hustled up just off the inside heading into the
lane and failed to threaten. RUN FOR HOME dueled outside of MISS CLASSIFIED for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle for command to the
mid-way point up the backstretch, failed to move on with rival, chased around the far turn then dropped back.

LUCKYHOTSTUFF sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace, held firm over oncoming pursuers late on the turn, saved ground turning for
home, roused for more, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. BUG A BOO was unhurried and raced in the back, came under a ride around the
turn, swung into action three wide entering the lane, closed willingly and cleared second best. SABRIA chased in contention, edged closer racing three wide
late on the turn, sustained bid at the head of the lane then continued to chase after the pulling away winner and just lasted for a share. APRETTYLULABY
tracked the leader up the backstretch, edged closer two wide late on the turn, ran on near the inside into upper stretch then evened out and got outnodded
for show. ATHENAS SONG lost iron at the start, quickly regained equipment but was trailing at this point, hustled along and gamely moved into contention,
continued in range four wide into upper stretch then came up tired. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, AFTER REVIEW NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN

ANCHOR LINE was forwardly placed in opening stages racing just off the embattled pair, moved up to engage rivals for the lead past the half mile marker,
vied three deep into the turn, shook clear still unasked approaching the quarter pole, came three wide into upper stretch then angled in, widened advantage
willingly, tapped once past the furlong marker then remained clear while confidently handled. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE raced off the top trio in the early
going, was ridden along three wide late on the turn and sustained bid into the lane, roused forward to gain place and dug in to hold position late. YOUNG
JONESBORO raced outside of rival in the second flight late on the backstretch, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under a
drive and steadily edged up closer in late stages. CHEROKEE WILL vied for the lead in opening stages, could not move on with eventual winner
approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. SUIT ME UP CHARLIE vied for the lead in opening stages, was no match for eventual winner
approaching the quarter pole and tired in the drive.

PATMO sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, held clear around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, widened advantage a furlong out
and kept to task. BATTLESHIPPER was forwardly placed from the onset and tracked the leader around the turn, given cue two wide turning for home,
sustained a steady bid and secured second best. FRIENDLY SPIRIT sat off the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo late on the turn, hustled along
three wide into upper stretch and gained a share. MISS CONTROL FREAK raced near midpack, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch, ran on but
lacked the needed response for impact. WOMAN'S INTUITION was forwardly placed racing in close range of the early leader, chased inside around the turn
then weakened in the lane. NO MORE SHOTS sat off the early pace along the outside, was ridden along four paths wide into upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. P R THAT'S JUDY got bumped at the start and failed to move into contention. TRACIANA raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
ANNUAL BUDGET sped to the lead and took the inside position soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, edged ahead and held clear going
by the quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane, had plenty left in reserve and finished clear while ridden out. DEER RUN applied pace pressure to
ANNUAL BUDGET up the backstretch, could not remain in touch with eventual winner near the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and
secured second best. UNCLE SINGH raced in the second flight along the inside, had to wait for racing room near the quarter pole, angled inside for a clear
path in upper stretch, gained and held show in final stride. TEMPLE CITY RUN was allowed to settle out of the gate then moved up three wide to engage
the second flight, chased three wide around the turn, kept on into the lane and narrowly misdeed show. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced in the second flight in the
early going, weakened entering the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and had no late response. MILTON STREET raced up close three wide up the
backstretch, continued in close range around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
RUBYSA tracked the top trio up the backstretch, edged closer near the inside mid-way around the turn then tipped out a path and made a game bid
between foes past the furlong marker, advanced to duel for the lead at the head of the lane, vied between rivals then shook off inside foe, battled on racing
inside of SLUSHY, dug in gamely under firm handling, held a slight edge and outnodded rival in final stride. SLUSHY was forwardly placed from the onset
and raced three wide into the turn, moved up to challenge HOUSE WRECKER for the lead at the quarter pole, took on the added challenge of RUBYSA at
the head of the lane, battled three deep, shook off inside foe and kept on with RUBYSA, battled gamely and just missed. HOUSE WRECKER dueled inside
of FOOLISH INTENT for the lead up the backstretch, was engaged by SLUSHY at the quarter pole then took on the added challenge of RUBYSA at the
head of the lane, battled back gamely along the inside then failed to keep pace late. REINA DEL SUR was reserved and trailed in the back, picked up the
tempo along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner entering the stretch, took closer order then angled three wide and kept on with response. CHAI TEA
raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact. BAYSHORE FOXES raced off the early pace, chased along
the inside then swung four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FOOLISH INTENT dueled outside of HOUSE WRECKER for the lead up the
backstretch, battled on past the quarter pole then came up empty leaving the turn.
