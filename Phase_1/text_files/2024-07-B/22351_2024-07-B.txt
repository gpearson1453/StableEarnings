Footnotes
BETSY'S ALL IN raced within striking distance, moved up around the second turn, pulled away and won easily. YOSHIDA ROSE quickly went to the front,
saved ground, couldn't keep up with the winner, but was best of others. MALLORY'S OCEAN lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn,
gained ground and proved no match for the top two. SURPRISE SUNRISE bumped at the start, pressed the pace, raced outside around the second turn,
faded and finished evenly. HARD EXIT bumped start, showed early speed and retreated. ACCELERATEDVICTORY broke in, bumped rival, shuffled back
and was never a threat.

DEE'S LIL FOOL brushed at the start, pressed the pace, rallied down the lane and drove clear before the wire. DIAMOND COUNTRY vied for the early
advantage, took the lead, couldn't match strides late with the winner, but held on for second. CUSTOMERUNHAPPY lacked early speed, raced outside
around the turn, made a wide gain and was outfinished for third. DEBBO went to the front, saved ground, was forwardly placed throughout and weakened
down the home stretch. KAT'S PRINCESS raced within contention, weakened and finished evenly. KRAFTY TAFFY raced evenly near the back and was
never a factor. SILK NOT SATIN broke slow, bumped and was never a threat. FUNTASTIC TALE raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and
faded. ALESSANDE always raced near the back, saved ground and was never a threat.

match for the top two. NORTH OF BALI raced within striking distance, weakened and finished evenly. HE'S CHARMING lacked early speed, finished wide
and was never a factor. RUN BRYCE RUN raced evenly near the back and was never close. SEAVILLE always raced in the back and showed little.

Footnotes
VETERANS DAY unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and was going away at the end.
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. GOLD MERRITT
pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide and proved no match for the top two. BANKROLL challenged on the front end in the early part and faded
down the home stretch. CIGAR VAN lacked early speed and was never a factor. FLASHY PREMO trailed the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
HARD LUCK HENRY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, angled out down the lane, rallied and drove clear. DR. SNYDER lacked early speed,
moved up around the turn, made a wide rally and was a clear second at the wire. APRIORITY ROCKET broke a step slow, quickly rushed up, took
command, drove clear and weakened down the home stretch. ROCKING TOBE showed early speed, made a bid down the stretch, took the lead and faded.
COME ON COME ON raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside and was never a threat. WICKED TOUGH lacked early speed,
raced outside around the turn and showed little.
