Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY was sent hard from the gate, brushed with a rival while angling in quickly, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well
rated while showing the way down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, was asked a bit near the five-sixteenths pole,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, drew off under the crop until the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the
finish while much the best. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY settled near the back while saving ground, was ridden along on the far turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and was along for the place. AFTERNOON HEAT was forced in early, saved ground on the first turn, moved up to race just off the pace with
five furlongs to run, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the three path, pursued the winner into
the final furlong and weakened then lost the place while able to get the show. CLASSIC MARK bumped with a rival at the start, was forced in early then
steadied briefly, rounded the opening bend in the two path, was urged along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the far
turn, turned into the stretch in the four path, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. KHAFRE bumped with an opponent at the
start, was brushed by a foe while forced in early then steadied briefly, went around the first turn in the three path, settled comfortably off the pace, was urged
while moving from the three path to the five path on the far turn and failed to respond. ROCK THE WEEKEND raced in the two then three path on the first
turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the four then five path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and was no factor. BOURBON
CALLING was hustled from the gate, went five then four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the four path
on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and retreated. MASON MANIA went four then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, dropped back under urging in the three path on the far turn and also retreated.

Footnotes
PLAY FREE BIRD coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the quarter pole, angled out four wide
into upper stretch, had to tip out a path at the three-sixteenths as MAJULU got guided out to greet her, traded a bump with that rival a furlong out when
seizing command, came in under a right handed crop and herded her main danger in a path when head to head for command a sixteenth out, then gamely
bested that rival in the final jumps to the finish. MAJULU broke in at the start bumping SUPERSTARSUSAN, vied three wide despite a rating hold early on,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, got guided out a path to look
her main danger in the eye forcing that foe to alter slightly, dug in and traded a bump at the eighth pole when headed for command, continued on under a
drive dueling to the finish getting herded in a path before being steered out to hold her ground a sixteenth from home and was ultimately bested at the end.
SUPERSTARSUSAN got bumped solidly at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. INFLAMMABELLE bobbled at the break and recovered inwards bumping GALATRONA into
MAXING THE BANK, then tucked inwards after the start and forced GALATRONA to check off her heels and alter outwards, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. REALTA chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, improved position to the finish. MAXING THE BANK got bumped at the start by
GALATRONA due to pressure from INFLAMMABELLE, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. PUREST PERFORMANCE brushed the off side stall at the start, vied just off the inside
between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in the midst of being shaken off, swung four wide into upper stretch and took brief hold as PLAY
FREE BIRD tipped out in front, then weakened through to the finish. GALATRONA got bumped at the start by INFLAMMABELLE and in turn bumped
MAXING THE BANK, then got forced to steady off the heels of INFLAMMABELLE as that rival crossed in front after the start and altered out and conceded
four lengths in total after both incidents, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went seven wide
into upper stretch and weakened. STEPPIN' HAWK coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. GENEROUS LUVA vied
inside a pair from the get go coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and
tired. There was a Jockey' Objection by the rider of MAJULU alleging interference in the stretch against PLAY FREE BIRD. After review, the objection was
dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
WORLD RECORD went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while inside on the turn, responded well when put to a
left-handed crop in upper stretch, was given one final pop of the crop at the eighth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the finish while much
the best. JEFFERSON STREET was urged between foes early then ridden along off the pace, moved closer while dropping from the four path to the two
path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while well clear for the place. VALENTINE CANDY broke a bit
awkwardly but right with the front, was coaxed along on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, shifted to the three
then four path later on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DONEGAL MOMENTUM
followed the solo leader from second, dropped from the two path to the rail under urging on the turn and tired. PURE FORCE was urged along off the pace,
went around the turn in the two to three path and capitulated.

Footnotes
TOUGH STREET coaxed from the gate, crossed to the three path forcing STONEWALL STAR into MOVIE MOXY before pinching back STONEWALL
STAR, then continued inside to force MOVIE MOXIE to steady out when crossing directly in front of that rival in the two path, tucked inside into the
backstretch and showed the way in hand through sensible splits patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish to prevail. OCCULT bobbled at the break, chased along the
inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to
go and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CHI TOWN LADY broke out at the start, raced five then four wide through the first turn and then
chased four then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. STONEWALL STAR
got pinched back after the start when TOUGH STREET tucked in front briefly forcing her to jostle with MOVIE MOXY, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOVIE MOXY jostled with STONEWALL
STAR just after the start due to pressure from TOUGH STREET to the outside, won the battle for the two path briefly before that same rival, TOUGH
STREET tucked in front of her forcing her to steady when also pinched back with seven furlongs to go, chased briefly three wide before tipping four wide
down the backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
ROYAL BROWNE established a forward position early, raced in the three then four path on the first turn, tossed his head some while tugging eagerly on the
bit early on the backstretch, was rated on the outside, advanced in the three path on the far turn, made a bid in the four path while roused at the
quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong then drew clear under good handling. CASH BAIL showed
speed on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path on the first turn, moved clear late on that bend, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while
inside on the far turn, spun off the rail into the stretch then lost the advantage, kept on while drifting out in the final furlong and willingly earned the place
while no match for the winner. SWEET TONE rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was roused nearing
the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved to get the show. OUTTAWATERBURY broke out at the start, raced in the three path
on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two then three path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the four path and
lacked the needed kick. JUDGE RULES rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace, was asked in the four path on the far turn, moved
closer in the process, came into the stretch in the six path, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out. FELINE TREASURE
saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, raced inside on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole and came up empty. DYNA POINT was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved from the rail to the three path late on the first turn, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover,
was roused in the four then five path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the six path and failed to threaten. TONY O unseated his rider during the
warm-up, saved ground under tight restraint on the first turn, raced off heels onto the backstretch, was reserved off the pace, passed the seven-sixteenths
pole between horses, raced in the two then three path on the final turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. FLUORESCENT BAY
moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, came under urging while in the three then four path on the final turn, was
driven into the stretch in the five path and failed to rally. SEVENTH RACE SHAKE was fractious in the gate then backed out and re-loaded, showed speed
on the inside of an opponent while along the rail, was taken back off the pace late on the first turn then shifted to the three path, stalked the pace on the
outside, chased in the two path on the far turn and tired.

ACCELERATING cut the pace from the two path under pressure from MISS WELCH to the outside shaking away from the field, tucked to the inside into the
turn had that foe advance at the seven-sixteenths and widened away from the rest while dueling through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch
roused, shook off her main pace rival with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages to the finish. OFF
SCRIPT lunged at the break and was bumped by SPEED AND BEAUTY, who came inwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. MISS WELCH coaxed from the start, pressed the
pace of the top one while three to four paths off the rail shaking away as a tandem from the rest of the field, advanced with seven-sixteenths to go and
dueled tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was let out spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, got
shaken off with three-sixteenths to run and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. OPEN FLAME brushed the near side stall at the
start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SOMEONE lunged and struck the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside and then
along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SPEED AND BEAUTY lunged at the break
and came inwards bumping OFF SCRIPT, then got steadied five and a half furlongs from home when rivals crossed in front, chased six paths off the inside
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. HORSEPLAY got bumped
after the start by OFF SCRIPT, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.
SELECTIVELY SWEET broke in at the start under coaxing, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch and faltered.

BETTER BET dropped back early, was unhurried at the rear while inside to the two path, came under coaxing while moving from the two path to the three
path on the final turn, angled six wide late on that bend, rallied outside into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, gained to make a bid outside
the sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail. L'ANTHARIS (FR) was taken in hand early then reserved in the two to three path, picked up stride while let out on
the final turn, brushed with a rival while coming four wide into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, led into the final sixteenth but
was caught while just able to get the place. BE LIKE CLINT dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, traveled
around the second in the three path, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged along in the four then five path on the far turn, brushed with a foe in
upper stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole but missed while able to secure the show. VESTING (IRE) went to the front, was well rated
while setting the pace in the two path, responded well when set down after turning into the stretch the final time, led under the crop until near the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to save the last spot in the superfecta. HARRY HOOD rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved
on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, moved out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick then just missed the superfecta.
HAMILTON'S WAY showed speed on the inside of a foe, tossed his head while wrestled back off the pace early on the first turn, saved ground while rated,
came under encouragement on the final turn, chased the leader in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ANTHEM KING was last into stride, settled on
the outside while three to four wide on the turns, was roused on the final bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back between horses into
the final furlong and weakened. AU PARADIS was taken under tight restraint early then reserved in the three path, tugged hard on the bit early down the
stretch for the first time, continued in hand while tracking the leader, came under urging on the final turn, dropped back into the stretch and had nothing left.

SURVEILLANCE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
just inside the sixteenth marker, then dug in game to hold on over a late closing rival. RUNNINGWSCISSORS chased three then four wide coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, came in under urging and impeded LET IT RIDE and was clipped behind by that rival with
three-sixteenths to go while also forcing SILARDI to pause to that rival's inside, closed well through to the finish and missed at the end. FORE HARP
hustled from the gate, vied inside a trio briefly early on before shaking away inside through the turn, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the
corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth pole, then ran on to preserve the show honors. RUN CURTIS RUN
hustled from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a
furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. MARKET STREET coaxed from the gate, vied three wide early on before chasing three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. THRILL OF IT chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. FAUCI chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, began to tip out to get ca clear lane when LET IT RIDE was impeded and clipped heels and fell,
continued to alter out at the three-sixteenths continuing his outward momentum and was able to avoid contact with the fallen foe, then got eased home to
the finish having lost chance to mount a rally. SILARDI vied between foes briefly from the two path and then gave chase just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, got paused at the three-sixteenths when LET IT RIDE was impeded just to
the outside as RUNNINGWSCISSORS came inwards, then tired through to the finish. LET IT RIDE vied four wide briefly before chasing four wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, had RUNNINGWSCISSORS come in directly in front at the
three-sixteenths and was impeded and clipped the back of that rival and fell heavily at that station, then got up and was examined by veterinarian and
walked off to the main course before being transported off the main track by the equine ambulance. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the incident at the
three-sixteenths. After review, it was determined that RUNNINGWSCISSORS had impeded LET IT RIDE and RUNNINGWSCISSORS was disqualified from

Footnotes
SCOTLAND was asked leaving the gate, tracked the pace on the outside while traveling comfortably, ranged up in the three path on the turn, made a bid
outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead near the quarter-pole then kicked clear in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop near the furlong
marker, was given one final tap of the crop nearing the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. ACCRETIVE was coaxed along off the pace,
moved out from the two path to the four path on the turn, was roused late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second
best. CASTLE CHAOS bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four then five path, turned into the stretch
in the seven-path and lacked the needed response while along for the show. RUNNINSONOFAGUN broke in then was hustled, bumped with a rival shortly
after the start, settled towards the rear, moved closer while inside on the turn, shifted to the two path outside the quarter-pole, moved out while asked for his
best in upper stretch, shifted further out approaching the furlong marker and also lacked the needed response. THREE TECHNIQUE bumped with a rival at
the start then was pinched back between horses, moved in under urging around the five-eighths pole, shifted from the two path to the four path early on the
turn, swung six wide into the stretch then came between foes and failed to rally. ZOZOS broke in then was hustled, bumped with a foe entering the
main-track then was taken in hand, dropped back some under reserve, was urged along in the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
came up empty. FACTUALLY CORRECT brushed with a rival while showing speed entering the main-track, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. GENERAL JIM bumped with a rival after the start, moved out while
urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and also came up empty. MAJOR BLUE bobbled at the start then was
sent hard, showed speed then pressed the leader on the outside, vied in the two path for most of the turn, moved to the three path while dropping back
outside the quarter-pole and capitulated.

Footnotes
RHETORICAL reared up prior to loading when a bit fractious as rivals grew fractious in the gate, broke a half a beat slow at the start getting away last and
came under light coaxing to advance near the first turn, went five then four wide into that turn impeding HARD PAR and forcing that rival to bobble when
altering over his back heels into the turn, tucked three wide and chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole advancing on the
leader, swung six wide into upper stretch and drifted out at the three-sixteenths before coming under correction with a right handed crop, seized command a
furlong out, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. SEBASTIANTHE FIRST grew fractious and broke open his stall door prior to the start, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to take command swinging five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared a furlong out, proved no match for the top one while running on to safely preserve the place honors on the wire over a pair of foes. HARD PAR
away in mid pack, was outside a trio four wide heading into the first turn when RHETORICAL tucked directly in front, was impeded and forced to alter over
the heels of that rival five to six wide into the first turn, tucked quickly four then three wide, chased three wide down the backstretch and then just of the
inside through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to just get up for the show
honors on the line. FILM ACADEMY got bumped at the start by WIND DANCER, who broke inwards, went two then three wide through the first turn then
chased just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in
the late stages and was nailed for the show honors. WIND DANCER fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke in at the start bumping FILM ACADEMY,
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. ISOMARSHALL
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. ALPHA CAT
chased along the inside, grew rank along the hedge when in tight and was steadied six and a half furlongs out, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled three wide into upper stretch and weakened. FERRIS MULER bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside and then inside and grew rank when
steadied six and a half furlongs from home, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. THE MANTICORE just off the inside through the first turn, cut the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when
under threat, got displaced spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. VISIONS TO REALITY chased two to three wide through
the first turn and then four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung
five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of HARD PAR alleging interference against RHETORICAL
into the first turn. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.
