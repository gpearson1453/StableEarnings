Footnotes
AWESOME RAINBOW bobbled slightly on the start, settled into stride trailing down the backstretch, was nudged for more between horses in the two path at
the quarter pole, had no running room when blocked behind the tiring early leaders in upper stretch, found a seam by the eighth pole and shot on by in the
two path with a strong late kick. DROP YOUR GLOVES had a good spot, tucked in behind the dueling leaders in the early going, crept closer, measuring
the engaged duo on the turn, shifted out four wide closing in by upper stretch but was no match for the winner who was full of run in deep stretch. DADDY
HAS DIAMONDS was situated outside rivals in mid-division down the backstretch, picked up the bit when scrubbed on between foes at the five sixteenths
pole, loomed a threat in the five path straightening out for home, did not have enough to threaten the top two late but was a clear third at the finish line. MAD
CHATTER was in hand near the rear three deep on the outside, circled four wide around horses in midturn, angled out with momentum in the six path for
the drive and finished up willingly to settle on the fringes in the end. OK SPEEDY settled in mid-pack insides foes down the backside, kept pace while taking
the shortest way around through the turn, lacked running room on the rail in mid-stretch, was checked and could not regroup in time to be a factor. THREE
O EIGHT pressed the issue inside down the back straight, battled determinedly on the rail around the bend, had a slim advantage on the fence turning for
home but folded with a furlong to run. SAINT GRAAL CHEVAL broke out to begin, pulled the rider to the lead outside of runners, dueled outside up front
throughout the turn, had no more to offer in the stretch drive and was engulfed by challengers on both sides at the furlong marker. GEE POWER tracked the
leaders while outside of rivals along the backside, was hard ridden but could not keep up with others with three furlongs to go and backed away between
horses by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
FRAC RIGHT broke sharp for control down the backstretch, set the pace comfortably while hounded outside in the turn, was headed briefly in upper stretch,
patiently rationed out his speed to keep rivals at bay down the lane and kept on going to the wire for the win. MATICULANT sat on the rail just behind the
pacesetter for most of the race, never wavered down the stretch, kept on chasing the frontrunning winner to the wire, could not reel him in but still fought on
to best the rest when crossing the finish line. SECRET THREAT stalked on the fence close to the back of the pack, made little movement around the turn,
shifted out three wide for the stretch run, switched leads at the furlong marker and closed in sharply late to capture the show money. CELENTANO watched
the frontrunner outside down the backside, closed the gap to bid for the lead with five sixteenths to go, was repelled by the winner in mid-stretch and stalled
between foes late to settle for a minor role in the end. AGILE DANCER settled near the back, leading the trail group down the backstretch, stalked outside in
the fourth flight on the turn, shifted out to the four path in the drive to the line and finished with interest down the stretch. ROAD TO VERSAILLES was
unhurried to trail in the beginning, stalked on the rail making little progression through the turn and in the two path, passed tired runners in mid-stretch.
CANADIAN AVRO had a tracking role between rivals down the backstretch, continued outside watching the front two around the bend, moved closer to
pose a threat, five wide straightening out for home but yielded outside at the furlong marker. FAST AND READY settled in mid-pack between runners down
the backside, went evenly around the turn keeping positioning, was in range for a share on the fence in upper stretch but had little to offer in the drive to the
finish line. BENLION stalked three deep outside near the rear, co-trailed outside a foe through the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the stretch
running but lacked a rally outside horses down the lane. CAUGHT SPEEDING travelled three deep outside runners in midfield, kept pace and position
around the turn, angled out in the five path for the drive but failed to fire running to the wire.

Footnotes
KEKOA was nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter, waited for his cue on the rail through the turn, pounced three wide, splitting runners in upper stretch
and had more, when asked to draw away in deep stretch. TIERNAN pressed the pace outside in the beginning, moved in two wide to bid outside by the
quarter pole, took the lead straightening out for the drive, could not fend off the winner who had an ideal trip late and stubbornly held for the place share in
the end. MAGIC POWER tracked the lead two outside along the backside, took closer order by the quarter pole, joined the fray up front in the four path to
battle up top straightening out for the stretch battle, determinedly ran to the wire and just missed getting up for the place share. ZONE CONTROL sat alone
in midfield down the back straight, started to put in a rally with five sixteenths to go, narrowed the margin shifting to the four path turning for home but was
could only finish up one paced to the wire for a minor role. GOLDEN TEST stalked close to the back inside a runner in the early going, saved ground, but
made no impact through the turn and finished with energy to close the gaps on rivals down the lane. HUNDRED PERCENT stalked near the rear outside a
runner down the backstretch, could not get involved around the bend and failed to menace in the stretch run. AFLEET PRINCE seized the lead down the
backstretch, edged away midway on the turn, was collared outside at the quarter pole, offered no resistance, began to shorten stride and stopped at the
furlong marker. BAPTIST BILLY broke with the field, checked soon after the break, trailed throughout but did show interest on the fence in deep stretch,
finding his best stride late.

Footnotes
ITS TIME TO SHINE set the pace from outside, shifted in a bit heading into the turn while clear racing nearer the rail, kicked away again from nearest
pursuers in upper stretch, held safe while kept to the task. SPEEDEEMAN bumped with a rival and steadied at the start, was in tight in behind runners soon
after and taken hold of, steadily advanced outside five wide on the turn, had aim in upper stretch, gained steadily and slowly but was not enough. THE NEW
MAYBE bumped the inside foe at the start, settled mid-pack, went three to four wide on the turn making a mild advance, ran on evenly in the stretch, just
held show. PIN BOY was unhurried racing off the inside, swung six deep for the drive, ran on in the stretch but missed show honors. FROST BITTEN
exchanged light contact early, stalked mid-pack mostly two to three wide through the turn, failed to menace. FRACEN MACHO was bumped between foes
at the start, gained forward position, stalked the eventual winner, was three wide coming to the quarter pole and within striking distance but weakened in the
stretch. FOCUSYN was bumped by a rival then brushed with a different foe at and after the start, was forwardly-positioned stalking between runners, was in
tight near the half exchanging more minor contact and checked while getting squeezed back, failed to rally thereafter. ALPHA MEISTER hesitated at the
start, was in tight past the half, shuffled back to the rear, switched out, swung six wide, did not make a bid. IRISH RAIDER bumped a rival at the start, was
forwardly positioned chasing inside, tired.

RED SAMURAI was away alertly to take control, getting to the rail for the lead, dictated terms throughout the turn, drifted out when clinging to the lead
driving to the wire in deep stretch and held on for the win by a diminishing margin in the end. MY SUNNY VALENTINE prompted the pace outside down the
backside, chased the pacesetting winner around the turn, kept on grinding while in the mix up front three wide in the stretch duel and just missed while being
pushed out nearing the wire. WICKED MERCURY was brushed on the break, stalked three wide between rivals early on, was roused three wide at the
quarter pole beginning to lengthen stride, shifted out in the five path by mid-stretch and with a late surge, closed in to capture third money. SOUPER
FLASHY broke out on the start, travelled on the rail in midfield down the back straight, took closer order behind the frontrunner around the bend, shifted out
for clear running room two wide at the top of the lane and determinedly fought on but had to settle for a fringe effort in the end. SOCIETY'S KAT watched
the front pair while three deep outside rivals along the backside, made a brief run three wide around horses commencing at the three eighths marker,
loomed a menacing presence. FLYING BLACK settled in mid-pack between foes in the two path down the backstretch, made no impression on the rail
through the turn, had little to give turning for home and was not persevered with in the final sixteenth of a mile. GIZMO'S B F F was checked when in tight
between runners leaving the chute, trailed early, still could see the field but was not far off when the field bunched up at the half, had no run to offer, lagging
around the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #5 MY SUNNY VALENTINE AGAINST #7 RED SAMURAI IN

Footnotes
AMERICAN DECISION was up close stalking three deep up the backstretch, came out further at the quarter pole with aim, kept on steadily and surged late
to get up. RAPID GREY stalked while kept wide going four deep into the turn, took the lead about the three-eighths, moved clear in the stretch while coming
in a bit, was outfinished but second best. WELLER GREEN settled off the pace inside, saved ground, came out for the drive, kept on willingly to secure
show. BEYOND ADVERSITY stalked from outside mid-pack, moved out from four to six wide leaving the turn, ran on in the stretch but needed more.
OSCARSSON settled well back, advanced while moving out four to seven wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. RAYMORE chased mid-division three
to four wide, steadied about the five- and one-half when in tight and dropped back several positions, angled out at the top of the stretch and ran on late but
needed more. RUNNING LIGHTS broke just a step slowly and was devoid of early speed, was never near enough to threaten. TUTTI CONTENTI chased
from between foes early, raced mostly three to five wide, came up empty. MY VOODOO DOLL was coaxed forward from the break and quickly took the
lead, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was challenged.

Footnotes
FIGHTER IN THE WIN was brushed between horses to start, stalked outside in the middle of the pack, started to rally four wide circling foes midpoint on the
turn, continued to pick up horses outside through the lane and wore down the leader at the seventy yards pole to edge away for the victory. CRUMLIN LAD
pressed the pace outside in the beginning, was then content to watch the frontrunner by the half, took command outside midpoint on the turn, gamely held
off the eventual winner until the sixteenth pole and kept trying late, to save for the place share at the wire. FOREST BUZZ vied between rivals in the early
going, was reined back to track the lead duo at the half, was scrubbed on for more but could not go on with the winner who was on the outside at the quarter
pole, kept on fighting to the finish line and just missed for the place share when crossing the finish line. SILENT SUNDAY travelled on the rail in
mid-division, made a quick burst to get a better inside placing with seven sixteenths to go, lost some positioning on the fence around the bend and, was in
range in the two path turning for home and was gaining gradually on the fence late but lost the three way photo for second money. STEAK AND CHEESE
stalked outside ahead of only one rivals in the backstretch running, made little headway three outside foes through the turn, angled out picking up steam five
wide down the stretch, was closing the gap late but could not improve position in the end. MOON LANDING was unhurried to trail in the early going, closed
the margin on the leaders by midturn travelling on the fence, was gradually gaining inside down the lane, lost his path coming up to a tired runner at the
furlong marker, switched outside late but lost his momentum in the stretch running. CLASSIC DANCER had a slim lead on the rail down the backside,
inched away up front at the half, was collared outside with five sixteenths from home, fought on until the furlong marker on the fence and retreated in deep
stretch inside.

PATCHES O'HOULIHAN brushed lightly with a foe at the start and was urged forward, quickly moved clear, set the pace near the inside, drew away coming
into upper stretch, held well under steady but moderate handling. SOUPED UP was up close tracking inside, saved ground on the turn, fought on in deep
stretch to retake the place while no threat to the winner. RAT PORTAGE moved out on the turn racing mid-pack in the two then three path, came to the top
of the stretch four wide and full of momentum but evened out and lost place late. MASON'S GAMBLE settled at the back, saved ground on the turn, came
out a bit in the stretch and closed willingly for a minor award. SECRET RESERVE settled off the inside and well back, raced in the three to four path through
the turn coming out a bit more for the drive, ran on. LAST AMERICAN EXIT chased up close into the turn three to four wide, lost ground on that bend
dropping back, was floated six deep turning for home, had no late bid. POSEIDON STEEL failed to threaten racing at the back and off the inside.
RELOAD'S RASCAL was brushed lightly at the start, raced up close, chased the eventual winner three wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
NIAGARA SKYLINE rated kindly in behind the stablemate in the early stages of the race while under a snug hold, was let out a notch at the quarter pole,
moved in quickly while allowed to drift out four wide turning for home, switched leads in mid-stretch and took off under mild urging for the score. CLEAR
DESTINATION stalked inside foes down the backside, began to weave through runners three furlongs from home, inched closer when roused at the quarter
pole, began to extend his stride while two wide straightening out for the drive and finished up smartly to capture the place share. BOSTON TEA PARTY was
loose up top into the first turn, continued on the lead while slowing the pace down through the back straight, was headed outside at the quarter pole,
hugging the rail into the lane but faded late to be a clear third. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT tracked three wide between rivals in the first turn, stalked outside in the
third tier down the backstretch, was hard ridden keeping pace in the far turn, jumped a shadow inside the quarter pole, angled out six wide turning for home
but was one paced in the lane to settle for a minor role. ELUSIVE KNIGHT co-trailed on the inside at the half mile marker, was urged for more when shifting
out at the quarter pole, started to gather speed outside in the five path in upper stretch and was running well on end in deep stretch. WHISPER NOT (GB)
tracked outside in the five path into the first turn, improved three deep along the backside to watch the front pair heading into the final bend, was moving well
to be in range of the leaders four wide entering the lane but could not find more late and stalled with a furlong remaining. PERFECT CRIME stalked outside
down the back straight, could not quicken with the field at the three furlong pole, was fanned out in the six path for the drive could not get into contention,
running to the wire. BODE'S TIPSY settled on the rail in the third flight, improved some when stalking in the middle of the pack on the fence down the
backside, was asked right-handed for more at the quarter pole, could not rally with the outside rivals and was picked up by challengers to lose some more
placings late. LUCKMAN had an awkward start to begin, co-trailed on the outside in the early stages outside, could not offer a rally three wide around the far
turn and failed to get into involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
INDIAN PEAK stalked in the third flight with rivals on either side down the backstretch, smartly started to circle around foes at the half, loomed boldly three
wide straightening out for home, seized command at the eighth pole outside, had duel to the wire with the relentless frontrunner late but did prevail at the
line. SIR SEAMUS broke sharp to comfortably have command down the backside, picked up the pace, playing catch me if you can around the turn, was
collared by the winner at the furlong marker outside, tenaciously dug in on the fence in the final eighth, fought on stubbornly inside to the wire but was
denied at the finish line by the winner. LAPOCHKA stalked near the rear between runners down the backside, started to unleash a run, four wide around
rivals three furlongs from the line, swung out gaining more momentum in the seven path at the top of the stretch, battled valiantly outside for the show award
to the wire and under a gutsy effort from the veteran won the nod for third place at the finish line. SOULMATE travelled outside foes in midfield in the early
stages, started to go past horses three furlongs from the wire, kept on coming while four wide in the lane, could not reel in the front dup late, battled with an
outside foe for the third money but just missed by a dirty nose photo in the end. DECIMATOR stalked on the fence near the rear in the beginning, made little
progress, saving ground around the bend, swung out widest at the top of the lane in the eight path and finish with intent passing rivals to the wire. MAD
DOG N JOE chased the leader with runners on both side down the backside, continue on the rail trying to keep up with frontrunner around the bend, was no
match in the two path when others were making a move turning for home, lost his path three wide at the three sixteenths marker, shifted out to be six wide
but evened out and could no play a role in the final furlong. PROVEN STRATEGIES settled on the rail in midfield down the backstretch, shifted just outside
trying to make a rally three furlongs out, angled out six wide in upper stretch, was checked briefly when losing its path three sixteenths from the line and
offered no finish afterwards. SPIRIT ANIMAL trailed on the fence in the backside, continued to see the field outside with a partner to his inside three furlongs
out, angled out in the six path for the run to the wire, lugged in at the furlong marker and could not offer a finish. MIGHTY SEA stalked three deep outside
rivals while ahead of only one runner down the backside, co-trailed inside three eighths from home, shifted out four wide in the lane put could not put in a
stretch rally. FORESTER HUMOR was part of the chasing group in the early going, travelling on the rail, began to show signs of weakness on the fence by
the half and backed away on the rail in upper stretch. SMALL TALK watched the pacesetter three deep on the outside down the backstretch, continued to
track the frontrunner outside a rival in the turn, sat just behind the leader straightening out to the wire to have a chance for a share, but had little left for the
drive and stopped at the furlong marker.
