Footnotes
NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK was unruly in the gate, missed the break, advanced steadily to make the lead three wide at the top of the stretch and drew off
late under right handed urging. THELMA LUCILLE was bumped and squeezed between rivals entering the first turn, loomed boldly two wide on the second
turn then was no match for the winner in the final stages. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA also bumped and squeezed entering the clubhouse turn, steadied behind
the tiring SOMETHING LUCKY while along the rail entering the far turn then came on again late for a minor share. VICTORIA COMMAND dueled for the
lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch then weakened readily. SOMETHING LUCKY drifted out a bit and bumped rivals entering the first turn,
matched strides along the inside for nearly five furlongs then gave way. THIRTY SOMETHING vied for the lead three wide for six furlongs then came up
empty. RALPH'S LIL' VICKY was outrun. DEBBIE'S DREAM was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

TOYI pressed the early pace three then two wide, rallied in the four path to make the lead past the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the seven path at the top of
the stretch and shook clear late under strong handling. GIZMO'S MISSION set the pace along the inside past the five sixteenths pole then couldn't handle
the winner. ON HIS TOES vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch, altered course to the eight path giving up ground then had a mild late gain.
ARMOR PIERCING with the second flight two wide, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack in upper stretch then finished evenly. THE RED MAN was
restless in the gate and never threatened. UNCAPTURED LYON raced wide and was never involved.

WINDY LU WHO allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide on the far turn to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace, shook
clear under left handed urging and was taken in hand in the final strides. LA ROSA unhurried early, advanced in the five path into the stretch and finished
well clear for second. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE chased the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly two wide between rivals then faded in deep stretch. HIGH FIRE
was no factor. TWENTY FOUR KARAT sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly six furlongs then was used up. POWER
BANKER was through after a half.

VOORHEES drifted out at the start and was quickly righted, advanced steadily along the rail to make the lead near mid turn, shook clear in upper stretch
and lasted under right handed urging. SKYHOOPER chased the pace two wide, loomed boldly midway on the turn, drifted to the five path while giving up
ground to the winner, the rider lost his whip near mid stretch then came on again under a strong hand ride and just missed in a determined effort.
SERGEANT COUNTZLER within striking distance while racing outside, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack on the turn, shifted inside RANSAM
PAYNTER after giving up ground then closed rapidly in the six path through deep stretch and just missed. RANSAM PAYNTER hopped at the start, sprinted
to a clear lead soon thereafter, got out on the turn and into the stretch and dropped out of it.

Footnotes
VERBIER away alertly, set all pace, widened into the stretch under right handed urging and won easily. JOHNNNY'S GAME was bumped at the start,
tracked the pace along the inside, dug in late and got up for second. STEVIE T never far back, offered a mild bid three wide into the far turn then was
outfinished for second. SIR stalked the pace four then three wide and was outfinished in a determined effort. GOTTA GO GATOR bobbled outward bumping
JOHNNY'S GAME at the start and was no threat. ELEGGUA had brief speed. MARSICO chased the early pace three wide and was through after a half.
