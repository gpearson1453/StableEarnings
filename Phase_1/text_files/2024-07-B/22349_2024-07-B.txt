Footnotes
PROMISE ME KAT went up to take control and set the pace outside APPLE VALLEY GIRL, cleared that rival early on the turn, confronted by SWIFT
HARMONY at the quarter pole, inched clear again at the eighth pole and held off the late challenge from TROPICAL RAIN DAY nearing the wire.
TROPICAL RAIN DAY bobbled leaving the gate, climbed a bit early, chased two wide earl on the bend, angled out to the five path, came with a late rally but
could not go by the winner. RECYCLEYOURHEART broke a bit slow, chased along the inside, took hold near the seven-sixteenths pole, came off the rail
around the bend and entered the lane three wide, closed well and gained third. APPLE VALLEY GIRL pressed from inside, got crowded a bit near the
three-eighths pole, checked behind the leader around the bend, cornered nicely into the lane and kept on for a minor award. SWIFT HARMONY came away
quickly while breaking outward, stalked the top pair outside a rival to the turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost touch with the leader a
furlong out and flattened to fifth. WARRENS FIFI broke a step slow, sat off the pace, traveled three, four, then five wide on the turn and improved position.
DYIN A THIRST dropped back under coaxing early, chased in the four path entering the turn, angled to the inside around the bend, moved back out in
upper stretch and could not rally. PEBBLES B AWESOME broke a bit slow, traveled out of range off the rail, angled from the three path to the two path
before steering back out, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. LONG LEGGED BABS bobbled a bit at the start, stalked along the rail, shifted to the
two path around the bend and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BIG MAMA SUE tracked in the two path, between rivals in the middle stages, continued in the two path on the far turn then cut to the inside, hugged the rail
into the lane, moved out and launched a bid, drew alongside the leader approaching the sixteenth pole, took over shortly after and held in the closing
moments. ANKYRAH sat off the pace along the inside, got floated out by inner rival and had to steady off heels past the five-sixteenths pole, cut back inside
entering the lane, angled out and came with a late run but missed. IN YOUR FACE also sat off the pace in the early going, traveled two to three wide on the
far turn, found brief traffic in upper stretch, moved out into the clear and finished well for a game third. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) cleared from outside and
crossed over, took pressure at the midway point, gained a clear lead around the far turn, confronted by BIG MAMA SUE midstretch and yielded to the top
trio. ZEYARAAT traveled near the back on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, chased three deep at the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and kept
on through the final furlong. MADIHA raced keenly outside a rival in a forward position early, went up to press the pace between rivals at the halfway point,
lost touch with the leader on the far turn, chased two wide turning for home and weakened. SKY MAKER allowed to settle at the back and moved inside,
tipped two wide on the far turn, angled out in the lane and passed tired rivals. CHASINGSERENDIPITY settled outside a pair of rivals, moved closer in the
middle stages, rounded the far turn four wide and flattened out. TIERGARTEN stalked two then three wide early, continued three wide and between rivals
on the far turn, then weakened in the drive. VRONSKY FEINT chased up close on the inside then had to checked when put in tight by outer rival and began
to pull, settled down on the backstretch stalking inside a pair of rivals, got put in tight twice on the far turn and was not persevered with down the lane.

Footnotes
SHEA BRENNAN broke slow and lost his path at the start, trailed in hand early, ridden a bit cautiously along the rail into the turn, gained while easing over
to the two path around the bend, tipped out and drew alongside the leader and drove clear to prove best. NAP went up to vie for the lead inside rivals, took
over nearing the turn, cleared outer rivals midway around the bend, could not offer any resistance to the winner midstretch and stayed on for a clear second.
WHISKYGINANDBRANDY vied between rivals, pressed the leader into the turn, lost touch with that rival nearing the quarter pole, chased three wide into
the lane and held third. THREE GEORGES settled outside rivals then was ridden along leaving the backstretch, took the turn five to six wide and offered a
mild response to round out the superfecta. WHISKEYINATEACUP showed brief speed three deep between rivals then chased the top trio to the turn,
rounded the bend in the three path and weakened in the lane. GOZER bumped leaving the gate, drifted in and bumped again early, chased four then five
wide on the turn before angling inward, kept trying to the lane but was unable to threaten. FAR OVER LOADED bumped leaving the gate then bumped with
GOZER again early, chased under coaxing two wide into the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. FAR WESTERN raced up close five
then four deep, lost ground still out wide on the turn and faded in the lane. SIR TOM vied four then three deep up the backstretch, could not keep up with
the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, remained wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
CORSO'S PICK broke alertly to take the front, set the pace along the inside through the turn, challenged by A DAY TO REMEMBER at the top of the
stretch, held a short lead with rivals bearing down on both sides into deep stretch and held gamely to the line. PROSPER broke in and bumped rival, chased
from inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, challenged inside the top pair in deep stretch but could not get by the winner. A DAY TO REMEMBER bumped
leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit from the two path, bid from outside at the top of the stretch, fought three deep late and lacked the needed late
punch. ANDREADYTORUMBLE traveled in mid-pack, saved ground around the bend, moved out in the fence and showed late effort to close the gap.
RUNNING SPARTAN got pinballed leaving the gate, raced near the back in the early stages, went two wide into the turn then moved inside, steered out in
the lane and came rallied late. LAUGIER NIGHT (IRE) got bumped hard in the beginning, sat off the pace on the inside, bothered by outer rival near the
seven-sixteenths pole, tipped three wide around the bend and produced a mild late bid. OSAGE CREEK broke well then chased the speed outside a rival,
continued two wide to the stretch and lacked the needed response. SEMPER INVICTUS bumped inner rival leaving the gate, raced off the pace outside a
rival, took the turn two to three wide and was not a factor. ZISKEY (IRE) off slow to begin, trailed on the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SPIRIT grabbed the early lead and moved inside, dueled with SPEED GRAZY on the backstretch, inched ahead nearing the far turn, maintained a
short lead through the bend, dug in under right then left handed urging and gamely prevailed. SPEED GRAZY raced up close in the four path around the
clubhouse turn, headed the leader and dueled up the backstretch, pressed that rival from the two path to the stretch, fought through the lane but lacked the
needed late kick to overtake the winner. BRAZENLY showed early speed three wide into the first turn then chased around the bend, raced outside a pair of
rivals in the middle stages, rounded the far turn two then three wide, kept on trying in the lane for a clear third but could not threaten the top pair. CITY OF
ANGELS stalked in the two path between rivals, moved inside entering the far turn, faded in the lane but saved a minor placing. TOM AND JAZZY tossed
his head and bobbled leaving the gate, tracked three then four wide around the first turn, angled to the inside racing at the back in the middle stages, angled
out and split foes at the quarter pole, raced in the four path turning for home and improved position. DAZZLE THE COMMAND stalked inside rivals along
the rail, got put in tight entering the far turn, dropped back around the bend and came up empty. MCGREGOR LAKE stumbled a bit at the start, raced two to
three wide at the back early, steadied briefly when running up behind a rival at the five-eighths pole, ridden along four deep leaving the backstretch, raced
three deep around the far turn and tired. MONTANA forwardly placed five wide on the first turn, raced in range wide up the backstretch, dropped back four
wide on the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
PUSHINESS set the pace under pressure from GAND SLAM SMILE up the backstretch, cleared that rival at the three-eighths pole, roused entering the
lane, then drew away under right handed urging and steady handling. GRAND SLAM SMILE pressed the pace from outside, lost touch contact with the
leader at the three-eighths pole, remained closest in pursuit from the two path to the stretch and stayed on to secure second. SAFA got forced into inner
rival leaving the gate, chased off the pace two wide into the turn, ridden along while angling out around the bend, spun five wide into the lane and kept on
for the show honors. BACK ON TRACK got sandwiched between rivals and forced to the back in the beginning, trailed along the rail into the turn, steered
out and raced four to five wide into the lane, moved further out in the drive and summoned a mild rally. PRANCINGTHRUPARIS bumped with BACK ON
TRACK at the start, raced near the inside out of range in the early going, saved ground around the bend, ran into traffic late on the turn, gained an opening
into the stretch and improved position. ROBERTA'S LOVE veered in and bumped SAFA leaving the gate, chased off the rail then moved inside entering the
turn, exited the bend a bit off the rail and weakened. STOP DIGGING stalked the top pair outside a rival, took the turn two wide, tipped out in upper stretch
and faded. QUANTUM INNERGY laid well off the pace early on, traveled two then three wide on the turn, lacked room at the top of the lane and angled out
but lacked further response when needed. ANDIAMO RAGAZZA broke in and bumped on both sides, sat off the pace, rounded the bend three to four wide
and came up empty. THE TRAINER OF BACK ON TRACK LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SAFA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START.
AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

MIZ CLUBCALI stalked in hand on the inside, coaxed along past the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, challenged from outside
entering the lane, took over in upper stretch and edged away in the last sixteenth. O K ROSE got bumped and checked off heels early on the first turn, got
put in tight three deep between foes leaving the same turn, traveled in mid-pack outside rivals on the backstretch, got boxed in at the quarter pole, tipped
four wide into the stretch, rallied and got up for second. COMANCHE GAL cleared from outside and steered over to the rail, showed the way under pressure
from outer rival to the far turn, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, confronted by the winner entering the lane, relinquished the lead outside the eighth pole,
stayed on through the final furlong and saved second. EPIONE stalked three then two wide, shifted out and bumped rival leaving the clubhouse turn, ridden
along in the two path then along the rail on the second bend, moved out in the lane and finished willingly for a minor placing. LAST ELIZABETHAN taken
back early, traveled three wide on both turns, tipped out in upper stretch and closed the gap late. R B'S TIGER threw his head and was off slow to start,
settled inside rivals along the rail, remained on the fence and cornered nicely into the lane but could not rally when needed. GLACIER RIM reserved two
wide at the back, outside a rival on the backstretch then moved outside a trio of rivals for the far turn, ran into traffic late on that bend and could not threaten
down the lane. G'ORO raced on heels briefly early, traveled two wide then along the inside at the back, ran up on heels again early on the backstretch,
continued along the inside, roused into the lane, tipped out and failed to menace. PIPPA PHILIPA rank between rivals early and bumped on the first turn,
ran up on heels and continued to fight the rider on the backstretch, ridden along between foes on the second bend, boxed in at the quarter pole, moved out
and was never a factor. TRULY MAGICAL raced up close from outside into the first turn, applied pressure to the pacesetter in the middle stages, chased
two then three wide past the five-sixteenths pole and faded out of contention. MADE TO MOVE got crowded between rivals in the beginning, fought the rider
briefly prior to the first turn, traveled four deep and got bumped late on the first turn, moved into range and raced outside the top pair at the half-mile pole,
spun five wide into the lane and faded.
