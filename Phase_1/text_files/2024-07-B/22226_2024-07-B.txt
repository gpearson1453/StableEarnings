Footnotes
CLASSIC KITTEN pressed the pace between rivals, bid at the quarter pole and won under steady urging. NO TRUST stalked the pace inside, was keen on
the far turn, checked at the quarter pole and again near the eighth pole while lacking running room along the rail, moved out to the four path late and was full
of run to gain the place. BICARB BETTY raced in the three path, bid at the quarter pole while four wide, moved in closer to the rail in the stretch but couldn't
close. MARTZ ROSEY bid in the three path at the quarter pole and faltered in the drive. SALTY SUE was clear early and gave way in the stretch. EMPIRE
SUNRISE raced in the three path, bid in the five path in the stretch and faltered. QUEEN D stalked the pace in the four path before giving way at the
half-mile mark. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
