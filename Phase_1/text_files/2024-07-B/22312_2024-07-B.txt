Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead two wide on the bend, floated out some as he was challenged from outside
entering the lane, jostled repeatedly with WILDWOOD RUBEN as those two dueled for the lead but prevailed. WILDWOOD RUBEN was kept close, went
for the lead outside SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY, was carried out some by the latter into the stretch, jostled with SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY as he fought to get
ahead, did not have enough late but was clearly best of the rest. GOLD SMOKE chased from inside, fanned out some for the drive, moved to the far outside
midstretch and caught FEVER NATION for third. FEVER NATION was hustled along to dispute the pace from inside but began to wear down before
finishing a half mile. FULL MAGAZINE raced in contention just off the inside but had no stretch rally. MAPACHE G was away slowly and never a factor.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S RULE was bumped several times then jostled between rivals leaving the chute, recovered to stalk the early speed from just off the inside, waited
for room on the bend, got through along the rail leaving the turn, took over upper stretch then steadily opened up on the rest under urging. ROAD GAME
bumped a couple times with DEVIL'S RULE then jostled briefly with that one leaving the chute, raced in contention from outside, commenced his bid three
wide on the turn, was carried out some into the lane and caught READTHETRANSCRIPT for second at the wire. READTHETRANSCRIPT vied for the lead
inside rivals, was no match for DEVIL'S RULE when set down for the drive and gradually wore down deep stretch. FEROCITY contested the pace from
outside, was two wide on the turn, fanned out into the stretch and began to wear down. SIRCORRI jostled leaving the chute, was checked, altered to the
inside and faded two wide on the bend. READY MADE displayed early speed between horses, was steadied when his path narrowed midway on the
backstretch, gave way from inside soon after, did not respond to urging upper stretch, was eased in the late going and walked off.

Footnotes
FRENCHYS TOAST broke on top, was sent from inside, roused again from just off the rail leaving the bend, moved clear, lugged in some midstretch and
maintained full control under steady handling. MY BUDDY BROOKS prominent from the beginning, saved ground through the turn, fought for second inside
the final furlong and edged ahead for the place in the late going. FLASH CADILLAC forwardly placed toward the outside, came four wide into the stretch,
took over second, was challenged from inside after entering the final furlong and did not have enough left through the waning yard. BIKINI MARTINI
advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. COOLTHING was taken out of the gate and
then reloaded after approval from the veterinarian, was two then three wide taking the turn, lodged a mild bid, belated bid in the stretch but proved easily
best of the others. DREAM GOLD was away slowly and only passed tired ones from inside through the stretch. ALEXSIS was also away somewhat
awkwardly and slow, stayed off the inside and was never a factor. MY MAMA SEZ displayed early speed just outside FRENCHYS TOAST but gave way for
the drive. AMAZING ANGIE forwardly placed between rivals, gave way two wide leaving the turn.

Footnotes
LUNDBERG rated on the front end, moved clear when allowed on the turn, widened command when he received mild urging upper stretch and proved
much the best ridden out. MR. CHIVAS chased the early speed from inside, was two wide taking the bend, drew off for second upper stretch and maintained
full control under mild urging in the late going. FIVE STAR RUN chased from outside, lost ground widest through the turn, was forced out further upper
stretch, fought for third inside the last eighth and edged ahead in time. CHARLIE'S BEACH moved inside then back out on the backstretch, was three to four
wide taking the bend, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened, battled for third in the late going but did not have enough in the waning yards. NATIONS
DREAM inattentive in the gate, was somewhat rank leaving the gate, stayed outside to upper stretch then gradually angled in as he improved position
without threatening. SOMNUS vied for the lead outside rivals on the backstretch, did not stay with LUNDBERG on the turn then gave way between horses in
the lane. HE GOES FOREVER hesitated at the break and was never a factor. RUNNING WATER displayed early speed between rivals but began to fade
after three furlongs.

Footnotes
GREEN GRACE was rated from outside, took over four wide when allowed on the turn, angled in some leaving the bend, lengthened command under
urging and was clearly best. I DID THE MATH broke outward and was steadied, moved toward the outside early on, lost ground five to seven wide through
the turn, took over second inside the final furlong and was easily second best. HARPER BRIANA void of early speed, was between rivals taking the bend,
came into the lane from path five, angled to the outside upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. IT'S ON also without early speed, commenced
her bid along the rail on the turn, gradually improved position and was outfinished for the show. I'M INTERESTED vied for the early lead from inside, did not
stay with GREEN GRACE on the turn, fanned outside that one entering the lane and drifted out briefly inside the last eighth. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE
bumped with AIR GERRI at the start, was prominent just inside GREEN GRACE on the backstretch, began to retreat into the bend, swung out six wide for
the stretch run and lacked a significant response. HANABI displayed early speed between horses then began to gradually yield once on the turn. AIR
GERRI bumped with HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE at the break, contested the pace between rivals and began to fade two wide before finishing a half mile.
PASSING PASSION was away slowly, advanced from outside but gave way four wide on the bend. SNOW GLO flipped in the gate, was taken out for
examination, approved by the veterinarian, tried to veer in leaving the chute once the race began, was checked briefly, soon trailed, steadily faded from the
rest and was walked off after the race.

Footnotes
TAPICITA rated while toward the outside, circled rivals five wide leaving the bend, quickly moved clear, steadily lugged in upper stretch, widened command
inside the final furlong and maintained full control under steady handling. JULIAISON prominent just off the early speed, was three wide taking the turn,
altered in when TAPICITA crossed her path upper stretch, bumped with BETHY, was checked, battled the latter for second inside the last eighth and
prevailed for the place. BETHY vied for the lead outside I LUV THIS BAR, did not keep up two wide on the bend, was bumped and steadied upper stretch,
dueled for second, did not have enough in the waning yards but was clearly best of the others. GREER CROSSING in contention early between rivals,
moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, retreated on the turn, angled out two wide upper stretch and improved position without threatening. MUD
HUT advanced from outside to loom a threat four wide on the bend, angled out some after TAPICITA moved clear at the top of the lane and had no late bid.
I LUV THIS BAR displayed early speed from inside but gave way for the drive. TEMPLUNA moved to the inside early on, steadily angled out in the lane but
had little to offer. ESSENTIAL BELLA a bit slow into stride at the start, moved to the outside early on, stumbled after the first two furlongs and lost her rider.
There was a stewards' inquiry into JULIAISON'S loss of action upper stretch and her rider also lodged a claim of foul alleging interference from TAPICITA at
that point. After their review the stewards' determined TAPICITA was clear of all horses when she bore in upper stretch and the claim of foul from
JULIAISON'S rider was not upheld.
