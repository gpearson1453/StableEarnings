Footnotes
ROSE VIEW laid off the pace in the three path, waited between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, was roused while angling out to the six path in the
upper part of the lane, rallied past inner foes just after the eighth pole, and drew clear while drifting in thru the final sixteenth. DARLING LUNA tracked in the
two path, was roused into the far turn, bid while swinging out to the five path at the top of the stretch, ran on to briefly lead passing the eighth pole, but was
quickly overtaken by a rallying outer foe, and held place. TAKE YOUR POINT laid in midpack from the four path, was driven from the three path into the far
turn, angled to the rail passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. SHINING SKYE had to steady to avoid a stumbling inner foe at the start, trailed in the
four path, floated out to the ten path at the top of the stretch, and made no impact. AWESOME EMPRESS rated in the four path, floated out to the seven
path under a drive turning into the lane, and failed to bid. ELYANNA stumbled at the start but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, was roused
along the rail entering the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. I LOVE IRELAND chased in the two
path but never threatened. BEAUTY TO BEHOLD stalked in the three path, bid around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
EMONA ROSSA bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, received a right handed cue entering the turn, angled inside turning into the
lane, bid on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear of the outer pacesetter in the final sixteenth. SAND WEDGE showed the way in the four
path, merged into the two path while being put under a ride entering the turn, dug in while floating back out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but
yielded to an inner foe around the sixteenth to place. WICKED LEGACY prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, floated
out to the seven path in upper stretch, but flattened for show. DID I DAZZLE YOU bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, was driven
in the two path around the turn, but failed to bid. MISS DIZ raced off the pace in five path and never threatened. A GILLION POINTS chased in the two path
but was no menace.

Footnotes
BURNAWAY saved ground in range, tipped two wide to advance around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. E M'S
TREASUREGIRL had her head turned at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to be clearly
second best. LOVE MAMI LOVE trailed inside, moved up three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. SPREZZATURA prompted the pace
two wide and faded around the far turn. BIG BAND LUZZIANN set a rated pace inside and faltered in the lane. TOP BLUE played no factor while racing two
wide.

Footnotes
SUGAR TREAT prompted the pace in the four path, was roused to bid in the three path midway around the turn, bumped twice with an inner foe while
dueling in upper stretch, and inched ahead of that foe in the final sixteenth. CAPISCI set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path when
challenged by an outer foe passing the three-eighths mark, bumped twice with that foe while digging in to duel from the three path in upper stretch, but was
edged out in the final sixteenth to place. SMART JENNY tracked in the two path, was cued along the rail midway around the turn, and finished evenly while
tipping out in the final furlong to secure show. BAHA SECRET had to steady at the start, trailed in the four path, was coaxed from the three path midway
around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. STARSHIP SUNRISE stalked in the three path, came under left
handed urging midway around the turn, but faded in the final furlong. FOLLOW THE FED rated in the two path but never threatened. THREE RUN BOLT
broke in at the start, chased in the three path but faded from the five path in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FOGGY NOTE trailed in the three path, swung six wide nearing the quarter pole, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. OMO
TEN GIRL bumped with CHAINA at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, angled in in upper stretch and kept on inside of foes to gain the place
late. R FIREBIRD set the pace in the two path, yielded near the sixteenth pole and lost second late. CHAINA bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide
and lacked the needed rally. BOTH SIDES hit the starting gate, raced in range five wide and weakened in the drive. LOVE PARADOX had her head turned
at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. MIGUEL'S BELLE chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
CABERNET broke in at the start, stalked in the four path early, received a right handed cue in the three path going into the far turn, made a sweeping move
to take the lead in the four path entering the lane, was headed by an outer challenger passing the eighth pole, but dug in to repel that challenge and inched
ahead late. FUNTASTICA rated in the four path, came under a ride in the three path entering the far turn, bid while floating out to the six path at the top of
the stretch, ran on to stick her nose in front while drifting in slightly going by the eighth pole, but was repelled by an inner foe to place. PUCKERED laid in
midpack in the three path, was roused from the two path into the far turn, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, and was one paced on her left
lead for show. NAA DUDETTE trailed in the three path, angled out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. LTE STARK WINTER
raced off the pace in the three path, was driven around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but did not factor. GRATIA set the
pace in the three path and went well clear turning into the backstretch, merged into the two path entering the far turn, but gaveway in the stretch. HEAVENS
EXPRESS had a slow start, raced wellback in the four path and never threatened. REAL MIKEY was steadied between foes around the first turn and along
the inside for the early part of the backstretch, tracked in the two path but faded.

Footnotes
TAP GOLD set the pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and held safe under a drive. TEST FACTOR bumped with
TRUTH AND HONESTY at the start, tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT chased
the pace two wide between foes and stayed on to gain the show without threatening the top two. HEALS THE SOUL clipped heels not long after the start,
made progress five wide around the turn but flattened out a bit in the lane. SMOKIN CLOUD chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. TRUTH
AND HONESTY was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. ROYAL QUALITY raced off the pace two and three wide and made little
impact while lacking a clear path in the lane. RATHMORE pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive.
