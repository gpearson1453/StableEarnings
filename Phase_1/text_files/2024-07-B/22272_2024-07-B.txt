Footnotes
TATAS JOE MARK pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled briefly and drew off under urging. MONIKER got away well, vied to mid
stretch, was no match late and held safely for place. JEEPS STRIDE raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, fell back and closed to
earn show. MUSICS MY VICE broke awkwardly, raced wide in a steady effort and improved position. B R KIDD ROCK showed speed to the turn, dropped
back and leveled off. AARON WHO pressed the pace along the inside, challenged on the turn, fell back, angled out and gave way. SHAME ON ROOSTER
broke out and brushed at the start, dropped inside and bore out on the turn. DANJERUS STORM was never far back, rallied three across on the turn,
stopped and was not urged late. RYDERS UP was not a factor. SHAME ON SAM brushed at the start and showed little.
