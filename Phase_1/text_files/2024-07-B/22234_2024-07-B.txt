ALFONSO rallied four wide, lost path then checked and yielded. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry late stretch involving WAVE
BURNER and ALFONSO. After review of the film the Board of Stewards determined that WAVE BURNER caused interference to ALFONSO. WAVE

POND. SPORTSCARR launched an all-out bid inside and missed after a game effort. MUCHO MAGIC sat in range while five wide, and showed a late
interest. COMMON KNOWLEDGE was reserved off the early pacesetters, lodged a bi nearing the stretch and gave way late. BEHIND THE CURTAIN vied

Footnotes
SILKSTONE went to the lead, drifted out in the opening turn, set a pressured pace from the two path, dueled inside of OOPS AND DOWNS, and won going
away under light away. WHO'S THAT BABY was five wide into opening turn, trailed entering the lane, waited at the three sixteenth pole then found running
room, and closed gradually to score second. OOPS AND DOWNS prompted from between foes, moved up alongside SILKSTONE to challenge the front,
dueled in far turn, drifted out to the four path, kept on evenly through the stretch under handling. ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO tracked early pace setters,
roused at the top of the lane, chased the leader, gave way. MARAMAX was five wide on the first turn, sat in striking position, chased in the stretch, yielded.
KELROSIE angled down to the rail, was steadied entering the backstretch, offered a mild bid, tired.

Footnotes
CLASSY CITY stumbled badly then was brushed leaving, saved ground inside, came under heavy encouragement, and prevailed under a long drive.
ITSALLGOODMAN was reserved off the early pacesetter while three wide, took closer order in the far turn, was roused at the three-sixteenth marker, rallied
three wide and was outfinished. SKIPPER'S PRIDE brushed inside foe leaving, was allowed to settle early, drifted in at the head of the lane, and closed
getting along in time. TICKET TO THE TOP sped to the front, held good margins leaving the backstretch, was under attack nearing the stretch, and
flattened. NORTHERN FORCE lacked a clear path early, trailed the field, and lacked a bid. TAYLOR FIELD rated well off the pace while five wide, and tired
early.

Footnotes
COOLWIND trailed the field and closed huge to score the win. KEEN FLATTER fanned three wide, moved up into striking range while five wide, challenged
the leaders in the far turn, gained the advantage, drove clear under handling and was bested. POINT TO THE STARS stalked inside, rallied into the stretch
and edged clear to earn show. SAXON SAGA contested the early pace, saved ground while showing the way, and responded to challengers in the final
turn, came up empty in the drive. RAILWAY fanned four wide into the opening turn, and lacked a closing response. DON'T LET ME DOWN offered little.
WALKTHELINE outsprinted in the opening turn, stalked the leader and faded gradually.

THISCATSGOTSPEED bumped leaving, showed speed through the backstretch while five wide, swept the lead then opened up through the final turn, and
was wrapped up late. OAK BAY QUALITY saved inside, gained closer order in the final turn, chased the leader under encouragement, improved position but
was no threat to the winner. CAPE'S LEGACY broke in bumping THISCATSGOTSPEED, allowed to settle off the pace, chased five wide, and flattened out
late. LEGAL ASSASSIN sent for early speed then emerged the leader leaving the chute, overtaken leaving the backstretch, and faded gradually.
DEFINITELY ITALIAN jostled leaving the chute, and failed to threaten. PADDY'S SPEEDSTER experienced traffic leaving the chute then bumped inside
foe, and offered a mild rally. MORE THAN A FLASH bumped leaving the gate, and never reached contention. FULL MEASURE vied outside leaving the
chute, and was done early. FULL MEASURE was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled.

SINGING BELL stalked from the rail, gained a short advantage leaving the backstretch, and held under a late drive. MONOPOLIZE stalked three wide,
launched a bid inside at the head of the lane, and was outfinished. RISING STRONG tracked wide through the backstretch, and closed well late. WHY NOT
DANCE quickly went to the front, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and had nothing left late. JODEYS LIL PAIN lugged out while in range, and faded.
ANN no factor.
