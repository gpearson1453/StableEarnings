AMUSING WAY contended the pace while three wide, dueled inside of PUMP THE BRAKES in the final turn, disposed of rival and drew away. PUMP THE
BRAKES fanned four wide leaving the chute, dueled through the far turn outside of AMUSING WAY, was unable to continue with rival and held on for
second. MACHINE stalked inside, swung out at the head of the lane and bid belatedly. BIG AL'S VISION rated off the pace, and lacked a closing response.
INDEPENDENCE NEIGH took back leaving the chute, and passed tiring rival. DREW tracked the dueling pacesetters, and yielded.

pace while four wide, rallied four wide into the lane, drifted in under encouragement and was outkicked. WHISKARITA sat just off the pace from between
foes, rallied between in the final turn, lost path then shifted out and was along with time for show. CHATTY GAL broke alertly then quickly went to the front,
was under pressure at the quarter pole, and weakened late stretch. ENTITLED STAR showed interest late. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI was never involved.
JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of WHISKARITA against the rider of OUT FRONT alleging interference late stretch was not allowed.

KAUAI DAN stalked the pace while four wide, went in pursuit of the leader, rallied outside and edged clear. STONE CARVER quickly took command, was
joined at the head of the stretch and was outfinished. SQUALOTORO tracked inside early, lacked room then shifted off the rail, lost path then shifted out to
the three wide at the eighth pole and missed after a good late effort. DRINKING AGAIN was in close quarters leaving the backstretch, chased but was
unable to improve position through the stretch. NORTHERN JEWEL stalked the pace while three wide, drifted out in the final turn, and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
KEEPMEINPOWER set a pressed pace while three wide, inherited the lead then drew away, was kept under light handling and won handily. NO MORE JO
KING was four wide entering the backstretch, tracked the early pacesetters, chased the leader through the stretch and finished second best. CUVEE TEE
fractious in the gate, pressed the early pace from just off the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded. BEAUTIFUL BABE was never
far back and failed to threaten. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL offered a late mild bid.
