Footnotes
TDZ HINT OF POWER rushed up to take a clear lead to set all the pace and won going away. A MILLION MOONS showed brief early foot and prompted
the pace from two wide to upper stretch but was no match for the winner. FLINT ROCK chased the leaders from throughout and stayed on for the show.
MAGNOLIA WEST saved ground throughout while racing evenly. SWEET TALKIN SLICK raced three wide throughout and passed tired one in the stretch.
HE'S A FINE BABY trailed the field early then moved between horses at the five sixteenth pole but failed to sustain the bid.
