Footnotes
GOOD SIN was nestled on the fence behind the pacesetter in the first turn, was nudged along to move in closer along the backside to be alone watching the
contesting pair by the half, waited to move on the far turn, shifted out to bid three wide straightening for the drive and overpowered the leader at the furlong
pole to edge away clearly for the win in deep stretch. SO CALLED VACATION was hustled to take command going into the first of two turns, set an even
pace having a narrow margin up top along the backside, was collared on the outside by runners at the top of the lane, could not fend off the winner down the
stretch by fought on to the wire to hold for the place share. RESTORING ORDER tracked three wide between horses in the first turn, continued to watch the
engaged duo three deep on the outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run midway on the final turn, angled out four wide in range of the leaders for
the stretch drive and finished up gradually to capture the show money in the end. PLAY THE DOTS broke inwards on the start, had a stalking trip outside
foes in the third flight in the early going, began to go around runners three wide on the far turn, was in the hunt for a share in the four path at the top of the
lane but stalled in the running to the finish line. TAPROOM pressed the pace outside in the early stages, turned up the pressure when bidding for the lead
between horses in the two path turning for home, could not match strides with rivals by upper stretch and folded at the furlong marker. EAT FOOD
EVERYDAY was fanned out widest in the four path in the first bend, tracked three deep outside foes along the backstretch, could not go on when between
others at the three eighths marker and failed to menace in stretch drive. BEER MOSA was bumped between rivals on the break to trail in the beginning,
made no headway down the backstretch and under a gallop passed a straggler in the stretch. COPROLITE stalked in the third flight inside runners in the
first turn, improved position on the fence down the back straight, could not continue going forward with three furlongs remaining and emptied out in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
LOIS LEN assumed control from the start, improved the margin by the half, comfortably set the pace around turn, was headed outside turning for home, put
away that rival, braced for the new challenger in mid- stretch, was well rated up front to have more in the tank for the drive and repelled that foe easily to win
going away at the wire. SYSTEMATIC stalked between foes in the four path down the backstretch, improved smartly getting a better position by the half mile
marker, rallied three wide around the turn, chased the winner home but to no avail and bested the rest at the finish. HELLUVA HOLIDAY shadowed the
frontrunner outside at the start, tracked inside a rival down the backstretch, moved in through the turn, loomed the main threat when bidding for the lead
outside turning for home, finished on the wrong lead down the stretch and stayed on to hold for the show award. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL trailed five deep
outside horses through the backstretch, began to pass foes outside starting at the half, circled four wide around rivals in the turn, angled out widest in the
five path in range of the leaders straightening for home, could not sustain the rally and settled on the fringes in the end. WINYAH BAY was ahead of only
one foe at the half, made little progress when scrubbed for more around the bend, trailed by the quarter pole and passed tired runners in the final sixteenth.
MAKE NO MISTAKE settled in mid-pack on the rail down the backstretch, was urged for more on the fence three furlongs out, but was going the wrong way
through the turn and could not get involved running down the lane. LIZZIES GIRL stalk near the rear inside rivals down the backstretch early on, could see
the field by the half, made a brief run to pass a runner three wide at the quarter pole and had nothing to show for the stretch run. VALLEY GIRL broke out to
begin, was part of the tracking duo outside along the backstretch, was roused in midturn, could not close the gap on the front pair by the quarter pole and
retreated four wide between horses at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
BEQUIA tracked five wide outside horses on the first turn, was quite content to sit back behind the pacesetter along the backside, cruised around the leader
midway on the final bend to seize control and coasted home for a dominant score when crossing the finish. HAYEK assumed command while in hand from
the onset, comfortably set the pace with no pressure from rivals down the backstretch, offered no resistance when the winner went on by at the five
sixteenths marker and fought on to the wire to hold for the place share at the finish line. GUNNAWIN tracked on the rail in the early going, was urged for
more chasing the front pair throughout the far turn and finished up willingly down the lane trying to close in for the runners up share in deep stretch. HIGH
TREASON was off a step slow to begin, was floated out widest in the six path into the first bend, sat alone in the third flight near the rear along the backside,
made little headway around the far turn and battled on outside foes down the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. ORIGINAL ME tracked between
runners in the early stages, came under a ride three furlongs out but could not keep pace with the leaders and lost the duel while on the fence for the minors
down the lane. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY was allowed to settle on the fence, seeing the pack in the first turn, closed the gap while on the rail along the
backside, took the shortest way around on the final turn but could not make any impression and lacked a finish in the stretch drive inside runners.

Footnotes
MRS. HOT SHOT broke outwardly, was forwardly-positioned into the first turn outside foes just off the lead, moved to challenge near the five-eighths,
pressed the new leader from inside before taking a narrow advantage at the seven-sixteenths, was put to urging at the top of the stretch, moved clear by
mid-stretch, continued to drift out late and held while being kept busy to the wire. TEXENSIS was a bit fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, settled well
back angling in to the rail, saved some ground in the early going, moved out on the far turn to be four or five wide nearing the quarter pole, was guided out
further coming to the top of the stretch, took aim from between runners, was carried out further still near the furlong grounds, surged from between foes late
to secure the place while gaining on the winner but needed more. CLASSIC GLORY settled early racing two to three wide at the back, moved out and
advanced four to six wide on the far turn racing widest of all into upper stretch, was forced out further in mid-stretch, got show honors. INITTOWINIT was off
the pace four wide through the first turn, advanced five deep on the far turn under some urging nearing the quarter pole, altered outside runners ten deep in
mid-stretch, ran on but was outkicked by others for the minor placings. MOET MONET stalked outside the second flight five wide into the first turn, made a
rapid early move to the lead past the five-eighths, vied outside a runner through the far turn, weakened in the stretch. SLOANS SKY was forwardly-placed
racing close up in pursuit of the leaders three to four wide, ridden along near the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. IMPECCABLE TIMING had bumps on both
sides at the start, shifted in settling mid-pack two to three wide, raced between foes into the far turn and kept on one-paced. SIX FOR A NINE bumped with
rivals at the start and checked sharply dropping back to last, settled at the rear, swung nine wide for the drive, was not a threat. BLING D'MONEY HOME
broke on top but was taken back off the leaders into the first turn pulling a bit against rider's restraint, tracked from inside saving ground, lacked room and
waited briefly near the quarter pole, swung out three wide past that juncture with room but failed to threaten. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER bumped the outside
foe at the start, moved forward briefly taking the lead into the first turn and bumping with the outside rival at that point, was soon overtaken and tracked from
inside, tired. MRS. BENJAMIN bumped with a rival into the first turn racing close to the pace, continued to chase in behind two to three wide, tired.

Footnotes
I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) was allowed to settle into stride early, co-trailed on the outside down the backside, extended his stride sharply passing foes three
wide at the three furlong marker, circled around horses through the turn to bid outside in the three path turning for home and pulled away for the score under
only mild urging in deep stretch. HUNT MASTER broke sharply foe the lead at the start, continued to set the fractions going well around the bend, was
collared outside by two runners turning for home, could not repel the winner at the furlong marker but did finish up determinedly to secure the runners up
placing at the finish line. POULIN IN O T was brushed inside to begin, tracked the pacesetter outside along the backstretch, chased the pace through the
turn, closed in to bid in the two path with challengers on both sides in upper stretch but was outkicked in the last furlong and settled for a clear third place
finish. COTTON settled in mid-division on the rail down the backstretch, lost position while on the fence in midturn to trail this tightly packed group at the
quarter pole, shifted out to the four path having a clear lane to run in at the top of the stretch and won the duel for the minor share. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY
was brushed outside on the start, co-trailed on the inside under a snug hold down the backstretch, shifted out at the three eighths marker starting to
commence a run, angled out widest in the five path for the drive but lacked a serious bid in the stretch running.

Footnotes
AIR COMBAT broke outwardly, settled outside at the back, advanced five then six wide late on the turn and into upper stretch, took aim while widest of all,
struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove clear. COURAGEOUS COPPER was bumped into a rival at the start, coaxed forward to the lead and clear, set the
pace near the inside, was challenged and headed midway on the turn, dug in to retake the lead in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner but was
second best. SOUPER SUCCESS bumped the inside foe at the start, stalked that one, bid between runners two to three wide nearing the quarter pole,
evened out in the stretch. READY FOR A FIGHT made a sharp middle move outside foes four to five wide on the turn taking a narrow lead past the
five-sixteenths, flattened out in the stretch. SPITE STORE chased from inside, saved ground, was one-paced and not a threat. JIMMIES BIG DAY was
bumped at the start, chased while a bit tight two to three wide entering the turn, was never a threat. DETERMINED FURY was relegated to the rear early on
the turn racing outside foes at the back, went three to five wide throughout and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHE MAKES A POINT tracked on the rail in the first bend, patiently was nestled behind the frontrunner down the back straight, shifted just off the fence to
bid for the lead when they turned for home, under right-handed encouragement found more at the furlong marker and drew off for the score in deep stretch.
SWINGING MANDY was hustled to have the lead on the first turn, continued to free wheel up front down the backstretch, set the pace while unchallenged in
the final turn, hugged the rail entering the stretch clinging to the lead and fought on stubbornly but gave way to the winner outside in the final sixteenth of a
mile. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) stalked on the fence ahead of only one foe along the backside, waited for her cue when behind the trio of chasing horses
throughout the final turn, angled out widest in the five-path straightening out for the stretch run and closed in late, to get up in the finals strides to capture
third money. SARAH'S DANCER trailed three wide on the first turn, continued to see the field down the backstretch, was making a sharp run when roused
on the rail in the far turn, sat just behind the leader on the fence turning for home, shifted outside for the drive but lost holding on for the show battle a few
jumps before the wire. FORTYFIVESEVENTY had a good tracking position outside runners in the early stages, was hard ridden trying to keep pace with
runners making a move midway on the final turn, could not keep up with rivals by the top of the stretch and flattened out at the sixteenth pole. RETAIL
THERAPIST stalked all alone in the third flight down the back straight, moved in three wide around horses at the five sixteenths marker, posed a threat in
the four-path turning for home, could not find more down the lane and folded by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
CRIMSON NIGHTS vied for the lead at the start under a snug hold, relaxed kindly down the backside to stalk outside in the third flight by the half, was on
hold with the rider statuesque around horses in the turn, pounced three wide at the quarter pole, shifted out in the five path turning for home, was full of run
and drew away with authority in the final furlong. FEATHERWEIGHT was away a step slow to begin, regrouped to stalk in midfield down the backstretch,
had to wait behind runners when smartly closing the margin on the leaders by the quarter pole, found a seam two wide at the furlong marker and finished up
strongly but could not reel in the winner who got the jump in mid-stretch. BEAUMONT DRIVE was away slowly to begin, could not find her stride while
trailing by many along the backside, figured things out when closing the gap smartly on the field throughout the turn, angled out widest gathering momentum
in the ten-path straightening for the drive and closed with a late rush to capture the show money. FIREBOLT settled on the rail in the third flight with the
eventual winner on her outside at the half, rallied smartly on the fence in the turn, had to be throttled down slightly with nowhere to run at the quarter pole,
shifted out for a clear path, three wide turning for home to be in the mix for a piece of the prize, finished up with purpose to the wire but was just edged out
late for the show award. SUMMER HOLIDAY stalked near the rear between foes down the backside, narrowed the margin on the leaders but could not
improve position around the turn, angled out eight wide for the drive to the wire and finished up mildly to pass some rivals to the finish line. LANEY GRACE
was ahead of only one rival down the back straight, made little improvement between horses around the bend, angled out nine wide for the stretch run and
showed good late energy with a sixteenth left to run. FULCRA had a good spot, watching the contesting duo down the back straight, began to inch closer
three wide outside foes in midturn, bid for the lead outside at the quarter pole, could not find another gear in upper stretch and yielded in the four path with
challengers on both sides at the furlong marker. SPEEDY ROSE veered in to hit the gate on the break, recovered quickly to press the issue inside by the
half, assumed command at the three eighths marker, was headed outside by another foe at the quarter pole, spurted away mildly in upper stretch but had
little left and wilted on the fence in the final seventy yards. ROHESE was up close, sitting just behind the lead group in the beginning, was shuffled back on
the fence by the half, made little headway saving ground throughout the turn and could not make a presence in the stretch running. LA GRIGIA emerged
from the pack to have a slim margin up front outside at the half, relinquished the lead outside with three furlongs to go, was urged right-handed in midturn,
had nothing more to offer and backed away through the field at the quarter pole.
