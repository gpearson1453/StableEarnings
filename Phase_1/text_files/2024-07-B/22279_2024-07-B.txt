Footnotes
BRAN (FR) away well then rated close up on the rail, waited patiently on the far turn, gained an opening in upper stretch, fought between into deep stretch
and drove clear. SUMTER stalked along the rail then moved into the two path, chased between foes into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane,
challenged in upper stretch, took over midstretch and got outkicked BRAN (FR) in the last sixteenth. PACKS A WAHLOP sped clear early and showed the
way two wide into the first turn before moving to the rail, took light pressure from outside in the middle stages, maintained command through the far turn,
headed at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after, fought back into deep stretch and faltered late. WAR AT SEA tracked between briefly then
went two to three wide around the clubhouse turn, rounded the second bend three then four deep, chased five wide into the lane and finished willingly from
outside. WATSONVILLE rated in the two path early, latched onto the pacesetter at the midway point, fought two wide through the far turn and weakened in
the final furlong. EXAULTED antsy in the starting gate, stalked outside a pair of rivals, given his cue past the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the
lane and faded.

J B STRIKES BACK sped to the front and took control of the rail, lost command briefly around the first turn then inched ahead from outer rival, carried a
short lead to the far turn, cleared leaving the bend and drew away in the late stages. TRIPLE PASS raced up close then took over briefly on the clubhouse
turn, gave the advantage back to J B STRIKES BACK and pressed from outside, stayed alongside to the quarter pole, lost touch into the stretch, remained
close into the final furlong, weakened a bit late but was still clearly second best. SCORPION SHOT stalked in the three path early, rushed up outside the top
pair then was taken in hand, lost ground leaving the backstretch, ridden along through the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, could not summon the
needed rally but held onto the show honors. CLASSIC ALPHIE tracked in the four path early, chased outside rivals in the middle stages and lost action
briefly nearing the half-mile pole, ran four to five deep on the far turn and lacked a bid. NAVAJO WARRIOR off slow in the beginning, traveled two to three
wide near the back, ran up on heels past the nine-sixteenths pole, found traffic on the far turn, went between rivals and got bumped on both sides at the
quarter pole and kept on trying to improve position. HALVERSON broke well then was taken back and three then two wide early, came in a bit and caused a
chain reaction on the far turn, exited the bend four deep and weakened. BIG BABY tracked two then three wide, coaxed along two wide on the far turn then
got pinballed at the quarter pole and had little left for the stretch run. CITADINO settled off the rail, went three wide into the far turn, got floated in and
bumped inner rival at the quarter pole, had to steady when HALVERSON cut in past the three-sixteenths marker, eased in the lane and walked off.
DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS stumbled leaving the gate, angled to the inside, rank on the first turn, pulled forward in the middle stages, ran into traffic on the far
turn, angled out at the quarter pole, eased in the lane and walked off. TORLEIF tracked from inside, raced out of range leaving the backstretch, got bumped,
put in tight and bobbled at the quarter pole, eased in the lane and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED HALVERSON
FROM SIXTH TO LAST FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SEVERAL RUNNERS AT THE QUARTER POLE.

Footnotes
CASALU set the pace under pressure, cleared early on the turn and showed the way long the inside through the bend, roused in upper stretch and drew off
while kept busy to the wire. OVETA'S HOBBY off slow from inside, chased from off the pace to the turn, gained along the fence around the bend, could not
get any closer to the winner in the final furlong but kept on to best the rest. CLAPPING TREES pressed from outside, chased two wide around the bend,
could not re-rally in the lane and got outkicked for second. TWO BAR forwardly placed four deep early, chased three wide into the, drifted inward despite left
handed encouragement and flattened out. ACQUITTED chased six wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, spun four wide into the
stretch and lacked further response. LEE'S BABY GIRL reluctant to load, raced up close outside the top pair to the turn, moved in late on the turn and
chased two wide into the stretch, then faded out of contention. RHYTHMICAL rubbed the gate and came away slow, lacked early speed and trailed far back
early, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. ISNTSHELOVERLY chased seven wide into the turn, moved into the five path around the bend

Footnotes
KAHUNA MAGIC laid well off the pace in the early going, was on the move off the rail through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed fast and
reeled in DEVIL AMONG US at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. DEVIL AMONG US set the pace up the backstretch off the rail, moved in on the turn then
led two wide into the stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, confronted by KAHUNA MAGIC with a sixteenth remaining and yielded. POP D'ORO
stalked from inside, moved off the fence in the lane, finished willingly but could not summon the needed late kick. VILIFIED raced up close from outside,
chased four wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend and weakened when called upon. OUTGUNNED chased widest leaving the
backstretch, angled in a few paths around the bend, spun three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. DAD'S JUBILEE raced in mid-pack to the turn, saved
ground along the rail and failed to menace. LEADING THE PACE chased from off the pace, navigated the turn two then three wide and could not threaten.
CAROL'S COMIC stumbled then got bumped and impeded by THE BIG CHEESEOLA leaving the gate and could not get involved. THE BIG CHEESEOLA
stumbled badly and lost the rider at the start, ran around the track and was eventually caught by the outrider following the race and walked off. THERE WAS
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START BETWEEN THE BIG CHEESEOLA AND CAROL'S COMIC AND RULED THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
AG BULLET moved around just before the gates open but still came away fairly well, sped clear and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, widened
when roused at the top of the lane and was ridden out to the wire. HANG THE MOON settled in the two path then outside a rival, drew closer on the
backstretch, ridden along two to three wide on the second bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but finished determinedly to
best the rest. ASCENDANCY well placed in the early going along the fence, saved ground through the far turn and cut the corner into the stretch, failed to
produce a bid in the furlong grounds but churned on to hold third. SUN OF HILL (BRZ) tracked in the two path, coaxed along the rail on the far turn, moved
off the fence in the drive and earned a minor award. LUNAR IMPACT (GB) forwardly placed outside a rival, took aim two wide through the far turn but was
no match and weakened in the lane. JUSTIQUE tucked inside towards the rear, tipped out into the lane, angled out further in the drive and could not rally.
MISS LIZZY trailed early and went two wide around the first turn, traveled outside a rival in the middle stages, chased between foes into the lane and was
never a factor. REAL FIRE tossed her head at the start to come away a bit slow, chased three then two wide near the back on the clubhouse turn, continued
off the rail to the stretch and had little left when needed.

NYCE GOING reluctant to load, shifted in a bit leaving the gate but still came away well, went up to vie between rivals, inched ahead around the turn,
dueled with I'M A BAD BOY down the stretch and gamely prevailed. I'M A BAD BOY vied three deep up the backstretch and around the turn, fought four to
five wide into the lane, kept the pressure on NYCE GOING into the final furlong, dug in late and just missed. STYLE CAT showed early speed three deep
between rivals before ceding command, chased the top trio four wide early on the turn then cut across to the rail, kept to task through the lane and gained
the show honors. HOME GAMER fought inside rivals to the turn, asked to keep up past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders two wide into the lane
and weakened. IMAGINARY LOVER broke a bit slow, sat off the pace, saved ground around the bend and could not rally. STEAK FRIES chased from
mid-pack well off the rail, rounded the bend four to five wide and could not threaten. THE GYPSY COWBOY fractious in the gate, came away slow and
dropped well back, traveled five wide then angled in around the bend, trailed to the stretch and passed tired rivals. PRINCE DOLCE broke inward, chased
four wide early on the turn then moved into the two path and failed to menace. CALI CAT off a bit slow to begin, tracked five wide into the turn, moved in a
path around the bend and weakened. TIGER STRENGTH also came away slow, laid well off the pace, went two wide into the turn, was getting out and had
to be corrected approaching the quarter pole and was no factor after.

Footnotes
FIRST PEACE settled off the top trio in the two path, moved closer in the middle stages, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, took over and cleared
inner rivals, then held well under right handed urging to the wire. ASTRONOMER tracked outside a rival off the pace, drew closer on the backstretch,
loomed four wide into the lane, chased after the winner determinedly through the stretch but had to settle for second best. FLASHIEST saved ground off the
pace around the clubhouse turn, gained through the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, got to within striking distance but needed to find more late.
CONCLUDE traveled along the inside toward the back, rounded the far turn two to three wide, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally.
ALMENDARES (GB) got put in tight between rivals shortly after the start, unhurried after and moved inside, eased off the rail and came four wide into the
lane but flattened out in the final furlong. AH JEEZ sat well off the the pace, chased two wide into the stretch, moved out and could not threaten. DANDY
MAN SHINES (IRE) unhurried along the inside at the back, went inside a rival on the backstretch, had one beat around the far turn, tipped out into the lane
and failed to make an impact. AIR FORCE RED raced up close outside rivals then vied for command up the backstretch, dueled outside CABO SPIRIT
through the far turn, yielded to the winner at the top of the lane and faded. IRIDEO (ARG) unruly in the starting gate, back out and reloaded, raced a bit off
the rail near the back, outside a rival into the far turn, trailed leaving that bend and passed tired rivals. CABO SPIRIT forwardly placed into the first turn then
pressed between rivals, fought for the lead between up the backstretch, dueled along the inside through the far turn, failed to keep up with the winner into
the stretch and retreated. NOBLE REFLECTION showed good early foot along the rail to take command, met by a pair of rivals around the first turn, vied up
the backstretch, failed to keep pace into the far turn, started to weaken around the bend, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GOLD FOOT sped clear from outside then dueled with inner rival first time through the stretch, raced keenly when ceding command, was closest in pursuit
to the far turn, latched onto SKETCHY once again, hounded that rival through the lane and wore down the runner-up to prove best in the end. SKETCHY
bumped with outer rival shortly after the start, chased briefly between foes then went up to challenge for command first time in the stretch, took control
around the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, coaxed along on the far turn, met the challenge from GOLD FOOT once again, resisted
into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly late. RASTAMAN VIBE bumped in the beginning, reserved two wide then moved inside, checked off heels at the
five-eighths pole, chased outside a rival through the far turn, swung out approaching the stretch and closed for a game third. PROMISSIO stalked four deep
then traveled in mid-pack in the two path, chased three then four wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and finished willingly between foes. BRITISH
ISLES stalked from inside, roused on the far turn, tipped out and bumped EL REY REY in upper stretch and finished evenly late. SIENNOIS (IRE) settled
outside rivals then steered to the two path, tipped three wide with a quarter mile left to run and summoned a mild rally. EL REY REY stalked the speed
outside a rival, got bumped by BRITISH ISLES at the top of the lane, chased between foes and got put in a bit tight, having to pause at the sixteenth pole
and kept trying to the wire. SIZE DOES MATTER chased three wide leaving the chute then moved inside and traveled in mid-pack, cornered nicely into the
lane and weakened. THE RABBI exited the chute four wide at the tail end of the field, allowed to settle at the back and tucked inside, passed a rival from the
two path on the far turn and was never a factor. FREE AGAIN pulled along the inside first time in the stretch and clubhouse turn, dropped back to last on the
second bend and had little left for the drive.
