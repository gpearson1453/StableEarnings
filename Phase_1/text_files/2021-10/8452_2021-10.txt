MY WAY OR ELSE broke outward steadying then settled off the pace, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole and took over past the pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. WHOSE THAT LADY saved ground off the early pace then eased out with a
bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished eveny while gaining second later yards. ELLIE BEAR settled off the
pace about the four path then eased to the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but
flattened the final sixteenth. KIM'S DIAMOND settled off the pace in the three path, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and raced at a close
disadvantage at the rail on the far turn, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LIL SWEETHEART stalked the early pace off the rail, moved to even terms
toward the three eighths pole but was caught past the pole, gave chase from that point then faded on the far turn. SPUNKY ALI CAT rated a slim lead
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was headed leaving the pole, gave chase from that point but flattened past the five

back to save ground then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and ran
evenly down the lane. BEING ME took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was caught past the nine sixteenths

BARRY KARAFIN BETS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at
the rail rounding the far turn, dueled clear into the lane and was steadily handled to hold off BRIAN'S AVENUE, who rated close inside the opening turn, bid
at the three eighths pole, drew close off the rail midway on the far turn and dug in through the stretch to finish evenly at the outside withers of the winner.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and dueled for a clear third
inside the sixteenth. MINE TO HOLD settled off the pace inside, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then relented third
inside the sixteenth pole. SACCO AND VANZETTI came away awkwardly then angled in to stalk two deep, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, though, faded at the rail on the far turn.

COURTLY KITTY rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths
pole, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and widened later yards. FONDA ROMANA saved early ground racing well off the pace, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in outside from the head of the lane and got up for second the final strides. CAROLINA
BAMBINA rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was met past the five sixteenths, contested even terms at the
rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. CATHERINES WARRIOR raced with the pace two deep and challenged nearing the
three
eighths
pole,
contested
even
terms
past
the
five
sixteenths
and
continued
a
factor
to
mid-stretch
before
flattening
later
yards.
WHYCANTTHISBELOVE settled off the pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then drifted in the upper
stretch and flattened stride. GRECIAN DANCER rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths, came through the far turn in the four path, steadied off the heels of the errant Whycantthisbelove past the eighth pole and
weakened.

WICKED WISDOM settled back in the three path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the
lead past the five sixteenths and raced clear into the far turn, was met a furlong away and dug in under a determined ride to hold on. STACIAS RUBY raced
with the early pace inside then gave chase into the backstretch, raced hemmed in on the far turn, came through at the rail at the eighth pole and dug in
gamely to share second while outfinished for the win. TIMEISGOLDEN dwelt and gave up several lengths at the break, angled to the five path into the first
turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid at the seven sixteenths pole, took aim in the three path midway on the far turn, lost considerable
ground entering the stretch but dug in when straightened away and got up to share second at the wire. UPTOWN BELLE saved ground off the pace, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole then steadied off the heels of Bipartisan Brooke approaching the quarter pole, angled to the five path through the far turn
and ran evenly down the lane. AMERICAN BARB steadied and angled to the four path into the first turn then saved ground past the five eighths pole, bid
past the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. BIPARTISAN BROOKE stalked
from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path midway through the far turn. MIDNIGHT
REGRET took the lead between horses toward the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught
approaching the quarter then weakened at the rail on the far turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the start of this race.

Footnotes
TEST ME I DARE U saved ground off the pace the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of the far
turn, dug in from the head of the lane and got up the final strides. TINA'S SONG rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and kept the edge over
STONES ROAD from the half mile pole, raced clear nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled through the
lane but gave up the lead in the final strides, while the latter angled to the five path into the opening turn and closed to even terms nearing the half mile pole,
gave chase through the backstretch but dropped back off the rail on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. DIVA GAL settled off the pace about the
three path the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and could only
improve her position. SWISS HORIZON rated close to the early pace two deep, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded from the three
eighths. DAFFYDILL settled off the pace inside and showed only mild response through the backstretch. MISS ORA LEE entered the first turn in the four
path then steadied from between horses at the nine sixteenths pole and showed little response through the backstretch.
