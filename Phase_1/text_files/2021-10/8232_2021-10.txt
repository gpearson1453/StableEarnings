Footnotes
CLASSY N' SILENT led early, set a reserved pace, drew away upper stretch and held sway under a hand ride. MISS BOBBIT raced in mid pack, was
hustled two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. OUR TICKET closed to mid pack, was hustled from
the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. CHERUBIC settled off the early pace, saved ground to the stretch, angled out and closed with good
energy. LINDA LOVES LACE pressed the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then hustled through the stretch. FLAT OUT FABULOUS settled off the
pace, came two and three-wide through the turn then rallied mildly. MY FINAL TRICK stalked the pace, raced four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out in the final 16th. ELITE PRINCESS pressed the early pace, stalked from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and was up close early
stretch but could not sustain the drive. CHASING DESTINY broke alertly but was quickly headed, pressed the leader on the backstretch and stalked
two-wide on the turn, then flattened out with a furlong to run.

MAGIC stalked the pace, was hustled four then three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but was outkicked. SWEET BOMBOLINI broke outward and
settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide late turn and finished evenly. EXIT STAGE RIGHT moved up to press the pace, chased two-wide late turn, bid
near the 1/4 pole but was also outkicked. NICE QUIST was away off slowly, stalked the pace along the rail, chased into the stretch but had no response in
the stretch. LOADED VIXEN held a short lead and quickly drew clear, set a reserved pace, was roused late turn and passed upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SEGUIMI sat in midpack in the two path early, rallied to loom four wide outside the embattled leaders nearing the stretch, bid at the three sixteenths and led
at the eighth pole, needing the wire desperately late. HYPERFOCUS trailed into the stretch, shifted out to find a seam, was hard to straighten out when one
appeared, got clear inside the sixteenth pole and was charging hard late but ran out of real estate. GIANT CRITIC hit the gate at the start and was pinched
back between runners early, came from off the pace into midpack along the inside and stayed on the rail into the stretch, closed inside the winner late with a
game effort. ENTRY TO HEAVEN was bumped by a rival at the start, settled in midpack and followed the winner two to four wide on the turn, tipped out to
the six path into the stretch but his close was compromised by lugging in all the way to the wire. VELOCE sat three wide near the rear on the backside,
came three to four wide into midpack on the turn and bested the rest without challenging the top four finishers. SELFMADE rushed up the inside to track the
leaders along the fence, got a nice seam on the rail turning for home and had a brief lead but was outkicked down the stretch. SOUPER COHIBA trailed into
the turn before circling three to four wide on the bend, in the nine path outside all turning for home and mildly closed down the middle of the course to the
wire. LION KINGDOM trailed down the backside, rallied mildly three wide on the turn and angled out at the three sixteenths but the run was over shortly
after. LYRICAL GANGSTER sat in midpack three to four wide on the turn outside the eventual winner, fanned into the eight path turning for home and did
not reach contention. LION'S GOLDENHEART along the rail and near the rear, moved up inside on the turn and awaited room behind a wall in upper stretch
but had no run when clear space was opened up. BREATHLESSNTHESAND led quickly, was stalked and pressed on the turn and headed turning for
home, retreating down the lane. ITMAKESMEWONDER stalked the leader down the backside, bid between rivals on the turn and backed up down the
stretch. WHISKEY VICTOR broke out and bumped a rival at the start, up to press the pace three wide on the turn but retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
BAHIA GIRL broke inward, stalked the pace, wide the rail then two-wide on the turn, closed into the stretch, rallied and led 70 yards out under a strong late
charge. CHASING SHADOWS stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch but was outkicked. SPIN THAT TUNE
pressed the pace, bid at the top of the stretch, drew clear quickly but was passed in the late stages. KERICS BEAUTY settled off the pace, closed two-wide
late turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly. HEKLA'S AURA broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled three and
four-wide late turn then finished evenly. BILLYJANE dueled, led into the turn, was engaged mid turn and was passed upper stretch then leveled out.
MOMMA CARRIE showed early speed, forced the pace, bid in earnest mid turn, was passed upper stretch and flattened out. PSARRIS pressed the pace,
dropped back late turn and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
DANCING DOLL three wide and chasing the leader early, bid in tandem with the eventual place finisher as they got the front at the eighth pole and prevailed
over that foe in a stiff drive to the finish. GET NONE broke awkwardly and made contact with a rival at the start, advanced inside the winner to bid late on
the turn, could not match that one's late push down the lane and settled for a game second. VALLEY GIRL broke awkwardly, settled in midpack and in the
two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and closed doggedly in the final stages outside for the show. LADIES SIGNATURE broke in and made
contact with a rival at the break, sped to the front, was stalked and pressed on the turn and held game to the eighth pole, fading from that point. AIRY FAIRY
was outrun for the lead, chased inside the top two finishers, angled out in the stretch but couldn't pass anybody after a pretty soft trip. SAMURAI QUEEN
settled in midpack and along the inside throughout, inching up down the lane on her own power without urge in the final sixteenth. HALFINTHEWRAPPER
had her head up in the air at the start and trailed the field, put in a mild rally on the turn but was never in contention. HASN'T HIT ME YET trailed the field
into the stretch and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SELF INFLICTED raced in mid pack, saved ground, was hustled on the far turn, rallied gamely and was up in the final yards, driving. KNOPFLER led
quickly, set a very pressured pace, bravely held off suiters through the far turn and stretch but was caught in the final yards by a closer. FINAL STRIKE was
away slowly but settled in striking range, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, drew even a 16th out but was outfinished by the
early pacesetter and the closer. MAJESTIC MELODY showed speed looking for the front moving towards the first turn, drifted out six-wide, settled in mid
pack but continued to race four to six-wide through both turns, closed on the far turn and finished gamely from the outside. LUCAS N' LORI was off slowly,
stalked the pace two-wide, chased into the stretch but evened out. MATINEE forced the issue throughout, tried hard and often to pull alongside the
pacesetter and finally weakened in deep stretch. AGNELLI settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then chased gamely through
the stretch. ROBUSTO raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the clubhouse turn, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then evened out in the
stretch. CANADIAN SECRET stalked the pace, dropped back a bit on the far turn and was still game in the stretch. KITTEN'S BOY was off slowly, trailed
the field but closed a gap on the far turn but failed to menace. WE TAKE CHECKS pressed the pace three-wide to the top of the stretch and tired.
