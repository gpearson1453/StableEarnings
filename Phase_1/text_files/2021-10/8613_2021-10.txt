Footnotes
LACOUGRA led quickly, set a pressured pace, moved clear through the turn then widened in the stretch and finished under a hand ride. FOREST VIXEN
hopped at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely and was a clear
second. I'M NOT PERFECT pressed the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn but leveled out in deep stretch. SWEET EDITION was off
slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide late turn and chased in vain through the stretch. DEVINE DANCING pressed
the early pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn, drifted out a bit at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. PSARRIS raced in mid pack, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn then posted a mild late rally. PAPA'S SILVER raced off the pace, angled in from three-wide to the rail on the turn
then rallied mildly along the fence. THATNIGHTINTORONTO stalked from the rail, was hustled on the turn then finished evenly. BELLASPINA was herded
outward a bit at the start and settled off the pace, trailed on the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ARRIVISTE was two wide chasing the leaders on the first turn, advanced two to four wide on the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, fell back in upper stretch
but dug in and rallied past that one in deep stretch, winning in a head-bobbing finish. LADY MOONSHINE chased along the inside, angle out early on the far
turn, led at the five sixteenths marker and cleared off in upper stretch but was caught by the winner right on the wire. BUTTERED TOAST trailed while three
to two wide on the first turn, circled runners four to five wide on the far turn and loomed in the six path turning for home but levelled off in the final seventy
yards, game to hold the show. VIVID VIXEN was bumped by a rival at the start, bore out inconveniencing two rivals on the first turn, on hold in behind
runners into the far turn and rallied up the inside upper stretch but evened out in the final sixteenth, holding on to a minor award. TRANQUIL SKY began
awkwardly and settled off pace along the rail, advanced up the inside in the far turn but steadied for quite a spell awaiting room, put in a mild run down the
stretch when a clear path became open. TENPENNY NAIL was floated out into the four path into the first turn and settled along the inside mid backstretch,
came up the fence on the far turn and her rally stalled in the final sixteenth. SHEZ A SEALY broke out and bumped a rival at the start and settled at the rear
of the pack, came two to four wide on the far turn and out in the eight path turning for home, passing a few down the lane while still outside. SUSPICIOUS
MINDS went up to press inside the leader into the first turn, settled back to chase along the rail, rallied inside the eventual winner at the quarter pole but hat
was it for her, retreating down the lane. GWEN sped off down the backstretch to an open length lead, was collared by the eventual place finisher and
headed at the five sixteenths and retreated from that point. TOTAL BETTY stalked the leaders three to two wide on the first turn, still in range three wide at
the quarter pole but retreated in the six path down the stretch. PRINCESS LANNISTER waas carried out into the five path into the first turn, dropped back
from midpack while three wide on the far turn and was eased in down the lane while wide.

Footnotes
SOUPER PECAN broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed from the rail on the turn, bid a furlong out, was headed but came on again and was best in
deep stretch. SWIRLING DANCER stalked the pace, pressed the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch, led a furlong out but was nailed late. MOONLIT
SILENCE broke outward, settled off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn, rallied outside, lugged in upper stretch then finished gamely. TRADING
BAY raced in mid pack, closed five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished determinedly. CHARGINA got away slowly and settled off the
pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn and was gaining between foes in the stretch. BENNY'S BUTTON stalked the pace, was pinched back at the turn,
closed two-wide, chased into the stretch, failed with a bid a furlong out and gave way. FEDALIA raced in mid pack, was hustled three then two-wide on the
turn, chased into the stretch but her rally stalled with a 16th to run. ARTIE'S FIRST KISS raced from off the pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on
the turn then finished gamely in vain. IMAGERY was off slowly and settled in mid pack, came four then three-wide through the turn then rallied belatedly.
OL' BLONDIE set the pace under restraint, settled on the turn, drew clear approaching the stretch, was joined a furlong out and gave way. FOURTEEN
DAYS pressed the pace, forced the issue early turn, backed away nearing the stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PLUIE D'AVRIL sat three wide in midpack early, advanced two to four wide between rivals awaiting room at the quarter pole, got through a seam in the
middle of tiring pacesetters near the eighth pole and surged to the front at the sixteenth, holding safe a closing foe under a stiff drive late. BIG MAMBA
broke out at the start and was far back, moved up the inside on the turn and under a strong hold, tipped to three wide still on hold at the quarter pole and
swung out to the eight path in upper stretch, driving past the leaders at the sixteenth pole but the winner was already gone nearer to the inside at that point.
SEA ANNA DREAM stalked the early duelers in the three path on the backstretch, loomed outside that pair turning for home and got by the pace survivor at
the sixteenth pole but the top pair were already well in front. NAITAKA won the break and got the front, was pressed to her inside by a rival, put that one
away late on the turn and led to the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. ONEZY'S DREAM sat four wide in midpack early, came two to three
wide on the turn and put on hold awaiting room behind a wall at the quarter pole, mildly rallying down the lane while lugging in. HASSAH (GB) began
awkwardly and rushed up to chase the leaders along the inside, in behind the frontrunners turning for home but was beaten to a seam between those two by
the winner at the eighth pole, outkicked from that point. TUSCAN DAMSEL sat along the rail in midpack, was in range turning for home but lost her path at
the eighth pole and took up, coming outside with a minor rally after that incident. VINYASA trailed far back down the backside and rallied past a few
stragglers down the lane. SADIE IRENE sat in midpack and dropped back two to three wide on the turn before showing some late interest in the final
furlong. SECRET ARCHANGEL came up inside the early leader to duel, stayed on to the top of the lane but retreated from there. MY SUGAR PIE began
slowly, had two beat into the turn, came three to four wide to the quarter pole but her mild rally stalled in the final furlong.

CAPABLE stalked the pace, closed into the far turn, took command and drew away then held sway under a strong hand ride. LIL'S TURN settled in mid
pack, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and gained steadily. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail
and two-wide late on the final turn, chased into the stretch but was outfinished for place. POST TO POST settled in mid pack, saved ground on both turns
then finished evenly. INTRICATELY raced in mid pack, closed angling from the tail to three-wide on the far turn, chased to the stretch but her rally stalled n
mid stretch. FLECK settled off the pace, closed from the rail and two-wide through the far turn but leveled out along the fence in the stretch. CAPOEIRA
raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the clubhouse turn, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. STORMY
SUZIE broke outward and settled off the pace, raced three then two-wide on the first turn, closed to mid pack, angled from three to five-wide on the far turn
but never reached contention. CRUMLIN TIME settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the first turn, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but lacked a
rally. FACTORING led midway of the first turn, drew off and set a reserved pace, came back to the field and was passed early on the far turn, chased to the
stretch then faded in the stretch.
