Footnotes
MAD LUTHER was hustled to set the moderate early fractions, saved ground on the second turn, extended the lead leaving the second turn, felt pressure
from the runner-up in the final stages but was kept to task to prevail. SUNNY SPOT settled at the rear of the field, checked in tight quarters on the run along
the backstretch, was five wide on the second turn and rallied in the stretch to apply mild pressure on the winner while besting the rest. IMPERATOR stalked
the pace from a ground saving path and was outfinished by the top two. TOUGH IT OUT settled in the second flight and made a mild late gain in the stretch
run. SINGLE BARREL was four wide on the first turn, continued to have a wide trip while five wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run.
RUNAWAY KRISTIN settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor. KENZOU'S RHYTHM stalked the early pace, lost
ground along the second turn and tired in the late going. UNPOSSIBLE tracked MAD LUTHER into the second turn and gave out in the stretch.

Footnotes
LONG LANCE stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, closed on KNOCKOUT BERT nearing the furlong marker and was ridden out in the late
going. K P SILVER BULLET was away a step slowly and settled at the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and closed well in the stretch for second,
while no match for the winner. KNOCKOUT BERT was away in good order and set quick fractions while saving ground, was collared by the winner nearing
the furlong marker and weakened in the late going, missing for second. CASHLINGS settled in the second flight, was asked for run on the turn while five
wide and did not offer a late rally. IMISSBAYMEADOWS chased the early pace from a four wide position and tired in the stretch run. SPEEDY TRIP
prompted the early pace, lost ground off of the turn and faded in the stretch drive. STORMIN GALILEO chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn and
gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
EVENEREVENWORSE was away well and set quick fractions while extending the lead and was ridden out in the final sixteenth as much the best. COJO
had no early speed, mounted a bid from the rear of the field while six wide and while no match for the winner kept on in the stretch to claim the place.
HANDSOME ACCOUNT chased the early pace from the four path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, losing the nod for second in the last
strides. AMITY HARBOR stalked the pace and weakened in the stretch run. LASTBESTHOPE was shuffled back at the start, chased the leaders while five
wide on the turn and tired in the stretch drive. CIBERTRUCK had no early speed and did not offer a late rally. WINK AND A DREAM chased the winner from
a three wide position into the stretch and faded in the late stages. REFUSE sat just off of the early pace, lost ground on the turn, was eased and walked off
under his own power.

Footnotes
COCOA CENTS was away well and assumed command of the slow pace, saved ground throughout and while feeling mild pressure at the end held to
prevail. STARS OF BLUEGRASS was forwardly placed, was three wide between foes on the second turn, gained ground in the stretch and just won the nod
for second in the final strides. NICOLE GRACE settled near the rear of the field, saved ground in the two path on the second turn, rallied leaving the turn
and just missed for second. FANTASTIC SECRET stalked the pace from a ground saving trip, steadied in tight quarters along the rail heading into the lane
and was outfinished in the late going. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was shuffled at the start and settled near the rear of the field, saved ground throughout and
made a mild late bid in the stretch. AMERICAN ROYALTY had no early speed, was five wide on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch.
PULPIT SINGER prompted the pace from a two wide position and faded in the stretch run. ALWAYS IN VEGAS stalked the pace while three wide and gave
way in the stretch. IRISH AFFAIR chased the leaders from the second flight, was four wide on the second turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES was away well and contested the early pace with MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH, continued to duel on the front end with that rival on the second turn,
put him away leaving the second turn and edged clear in the late going. DEL MO was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground while two wide on the
second turn and closed well in the stretch to claim the place. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH dueled for pace duties with SAINT IVES, was two wide on the second
turn while still contesting the pace, was turned away by SAINT IVES leaving the second turn and was outfinished in deep stretch. LEN'S LUCK was a step
slow leaving the gate and settled at the rear, rallied from four deep on the second turn and just missed for third. LITTLE CASINO sat off of the early pace,
mounted a bid on the second turn from the three path and made a mild late gain in the stretch run. BROOKYS TAPIT tracked the early pace, lost ground
along the second turn while three wide and tired in the late stages. HANS GRUBER tracked the early pace from the midflight, pulled on the jockey along the
run on the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. DIAMOND WILLOW was forwardly placed in the early going, was still
near the front on the second turn while four wide but quickly dropped back and gave out in the stretch drive.

TOP HARBOR sat off of the early fractions while saving ground, rallied along the inside in the lane and just nipped IN OUR A on the line in a game win. IN
OUR A attended to the early pace from a two wide position, tipped out for the stretch run, dueled with TOP HARBOR inside of the final sixteenth and was
just nipped for the win in a game runner-up effort. WAR GAMES was hustled to show speed leaving the gate and set the pace through the turn while three
wide, was confronted leaving the turn and weakened in the late stages, and was reported to have bled when pulled up. R M C HOOK'EM stalked the early
pace from a two wide position and was outfinished in the stretch run. JAMMING EDDY settled at the rear of the field, was three to four wide on the turn and
did not have a late kick in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LUCAS MCCAIN was away fast and showed speed through the turn while saving ground, had a clear lead into the lane, felt pressure from the runner-up in
the final sixteenth but held to win in a drive. GOOD OLD FAITHFUL tracked the leader from a three to four wide position and was gaining on LUCAS
MCCAIN in the final sixteenth while running on the left lead but could not reel him in while besting the rest. ZERO DOWN pressed the pace from a two wide
position and was outkicked in the late going. BARHOPSKY had no speed early, improved position off of the turn and continued that rally in the stretch but
was not pressuring the top three. LEMON DROP SHOT settled near the rear of the field while saving ground and made a mild late gain in the stretch run.
BLAZING JAMIE was shuffled at the start and was hustled to chase the pace from the two path, finished evenly in the stretch and was reported to have bled
when pulled up. ELCONDOR tracked the early leader from the inside and weakened in the stretch run. TIGER'S ARROW chased LUCAS MCCAIN while
four to five wide on the turn and tired in the late going. BRAZENLY chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn and was not a factor. LEMON ZINGER
stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground and gave way in the stretch.

end. TIGER QUEEN was pinballed at the start and was hustled to chase the early leaders, gained ground leaving the turn and while outkicked by the winner
kept on to claim the place. GRINNINGEARTOEAR tracked the early pace from a three wide position and was outkicked in the stretch run. CHIEFTAIN'S
LADY chased the quick pace from a five to six wide path on the turn and finished evenly in the drive. STRIKING SERMON settled near the rear of the field,
saved ground on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch. GO SMILEY GO was away a step slowly, was outrun in the early stages, saved ground on the
turn, rallied leaving the turn and continued that run to make a late gain in the stretch. CAROLINA MIA chased the early pace from the inside and weakened
in the late going. MADDIE'S MOJITO was away well and set quick fractions through the turn, had a clear lead into the stretch but faded in the drive. SWEET

FINAL FINAL was unhurried in the early going, was content to trail through the backstretch, mounted a bid while seven wide on the turn to circle the field,
collared BARBARONI with a sixteenth to go and kicked clear in the end. HAMMERING LEMON settled near the rear of the field, improved position leaving
the second turn while saving ground and was closing well in the stretch but was outfinished by the winner while getting up in time to claim the place.
BERNALINHO was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground along the second turn, gained ground in the stretch but was outkicked by the
runner-up to miss for second. BARBARONI was five wide on the first turn, tracked the leaders from the second flight, mounted a bid while five wide on the
second turn to take the lead leaving the turn but was outfinished in deep stretch. DI LAURIAN settled near the rear of the field while saving ground, rallied
off of the second turn but flattened out in that bid in the late stages. CAPE POINT was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace from the midflight, was
five wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. TEMBO stalked the pace in the middle of the field, saved ground on the second turn, clipped heels
nearing the furlong marker while in tight quarters and was empty in deep stretch. CROWN AND PICKLES stalked the pace from a ground saving position
and weakened in the stretch drive. ROARING TIGER was forwardly placed through the second turn and gave way in the stretch drive. SPECIAL MISSION
prompted the pace by VOICE OF VICTORY through the second turn and tired in the stretch run. VOICE OF VICTORY was away in good order and set
quick fractions while being prompted and faded in the stretch.
