Footnotes
CLAYTON DELANEY off slow from inside, stalked along the rail and waited around the turn, found clear sailing entering the stretch, was crowded a bit in
upper stretch but rallied through unaffected, challenged FIGHT ON inside the furlong grounds and proved best. FIGHT ON raced in range outside rivals,
exited the bend four wide, took over in upper stretch and got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. TIZHOTNDUSTY off slow to begin, tracked three wide
into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and faltered behind the top pair. OWNING was closest in pursuit and moved outside the
pacesetter, drew alongside into the turn, dueled around the bend, took over leaving the turn, led three wide into the drive, drifted inward in upper stretch and
relinquished control, then weakened in the final furlong. GRIT AND CURIOSITY got shuffled between foes early, chased off the rail then between foes, went
two wide around the turn, tipped three wide into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, steered out to a clear path and could not rally. POLAR sped clear to
take control early, moved down to the inside, dueled around the turn, lost command leaving the bend, lost contact into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
NO HANG CHARLIE pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear leaving the turn and drew off. BRAVESTONE off a
bit slow to begin, stalked the top pair inside a rival, went four wide into the stretch, lacked a late bid and stayed on to save the place. MONGOL ALTAI came
away slow and got bumped from outside, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied and missed second. IRRESISTIBLY SEXY broke out, moved down to the
two path early and settled off the pace, steered four wide on the far turn, drifted inward in the stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. BIG WELL set the
pace from inside under pressure, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished command then lost touch with the leader with a quarter of a mile
remaining and weakened down the stretch. CLUB MESQUITE bumped with inner rival at the start, got bothered from outside then put in a bit tight into the
first turn, tracked off the inside, angled to the two path on the final turn and weakened. MAYHEM AND CHAOS chased from off the rail early on, angled to
the rail on the second bend and faded. PRIMER DIMER off slow at the start, climbed along prior to the first turn, tugged closer early on the backstretch,
came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. ROCKETCENT showed early speed outside rivals then chased four to three wide on the
clubhouse turn, continued to track off the rail to the second bend, went three then two wide around the turn and tired. GONE AWOL off slow to begin, settled
inside, saved ground to the stretch and tired. FISHIN THE RIVER rank early and into the first turn, went five then four wide around that bend, remained off
the rail then angled into the two path on the far turn while tiring, eased in the lane and walked off.

BARSABAS off a bit slow from inside, saved ground through the turn, rallied inside the top pair and drove clear. MR. T'S THIRSTY had early speed outside
SAULS CALL, got floated out crossing surfaces early, lost touch briefly then came back to challenge on the turn, took over in upper stretch but could not go
on with the winner in deep stretch. SAULS CALL away quickly to establish the front, lugged out crossing over the dirt crossing early, cleared briefly then got
tested again on the turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened to third. DOUBLE THE GOLD stalked the pace outside a rival, exited the bend two to
three wide, tipped out in the lane and never threatened. LAST RENEGADE off slow from outside, trailed two to three wide into the lane and made no impact.

HOT ON THE TRAIL raced up close between rivals then ceded the lead on the first turn, stalked the speed outside a rival, bid outside on the far turn, vied
three deep at the quarter pole, fought with CONVINCE in the final furlong and got up. CONVINCE stalked the pace from inside, bid inside the top pair at the
quarter pole, led into the stretch, dueled with HOT ON THE TRAIL inside the furlong grounds and just missed. PERFECT ICE STORM traveled three to four
wide around both turns, lacked a bid in the stretch and kept on for a clear third. MISS YOU MOM unhurried on the inside, moved out to the two path and
failed to menace. NORTHERN GEM off slow from outside, took the first turn three to four wide, went four wide into the second bend, five wide into the
stretch and weakened. LADY ROBIN cleared rivals around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, tested around the far turn, vied between
leaving the bend, lost command and became rank while tiring through the lane.

Footnotes
HARBOR SKY stalked the top pair off the rail, bid outside on the far turn, took over with a quarter mile remaining, cleared with a furlong to go and drew
away. BOLD VOYAGER dueled for the lead in the two path, cleared away from rival at the half-mile pole, dueled with HARBOR SKY on the far turn, lost the
lead at the quarter pole, fought to the stretch, lost contact near the eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. LAUNCH PAD had early speed four deep
entering the first turn, ceded the lead to the top pair and moved into the three path, remained three wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late kick inside
the furlong grounds. INTENSE dueled for the lead from inside, jumped a shadow at the three-quarter pole, remained close up to press the pace, lost contact
with the leader at the half-mile pole, started to weaken around the far turn and tired. VEGAS MOON dropped back despite early asking, trailed two wide into
the drive and was not a factor. TEST DRIVE went five deep into the first turn, dropped back and angled to the four path around the bend, took the second
turn two then three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
IRISH HEATWAVE unhurried in the beginning, raced off the rail then angled in on the backstretch and took closer order from inside, tipped two to three wide
leaving the far turn, rallied outside the top pair with a furlong remaining, fought with BLAMELESS in the final sixteenth and edged the runner-up.
BLAMELESS turned his head and came away a bit slow, set the pace under pressure, resisted through the lane, finished gamely to the wire and got edged
by the winner. LIBERAL (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, between foes at the seven-sixteenths marker, chased two wide into the drive, steered out and
got up for third. FLY TO MARS pressed from outside to the stretch, faltered in the late stages and got edged for the show. STAGE READY sat off the pace
early on, raced widest up the backstretch, exited the far turn three to four wide and failed to respond. LUCK OF THE DRAW stalked the pace outside a rival,
raced three deep at the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide into the lane and never produced a bid. EAST RAND settled inside the moved off the rail,
steadied briefly at the halfway marker, lacked room and checked at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch then steered back to the inside and
could not rally. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) off slow to begin, saved ground then came two wide into the drive and made no impact.

Footnotes
HALF PAST TWELVE got brushed from outside leaving the gate, chased two wide into the bend, drew alongside with a quarter of a mile remaining, took
over then cleared in upper stretch and padded the margin late. YOUTEYOURHONOR tracked four wide around the turn and bested the rest. EMPIRE PASS
broke in and brushed the winner, chased off the rail, went three wide around the turn and never produced a bid. SALLY STANFORD sped clear to take the
lead, challenged by HALF PAST TWELVE at the quarter pole, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. LILLY BABE chased along the inside through
the turn, moved off the rail in the stretch, lacked room behind a pair of rivals late but never threatened. MISS RENO off slow to begin, climbed early and
dislike the kickback, steered out into the clear, went five into the turn, three wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
