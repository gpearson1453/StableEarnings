NIGHTATTHEMOVIES pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the
best under a mild drive. WISH FOR PEACE was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the drive and finished willingly. JO JO HANS was reserved
early while three wide, then came five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally for the show spot. AMIGOS GUITAR was allowed to settle early, then
was on the inside entering the stretch, lacked room for the furlong marker to the sixteenths pole, angled out late to be up for the minor rewards. FREEDOM
RACE chased the early pace towards the inside, then eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive but was empty. NICE WEATHER set a
pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command on the inside on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

UNBEKNOWNST TO ME prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn and widened the margin to prove best
under a drive. BRIDOLOGIST set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the quarter pole and faded while holding on to the place award. ORBERT
was four wide into the first turn, then settled four wide down the backstretch, dropped down to be two wide by the five sixteenths, then swung out five wide
for the drive and offered a mild late rally. PAPA TONY stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive but came up empty in the drive. FIND
YOUR BOAZ was off slowly, then settled in the back, was four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.

Footnotes
BEREN pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole, then turned back the bid from MARVELOUS
MIKE in the final furlong to draw clear under a drive. MARVALOUS MIKE tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole,
loomed boldly when straightened but could not go with the winner late while being clearly second best. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY was bumped at the start,
tracked the pace from the inside, angled out ion the stretch, bumped MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU, then was up for the show award. FIRE'S FINALE was
reserved early, came three wide into the drive, angled in by the furlong marker and had a belated rally to just miss the show spot. MEET ME AT MUNDIS
was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally on the outside. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU was allowed to settle early, made a
four wide ruin on the turn, then was bumped around the sixteenths pole while being empty. LIFE DON'T OWE YOU set a pressured pace on the inside and
faltered. The jockey on MEET ME AT MUNDIS claimed foul against the rider on DON'T LOSEMYMONEY, also the rider on MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU also
claimed foul against DON'T LOSEMYMONEY for the running in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the stewards left the race as is.
