Footnotes
TOLONDA set the pace from the start, drew clear in upper stretch and was clearly much the best in the end. ELIZA ROSE was bumped at the start then
chased the pace while two wide, made a bid but was no match for the winner in the stretch. RED QUEEN was hard to load then broke in and bumped at the
start, was unhurried early and moved out to be four wide in upper stretch but was no threat to the top two. REUNION BLING chased the early pace whole
inside, was hard used then gave way. ES IS I LIKE IT was unhurried early then rallied four wide in the stretch and was no threat. SECRET AVENGER was
inside early then made a bid two wide but was no threat. BOTTOMSUPBELLE pinched back at the start then rallied and was gaining ground but was no
threat. TRINITY'S STORM was through early and stopped.
