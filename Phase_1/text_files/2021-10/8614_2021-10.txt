Footnotes
DAZZY broke in at the start then was hustled, moved up under urging, drafted inside early on the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths, slipped through
inside a foe coming to the five-sixteenths, took the lead while cutting the corner into the stretch then shook clear around the three-sixteenths, drew away
under the crop to just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. FROSTED WILD RIDE moved up on the
outside to contest the pace, vied in the three to four path on the turn, moved clear inside the three-eighths, lost the lead under urging into the stretch, shied
in and out from the whip in the drive and weakened while clear for the place. MOSTLY HARMLESS broke in at the start, was urged along on the outside,
moved from three to five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while along for the show. DIAMOND
STATUS showed speed then was taken back and rated just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and
came up empty. MISS INVINCIBLE displayed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under
urging passing the three-eighths and faded. ROYALLY BLUE was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn
and retreated. KEEN DANCER stood in the gate and was slow into stride, dropped far behind the rest of the field and trailed. THREE-QUARTER TIME WAS

Footnotes
CHRIS AND DAVE coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of MUSICAL AMERICA from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths and advancing to take command five-sixteenths from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under tepid threat
a furlong out before rebuffing that challenger to inch away kept to task to the finish. TWO THIRTY FIVE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, advanced on the top pair and swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to nearly latch on a furlong out, came under a left side crop and
shied out near the sixteenth marker before shying out through to the finish under left handed encouragement and was ultimately repelled and shaken off to
the wire. CROATIAN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure
the show honors. MUSICAL AMERICA coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from CHRIS AND DAVE to the
outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, got headed with five-sixteenths to run, took the inside route into
upper stretch and tired. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide for home and tired.
CONTROL GROUP four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing with seven-sixteenths
remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
JOIN THE DOTS was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn, gained into upper stretch, took the lead into the final furlong
and drew clear under steady urging. VIOLENT VIXEN set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, inched away into the
stretch then was roused around the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
LADY VALENTINE pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired
but was clear for the show. MY SUNNY VALENTINE settled well back in the field, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TEKILA
settled just off the pace, chased in the three to four path on the turn and came up empty. R GIRL FAITH broke a bit awkwardly, raced near the back, lugged
out significantly on the turn, floated five then six wide late on that bend then came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. VENUS OYZO settled well
off the pace, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn and failed to respond. ANGELOVERTHEPULPIT was urged along on the outside,
dropped back fast leaving the backstretch, fell to the rear while four then three wide on the turn and faltered.

path with nine-sixteenths to go, remained just off the inside through the turn under some pressure from FIRST CONSTITUTION along the inside, cornered
two to three wide for home, got roused straightened away and drew clear under a drive getting geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably
on the wire. FIRST CONSTITUTION (CHI) bobbled at the start, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before tucking inside and advancing
near the nine-sixteenths pressed the pace along the rail under coaxing from the three-eighths through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON chased along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. LIMONITE five to six paths off the inside early on,
steadily tucked inside to be along the rail with half a mile remaining, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch
and improved position to the finish. T LOVES A FIGHT two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the turn placed to coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. YANKEE DIVISION rushed the gate bouncing open the stall just prior to the latch
being sprung, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the finish.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
ANADOR (FR) was well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path at the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid into the stretch then was
asked for her best, took a short lead into the final furlong, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FULL COUNT
FELICIA went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came
under the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final furlong, dueled gamely with that foe to the wire and just missed while clear for the
place. BESIDE HERSELF settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response
while able to get the show. MISS YOU ELLA was reserved off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
SHINE settled on the outside without cover, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond. MISSY GREER was asked leaving the gate, tracked the
pace down the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the turn and tired. ACE GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, went two
to three wide early on the turn, shifted five wide late on that bend and failed to threaten. SIGNORA D'ORO dropped well behind, traveled around the turn in
the two path, moved out near the furlong marker and was no factor. BEYOND THE HYPE broke in and bumped with an opponent, was a bit keen under
restraint early on the backstretch then reserved off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and never reached contention. HYPE HOUSE settled towards
the rear, was roused three wide on the turn and also failed to respond. S OH S was taken under a tight hold early then reserved off the pace, dropped back
while inside to the two path on the turn and faltered. TIZMET broke out at the start, was forwardly placed down the backstretch, dropped back three then
four wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
HAGLER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command just inside that station and swung four wide into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. ICONIC ADVENTURE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the place
honors well clear of the rest and along second best. DADS GOOD RUNNER chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. RED LINE OVERDRIVE broke inwards under hustling and showed the way in hand just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside at the quarter pole and yielded the front before straightening away into upper
stretch, then weakened in the drive. UNION LIGHTS brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PERFECT
FLIGHT hustled from the start, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn ridden along from midway, tipped
five wide into upper stretch and tired. JUPITER RAIN chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper

GRUDGE came away in good order and went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, vied inside while challenged on the turn, shook off a foe
when that one was taken in hand outside the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and held sway under
strong urging. SOCIAL WHIRL settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then came between horses,
pursued the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe with good courage late but missed while able to get the place. JILL'S A HOT MESS was rated just
off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly but was
out-kicked while clear for the show. FETCHING dropped back early, went three wide early on the turn then floated five wide and failed to threaten. KEPT
WAITING settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BUSTIN BAY settled towards
the rear, moved out nearing the half-mile pole, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no factor.
ITSAKEYPER tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the two path on the turn, was taken in hand after bobbling inside the five-sixteenths
then dropped back, spun three wide into the stretch and capitulated. SUMMER BREW was hustled from the start, raced just off the pace, dropped back two
then three wide on the turn and faltered. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
CHLOE ROSE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command at the
three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish kept to task. GREATEST LOVE just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped five wide
through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, shied out suddenly near the quarter pole, the rider taking hold and pausing before
swinging eight wide into upper stretch, got re-engaged to a drive near the eighth pole and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the place honors. LEFT
LEANING LUCY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROSEY'S
PEACH five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, was spinning just off
the inside for home when deciding to suddenly veer out to the seven path straightening away, then offered up a mild bid. GUNS BLAZING led early on
before dueling from the two path with SHAKER SHACK to her inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, yielded
the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. PENDOLINO chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHAKER SHACK advanced after the early stages coaxed along to duel inside of GUNS BLAZING into and
through the turn, got shaken off near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead while
asked for his best in upper stretch, shook clear under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead when switched to a
right-handed crop and given one pop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. PULSATE was rated
just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out three wide into upper stretch and finished with good courage to get the place. FAUCI settled on the
outside, was given his cue in the four path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get a share of the
show. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was last to commence, moved in while settling at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was roused while swinging
six wide into the stretch and improved position to share fourth money. BACKTOHISROOTS was in tight between foes early then rated off the pace, came
under urging in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MADE YOU LOOK settled off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole and failed to rally. BATTLE STATION went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
traveled around the turn in the two path, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and tired. EMARAATY (GB) broke near the back of the field, was
reserved off the pace, passed the five-eighths under a strong hold, went three wide on the turn, was roused while shifting five wide into the stretch,
remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed to respond.

Following a significant delay to the post time due to a technical issue regarding the photo finish in the prior race, SLOW CROSSING hustled from the gate,
got shown the crop to the right side and was coaxed along from the get go along the inside, tipped three wide through the turn advancing into contention
and swinging five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to collar the front a sixteenth from home, edged clear to the finish kept to task.
JET SET JULIET broke out at the start bumping LAFFIT GIRL in tandem with EUDAIMONIA who veered in and pinched that rival back between, showed
the way lightly coaxed along in the two path safely in front, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
growing threat and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to secure the place honors. BELLS ON HER TOES coaxed from the gate, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. EUDAIMONIA veered in at the start bumping and pinching back
LAFFIT GIRL against pressure inside from JET SET JULIET, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five to six wide through the turn, bid four
wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. ALICIA'S WAY chased five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and tired. SWEETIE PIE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. DERBY
KISSES chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and tired. PALS ALLY six to seven paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn getting ridden along from midway, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. Reluctant to load prior to the start, LAFFIT GIRL got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was pinched back at the start conceding
three lengths to the front, chased three to four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
SARATOGA SPIRIT hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four then three wide through
the turn retreating near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish.
