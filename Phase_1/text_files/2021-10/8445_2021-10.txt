BE SNEAKY shadowed leader off inside, shifted in midway through the turn, got through and assumed command entering the stretch, edged clear under
steady urging. FLASHING DIAMOND settled in hand, circled four wide to make his bid, was unable to reach the winner, but finished willingly to garner the
runner up spot. ABOVE PAR sped clear to set pace inside, drifted out a bit leaving the turn, relinquished the lead into the lane, weakened further in the drive
and settled for the minor award. CAUGHT UP IN YOU settled saving ground, angled out in the stretch but failed to make headway. WE MISS SUSIE was
close up three deep to the stretch and tired. REINA LA KELSY was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON FRONTIER was close up along the inside in hand, waited briefly in traffic near the quarter pole, altered out entering the stretch, quickened once
uncovered and drew away swiftly. CELTIC TREASURE disputed the pace along the inside, continued on willingly through a long drive, but was no match for
the winner through the final furlong. NORTHERN RIDGE contested pace three deep, weakened leaving the second turn, but had enough left to preserve the
show spot. FORTUNATE FRIENDS contended between rivals, took closer order on the second turn, but wilted entering the lane and faded. TAXABLE
GOODS unhurried inside, saved ground throughout and improved position some. OXIDE forwardly placed while hung wide for a half and dropped out.
ARRIVEDERLA showed little.
