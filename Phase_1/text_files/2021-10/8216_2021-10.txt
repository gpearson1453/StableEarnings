Footnotes
QUICKTRIP VAN showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail dug in when challenged and drew clear entering the stretch to win handily.
FRIENDLY FOE was well off the early pace but got a perfect rail trip on the turn and through the lane and was up for second. MUCHO GIFTED was forced
to go five wide entering the stretch and was finishing with interest. BARLOWS PRIDE showed good early speed but was in the two path held tough to mid
stretch and then gave way. THREE FOR THREE was well back on the inside in the early stages made a mild bid while never a serious factor. TULSA TIME
had an awkward break and the rider lost his irons at the outset. After slow break moved between foes while the rider did his best to control the horse and
was un-rideable throughout. WALKIN TALKIN BOB raced four wide on the turn and then gave way in the stretch. WILLY B raced wide while always well
back and had no rally.

came in the two path after stalking the pace and was up for second while no threat to the winner. GEORGIE'S WOOLF showed good early speed but could
not keep the winner to his outside going into the turn and weakened in the stretch. UNBRIDLED DIXIE was bumped at the start and off the early pace made
a mild bid between foes and was up for fourth. SEXY THING was well off the early pace came between foes to make a mild bid while never a serious threat.
SUPREME DREAM was mid pack four wide on the turn and dropped back in the stretch. PERFECT LILCHARLIE raced along the rail but never offered a
rally and was not a factor.

SHE'S SMART ENOUGH showed good early speed on the inside was challenged on the turn but repelled that bid and drew clear easily to win as the rider
pleased. BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL was just off the pace in the two path went after the eventual winner on the turn but flattened out through the stretch.
CELEE'S TE chased the pace along the inside came off the rail for the drive and could not make up the needed ground. BEHOLD THAT WORD raced
along the inside and never mounted a rally. SNICKEL TE raced in the two path and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

CELEE'S LAST TE showed the best speed and got to the rail opened on the turn and was never seriously challenged to win s the rider pleased. QUE TEE
stalked the pace while off the rail made a bid going into the turn but could never get close to the winner while second best. K B'S MINT was well in back of
the pack for much of the race made a mild bid through the lane to get third. DONNAS FINAL WORD chased the pace along the inside but could not make
up ground. JUST REMEMBER showed good early speed in the two path but tired on the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
TUFF WILLY TE had the perfect rail trip on the turn angled out at the head of the stretch and blew past the leaders to win handily. RED WES was prominent
from the outset while just outside the early speed held on gamely for second but could not go with the winner through the stretch. MY PAL came four wide
entering the stretch and was gaining and up for third in the final yards. CHUCK NAZTY was well back along the inside began a good run through the lane in
the two path and just missed third. KILO BRAVO showed good early speed on the inside and gave way late but was only beaten a pair of noses for third.
BUDDY NINER was in the back for much of the race made a mild bid to pass foes but was never a serious threat. E'S BIRTHDAY BOY was always towards
the rear of the pack and never mounted a rally. SAND WALKER broke very alertly but faded while racing wide and was not a factor. DIVINE TASK showed
good early speed while three wide but stopped through the stretch. BULLAWAY was mid pack and then steadied in the turn and dropped back quickly after
that.

path and made little gain on the top two. SLICK IT UP showed good early speed on the inside but gave way in the stretch. CONVENTION was last for much
of the race along the inside and never mounted a serious bid. JAZZY JUSTIN showed good speed in the two path but tired on the turn.
