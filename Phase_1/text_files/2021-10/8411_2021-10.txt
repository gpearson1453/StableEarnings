INDEFENSIBLE vied for the early advantage, took the lead around the final turn, dueled down the lane with ESCROW STYLE and prevailed for the win.
ESCROW STYLE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
COUNTRY CUT unhurried in the early part, racing near the back, made a late rail bid and held on for the show. VERO CAMPIONE lacked early speed,
gained ground late and was outfinished for third. THE BIG SHOW dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. GOLDBRIDGE raced within striking
distance and weakened. RAISE THE PURSES void of early speed, raced outside around the first turn and showed little. SILENT TAP raced in the middle of
the pack, came around the final turn on the outside, dropped back and was outrun.

near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, rallied four wide down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was an easy second. SLITHER
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. VICE VERSA raced near the back in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
made a mild bid, but was never a factor. LEMNISCATE had a tight start, racing in the rear and was never close. VIOLENT WAYS broke in, challenged for
the early lead, saved ground and faded. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN raced in the middle of the field in the beginning, dropped back and was outrun.

LAST APPEAL dueled for the early lead, being challenged in the early part by MY BOY GUS, put him away, drove clear and won under steady urging. ON
TILT raced within contention, came around the turn three wide, made a late bid, finished willingly and was a clear second. COOL FIRE raced near the
middle of the field, came around the turn four wide, made an outside bid and was a clear third. HARRY'S LIL HIPPIE raced within striking distance, saved
ground around the turn, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. MY BOY GUS flashed early speed, faded and was no threat late. FLAT OUT FREED
lacked early speed and was never a threat. CAJUN BERTI void of early speed and showed little. ICE CITY GHOST always raced near the back and was
outrun.

Footnotes
A WISH FOR MADELYN went to the front, drove clear around the final turn and won under steady urging. DOBBY SUE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. SPECTACULAR IZZY was an early factor, racing five wide around the first turn, lacked
a late kick and proved no match for the top two. VELVET NIGHT raced near the back in the beginning, came around the first turn four wide, made a mild
bid, but was no factor. AUDACIOUS GIRL lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. GRACE'S GAL void of early speed, was never a factor,
while finishing evenly near the back. THIRSTYPROSPECT lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and showed little. SEVEN COME
ELEVEN raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat late. SALT LIFE ANGEL challenged for the early advantage and stopped.

Footnotes
BROWN EYED ANGEL went to the front, saved ground, dueled down the home stretch with MERLIN'S SISTER and proved the best late. MERLIN'S
SISTER raced within striking distance, took the advantage around the final turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of
others. PINTLALA raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. BEE HOUSE steadied early, getting out down
the front side, steadied again around the first turn, after trying to get out, moved up within striking distance and finished evenly. LAST DESTINY pressed the
early pace, put forth an even effort and lacked a late bid. MISS MABELEE raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
GOTTABEGOLDEN steadied in the early going, lacked running room and was never a factor. STORMY COLLISION lacked early speed and showed little.
SANDY'S WAGER always raced near the back and was outrun. ABIGAIL G challenged for the early lead and dropped back.

vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ANDIAMO GIACOMO challenged
for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. LULLABY BLING dueled on the front end, saved ground around the
final turn and lacked a late kick. UNDERDOG pressed the early pace, raced outside around the second turn, finished wide and lacked a finish. MACHO
RAPIDO void of early speed and was never a factor. BRAVURA CREEK lacked early speed and showed little. SIXTO always raced in the back and showed
little.
