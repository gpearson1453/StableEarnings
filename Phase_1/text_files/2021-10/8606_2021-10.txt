Footnotes
LI LI BEAR stalked the early pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then dueled late with
HOT PEPPERS, edged ahead of that one and held. HOT PEPPERS well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane, dueled with the winner late and lacked the needed late kick. BOO BOO KITTY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. STRAWBERRY POINT hit the gate at the start and was off slowly, saved ground through the
turn on the two path, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and closed for a share. MOON PARTY never far back, looped up four wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. MAGNOLIA MIST tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals and faded. LILY'S LEAD showed little. MAGNOLIA ROAD was no factor.

Footnotes
FINDING MISCHIEF sprinted to a clear lead in the early going, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure.
EXPONENTIAL mid pack and outside, looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain
and missed. SKYWALKING void of speed, looped three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged
up for the show in the final strides. LORD DARNLEY tracked the pace rating, raced boxed through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then weakened late and lost the show. NOT SO EASY mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid four wide into the
lane and had a mild gain. BIG CITY RED well placed and outside, moved to a stalking position, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn,
came through on that path and could not gain. POLITICAL RIOT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch and could
not gain.

Footnotes
KUHL STAR well placed and outside, held position three wide, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late.
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM bumped with PAPI BELLO at the start, well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. WADADA sprinted to a clear lead rating, held sway to the lane,
then weakened the final furlong and held the show. PAPI BELLO was sandwiched between horses at the start, moved up while angling out through the turn,
bid three wide into the stretch and got up for a share. ROJO TORO broke out bumping a rival at the start, and was a brief factor.

Footnotes
LOUDER THAN BOMBS well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled in in the late going and edged
up in the final strides. MAX K. O. tracked the early pace, angled out and moved up on the two path, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then
was outfinished. J P HELLISH sprinted to a clear lead inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then evened in the stretch and held the show.
DUROCHER allowed to settle, saved ground to the stretch, angled widest and got up for a share. GO MIKE allowed to settle, moved up three wide to
position, bid four wide and had a mild stretch gain. SPEARGUN well placed and inside, weakened after a half. STAR WEAVER allowed to settle, moved up
three wide into the stretch and had no rally. FUEGO CALIENTE was no factor.
