Footnotes
CASHEW unhurried in the beginning, moved up, four wide around the final turn, drifted in down the stretch, drove clear and won under steady urging.
LEGENDARY GIFT pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn, steadied down the stretch, angled out and finished willingly. TURF DANCER
vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't keep up with the top two. ONE TIME AROUND pressed the pace, raced outside around the
first turn, weakened and finished evenly. ALL EARS raced near the middle of the field, eased back, came around the final turn wide, improved position, but
was no factor. PI YO PRINCESS void of early speed, raced outside around the first turn and was never close. PRIDDIS broke a step slow, moved up to the
middle of the pack, came around the final turn on the inside, faded and was no threat late. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE dueled on the front end, saved ground
around the second turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
HOME VISIT pressed the pace, raced close throughout, dueled down the home stretch and proved the best late. MORE MEMORIES went to the front,
saved ground, dueled down the final stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. MO CREDO lacked early speed, moved up wide around
the final turn, made a steady gain, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. SCORING DRIVE raced within striking distance, saved ground
around the final turn and lacked a late kick. NICE STAR raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside and put forth an even
effort. JEFFROW lacked early speed and was never a factor. SMOOTH CUSTOM broke slow, racing in the back, moved up within contention and dropped
back. FORGED IN STEEL was slow leaving and never mounted a bid.

wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SAPONI raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. HARBOR KNIGHT void of early speed and was
never close. APRIORITY STORM void of early speed, finished wide and was no threat. PAT ME DOWN raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
DEALIN' STELEN unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals entering the final turn, raced outside around the turn, rallied and drove clear before
the wire. DEBONNAIRE DUDE pressed the pace, made a bid around the second turn, took the lead down the home stretch, put PADDOCK PICK away, but
couldn't match strides with DEALING' STELEN for the win. PADDOCK PICK went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and weakened late. EPIC (ARG)
raced near the back in the beginning, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MIDNIGHT REVOLT broke out, raced in the middle of the pack in the early part,
weakened and finished evenly. APPLEWOOD void of early speed, moved up, faded and was no threat late. FANCY THIS pressed the early pace and
dropped back.

Footnotes
CALLTHEWOLFE unhurried in the beginning, moved up in the inside around the second turn, rallied, took the lead, was all out and held off THE BIG
IRISHMAN for the win. THE BIG IRISHMAN raced in the middle of the field, made a late rail bid and missed. SLOW brushed at the start, pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ROCK ON COWBOY
sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. MY FORTUNATE SON broke out, raced within contention, came around the final turn on the
outside and weakened. ZYZACK raced in the middle of the field, weakened, finished wide and was no threat late. GOTTA A. P. B. void of early speed and
showed little. MAJESTIC SOCIETY always raced near the back and was outrun. ROVERTON pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn
and dropped back.

Footnotes
SOUTHPINE GIFT raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn, drove clear and finished well. TOWN DRUNK pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HALF A BITE raced in the middle of the field, steadied down the
backside, getting in tight quarters, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. ETERNAL FORCE lacked early speed, moved up within contention,
checked final turn to avoid down horse and went to the wire evenly. WAR VETERAN void of early speed, came around the second turn wide, moved up, but
was no factor. D'ROCK went to the front, drove clear, faded, steadied late to avoid down rival and was no threat late. BUCKETS raced within striking
distance and dropped back. FREUDIAN SIP void of early speed, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire. DIAMOND PALACE dueled on the
front end, racing wide around the first turn, took the lead around the final turn, fell, lost rider. Walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE
RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
