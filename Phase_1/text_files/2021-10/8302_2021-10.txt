MUSTY RED set pace while well handled, dug in gamely stretch to hold sway in the lane. HALABOUTTHAT just off top pair to the half, took up chase to far
turn and was coming on too late. DO YOUR BEST no speed early on, rallied up the rail from far turn for show. CITY PEAKS back early on, moved up to
contend far turn but flattened out in the stretch run. KISS OF CAIRO dueled early on, chased to the half but came up empty thereafter. ECHO MOUNTAIN
was through early, dropped back. FIRMAMENT never a real menace. G FOR GERRY dropped far back.
