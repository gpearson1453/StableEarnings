Footnotes
GOLDEN SPOKE took control inside, widened in hand on the final turn and remained safe under moderate urging. LAWLESSNESS moved closer wide
before half a mile, continued well but was no match for the winner. ILOVECHARLYBROWN angled wide on the first turn then moved back inside and
finished willingly. INACEPTABLE prompted the pace outside and stopped abruptly. BIG TIME OPERATOR ran off prior to the start and was ordered a late
scratch.

BOOM BOOM GIRL raced close up, split rivals into the stretch and edged away late while kept to her task. LEAN ON E forced the pace outside, led after
half a mile, continued gamely but was outfinished in the stretch. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE rated three wide just off the pace, drifted in near midstretch and
yielded. FED POLICY made a menacing outside bid on the final turn then flattened out. MISQUILLO lagged far behind then passed fading opponents.
OBSTINATE raced close up inside to the far turn and gave way. SOUTHERN CENTS hustled to the front inside, dueled then stopped abruptly.
JUMPINTOACTION lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FLASHY moved clear after a quarter mile then widened throughout under moderate urging. THE JONES BOY lost his rear footing at the start
breaking far behind his field then rallied strongly to get up for the place. INSPIRED OPTIONS was fanned extremely wide into the first turn, remained wide
and was nailed for the place. IMAGINE THIS led narrowly on the first turn then gradually faded. CHIEF RON rated close up between rivals into the first turn,
moved inside on the final turn and faded. RISQUE REBEL reserved wide off the leaders and lacked a rally. FIRST AVENUE drifted very wide into the first
turn and was never a factor. AMERICAN FLEET saved ground close up and gave way readily. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.
