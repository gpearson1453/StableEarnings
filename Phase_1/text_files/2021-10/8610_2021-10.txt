Footnotes
EXTREME set a clear pace from the outset, was in the two path into the lane and drew off down the lane in hand. WINDCRACKER stalked the pace early,
was on the inside into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. HOMETOWN HERO broke slowly from the gate, chased the pace early on,
was in the four path into the lane and had no late gain in the stretch drive. HOLIDAY TICKET tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and
faded late in the stretch. HURRY ON OUT was steadied repeatedly along the backstretch and empty in the stretch. PHAROAH CAT was through after a
half.

BROOKE MARIE set the pace, shook clear of a vying LADY OF LUXURY into the turn, then held gamely from that rival and a bidding outer foe through the
final furlong. HONEY I'M GOOD pressed three wide, chased around the turn, grinded away under a long drive through the lane, stayed on to produce a late
bid, but did not have enough to reach the leader. LADY OF LUXURY vied outside of the eventual winner early on, backed off to stalk into the turn, then
chased that foe through the lane while hanging on her left lead, and got outkicked by an outer rival for place. SOCIAL CHATTER trailed, took the turn at the
rear of the field three wide, then split foes in the final furlong to reach a minor placing. STRONG ODOR tracked two wide, but failed to make a bid. ALMS
saved ground off of the pace, then chased the leading trio through the lane, and failed to threaten. AMAZIMA lied off of the pace two wide, was held up
between horses into the turn, then failed to make an impact. DROP A HINT lied off of the pace three wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ZATIP dueled for the lead outside of COFFEE WITH ALEX, forged a narrow advantage from that foe entering the lane, kicked clear of that rival passing the
furlong pole, and widened while being kept to task under left handed flagging. JEGO stalked the dueling pair from along the inside, shifted outside of them at
the five sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase while proving no match for the eventual winner, then reached place a sixteenth from home. COFFEE
WITH ALEX dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, fought on through upper stretch after being headed at the quarter pole, but yielded passing
the furlong grounds, and lost place at the sixteenth pole. MAGAZINE STREET chased three wide under steady urging, got floated five wide turning for home
while failing to quicken, then chased through the lane while losing ground, but held a minor placing. NAPA VALLEY hit the gate at the start, lied off of the
pace in the three path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. GALACTIC EMPIRE lied far off of the pace in the two path,
swung six wide turning for home, but failed to factor. YOLO SANTIAGO chased two wide and between horses, got floated four wide by an inner foe at the
five sixteenths pole, but got outkicked by that rival, cut the corner entering the lane, and faded. LESLIE CHOW bobbled a bit a stride out of the gate, tracked
from the three path, then attempted a rail rally through the lane, but faded. RERALLY had a noticeable layer of sweat on his neck approaching the gate,
then broke slowly, and got outrun. MISTICAL CURLIN saved ground off of the pace, but weakened.

Footnotes
DYN O MITE set the pace along the inside, repelled PARKLANDS bid passing the quarter pole while shifting off of the railing, met MUTAKATIF (IRE)'s rail
challenged in midstretch, but held well from that foe. MUTAKATIF (IRE) broke outwardly, stalked along the inside, produced a rail bid inside of the pace
setter in midstretch, but was denied. TARANTINO turned his head to the right just before the gates opened and was unprepared for the start, sat reserved
far off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and rallied well to reach show
approaching the wire. THE LAST ZIP tracked from the three path, moved closer four wide and outside of foes down the backstretch, got floated five wide
entering the lane while ranging up, but hung on his left lead through the lane, sustained chasing position through midstretch, but lost show a few strides from
the wire. ABSAM stumbled at the start, tracked two wide and between horses around the first turn, then failed to menace. FORTUITY tracked three wide
and between horses early on, relaxed back down the backstretch, then shifted six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. VINTAGE PRINT stalked four
wide, ranged up three wide and between horses turning for home, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, and faded. IRONSTONE ROAD lied far off of the pace
two to four wide, and failed to factor. PARKLAND stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. BUNDIBUNAN lied at the rear
two to three wide, got floated eight wide entering the lane, and was outrun. KINGMEISTER broke slowly, tracked along the inside, but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
YONO saved ground while trailing around the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, rallied between horses before pausing behind a wall of rivals
approaching the furlong pole, dove inwards to split foes two wide at that marker, then surged stoutly in the final sixteenth to blow past the leader
approaching the wire. IN DREAMS dueled for the lead two wide, cleared turning for home, drew off in upper stretch, but was caught by an oncharging foe
strides from the wire. POUR ME A DOUBLE settled far off of the pace, picked up stride while shifting three wide into the turn, swung six wide entering the
lane, and rallied to reach show on the wire. STEINBECK tracked from midpack two wide, chased from between horses in upper stretch, altered three wide a
sixteenth from home to claim show, but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe for that position. ROME stalked from the two path, split foes and took aim on
the leader around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth, but faded late. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT lied
at the rear two wide, then passed tired foes late. COMBAT MEDAL chased three wide under steady urging, got floated four wide into the turn, then faded in
upper stretch. PRACTICE SQUAD lied far off of the pace three wide, and never got involved. BENNY'S FIDDLE saved ground in midpack into the turn, but
faded turning for home. RUMBLE READY tracked four wide, but tired in upper stretch. MAGOO was sent early on to duel for the lead inside of IN DREAMS,
but weakened turning for home. CLOUD CREEK tracked three to four wide, then weakened through the lane.
