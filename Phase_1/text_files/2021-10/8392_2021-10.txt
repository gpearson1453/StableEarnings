Footnotes
EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE attended the pace, vied between foes three wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch and kicked clear while being kept to
the task. SWEET REGARDS stalked the pace from between runners, moved out from four to five wide on the turn shifting outside a rival, came into upper
stretch seven deep and kept on for the place. OUR ISLAND GIRL was off slowly then rushed inside, steadied on heels slightly near the seven-sixteenths,
continued inside on the turn just off the leaders, came out in upper stretch then again in late stretch while running on gamely. SEE YOU AT THE TOP
stalked from outside, asked for more outside the three-eighths and made an early bid midway on the turn moving in from five to four wide on that bend,
came out six deep turning for home and could not sustain the effort. CANDY CARMA set the pace racing in the two path and with outside pressure from
foes up the backstretch and into the turn, weakened in the stretch. TEXANA tracked in behind the leaders, moved out four wide nearing the five-sixteenths,
shifted in once in upper stretch and was in a bit tight between runners late. MS. LEA settled off the pace, went five to six wide on the turn and was never a
threat. MARIA'S TOWER was well back early going four to five wide through the turn before swinging out ten deep turning for home, failed to make a bid.
SANDPLUM CREEK broke a step slowly and failed to menace racing near the inside.

RIGGED TO RUN dueled outside a foe, took charge two to three wide on the turn, cleared off in the lane under steady handling. WAY RITE stalked just off
the dueling pair, went three to four wide, was no match but second best while lugging in and out just a bit in the lane. RUN LIKE THE WIND dueled inside
briefly, lost ground and was getting out near the five-sixteenths then switched out four wide at the quarter pole, weakened. SUPERBLEA broke inwardly and
slowly, lacked early speed and was not a threat. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

SAYWARD contended between runners going three wide on the turn, dug in to edge clear in the lane. TIME IS PRECIOUS tracked in behind the leading
trio, moved out from two to four wide on the turn then back in a bit, altered outside a rival in mid-stretch and kicked on to get up for place. ADORABLE
BRITTANY pressed from outside going four wide on the turn, lugged in a path in mid-stretch, lost second late. LAUGHING ROCKETT was in just a hair tight
at the start but quickly moved forward to vie inside rivals but off the fence, battled till upper stretch then weakened. RITZY STORM broke just a tad
awkwardly, settled off the inside, shifted in nearer the rail early on the turn, altered out in late stretch for room. NOBODY KNOWS WHO switched off the
inside going three to five wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MINE THAT STAR tracked the leaders from inside, came off the fence a bit on the turn, encouraged along past the five-sixteenths while losing ground on
the leading pair, moved out further in the stretch and got up late under continued urging. COMPETITIVE IDEA was urged from the break, set the tempo in
the clear but was soon joined by a rival early on the turn, dueled inside that foe but in the two then three path, was headed by that one in upper stretch,
drifted out in mid-stretch, turned back that challenger to regain command but was caught late. SKY JUMPER stalked the early pace then moved forward to
duel outside going three to four wide on the turn, was carried out in mid-stretch and yielded late. WILMAS IRISH ROVER switched well off the inside
clearing the gap then back in, moved out again from two to four wide on the turn, ran on. NUMEROLOGIST raced outside four to six wide on the turn and
wider still for the stretch run, was not a threat. CLAVICHORD tracked in behind the leaders outside a foe, lost ground going three to five wide on the turn,
shifted in once in upper stretch and made no bid.

Footnotes
WEST DAWN pressed the pace from inside, lost ground heading into the second turn, came out nearing the quarter pole and then further turning for home,
steadily ground away to get up late. JET N G settled inside just off the fence early, switched out heading up the backstretch, advanced four then three wide
on the far turn to commence a bid, drifted out under left-handed urging in late stretch and was caught. HUSTLE UP moved forward outside rivals shifting in
a bit early on the first turn, was rated while in control heading out of that bend and up the backstretch, challenged by an inside rival then by outside foes
while going two wide on the far turn, overtaken late on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. NEXT AFFAIR stalked three wide early, took closer order up
the backstretch, dropped back three wide on the far turn and continued to weaken some.

Footnotes
WINNIES OWN attended the pace from outside, took a short lead three wide on the turn, was still challenged into upper stretch then kicked clear under
steady handling. AISLE RUNNER vied inside the eventual winner, yielded late. MY STORM WARRIOR tucked in behind the leaders early, went two wide
into the turn moving out three deep later on that bend before swinging about five wide, failed to rally. ILIKEROLLIN settled off the leaders, saved ground on
then just off the rail on the turn, failed to menace. NEAR GENIUS broke awkwardly tossing his head but recovered to move forward outside in pursuit of the
leaders, went four wide on the turn, faded. SMOOTHING IRON raced last but one in about the five path and was not a threat. CHARLIE COMANCH broke a
step slowly at the start and was never in contention.

Footnotes
FOXY RED was urged forward to set the pace in the clear racing off the rail, went in the two to three path on the turn, was kept busy in the stretch and just
lasted. CORRINA CORRINA was off slowly and in tight at the break, switched outside a rival at that juncture, advanced six wide on the turn, was gaining
late but missed. DESERT SPIRIT was forced in at the break, switched outside a rival, moved in from four to three wide on the turn then back out again
turning for home, kept on with a steady and slow gain. SUERTUDA broke a step slowly and had to steady in tight quarters at the start, was thereupon urged
forward entering the turn two wide outside a foe and off the leaders, came out four wide leaving that bend, drifted in late and bothered rivals nearing the
wire. JAZZY HEAT broke inwardly, chased the winner four wide, weakened. SHEZACONSTANTSONG chased from inside, was two wide in the stretch run,
steadied late when in tight. RELEASE THE GENIE came out at the start, lacked early speed, went mostly four to five wide on the turn, swung ten wide
turning for home. MISS ABILITY angled in heading up the backstretch, went mostly two wide on the turn, was in tight quarters on the rail in late stretch and
had to steady. AXIS CHARM was fractious behind the gate, chased briefly inside, came out leaving the turn to enter upper stretch six deep, made no late
bid. LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY was loaded riderless, went four to five wide on the turn and was never a threat. WILEO PROCEED angled in early, went
three wide on the turn, was not a threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY BOTH THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF MISS ABILITY AGAINST SUERTUDA
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND THE FORMER.
