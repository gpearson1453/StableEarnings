Footnotes
LIZZY'S INTHEGAME settled near the rear of the field, was still near the rear on the second turn while three to four wide, improved position leaving the turn,
surged in the final sixteenth and got up just in time to win the nod. DESERT SMOKE was away in good order and set the fractions from a ground saving
position, had a clear lead into the lane, was all out in the final sixteenth but was nailed in the final strides by the winner while holding for second. SMILING
ANN tracked the early pace while forwardly placed, mounted a bid from three deep on the second turn but was outfinished by the top two in the stretch.
FANTASTIC SECRET was unhurried through the early stages, saved ground on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch run. PULPIT SINGER
broke through the gate prior to the start, attended to the early pace, gained a bit of ground on the pacesetter on the second turn but weakened in the stretch
run. BLUSHING BAY settled in the second flight, was four to five wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

SEGURO was away well and set quick fractions, had a clear lead into the lane and was mildly pressured in the end but was urged and held to prevail.
GLITTER LAKE settled at the rear of the field, mounted a bid while four to five wide on the turn and applied mild pressure on the winner in the end but was
outkicked. WICKS AND CHAPPIES prompted the early pace while saving ground and was outfinished in the stretch, holding for third. FAMILY TRIPS
chased the pace from the midflight, saved ground on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch to challenge for third. DISCERNMENT was hustled to track
the early lead from a three to four wide running position on the turn and had no final kick in the stretch. GOOD TIME DOLLY sat off of the early leaders, was
two wide between foes on the turn and did not offer a late rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
ACE AND KINGS pressed the early pace from a three wide position, chased ELUSIVE LOVE off of the turn, dug in and gamely prevailed in the final strides.
ELUSIVE LOVE was away well and set quick fractions while being pressured by ACE AND KINGS, was all out in the final sixteenth and was nipped on the
line for the win. FATHER O'FLAHERTY had no early speed, saved ground on the turn, rallied leaving the turn and got up in time for the show. BY
MOONLIGHT tracked the pace while two wide between runners, closed well off of the turn and missed for third. ASHLEY'S VALENTINE was forwardly
placed in the early going, was four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. SEA SAILOR was away a bit slowly and had no early speed, was four
wide on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch run. GOVERNOR ARTHUR settled near the rear of the field, was three wide between horses on the turn
and made a mild late bid in the stretch but was not impacting the leaders. MAGIC TIGER stalked the early fractions from a ground saving position and
weakened in the stretch run.
