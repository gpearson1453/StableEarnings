Footnotes
BIG CHEEKS, pinched back at the start, settled mid pack, chased four wide on the far turn, led at the top of the stretch and widened. NORTHERN CROSS
sat mid pack, chased four to six wide on the far turn and rallied outside late. JOLENE JOLENE, in mid pack early, came rail to three wide on the turn,
chased four wide into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. SNOW SQUALL broke inward at the start, raced in mid pack, hustled along the rail
on the far turn and closed gamely along the fence down the stretch. TWISTED PATH set a pressured pace, dueled into the far turn, had a short lead but
was passed at the top of the stretch. MS WICKED, in range, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace.
BEARTHESTORM was taken back at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention.
ALTERNATIVE VIEW was pulling early, stalked the pace, came three to five-wide through the far turn then finished evenly. SWEET SHADES broke
outward, forced the pace into backstretch, dueled into the turn, pressed to upper stretch and gave way. CEEBETT'S BOW stalked the pace, dropped back
nearing the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. RASPBERRY WILD settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then flattened out in the
stretch.

Footnotes
ORBALINE stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, bid a furlong out and edged ahead in deep stretch. LITTLE MISS CAT had speed, led into the
turn and shook clear, was pressured through the stretch and gave way grudgingly. D'S SOUL pressed the pace, chased two-wide and from the rail on the
turn and finished under a determined drive. FRERET raced in mid pack, chased four to six-wide through the turn then rallied outside. ROCHE'S POINT, in
range early, was hustled from the rail in mid pack on the turn then finished evenly. CHALDEA, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled three to
five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, bumped at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
finished gamely, but late. BABY DRIVER raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide turn then chased through the stretch. CHASING DESTINY
forced the issue early, stalked on the turn then lacked a closing response. TREASURE FINDER, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled angling from the
rail to three-wide on the turn then showed some interest in the stretch. MY FINAL TRICK, away slowly, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn but
evened out in the final furlong. FLAT OUT FABULOUS stalked the pace, chased three-wide from mid pack on the turn then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HICKSY chased the leader down the backside off the rail, in the three path early on the turn, had dead aim midstretch and drove by outside at the seventy
yard pole, inching away late. IRONSTONE hit the side of the gate at the start, rushed up into a clear lead while under restraint and off the rail, stayed in the
three path early on the turn and still off the rail into the stretch, collared by the winner at the seventy yard pole but staying game to the wire. OPTIGOGO
was crowded somewhat at the start and settled in midpack along the inside, hustled along the fence on the turn and angled out in upper stretch, gamely
grabbing the show spot late from a rival under a stiff drive. HEAT MERCHANT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, settled along the rail at the back
while under a hard hold, skimmed the rail and looked dangerous in midstretch but levelled off in the final stages and was outgamed for show. SOUPER
LEGACY was taken back at the start and steadied between rivals heavily coming out of the chute, unable to overcome these early inconveniences and put
in a rally of any kind. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA broke out at the start and chased very wide early, stayed in range while three wide on the turn but had
nothing left for the stretch run.

CONFIDENT pressed the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn, led a furlong out the held sway under a drive. CIELO D'ORO was away slowly, settled off
the pace, closed to mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. FROSTERIA led into the backstretch, set a reserved pace, was
hustled late on the far turn, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. ROMY raced from off the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then rallied
gamely between foes. CAPPY settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide late turn then finished evenly. BEQUIA raced in mid pack, was hustled
two to four-wide on the turn then rallied outside. MAGIC RIDE pressed the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, cut to the rail in mid stretch but evened
out late. ENGLISH SHIRL pressed the pace in hand, chased from the rail on the far turn but leveled out in the stretch. SEAQUELLE was away slowly and
settled off the pace, angled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. SUGAR SURGE raced in mid pack, was hustled along,
dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally. YOUENS, off slowly, gained a position in striking range, dropped back and bore out wide on the far turn then
failed to menace.

Footnotes
CHURCHTOWN settled inside while midpack early, angled out two to three wide on the turn to bid at the quarter and collared the leader in upper stretch, led
before the eighth pole and quickly opened up, just the margin of victory to be determined. CITRUS BOY sped to the lead with challengers inside and out,
had a clear advantage into the turn but a rival bid midway on the bend and the winner joined the fray at the quarter pole, lost the front at the eighth pole but
held the place spot safely late. HOLIDAY HOUSE chased along the inside, was behind a wall of horses at the quarter pole and got a nice spot along the
fence in upper stretch but could only grab the show spot, no match for the top pair. SCOOT DADDY was sluggish to begin and trailed the group, came four
wide circling runners to loom four wide outside the winner out of the turn but stalled in the final sixteenth while still widest. RONDURE was devoid of early
foot, came up the inside into midpack on the turn and rallied mildly to the seventy yard pole, then closed better with purposeful strides in the final stages.
SILENT FAREWELL stalked between runners early, bid midway on the turn and was heads up for the front at the quarter pole but ran out of run inside the
final furlong. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL showed no early foot and was off the pace between runners into the turn, figured it out somewhat in the final stages
when a mild rally kicked in at the sixteenth pole. LAST DAWN was wide at the back and running greenly throughout, passing only his stablemate down the
lane. MORE THAN A DANCE settled three wide in midpack down the backside and began to lose ground while still outside on the turn, never a threat.

Footnotes
THE MINKSTER was three to two stalking the leader on the first turn, began to turn up the pressure down the backstretch and bid on the far turn, lugged in
and brushed with that one when going by in upper stretch, got clearly by at the sixteenth pole and inched away late. DANCIN IN DA'NILE went to the front
quickly, was stalked and pressed by the winner throughout, brushed with that foe when he came up to get the front in upper stretch, fighting on gamely to
the wire but clearly second best. J M R BEST OF TURF out to inside stalk the leader early, fell back when the top pair hooked up into the stretch but
managed to come again along the fence to grab the show spot in a multi horse photo. SHAMATEUR sat in midpack along the inside, angled out into the two
path on the far turn and came through between runners late to grab a minor award. GOD OF LOVE off the pace early, advanced three wide on the far turn
but was run up in behind a stopping rival midway on that bend and shuffled far back, gathering up and closing strongly in the later stages after that
unfortunate event. MAD MOCHA hopped up at the start and was well off the pace, commenced an eye-catching circle run late on the backstretch and
through the turn to loom outside the leaders at the quarter pole, tiring understandably in the final sixteenth while wide. LARAQUE off the pace and steadying
out of the first turn while inside, was full of run late on the backside but steadied back out of traffic, circled two to four wide on the turn and tipped out into the
eight path in upper stretch, closing with powerful strides late outside when clear. KIDDIE HOLIDAY sat in midpack while two wide, came up in behind the
leaders late on the far turn and angled out in upper stretch but his mild run stalled in the final sixteenth. FAST FEET chased outside on the first turn, moved
up three wide to loom near the quarter pole but couldn't sustain his bid and faded in the final furlong. STRONGER TOGETHER two to three wide in midpack
on the first turn, dropped back when between runners three wide on the far turn and had no stretch bid. BRUTALITY steadied hard in behind runners on the
first turn, still giving the rider trouble along the fence on the far turn and a mild rally into the stretch was over by the eighth pole. HIDDEN HONOR was three
to two wide off the pace in the first turn, rallied four to five wide on the far turn but lugged in upper stretch and dropped back in the final furlong. LAMENT
bumped with a rival at the start and trailed the field, skimmed the rail into the stretch and seemed to have some run but was hopelessly out of by that time.
RUM CUP was bumped at the start, sat three wide in midpack before uncorking a wide rally late on the backstretch, stalling and backing up at the three
eighths marker.

Footnotes
AUBRIETA sat along the rail in midpack while the lead exchanged hands a few times, angled out two to three wide before the quarter pole and bid turning
for home, had the engine at the eighth pole and held off the closers safely late. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY sat in midpack between rivals on the
backstretch, came three to four wide on the turn into range and was up late on the outside for the place spot late but no threat to the winner.
CHOCOLATEADDICTION two wide and off the pace early, came three wide on the turn and went back inside into the stretch, twisting her head about and
running erratically down the stretch while lugging in and not changing leads, into the place spot by the sixteenth but lost it to a closer in the final stages.
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY was two wide in midpack early, moved up to bid late on the turn and was head and head for the lead in upper stretch but couldn't
hold the winner and lost positions late. SKYLERVILLE outside in midpack down the backside, was fanned four to five wide on the turn and out in the six path
turning for home, no threat down the lane. MARIE MACKAY broke out very wide at the start, came up to challenge the leader into the turn and took the front
at the three eighths marker but was immediately tackled by a rival and once headed nearing the turn for home, retreated. ELEGANT JOY was slightly
steadied at the break and dropped off the pace, never entered contention while in the two path throughout. FULMINATE went to the front, was stalked and
pressed by a rival, headed at the three eighths and retreated along the rail.

Footnotes
O'KRATOS had early speed, set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn then held under a drive. DANI'S VICTORY settled in mid pack, closed three to
five-wide through the turn, rallied, gained steadily and just missed. DOWNY BOY raced in mid pack, chased hard two to four-wide late turn then rallied
gamely. VICTOR'S DYNASTY settled off the pace, chased along the rail on the turn then closed between rivals in the stretch. DOT'S VISION in range, was
hustled three-wide on the turn, was blocked in the final furlong, altered course a bit and closed late. KITTEN'S SOLUTION settled in mid pack, was hustled
four and five-wide on the turn, chased through the stretch but evened out late. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE bumped with WHISKEY VICTOR leaving the gate,
settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch then rallied belatedly. SURE WOULD FOREST hit the gate leaving and
settled in mid pack, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. CHEEK TO CHEEK settled off the pace,
closed four to six-wide on the turn, rallied outside but never reached contention. WHISKEY VICTOR broke outward and bumped SEVENTYSEVEN STONE,
pressed the pace, chased three-wide late turn but his rally stalled mid stretch. DRENA'S BULLET hopped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled
four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. BAY OF RUM pressed the pace, dropped back three and four-wide under a
ride on the turn and lacked a rally.
