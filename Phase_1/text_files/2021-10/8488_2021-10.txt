Footnotes
VOLODINA advanced three wide down the backstretch, took over midway on the turn and edged away. BIG RED SEVEN stalked the pacesetter outside,
dueled on the turn and faltered. SILVER EXCESS lacked speed, was asked for run on the final turn then rallied mildly. CREEDIBILITY trailed early,
advanced wide and continued willingly. HOLA PRINCESS dropped well behind and was never in contention. NOT IN THE MOOD saved ground off the pace
and yielded. ENIGMATICA broke alertly and led inside then stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
KISSMELIPS controlled the pace inside, shook clear on the final turn and edged off while kept to her task. SWEET SAMURAI prompted the winner outside,
proved no match but was easily second best. LET'S CELEBRATE saved ground close up then flattened out in the stretch. SUPERHELPFUL dropped far
behind, moved wide in the stretch rallying. BEAUTIFUL STAR saved ground, faded on the turn then came again while no threat. CHELSEA WALL dropped
back early near the inside and lacked a rally. SHANG'S SISTER raced close up outside early then faltered on the final turn. AFRICAN SONG chased in
midpack then gave way readily. IRISH JUMPER was a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

path and drifted out through the stretch. MARTINI'S AMICA lacked speed then continued well while no threat. GOLD WATCH raced wide and never a factor.

BOAT'S A ROCKIN controlled the pace inside, widened in the stretch and maintained a safe advantage ridden out. AMERICAN NINJA settled inside, rallied
into the stretch and was easily second best. EL BORRACHO dropped far behind, moved strongly very wide too late. ATTA KID dropped back early, moved
wide then flattened out. STORM FACTOR made a menacing inside move on the the final turn then faltered. NATIONAL HONOR lagged far behind inside
and was never a factor. DRAMATIZED prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. THANK YOU RICKETTS broke slowly then passed fading
rivals. I SAY I PLAY raced within range for half a mile and stopped. OVERBOLD was urged close up briefly inside then gave way.

Footnotes
WHY WHY PAUL WHY advanced outside, took over midway on the turn, moved clear under urging then was geared down late. RIDIN WITH BIDEN broke
in a tangle, rallied very wide and closed well without threatening winner. THREE TWO ZONE hustled to a clear advantage, was collared on the final turn
then weakened. SUPER DUDE raced within range between rivals and flattened out. OPTIC WAY chased close up wide and lacked a response. BRILLIANT
CHASE saved ground, was briefly closer before half a mile then faded. RUNNINGFORHOME dropped back early and raced far behind throughout.
