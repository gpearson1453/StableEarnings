Footnotes
PORKETTA tracked inside, angled into the five path entering the lane, gained momentum while straightening then drove past and remained clear to the
wire. PEEKACHICA was off a step slow and was bothered when attempting to gather, raced in the two or three path through the turn, swung into the lane
from the eight path and finished with good energy to be up for the place spot. PRINCESS CONSUELA raced in the four path through the turn, came into the
lane from the seven path and moved up for the minor share. BLAZING FIREFLIES set the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then
could not keep up through the final eighth. JUSTA DOLL raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane then moved up while passing tired ones.
SWEET SKY pressed the leader while two wide and traveling in the three path, was well positioned into the lane then tired. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, raced in the six path through trough the lane and tired. ZIGGY'S STORM tracked the pace along the
inside through the turn and into the lane and was empty turning into the lane.

MAJESTIC CLIMB moved clear soon after the start, raced in the two path through the turn while maintaining a clear advantage, rider took a peek into the
lane then offered minimal urging while keeping interest and geared down the last fifty yards. MAJESTIC ICE chased the pace along the inside into the turn,
was roused after straightening but lacked a closing response. B DEB'S FORTUNE was never a threat while racing off the rail into the lane.

Footnotes
ZING set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, was put under pressure approaching the quarter pole, continued under pressure into the lane, shook
clear inside the eighth pole and quickly extended the advantage to the wire. HEAVENLY HELLOS tracked the pace while along the inside into the far turn,
came off the rail in mid-turn to get closer to the pacesetter into the lane, was close while straightening in the lane then could not keep up, weakened late and
was caught to share the place spot. DOMITIA LUCILLA was unhurried early while just off the inside, moved up into the far turn, bid three wide through the
turn, was prominent into the lane, could not keep up with the winner while staying on well to get a piece of the place spot. MEGAN'S NOEL was unhurried
while racing in the three path through the turns and moved up while never a threat. CINQ SOUERS was never a factor while along the inside throughout.
SONG OF THE SIREN was outrun while in the two path. DIRTY NELLIE stalked the winner from the three path into the far turn then could not keep up and
dropped far back through the final eighth.
