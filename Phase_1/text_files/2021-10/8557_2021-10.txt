leaving, settled in range, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, launched her bid in the final furlong but was outkicked.
PROTECT, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then closed in the late stages. COASTING AWAY broke
outward and bumped PROTECT, showed speed, set a pressured pace on the backstretch but easily moved clear through the turn, then was headed upper

DIVINE GENESIS, in range along the rail, angled out leaving the turn, rallied, led near the final 16th and held under a drive. FORTY SMOOTH stalked the
pace, bid late turn, dueled all out, wore down her early rival, was passed with a 16th to run but held place. SHE'S A TRUE FOX raced in mid pack, closed
from the rail on the turn, angled out upper stretch and chased to the end. REIGN BY REIN, in range, came two to four-wide through the turn, was roused
upper stretch and finished gamely. SILENT GUROO led quickly, set the pace, was joined late turn, dueled, and gave way in the final furlong. ELEANOR
POWELL settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn and finished under a determined stretch drive. ALTERNATIVE VIEW raced in mid pack,
closed along the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out. BLUEYED PRINCESS settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the
turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. CHERUBIC hopped out of the gate and bumped IVY'S STAR, was a bit rank in the early going,
chased from the rail to three-wide on the turn but was never contentious. JOY'S SOLUTION raced in mid pack, dropped back on the turn, closed mildly but
was not a threat in the stretch. IVY'S STAR, bumped at the start, trailed on the turn then passed a tiring rival in the stretch. CAPTURE THE MOMENT raced
in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, tired at the top of the stretch, was eased up, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HEY MICKEY broke in and bumped a rival at the start, outrun early, moved up gradually to chase the leaders in between rivals down the backside and
around the turn, angled out to loom dangerous two to three wide into the stretch, continued to close on his wrong lead while laying in and got the front at the
forty yard pole, holding safe a late charger. POINT TO THE STARS off the pace early, advanced into midpack three wide on the turn, tipped into the six path
into the stretch and closed on the flank of the winner in the final sixteenth, unable to make up the deficit while inching up late. PERFECT PICTURE rushed
up to stalk the early leader to his inside, dueled on the turn before shaking off and clearing into the stretch, unable to hold off the winner inside the final forty
yards and dropping the place spot as well late. I AM RESILIENT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, settled in to chase the duelers along the rail,
angled out in upper stretch and had dead aim on the pace survivor but was dropping back when he got in tight between runners in the final stages.
MUROMEC leaped up at the start and trailed the field, came inside to three wide at the quarter pole, tipped out into the seven path into the stretch and
closed while widest to best the balance. BOUND LUCKY hit the side of the gate at the start and was taken up soon after, dropped back to off the pace and
was in the two path throughout, a mild rally along the fence in upper stretch stalled at the sixteenth pole. INNUENDO was pinballed between rivals at the
start, quickly recovered to get the lead, dueled with a foe to his inside on the turn and began to leak oil turning for home, retreating down the lane. TIMMINS
chased the duelers three wide early, outside the winner and four wide at the quarter pole, dropped back after staying in contention to the final furlong. THE
RIDER OF THE FOURTH PLACE FINISHER I AM RESILIENT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH. AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM OF FOUL.

Footnotes
BAYOU BELLE chase a four pack of leaders along the rail, moved up gradually on the turn, up inside the leaders in midstretch and outgamed the place
finisher in the final forty yards when that one drifted in to be beside her. GRATEFUL PRAISE began sluggishly and was off the pace, came up the rail on the
turn and angled out from the fence to the five or six path in midstretch, got the lead while widest at the sixteenth pole and drifted in to be beside the eventual
winner on the rail at the seventy yard pole, unable to match that one's late surge. QUEEN'S SPEED off the pace early, rallied in the two path on the turn
outside the eventual winner, angled out to the four path in upper stretch and drove by the tiring leaders near the sixteenth pole but couldn't match the
closing kicks of the top pair late. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD rushed up to engage the leader soon after the start, dueled with that one on the turn and had the
lead in the stretch but faded in the final sixteenth, hanging on for a minor award. A BROKEN BREEZE trailed early, was beside the eventual place finisher
early on the turn but could only put in a mild rally down the lane after tipping out into the six path in upper stretch. MISS SAVVY was quick to open a clear
lead, engaged quickly by three rivals to her outside, stayed on game until the stretch when tiring and retreating. WEST PAW was four wide pressing and
stalking the front runners, began to lose ground midway on the turn and did not recover. SAMURAI QUEEN was three wide between rivals in the early mix
for the front, began to drift out when tiring on the turn and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
LOADED SNIPER had speed, was passed by duelers and forced that pace, closed swiftly into the turn and drew clear, set the pace then held sway under a
brisk hand ride. FIFTY THREE hopped out of the gate and lost his path, settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn then chased gamely
through the stretch. BELENTIME, in range, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished gamely along the fence. SUN FORESTER, in
touch between foes, chased two and three-wide on the turn then evened out in deep stretch. IN ALL ALONE moved up quickly to duel for the lead, was
headed at the turn, chased determinedly to the stretch but leveled out in the final 16th. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE), in range, was hustled three-wide on the turn,
dropped back at the top of the stretch and evened out. RED MAVRIK dueled, chased two-wide on the turn, gave way at the top of the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TAQUANYAH bumped with IMAGINARY SKY at the break, showed brief speed, moved to the rail with a smooth move at the turn, stalked the pace, rallied
in the stretch and was up just in time. LIVIN ON LUV broke outward, closed on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, gained the lead but was lugging in and
was collared on the wire. VEERY, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn then closed gamely in the late stages.
CEDAR VALLEY was bumped leaving the gate, showed speed but soon dropped back, closed three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished
gamely. RECIPROCAL was rated off the pace, closed five then four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. RAVEN ECHO broke
outward and bumped CEDAR VALLEY, settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn and made a steady gain through the stretch. GREEN
GABLES gained a short early lead, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. IMAGINARY SKY, bumped at the start,
settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn and closed through the stretch. I'M EXCEPTIONAL bumped VEERY at the outset, settled off the pace,
closed two to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. BLAZING SKY settled in mid pack, was squeezed back along the rail at the turn, was
steadied several more times before reaching the stretch and finished evenly. ALLURING MEG hopped at the start, was hustled to gain a stalking position
and accomplished that by the turn, but dropped back, was roused but showed no response. ASHBURY bobbled leaving the gate, forced the pace, dropped
back on the turn and lacked a rally.
