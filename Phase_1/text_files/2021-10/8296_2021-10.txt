BOSSY CAT vied for the early lead on the inside, made a bid and drew off on the turn, then was kept to right handed crop urging to prove much the best.
MARC WELLS chased the pace on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive but could not gain on the winner while clearly second best. HOLD THE
IRISH chased the pace four wide, came six wide into the drive and faded, bested rest. BAMA DRIFTER was not a factor. MISTER ARANGUIZ vied for the
lead three wide and stopped.
