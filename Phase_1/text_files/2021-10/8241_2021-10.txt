Footnotes
ISHIHARA rated just off the pace toward the inside on the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage
two deep on the far turn, was carried out into the stretch but dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and dueled clear later yards. WESTBURY
ESTATES rounded the opening turn about the four path then took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear at the three eighths, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn but lost ground into the lane, gave up the lead past the sixteenth pole and relented later yards. REATA'S CASTLE
settled close off the rail early on, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three and four paths of the far turn then flattened the final furlong.
LET'S GET PHYSICAL rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
remained in the four path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. BRIGHT DAWN saved early ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn off the rail and finished evenly to pass rivals. IN THE GOSPEL took a quick early lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, was caught toward
the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the three eighths and faded at the rail on the far turn. HENRY
STANDINGBEAR was not a factor. OMEGA GOLD stalked the early pace in the three path then faded past the three eighths pole.

WEAVER chased toward the inside and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dueled to the lead leaving the eighth pole but was caught
mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased through the backstretch, was blocked midway on the turn, recovered stride
inside the eighth pole and finished well to take third later yards. BAYOU BOUGIE came away awkwardly then surged clear to set a pressured pace,
contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, gave up the lead past the eighth pole then weakened the final sixteenth. QUITE SUGGESTIVE chased
toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CHINA CAT settled back inside the first turn, started a bid into the backstretch and steadily gained to take the lead at the rail nearing the eighth pole, dug in
under steady encouragement from the top of the lane and just lasted. JUST A BIT SASSY came away a step slow and dropped well off the pace while
saving ground, eased out into the backstretch and started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, angled to
the five path leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final yards while gaining on the waning winner. JESSICA rounded the opening turn in the four
path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, drew close three wide nearing the top of the stretch
and appeared a solid factor to late stretch before flattening stride. WARFRONT PEACE RVF stalked the pace from the three path the first turn then took the
lead into the backstretch, came under pressure into the far turn and raced off the rail on the turn, was caught approaching the top of the stretch then
weakened inside the eighth pole. GLORIOUS MYSTERY stalked the pace off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded
into the far turn. VINTAGE GIN rated a short lead inside, was caught leaving the first turn and gave chase from that point, but gave way nearing the five
sixteenths. ZIG was through after a half mile.
