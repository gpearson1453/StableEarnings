and overtaken in deep stretch. EVE'S CITY got round, never a threat. PEAT MOSS (IRE) was outrun in late stage of the race. EMBRACE THE GRIND
traveled mid pack, tired two hurdles out and was pulled up. WIGHTMAN (IRE) showed no speed, showed little and pulled up. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY had
the lead when impeded early in the race, unseating the rider. SORAMOND (GER) drifted severely across course in front of the field, caused
ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY to check and lose rider, duck out and hit the wing unseating the rider.
