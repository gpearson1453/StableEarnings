DISCOVER A WISH was off a step slow then reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage COASTAL SWEETIE with a furlong to run,
vied with that rival and drew clear through the final yards. MO SUGAFOOT raced four-wide through both turns, was unhurried early, could reach the winner
in the drive but finished well to gain the place. COASTAL SWEETIE was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, dropped back from
WHYNOTGEORGIA after the opening quarter, re-bid with a furlong to run and gave way through the final sixteenth. BABY CHOCOLATE drifted out through
the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly late. BEAZEE BOLT lacked early foot, saved ground
through the second turn and failed to rally. WHYNOTGEORGIA broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin before reaching
the three-eighths marker, bolted nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PREMIER LEAGUE was away in good order to stalk the pace of MISTER G. Q. while racing three-wide, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached
that rival with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. MISTER G. Q. broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter
and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. PAPA'S HONEY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished
with a steady bid. GOLDEN FLAME was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. LONO lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. NORTH OF THORP was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and
gave way. NACHO VICTORY lagged throughout.

THOUGHTS OF GOLD was bumped at the break, opened a clear lead soon after, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the
back-stretch and drew off through the lane with complete authority. EQUIVOCATOR lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled
out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished well to gain the place. GABBY TOM chased the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the
drive. DUTCH COLONEL was bumped at the start, chased the leaders from the inside and gave way in the drive. BLUE SUNSET raced four-wide through
both turns, settled off the leaders throughout and lacked the needed rally. LONGFORD lagged throughout.

the final furlong. PIN UP LADY was carried out through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished
willlingly. SHEZ A GRINDER raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the lane and did not threaten. MY LITE

Footnotes
PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the third turn and was up in the closing yards. LUCK IS MY NAME stalked the
leaders while racing three-wide, drifted out through the third turn and finished with a steady bid. A GEM IS A GEM was fractious at the gate then was away
alertly to press the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, led and gave way late. ROWDY RETURNS set a pressured
pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the half mile marker and gave way in the drive. COLAVITO broke sharply then dropped back,
raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. KEEN JAMES was four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, saved ground through
the third turn and did not menace.
