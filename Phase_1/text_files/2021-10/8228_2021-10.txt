deep stretch and was up late for a narrow victory. KINSALER vied two wide early, took over to set the pace, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely
in the two path in the stretch run, dueled to the wire and just missed. PASS THE SALSA stalked outside a rival, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied
outside and dug in to earn the show spot. IAN DUNROSS trailed the field, saved ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive and was
outkicked. PRIVATE CODE stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the far turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive.

stretch, drifted out causing crowding past the furlong marker, then dug in gamely in deep stretch to hold on. KITTEN STREET vied inside for the early lead,
then stalked the pace, rallied outside entering the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and battled on to the wire. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) raced off the
pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied between rivals, lacked room in tight quarters and was forced to check past
the furlong marker, then angled in and rallied inside. MY POINT EXACTLY vied two wide for the early lead, then stalked the pace, chased on the far turn
and had no rally. DRILLOMATIC stalked two wide early on, then raced three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and had no rally. BEACH TRAFFIC
trailed the field and did not factor. NEXT COWBOY UP raced two wide off the pace, then between rivals and failed to threaten. After a Stewards' Inquiry,
along with rider objections by the second and third place finishers against the winner, PROJECTED (GB) was disqualified and placed third for interference in
