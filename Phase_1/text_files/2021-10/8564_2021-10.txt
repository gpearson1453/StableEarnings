Footnotes
PERCHER was shuffled back at the break, settled off the early going, moved up around the far turn, raced six deep near the quarter pole and finished well
late to just get up under strong encouragement. BLUE SKY PAINTER stalked the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch
run, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. MY SACRED PLACE showed good early speed to set the early pace, drifted through the stretch to
race well off the inside and weakened late. RUM BOBBY was forwardly placed to lay up close early, came out near the eighth pole forcing rival to take up. A
stewards and jockey objection was filed by Bobby Two Times and stewards disqualified Rum Bobby and placed fifth for interference in the stretch run. An
additional claim of foul from Rum Bobby from trainer and jockey for interference in the stretch run Against My Sacred Place and stewards ruled no change.
BOBBY TWO TIMES stalked the early pace, was forced to take up sharply near the eighth pole and had not enough late. CLEVER AND GREAT tracked the
early leader from the inside and faded. TALE OF DIXIE dropped back early, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response.
KEEPYOURGUARDUP was slow early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
NICOLAR was unhurried early on, made a steady advance towards the far turn, circled the filed while racing six wide into the upper lane and finished well to
get up under strong handling. GETTING LUCKY settled off the early going, moved up six wide near the quarter pole and closed in well late. TREASURE
TAILS dropped back early, moved up five to six wide through the lane and gained ground willingly late. PERFUME RIVER settled to the middle of the pack
early on, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest. DOWNTOWN KATIE settled off the early pace, raced four to
three wide in the lane and had not enough in the drive. A RING THING made a quick move to take command into the far turn, led inside the eighth pole and
faltered in the latter stages. ENGLISH CHARMER dropped back early, lacked racing room near the three eighths pole, raced in the two path through the
lane and had no late rally. CLOSERTOTHEHEART was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced in tight quarters near the eighth marker, raced in the
three path and weakened a bit late. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) stalked the early pace, raced four deep near the quarter pole and had no response. GLOSSAMER
raced up close early on and faded along the inside. BONUS BABY failed to sustain a bid. EMPTY NET showed early foot from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
TROUBLE COFFEE settled to the middle of the pack, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to prove best under strong
pressure. CURLEE FOX stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole, led deep stretch but couldn't hold off the winner to finish second best.
STRAIGHT UP GUY was unhurried early on, moved up five wide in the stretch run and showed good late interest. BE YOURSELF was unhurried early on,
angled six to seven wide through the lane and made a good late bid. MAKE A STAND showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME stalked the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, waited nearing the three
sixteenths pole, raced to two to three wide in the stretch run and had not enough. RISING PERRY raced up close early on, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and weakened. CORAL LEGACY stalked the early going while racing four wide down the backstretch, raced in the two path through the lane
and weakened. GHOST STALKER settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. FRANKEE MERCH failed to
sustain a bid.

Footnotes
LOVE MY CAT settled off the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch run, surged late and just got up under all out pressure. WILDCAT stalked
the early pace from the outside, raced in the three path through the drive, led near the wire and just missed in a game effort. CHELICHNA was slow early,
raced in traffic near the three sixteenths pole, angled four wide and finished gamely to the wire. POST BOX settled off the early pace, waited for racing room
near the quarter pole, made a good rail bid late to finish willingly to the wire. WRONGFULLY ACCUSED stalked the early pace from the inside, raced three
to two wide in the drive and weakened a bit in the final stages. MY GIRL BLUE was unhurried in the early stages, moved up six deep into the upper stretch
and had not enough late. BAY B settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late
rally. LAUGH IT OFF stalked the pace from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LIKE N' EAGLE pressed the leader from the inside and
weakened in the drive. SURELY TRUE was fanned seven wide into the upper lane and had no late rally. AUNT MARY showed good early speed from the
outside and tired readily. SILVER AND BLUES was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and tired readily.
