Footnotes
JONO showed the best speed along the inside and held the rail throughout edged clear on the turn and drew away in the lane under mild urging to win
handily. HANDY BOY was away very slow spotting the field four lengths gathered quickly and had the perfect rail trip while gaining late in a good debut.
LANKY LOU chased the pace in the two path but could not go with the top two through the lane and had to settle for third. STRONG STORM raced four
wide on the turn and could not make up ground through the stretch. ALL RISE UP was away slowly and towards the back of the pack throughout and never
mounted a rally. FROG WALKER was up close in the three path but gave way entering the stretch. COURIR SI VITE was away slow and was quickly in the
back and never a factor.

FLOWER BEACH broke a step slow but was hustled to the lead and saved the rail was challenged on the turn but drew clear handily in deep stretch and
was geared down at the wire. YODELERS WAY raced three wide throughout and was up for second in the final yards while never a serious threat to the
winner. JACK WITH SEVEN was up close in the two path but a head in front on the turn and for much of the stretch run but shortened stride inside the
sixteenth pole and could not hold second. GAME DAY DECISION was four wide throughout and could not make up any ground. I'M LUCKY raced along the
inside the entire race and was never a serious factor.
