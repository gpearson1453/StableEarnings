Footnotes
STATE OF AFFAIR took command from the beginning and controled the race on the front end, started to widen his margin on the home turn and further
widened his lead after the last jump. ACE VENTURA (GB) settled towards the back, started picking up rivals heading towards the second last, came with a
rush after the last fence to just get up to capture the second spot. TWENTY YEARS ON (GB) was in no hurry for the first mile, then got in contention
heading down the backside for the final time, gained ground on the home turn and dueled with ACE VENTURA (GB) to wire after the last but just missed the
second spot. GEARHEAD was close up for the first mile and a half then started losing ground in the middle of the last turn but held on for fourth. GOING
COUNTRY (IRE) was in no hurry for the first mile, had a mild rally going down the backside for the final time then flattened out. HONOR UP stalked the
pace for most of the race then weakened after the last jump. MEKONG was through after a mile and pulled up before the last jump and walked off.
QUALITY CHOICE was never in contention and pulled up before the last jump and walked off. ELUSIVE SOUL was in contention for the first mile then
started falling back and was pulled up before the last fence and walked off. HAIL MICHIGAN was in contention when he fell at the second last and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
MERRY MAKER (IRE) was either on the lead or close to it, he gained command heading into the final bend, had a clear advantage jumping the last and
cruised home from there. FRONTLINE CITIZEN (IRE) settled towards the back for the first mile and a half, rallied down the backside for the final time to
track the leader on the last turn but could not gain further ground. LAP OF THE GODS settled mid pack, got into the mix on the home turn rallied after the
last and got up for the third spot. MASTER PLAN was close to striking distance thru out but lacked late kick. DUCKETT'S GROVE ran evenly through out.
PROFITEER was no threat. SURVEY (IRE) was through early. O DIONYSUS was in contention and stopped after a mile and a half. UNDERCOVER
ROWDY (IRE) fell at the fifth jump and walked off.

the 16th jump when he out jumped his only rival at that fence and widened his margin from there. STAND DOWN (IRE) went up sides with the winner until
the 16th when he was out jumped, knowing he had no chance at the head of the stretch he just cantored to the wire for the second spot. STORM TEAM was
confused to which way to go after the fifth and wound up off course and walked off. RENEGADE RIVER also confused on which way to go wound up off

Footnotes
SENOR SEVILLE was in no hurry until the final bend, started picking up ground heading into the straight, came with a rush over the last two hurdles to just
prevail at the wire. HERO'S RETURN set the pace for the first mile, got shuffled on the backside, came again on the final bend to have a slight advantage at
the last, but could not hold off the hard charging winner. REAL GOOD MAN (IRE) was chasing the pace, grabbed the lead heading into the final turn, then
failed to pursevere through the stretch. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER drafted the leader for the first mile, then flattened out from there. THE KID ROCKS rallied on
the club house turn to grab the lead heading to the backside then gave way. TABLE MAX contended, tired. UBUNTU trailed, pulled up before last jump,
walked off. WHERE'S OLIVER was never a threat and pulled up before the last fence and walked off. ONAROCK raced mid pack, tired on turn and pulled
up before last fence.
