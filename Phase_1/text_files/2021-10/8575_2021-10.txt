Footnotes
MATT'S HONEY had good position on the inside down the backside, angled out three wide in the stretch, closed determinedly and drew clear late under
strong handling. MOBIL LADY set the early pace, chased the speed down the backside, came again in the stretch on the inside and was second best.
LIBERTY BELLE pressed early three wide, rallied down the backside and gain the lead, faltered slightly late. JOPLIN never far back, lacked a late bid and
went evenly. FASHION FRAME broke slowly, rushed up four wide in the first turn remained in contention until the top of the stretch, then came up empty.
MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE was no factor. SCATNAP contended early on the inside and was through after a half.
