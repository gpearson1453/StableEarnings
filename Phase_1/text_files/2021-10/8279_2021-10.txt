Footnotes
DIRTY JUSTICE tracked from midpack in the two path, swung five wide turning for home, produced a good kick outside of foes in the final furlong, and got
up at the wire. COMPASS POINT stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, grinded away on her
left lead through upper stretch, but changed leads at the furlong grounds, surged in the closing stages to bid as an outer foe did the same, but missed.
SUCCESSFULLY DONE dueled for the lead inside of FERDAN, pressed that foe around the turn before regaining an advantage in upper stretch, inched
clear a sixteenth from home, but was nailed on the wire by a pair of outer foes. FERDAN dueled for the lead two wide, led around the turn, but was headed
by his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then yielded in the final sixteenth. GUARD DUTY chased three wide, but faded on his left lead after being four wide
entering the lane. SILENT SONATA was off slowly, took the turn in the three path while hustled along off of the pace, and failed to factor. ALTERNATE
NIGHTS was off slowly and got outrun.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY broke slowly, tracked from inside of a foe while in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, rallied to split
the leading pair at the sixteenth pole, and forged ahead to the wire. TEQUILAS RANGER chased from midpack in the three path around the turn, shifted five
wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to reach place. A FEW TOO MANY prompted the pace three wide and between horses,
chased an inner foe as that foe shook clear entering the lane, rebid passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole,
then got outfinished by an outer rival for place. MATERS N TATERS set the pace inside of a trio of vying rivals into the turn, shook clear passing the quarter
pole, but was headed a sixteenth from home, and weakened. CAJUN MOON broke a step slowly, got sent to vie two wide and between horses, but backed
out to chase into the turn, then tired through the final furlong without rebidding. FALLEN EMPIRE trailed, came into the lane six wide, and failed to factor.
FIRST DEPUTY broke slowly, tucked into the turn, saved ground around the bend, then failed to menace along the rail through the lane. STURGILL
pressed four wide, but faded at the quarter pole.

HENRYS GIRL stalked three wide, bid into the far turn, led passing the three furlong pole, cleared off in upper stretch, but hung on her left lead through the
lane, and lasted from an outer foe in the late stages. TIMELESS GLORY tracked two wide, chased in range of the leader in the four path around the far turn,
got outpaced by that foe in upper stretch, but stayed on as that clear rival tired, bid a sixteenth from home, but hung and was denied. TIZ ABBY settled at
the rear along the inside, gained steadily outside of foes while shifting from the three to the five path around the far turn, but leveled off through midstretch.
REVS RUN stalked two wide, pressed down the backstretch before bidding with HENRY'S GIRL into the far turn, but was outkicked by that foe passing the
three furlong pole, chased turning for home, but tired in upper stretch. JUST HUMMING tracked from midpack along the inside, took the far turn two wide,
chased through upper stretch, but failed to menace. SWIFT TEMPLE settled at the rear of the field two wide, and failed to factor. MAMBACITA lunged
outwards at the start, lied off of the pace two to three wide, and faded. SAVEDBESTFORLAST lied off of the pace three wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SUNDAY GRACE pressed the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway. OPTIONALITY stalked
along the inside, then chased the leader along the rail, and proved 2nd best. SASSY SAGEY broke a step slowly, tracked from the two path around the turn,
then moved up in the final furlog. CATBRIER set the pace, battled inside of the eventual winner around the turn, then gave way to that foe in upper stretch.
AVENDORE was reluctant to load, then broke outwards from an inner foe at the start, was slow to pick up stride afterwards, and never got involved.
ANOTHER FLAT DRUNK saved ground off of the pace, but failed to factor.

CONTACT TRACING stalked the dueling leaders from the three path, gained on J. E. HANDMEDOWN's advantage into the far turn, took over entering the
lane, and was driven home to seal the deal. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN dueled for the lead two wide, drew clear passing the half mile pole, but felt pressure
from a menacing CONTACT TRACING around the far turn, proved no match for that foe entering the lane, then kept on to prove second best. LEMON KICK
dueled for the lead along the inside, but gave way passing the half mile pole, and was best of the rest. TRUMPS REVENGE tracked along the inside and
never got involved. HAY DAKOTA checked between horses into the first turn to trail the field, and was outrun thereafter.

PRIVATE ROAD stalked two wide, bid in upper stretch, took over at the furlong grounds, drew off, and held sway. ERASE broke a step slowly, tugged in the
two path to a tracking position, awaited racing room entering the lane, tipped three wide and inside of BENNY"S FIDDLE at the furlong pole, but only
managed to prevail over that foe for place while chasing the leader home. BENNY'S FIDDLE stalked three wide, grinded away in upper stretch in an attempt
to bid, but was outkicked for place at the sixteenth pole. SUCCEED lied far off of the pace, swung five wide entering the lane, and passed tired foes.
ENFORCER tracked three to four wide, but faded on her left lead in upper stretch. RONNIE'S VICE tracked from midpack two wide and between horses,
but faded turning for home. PRIVATE CONNIE chased briefly, but was done early. CAIRO CALLING quickly cleared, maintained a clear advantage in hand
entering the lane, but was overhauled by outer foes at the furlong pole, and stopped. FIRST COUNT bobbled at the start, lagged behind early on and was
outrun.

GRAND DESIGN cleared off and crossed over to the rail into the first turn, managed an uncontested lead down the backstretch, showed the way from
BRIDGEKEEPER while well in hand around the far turn, repelled that foe's bid when set down entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure.
RONITHELIMODRIVER trailed in the four to three path around the first turn, advanced to chase the leaders from the two to three path around the far turn,
sustained a mild charge to bid for place outside of a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed. IMTHEPRINCE settled off of the pace in the three to
two path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, sustained rail grind to bid for place inside of a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole, but was
outfinished for that position. BRIDGEKEEPER stalked along the inside around the first bend, took aim on the clear leader from the outside into the far turn,
ranged up turning for home, but was repelled entering the lane, then faltered between horses at the sixteenth pole. MR. BIFFLE stalked two wide early on,
came under a drive three wide into the far turn, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
TAKNTOTHECLEANERS managed a loose lead in the two path with her ears pricked down the backstretch, then asserted her dominance over her pair of
rivals by powering away in upper stretch, and was kept to task under a busy ride to the wire. DOUBLE DAWN tracked two wide, chased the clear leader
while claiming place around the far turn, then weakened through the late stages, but saved place. THE BEAUTY'S TALE stalked along the inside, but faded
around the far turn.

Footnotes
MR CHAOS rushed to set the pace along the inside, drew clear into the turn under her own power, drew off entering the lane before being set down
approaching the furlong grounds, and continued to widen through the late stages. SHINEONBRAD broke a bit outwardly, saved ground in midpack around
the turn, then gained place in upper stretch while no match for the leader. NO PROOF prompted the pace two wide, stalked around the turn, but lost place in
upper stretch, and was best of the rest. MONEY MAN BRYLAN tracked the pace from the four, ranged up to bid for place turning for home, but flattened out
in upper stretch. GRAND IN BAY shied in at the start, lied at the rear of the field two to three wide around the turn, swung five entering the lane, and failed to
factor. MYDADSBETRTHANYURS hopped at the start and was crowded between horses soon after, lied far off of the pace wide, and made little impact.
EXPRESS MAIL hopped before shying into an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace in the five to three path around the turn, and failed to threaten. WILD
MAN CADEM lied far off of the pace along the inside, steadied behind a tiring foe passing the five sixteenths pole, then failed to menace. PURSUANT
stalked two wide, but faded turning for home while drifting four wide. COPPER HARBOR chased along the inside and faded around the turn. TASER was
bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, but was done early.
