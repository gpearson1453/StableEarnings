Footnotes
HUNGRY HENRY chased the two rival duel into the turn, continued in the three path while moving closer to the top ones, bid three wide in late turn, came
out of the turn with the lead then extended the margin while in the four path through the final eighth. COME ALONE chased the pace from the three path
through the turn, entered the lane from the four path then followed the winner home and was clear for the place spot. CHISMOSO was in a bit tight early,
raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up for the minor share while not a threat to the top two. MR.
HALFTIME saved ground through the turn and was never a threat. INGERSOLL moved up along the inside down the backstretch to vie for the top spot, put
in tight and pin-balled with another entering the far turn, continued to challenge for the lead into the lane then was empty. EMPEROROFTHEDARK was
clear early while in the two path, joined by another before the half-mile pole, was bumped by that one entering the turn then faded entering the lane. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF FINISH ORDER.

Footnotes
DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS vied for the lead along the along the inside through mid-turn, was passed by the runner-up straightening into the lane, looked to
be a place finisher with an eighth to go then steadily came again under intermittent left-handed urging and got up by an inch. SOL DEL SUR settled off the
early pace while along the inside, moved up through the turn while along the inside, angled three wide in late turn, gained the lead into the lane, was clear
with an eighth to go then could not last. OLYMPIC ROMP was in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the four path and was gaining late.
MAKE NOISE tracked the dueling leaders while along the inside into the far turn, continued near the rail through the turn and into the lane then lacked the
needed response. UNBRIDLED BEAST raced near the rail into the far turn, came off the rail and into the three path through the turn, entered the lane from
the five path and moved up while not a threat. SLICK SILVER prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, began losing contact after mid-turn then faded
after entering the lane. HIGHER AUTHORITY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and was done after mid-turn.

Footnotes
CHANDANA set the pace while under pressure into the turn, shook clear after mid-turn while near the inside, continued to widen into the lane then was kept
to the task while extending the lead to the end. MISS DEPUTY STAR chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four
path, moved up to be nearest the winner with an eighth to go, could not make headway into the deficit and settled for second best. BRIBE pressed the
winner two wide into the turn, chased that one into the lane while in the two or three path and kept on to save the show spot. D D SEVEN THIRTY was
never a threat while racing near the rail into the lane. NIGHTTIME JUSTICE was never a factor while racing near the rail into the lane. INCREDIBLE
JUSTICE was well back throughout while along the inside. MISS SUGARBAKER raced the three path through the turn and showed little interest.

CAUSE TO CRUISE stalked the pacesetter from the two path into the turn, was asked for more after mid-turn, gained a clear lead before the quarter pole,
came into the lane from the three path and widened while being kept to the task. JUG ROCK tracked the pace along the inside, moved off the rail in late turn
to pass a tiring rival, got closest to the winner in the lane then kept on well to save the place spot while not a threat to the top one. CACHIRULO was in the
two or three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and was all out to gain the show spot. BETTER TONE raced in
the three path through the turns, was asked for more approaching the five-sixteenths pole, was closest to the winner into the lane then weakened in the final
eighth and lost the show spot. MR KEEN was never a factor while saving ground. ROYAL OUTLAW set the pace while near the rail into the far turn then
was suddenly done approaching the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BLOODY MARY MORNIN settled off the pace while in the three path, moved to reel in the leader after entering the far turn, quickly passed that one and
cleared, widened into the lane then was kept to the task until late. SUNNY ONE was unhurried while in the two path through the far turn, continued into the
lane while never far off the rail then was all out to gain the place spot. LEA RO was near the rail through the turns when unhurried, bid into the lane from the
three path and just missed the place spot while not a threat to the winner. STYLISH KITTEN was void of speed while racing off the inside into the far turn,
came into the lane from the seven path and moved up while not a threat. OUR CLOSURE was in the two path through the turns and never was a factor.
LADY LEAH hustled out to move to the rail and gain a clear lead, continued clear into the far turn, was no match for the winner in late turn and was empty
the final eighth. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE was never a factor while in the three or four path through the turns. MAUK'S TUFF chased the pace from the two
path into the backstretch then steadily faded. ROMANTIC ATTACK was along the inside into the backstretch when not far back then steadily faded.
