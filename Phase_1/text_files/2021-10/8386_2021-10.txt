advanced from the inside through the lane to be clearly second best while not a threat to the top one. SHOFAR saved ground through the turn and into the
lane, moved up and was clear for the place spot. MY GIRL LEXI raced in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five
path and never was a threat. BAYTOWN BEAR dueled with the winner through late turn while in the three path, chased that one into the lane then faded.

TRADE SECRET set the pace while clear through the turn and in the two path, was roused entering the lane and quickly drew off while being ridden out to
inside the sixteenth pole and subsequently geared down. HILLSTONE MARTINI chased the winner from the three path through the turn, was asked for
more near the five-sixteenths pole, came into the lane from the five path, was no match for the winner but kept on to be second best. MY ANGELICA raced
in the two path through the turn when not far back, asked for more into the lane and moved up while not a threat. OFF RAMP tracked the pace while near
the rail into the lane then weakened in the drive. BOURBON BUNS was in the three path through the turn and lacked a response.

HUNGARIAN PRINCESS pressed the pace two wide into the turn, settled off to stalk the leader into the lane then drove past when asked and widened to
the wire. EVER WONDER was off with a slight hop inward and brushing of inside rival, hustled up to gain a short lead before the first call, cleared in late turn
then was no match for the winner through the lane but kept on to preserve the place spot. NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS raced in the two path through the turn
when not far back, came into the lane from the three path and passed one to gain the show spot. SERENA BECK gained the lead early and cleared before
the first call, was joined by two others after a quarter, continued to chase those two into mid-turn then faded along the rail. VERRY AMELIA was squeezed
between rivals at the start, moved up to contend in late turn, swung into the lane from the five path with aim on the top two then was empty late.

Footnotes
COUNTRY TIME tracked the pace from along the inside through the turns when never far back, came off the inside into the lane, passed the previous
pacesetter near the three-sixteenths pole then took aim on the new leader, caught that one just inside the eighth pole and quickly drew away. GRACEFUL
CHOICE stalked the pacesetter from the two path into the far turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then was no match for the
winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. KANGAROO TALK saved ground through the turns and into the lane, shifted from the rail to the four
path inside the eighth pole and moved up for the minor share. INCESSANT saved ground throughout, had aim on the top ones after entering the lane but
lacked a response. FIRST KITTEN set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way. CATCH MY KITTY raced in the two to the four path through
the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up while not a threat. PERSEVERING was never a factor while in the two to the three path
through the turns. REMEMBRANCE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn then was empty. CANDY CALL was in the two path through the
turns while in the back and was empty turning into the lane. MY TOMMY LEE raced in the two path through the turns, dropped back and was eased to wire
and walked off. ANGELS OVER ME raced far back throughout.

Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG stalked in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled briefly in the stretch, then drew off and held sway under steady urging.
WEIGHTLESSNESS stalked the pace inside, angled five wide late on the turn, then rallied belatedly. KALISPELL vied early inside, then gave way.
NOTHINS FREE led inside before giving way. ABBY'S DESTINY raced in the three path, then had a mild late bid six wide. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD pressed
pace in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. G CITY WARRIOR pressed the pace in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. LA COYOTA raced
evenly in the four path. DON'T HOLD QUEENS saved ground to no avail.
