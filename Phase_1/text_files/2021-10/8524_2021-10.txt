Footnotes
CUY tracked the top trio through early stages then crept closer three wide late on the turn, given cue two wide at the head of the lane, swept by
ALLEGEDLY PERFECT near mid-stretch and finished going away. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT cleared and crossed over soon after the start, held firm along
the inside around the turn, saved ground into the lane, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. FIG JELLY raced in a
forward position along the inside in the opening quarter, saved ground into the lane and churned on for a share. SURPRISE FACTOR raced off the early
pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GRACEFUL KITTEN raced in the back, went three wide into the lane and failed to move on.
NITRO TIME raced in contention two wide through early stages then came up empty leaving the turn.

ADVENTURE SEEKER bumped with rival at the start then got in tight and steadied in early stages, got shuffled back and moved closer to the inside, went
two wide out of the turn, shifted back to the inside at the head of the lane, inched way up closer along the rail and drew clear in the final sixteenth.
FEDERAL EXCHANGE raced two wide between foes around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid in the final furlong
and got a nose up for place. GILLIGAN held a slim lead and set a pressured pace, vied inside of ORIENTAL PARK around the turn, led the way a furlong
out then failed to hold off the winner in deep stretch. ORIENTAL PARK vied outside of FEDERAL EXCHANGE around the turn, could not move on for the
lead in the upper stretch and gave way. VENEZUELA FIRST was not far back while positioned four deep with three furlongs left to run, went four to five
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HAPPY BACK bumped with the winner at the start, was not far back three wide into the turn then failed to keep
pace past the five sixteenths pole.

into UBIQUITOUS near the three-sixteenths, gained the advantage coming to the eighth pole and finished going away. TUWAIM vied inside of BEN
COPENHAGEN for the early lead, cut the corner and battled on in the upper stretch, got overhauled by the winner near the furlong marker but stayed on
gamely to take place. BEN COPENHAGEN vied outside of TUWAIM in the early going, battled back into the upper stretch, could not move on with the
eventual winner but stayed on with response and cleared the rest. UBIQUITOUS angled off the inside and raced in range through early stages, edged up
into close contention mid-way around the turn four then five wide, got bumped and gave way turning for home, and was vanned off after the finish. CATCH
ON EMOTIONAL was away in good order from the outside, moved up to race in aim at the five sixteenths pole then got bumped by the winner leaving the
turn and faded. REDJACK raced in the back then moved into the stretch run along the outside and neve threatened. LORD BERRIER failed to move into

around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, had more left in reserve, responded under pressure and finished clear. FIGHTING FORCE was allowed
to settle through early stages while never far from the front end, edged up closer four then three wide around the far turn, stayed in pursuit two wide through
the lane and secured place. LIGHT FURY stalked the pace sitting outside a rival through the backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the final turn,
raced near the inside through the lane and churned on for a share. TROPHY CHASER tracked the pace on the inside through the backstretch, failed to
move on under pressure around the far turn then gave way. FLY THE W raced two wide between rivals just off the second flight, stayed in range around the
far turn then faded turning for home. FREEDOM MATTERS tracked the pace through the backstretch, prompted three then two wide around the turn and
came up empty turning for home. INDY LYON was not far back on the inside through the backstretch then retreated entering the final turn.

lead with SEQUIN LADY at the top of the lane, battled on into the final furlong then failed to be a match in late stages. SHEZA SPITFIRE ducked in at the

a share. LANIAKEA STORM hustled up on the outside around the turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. POIEMA vied in opening
stages then led the way, held a slim lead over pursuers around the turn then got collared by the outside duo at the head of the lane and gave way. BABY
LUCK chased between foes in range around the turn then went two wide into the lane and flattened out. MOUNTAIN BELLATRIX raced off the pace, saved
ground around the turn then angled out three to four wide and lacked a needed rally. KNIGHT SLEEPER got pinched back at the start, raced outside off the
early pace then came five to six wide into the lane and failed to move on. FLOR DE PLATA chased the top pair along the inside then weakened nearing the

Footnotes
HELPING LISA D was allowed to settle through early stages then edged up closer leaving the backstretch, sat patiently for an opening midway through the
turn then given cue leaving the quarter pole, slipped through the inside of STARSHIP NALA and took command turning for home, quickly widened to a clear
advantage and finished going away. THISSMYTIME tracked the pace along the outside through early stages, moved up two wide to race in aim for the lead
at the quarter pole, was no match when the winner took over turning for home but sustained a steady bid through the lane and finished second best.
STARSHIP NALA settled in the opening quarter then ranged up closer late on the backstretch, launched a rail bid to take over the lead at the three-eighths
pole, came out a path and held a slight edge late on the turn then got collared when the winner slipped through the inside turning for home. TONALIST'S
SHAPE raced off the early pace then moved up closer entering the turn, came under a ride four wide approaching the quarter pole, raced in contention then
failed to sustain bid into the lane. CRUMB BUN tracked the quick top pair through the backstretch then weakened between rivals around the turn. SIMPLIFY
(ARG) dueled outside of COOKIE DOUGH through the backstretch then came up tired mid-way around the turn. COOKIE DOUGH got caught up in a quick
pace duel through the backstretch, stopped on the turn and jogged in.
