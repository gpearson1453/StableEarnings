Footnotes
ROCK STAR PARKING brushed at the start, raced in contention into the turn while in the two path, continued close up through the turn, tipped into the three
path when letting out a notch, quickly gained the lead once straightened then was ridden out while extending the margin to the end. DANCE ON OVER was
unhurried early while in the two path through the turn, asked for more entering the lane, was in the four path with an eighth to go and moved up for the place
spot while not a threat to the top one. GUEST IN MY HEART stalked the pace from the three path through the late turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, gained
a short and short lived lead entering the lane then yielded while staying on to preserve the show spot. WILD TAPIT was in the three path through the turn,
raced in the five path through the lane and never was a serious threat. NINJA KITTEN stepped out at the start and brushed the winner, hustled to the lead,
raced clear into the turn, came under pressure after mid-turn then gave way. SUGAR AND SASS tracked the pace from the inside through mid-turn then
faded.

Footnotes
OCELIA chased the pace from the four path into the turn, continued well off the inside into late turn, bid from the five path into the lane, gained the lead
when straightening, looked to be a clear winner outside the eighth pole then kept on well to hold the runner-up safe. FEARLESS ANNA set a rated pace
through the turn under dawdling fractions, lost the lead into the lane then kept on gamely to be inching closer to the wire. MISS INHOFE pressed the slow
pace through the turn while in the two path, lost positions into the lane then kept on through the final sixteenth to be inching up along the inside. C J'S
EMPIRE raced in the three path through the far turn when never far back then lacked a closing kick. IRENE was slow early and spotted the field some five
lengths, raced in the back into the far turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked a response.

Footnotes
TEN AT TWELVE vied for the lead from the two path into the turn, continued with a short lead entering the lane, dueled with the runner-up through the final
eighth while drifting to the rail and prevailed. MISS DIAL chased the pace from the four path through the turn, bid into the lane, hooked the leader outside
the eighth pole, dueled with that one through the final eighth and was denied while clearly second best. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX raced into the turn from
the four path, was asked for more after mid-turn, continued well off the inside into the lane and was clear for the minor share. CARDIGAN was near the rail
through the turn, had clear running into the lane then lacked a closing response. MAPLELINE was steadied from between rivals entering the turn, continued
in the four path through the turn and never was a threat. BLESSING THE FLAG hopped at the start, trailed into the lane, raced in the eight path and never
was in it. STORMIN HOT was along the inside throughout and never factored. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN pressed the winner two wide into the turn, began
losing ground approaching the lane and was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
GARMENTO tracked the pace while along the inside through the far turn, was boxed into the lane, tipped into the three path then reeled in the leader at the
wire after a lengthy drive. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) chased the pace from the three path through late turn, bid into the lane, moved clear once straightened
then was all out to the wire late and was caught while well clear of others. ACTUATOR was in the three path through the turns, came into the lane from the
five path, angled in after straightened then continued with good energy to be gaining to the end. MORE THAN WORK raced in the two or three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the five path, had aim on the top ones then could not gain while finishing best of the rest. HORSE DADDY saved ground
through the turns, angled into the six path for the drive and moved up while not a threat. CARNIVORE pressed the pace three wide through the far turn then
weakened turning into the lane. SIEGE OF BOSTON was in the four or five path into the land when under a drive then tired. SARGEANT BARGER pressed
the pace two wide into the turn, led, then faded through the lane. DAHTESTES HERO raced in the three or four path through the turns and never factored.
AIR PAYNTER was outrun while saving ground. STORMY SUMMIT set the pace into the far turn, began losing ground after mid-turn then was empty
through the lane. HICKORY COURT was well back while in the three path and was eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
LEADING THE CHARGE was unhurried while in the two path through mid-turn, angled into the five path entering the lane and drove clear. JOHNY'S
FIREBALL unhurried while near the inside into the far turn, came further off the inside after mid-turn, entered the lane from the five path with aim on the top
one, could not gain on that one while finishing clear for the place spot. MY BARILEY was along the inside through the turns, angled into the seven path for
the drive and rallied for the minor share. PADDY'S HOUSE saved ground through far turn, entered the lane angling into the six or seven path and moved
up. POPPY'S BOYS stalked the pace from the two path into the turn, bid approaching the lane then weakened in the drive. REDSKIESATNIGHT raced in
the three path through the turns then moved up while well off the inside in the stretch. PENICILLIN SUCCESS was near the inside through the turn then
lacked a closing bid. BUCKETS OF RAIN set the pace along the inside into late turn then faded through the lane. MAJOR FRONTIER chased the pace from
the two path through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. CLASSY COWBOY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was asked
for more after mid-turn, gained a short lead entering the lane then was empty turning into the stretch. SEATTLE SOUL was outrun while in the four to the
three path through the turns.

Footnotes
BAYOU CAT was clear early inside, was challenged outside on the far turn. HARD LUCK JUSTICE stalked the early pace inside, bid in the two path at the
three-eighths pole, then was no match late. STRONG TIDE stalked in the two path, then had no late bid. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK saved ground, then had
no late bid. TOSS OF FATE raced inside, angled three wide at the quarter pole, then failed to menace. MAX EXPRESS was unrushed early, then had mild
late gain inside. BLUEMOON JUSTICE stalked in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. WILDCARD PRADO stalked the pace between foes to the far
turn. UPHOLD was not a factor. JOVA raced four wide and faded in the stretch.
