ALPHA QUEUE made the early lead, set the pace in the three path around the turn then steadily pulled away while kept to his business. TYREEK stumbled
leaving the starting gate, raced between horses around the turn, was in the four path turning for home and gained the place. BOLD TREK , three wide
leaving the turn, chased the winner to upper stretch and weakened late. ZIP THE LIP raced in the two path around the turn and failed to rally. PET'S NIGHT
hugged the inner rail and weakened. STREET PRAYER , four deep on the turn, was fanned to the five path turning for home then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
AWESUMMER came out at the break, corrected and had speed three wide and to the inside of GLEAMING SWORD, rated back off of that one nearing the
turn and took up a stalking spot, edged up to have aim two wide nearing the lane, was put to solid left handed asking past the three sixteenths, surged
through between rivals inside the sixteenth pole, took over late and was taken in hand at the wire. LASSMAN was checked when put in tight at the break,
regrouped and made a solid four wide run into and around the turn, moved to engage the leader into the lane, dueled, gained a slim lead inside the furlong
pole, drifted in some under right handed asking but kept on gamely to the wire. GLEAMING SWORD had speed outside rivals then went clear into the turn,
dropped in the set the pace, came under pressure in upper stretch, attempted to lay in despite efforts from his rider, dueled from mid stretch to late and gave
way grudgingly. HAIR OF THE DOG had speed towards the rail, checked when shuffled back nearing the turn, angled outside rivals to be six wide in upper
stretch, straightened and closed steadily. OUT OF TOWNER , four wide between rivals mid turn, gave hard chase into the lane and churned on with some
interest. FRANCIS X. steadied nearing the turn, edged up between runners in upper stretch, shifted in some and kept on trying. WONDERVILLE was sent
up between runners to force the early pace, eased back to stalk, steadied near mid turn, angled in and faded. STREET MOJO , in close at the break, lost
ground five outside foes mid turn and came up empty. MANGO MAN saved ground off the pace, came in under right handed asking and hit the rail in upper
stretch, recovered but failed to threaten. DIRTY DIRTY failed to keep pace. CUBANO CAT broke slowly and dropped far back.

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER quickly sprinted clear, set the pace near the inner rail and was under urging in the drive. MYSTIC TIMES , a forward factor in the three
path around the turn, was bumped by KINGSTON PIKE when that one was forced out in upper stretch then dug in willingly in the drive. AMEN CORNER ,
along the inner rail around the turn, caused interference when drifting out entering the stretch then flattened out. KINGSTON PIKE broke sluggishly, moved
up in the two wide between horses entering the stretch, bumped MYSTIC TIMES when forced out in upper stretch then checked in very tight quarters in mid
stretch. POWER BACK , no factor, was four wide entering the stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of KINGSTON PIKE,
AMEN CORNER was disqualified and placed fourth. An objection by the rider of KINGSTON PIKE against MYSTIC TIMES for alleged interference in the
stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
GLENGAR cleared early and dropped over towards the rail to set the pace, controlled things up front under slower fractions, responded when set down two
wide past the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling inside the furlong grounds and remained clear to the wire. LECTRIC CHOKE was steadied off
heels nearing the first turn, settled off the inside, picked up steam when given his cue near the three eighths, ranged up four wide outside rivals to loom into
the lane, failed to initially quicken with the winner past the three sixteenths but kept on grinding to the wire. HARDCORE FOLKLORE , off the pace, raced
between foes near the half mile pole, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, closed steadily but missed the place. ROYAL COUP stalked two to three
wide, was hard ridden to the inside of rivals past the five sixteenths but failed to muster up a legitimate finish. PURIMETER saved ground but lacked a rally.
GREEK PRINCE broke inward and was off a bit slowly, straightened and was used wide into the first turn, stalked three wide, was ridden along trying to
keep pace past the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch then faded.

the five path near the sixteenth pole and closed late. OLDIES BUT GOODIES , forced leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace three deep on the turn,

ROCK THE BOAT broke a step slow then lightly steadied back off foes, was a bit keen and pulled his way forward heading to the turn, steadied again
leaving the far turn, regrouped and advanced inside into the stretch, eased out past the quarter pole, had a seam and burst through four wide between foes
in mid stretch, spurted away a bit under a drive near the sixteenth pole then held firm under steady handling. PRINCE PERE had speed between rivals then
rated back off foes in the opening furlong, tracked a quartet of embattled foes nearing the five sixteenths, shifted out six wide in upper stretch, ranged up to
challenge for command in mid stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. SUE LOVES BARBADOS rated off the pace and between foes past the three eighths,
altered out to about the eight patch in upper stretch, straightened and closed steadily. SUBJECT TO CHANGE , fractious in the gate, eased back off of foes
leaving the far turn, swung wide and came on late. RAILMASTER broke alertly and disputed the pace two wide between runners, held a short lead into the
lane, fought on past mid stretch then faded in the final seventy yards. BENNY HAVENS , in close attendance while four wide, bid four deep nearing the
stretch, gained a short lead while dueling past the three sixteenths, failed to contain rivals leaving the eighth pole and faded. MACY'S BOY rushed up early
and contested the pace three wide, dueled between runners past the three eighths to mid stretch then gave way. PASCAL CHANT had speed to the inside
of rivals, was involved in a prolonged battle and then weakened in the final sixteenth. AFTER FIVE , four wide early, edged up a bit three deep past the
three furlong pole, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded

Footnotes
SOUTHSIDE SWIG sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and eagerly pulled away under urging in the stretch. SOUPER EMPEROR raced
slightly off the rail around the turn, chased the winner and held the place. CLEAR HUMOR lacked speed, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch
and had a late rally outside rivals. HE'S ORIENTATE , a forward factor in the three path on the turn, weakened through the stretch. BILLINGSGATE , four
wide entering the stretch, failed to rally. WICKED PRANKSTER trailed.

Footnotes
MISS MAJORETTE was steadied back from between rivals early then floated out around the far turn, regrouped and moved up five wide into the lane,
responded to pressure and ranged up outside foes leaving the eighth pole, sustained under a drive and forged ahead in the final yards. ELLANATION ,
bumped and in close at the break, moved up three wide in hand into the turn and stalked, switched over to her correct lead when challenging between
horses near the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely. FLYINGONTHEGROUND bobbled at the break, moved up outside and took command into the turn,
dropped in to set the pace, dug in when confronted entering the lane, battled on a slim lead leaving the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. ROSELBA
edged up off the rail then was forced out a bit entering the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the lane, vied between foes past mid stretch but was
out kicked in the final seventy yards. FIFTEEN ROYALS had speed inside, steadied back nearing the turn, shifted out and came back on. WHISKEY AND
RYE was steadied while saving ground into the turn, stayed inside to move up past the three sixteenths, eased out and continued with effort. MONEY
FROMHEAVEN was forced out about five wide into the turn, angled very wide in the drive and had a belated response. HYDRA , three wide between foes
mid turn, came up empty. OUR DIAMOND GIRL had speed inside, drifted in and checked in close quarters nearing the turn, recovered to chase while
saving ground then faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
THE MAN TO SEE lunged at the break, steadied behind the jam up leaving the starting gate, was rank and bore out when running off entering the first turn,
raced four wide the first turn, moved up wide entering the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch and lasted. GENERAL'S DUTY lacked speed, rated inside
horses down the backstretch and around the far turn then rallied nicely along the inner rail. JARDANI , well placed between horses entering the far turn,
swung wide in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and rallied. HARD TRAVELER bumped with SHAKE EM LOOSE when that one was forced in by
CONSULTANT leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and flattened out. CONSULTANT bore in on
horses leaving the starting gate, was rank entering the first turn, angled four wide and rushed up outside horses mid way on the bend, advanced in the three
path on the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. AMARILLO raced in the three path on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and
failed to rally. TEMPLE OWL LIAM sped to the early lead, angled in on the first turn, set the pace along the rail and tired in mid stretch. E. P. MILTON ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, chased the pace two wide to the stretch and tired. CANDY COOL , outrun, raced wide in upper stretch. SCAREDY
CAT raced well off the rail and was done on the far turn. SHAKE EM LOOSE was pinched back and bumped with HARD TRAVELER when forced in by
CONSULTANT leaving the starting gate, got carried out by THE MAN TO SEE approaching the first turn and failed to be a factor. DYNA MAST , very wide
the far turn, gave way and was eased.
