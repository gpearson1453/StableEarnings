checked leaving the five sixteenths pole, then made a inside move nearing the quarter pole, shifted off the rail nearing the furlong marker and finished
willingly while no match to the winner but clearly second best. BALBOA'S SMILE pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but came up
empty in the drive, bested rest. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL pressed the pace two wide and weakened. SHE'S A REBEL was off a step slow, then settled
early, then was six wide on the turn and weakened. DON'TMAKEAZEEN set a pressured pace three wide and folded up.

BEHEMAH STAR was off slowly, then advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and closed well on the outside, hit the front leaving the
sixteenths pole and was going away late under a drive. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, lugged in
leaving the furlong marker bumping SHACKLE CAT, then was corrected with left handed crop urging, drifted out and was clear but was caught late while
staying on for the place. JOHNNY SWISH chased the pace four wide and came into the stretch four wide and was gaining late. SHACKLE CAT set the early
pace, then dueled for the lead on the inside leaving the quarter pole, then had to check leaving the furlong marker and then lost the show spot late. DREAM
HAPPY checked after the start, then chased the pace three wide and between horses, then came three wide into the drive and finished evenly late. QUEEN
OF MINE was well placed on the inside and weakened. DANCE ON THE MOON chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. DON CICCIO failed to
menace. The jockey on SHACKLE CAT claimed foul against HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE for interference in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the stewards
disqualified HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE from second and placed him fourth.

TEXAS REWARD was reserved early on the inside, eased off the rail and made a four wide by the five sixteenths pole to loom boldly by the quarter pole,
continued that bid and slowly edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC stalked the early pace three wide,
made a bid to duel for command by the half mile marker, continued to duel for command to the quarter pole, gained a short lead leaving the turn, but could
not hold off the bid from the winner in the final furlong while staying on gamely to be clearly second best. DR. ANN set the early pace while racing off the
rail, then dueled for command on the inside on the turn and weakened, bested rest. WONDER CITY chased the pace three to four wide and weakened.
NANA'S SHOES was reserved early, made a mild five wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. THAT IS KEY chased the pace four to five wide
and tired.

NURSE RACHETT was away alertly to set the early pace while clear and off the rail, then was headed by the quarter pole, floated out four wide leaving the
turn and turned back the bid of JOANIE'S SUNSET and slowly edged clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. JOANIE'S SUNSET stalked the
pace setter three wide and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole to go on even terms for command, but hung in the final furlong. RAPIDAMENTE
was rated along the inside, had to steady around the five eighths pole, continued saving ground but lacked the needed winning bid.

Footnotes
AMAZING ALEX set the early pace while in hand towards the inside, shifted out by the three sixteenths and responded well to mild urging to draw clear to
prove best. INVECTIVE was well placed early and advanced on the turn two wide by the quarter pole, angled out for aim leaving the turn, finished willingly
but proved to be no match for the winner, clearly second best. MY HANDSOME MAN was fractious in the gate, settled early, made a inside move on the
turn, angled out leaving the turn but flattened out, bested rest. TRIPULANTE pressed the early pace four wide and weakened. PATH TO SUCCESS was
settled early, raced two to three wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. BIGSHOT ON NOTHING was allowed to settle early and raced five wide on
the turn and weakened. SAPIO SOCIAL broke outwardly at the start, settled back early and moved to be three wide on the turn and then failed to respond.
