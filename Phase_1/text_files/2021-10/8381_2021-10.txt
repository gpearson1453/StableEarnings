Footnotes
SMASH stalked the early pace, advanced steadily two wide to make the lead on the far turn then widened the balance of the trip under brisk handling to win
as much the best. KITCHI pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead, set the pace into the far turn then was no match for the
winner. ARTISTICO stumbled at the start, got out on the first turn then passed tiring rivals outside. VAN DAMME was no factor. CASTLE KING set the pace
around the first turn, had speed into the stretch then weakened. GEH SCHNELL was always outrun. CHANGING LANES showed little. ESKENDULCE
allowed to settle, pulled up injured on the second turn and was vanned off. VIGO had brief speed, also pulled up on the far turn and was walked off.

held on for second along the rail. HIGH FIRE unhurried early, found her best stride late in the three path. GRINS N' WINS stalked the pace four wide and
went evenly. K FOR KATHY chased the pace into the far turn then weakened. CAT'S RHYTHM was through after a half.

Footnotes
BEACH BABE trailed for a half, swung wide, closed with a burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack and was along in time. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE
chased the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead on the far turn, edged clear before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner.
UCANTKEEPUP never far back, improved near the inside on the far turn, shitted to the five path then leveled off. POWER BANKER stalked the pace for a
half then failed to respond. CIRCLE WILL RUN sprinted to a clear lead on the first turn, set the pace into the far turn along the inside then weakened.
YELLAH stalked the pace into the stretch from the four path then weakened. SPIT'S IMAGE was in tight behind rivals entering the first turn then had brief
speed. DREAMINOFJUSTICE was outrun.
