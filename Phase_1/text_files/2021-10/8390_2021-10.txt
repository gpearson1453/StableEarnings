saved ground through the turn, came through inside and improved his position. HIDEKI showed little, inside. ENDLESS was no factor. LADY IN HEELS set

under steady pressure. WATCH THE DIP chased the pace, angled out and looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, then
was no match for the winner late and held the place. ANOTHER SOFTBALL allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane,
made a steady gain and missed the place. TOTAL DISTRACTION mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
passed tiring for a share. APACHE BRAVE set the pace on the inside, bore out slightly into the lane, then was unable to be ridden the final furlong and
faded. OLD TIMER'S DAY well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened. MR. MAGICO

Footnotes
SILVER DOLLAR CITY well placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled in, made a steady gain
and edged up late. MAC NINETY chased the pace, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and missed.
SECOND ENCORE broke out at the start, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed well for the show. LORD
BYRON allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and had a mild gain.
RUSTY DE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out and passed tiring rivals. WROTE IN STONE mid pack, looped
up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. SAVE THE LAND improved his position. HEY SACH sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, held sway to the furlong marker, then faded. BOURBON BROWN vied for the early lead on the inside,
lost some ground through the turn, then faded in the lane.
