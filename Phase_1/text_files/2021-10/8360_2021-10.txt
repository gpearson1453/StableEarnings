Footnotes
I HEAR YOU tracked the pace in the two to three paths, stalked intently while looming around the far turn, took aim on CHARGES DROPPED in upper
stretch as that foe forged an advantage, bid outside of that rival at the furlong grounds, got mildly brushed and herded outwards by her inner drifting
counterpart, yet prevailed. CHARGES DROPPED prompted the pace three wide, vied around the far turn, led in upper stretch, dug in at the furlong grounds
as I HEAR YOU menaced, subtly drifted outwards brushing that rival and herding her a few paths while sustaining the battle, but was bested. FOOLERY
settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked from the two path around the far turn before shifting four wide entering the lane, got floated five wide leaving
the three sixteenths, and stayed on to reach show. LONGPANTS REQUIRED broke a bit outwardly, stalked comfortably along the inside, was driven four
wide passing the three sixteenths pole to be outside of the leading pair, but lacked a kick to make a bid, and only managed to chase them home. SURSUM
CORDA broke slowly, saved ground far off of the pace around both turns, and stayed on through the lane. DANCE RECITAL took bumps between horses at
the start, trailed the field around both turns, swung seven wide turning for home, and rallied well widest of all. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) settled far back three
wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. RUNAWAY MOM lied far off of the pace two wide and between horses, but never got
involved. SOCIAL DILEMMA lied off of the pace two to three wide, shifted five wide, and lacked a bid. ICE QUEEN set the pace inside of a pair of pressing
rivals, but yielded in upper stretch. MISS ADELINE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane. SUKI tracked from the
three to four paths, but came under urging to keep pace at the half mile pole, and weakened outside of rivals around the far turn.

Footnotes
ALL LUCK set the pace, met MANASOTA SUNSET's bid into the far turn, got headed by that foe with five sixteenths remaining, but dug in turning for home,
dueled before regaining an advantage leaving the furlong grounds, and drew clear. MANASOTA SUNSET prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead
outside of ALL LUCK into the far turn, forged an advantage around that bend, but failed to kick on in upper stretch, got re-headed by that rival inside the
furlong pole, and yielded. LAURA'S CHARM stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them entering
the lane, faded, but saved show. CODE FOR SUCCESS trailed, advanced in the three path around the far turn, then moved up through the lane, but missed
reaching show. MIZ JAMESON got rank while off of the pace around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, and failed to factor. LET'S BE
CLEAR was last away, was brushed by an inner foe into the first turn, tracked from the four path, gained minorly into the far turn, but ran out of steam
around that bend, and faltered turning for home. RUNNIN HAPPY broke a bit slowly, tracked from the two path under a snug hold around the first turn, but
was shuffled back behind a weakening MABEE LUCKYNWILD before steadying hard behind that rival into the far turn, then failed to re-rally. MABEE
LUCKYNWILD brushed an outer foe while shifting ground outwards into the first turn, tracked three wide, but weakened readily into the far turn.

Footnotes
AVERLY JANE took a minor brush from an inner lunging foe at the start, set the pace feeling mild pressure from a pair of outer rivals, but swiftly kicked
away when let out a notch in upper stretch, widened under mild hand urging through midstretch, and was geared down through the final sixteenth.
KAUFYMAKER saved ground in midpack, then sustained a rail rally through the lane to bid for place a sixteenth out, and prevailed. CIRCLE BACK JACK
tracked from midpack three to two wide into the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch with many lengths to find,
changed leads at the furlong grounds, quickened mildly, and stayed on to reach show while missing place. DETROIT CITY stalked along the inside, forged
place entering the lane from a pair of outer rivals, but quickly proved no match for the leader, chased through the final furlong, but was outfinished by rivals
on both sides for minor placing in the late stages. PURE PANIC saved ground far off of the pace, shifted five wide approaching midstretch, and stayed on
but failed to threaten. ROMAN POET prompted the pace setter from the outside into the turn, but failed to keep pace turning for home, got outmoved by an
inner foe for place entering the lane, then chased before fading. BIG BOSS BEN broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, lied off of the pace two
wide, got floated six wide in midstretch and failed to factor. BONUS APPRECIATION lunged outwards and brushed an outer rival before being bumped by
an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three to four path around the turn, and was outrun. DIAMOND CITY stalked three wide, but weakened
entering the lane.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA established a clear advantage early on, managed the loose lead with her ears pricked, received a breather into the far turn as foes inched
closer, but drew away again when let out passing the five sixteenths pole, widened under driving pressure in midstretch, then held safely from a chasing
DUNBAR ROAD through the late stages. DUNBAR ROAD sat reserved along the inside around the first turn, shifted three wide while inside of BONNY
SOUTH into the far turn to commence a rally, gained while shifting four wide turning for home to bid for place in upper stretch, then chased the clear leader
home while steadily narrowing her margin late. BONNY SOUTH trailed, gained four to five wide and outside of DUNBAR ROAD around the far turn, but
failed to match rallying strides with that foe entering the lane, and stayed on to claim show. CRYSTAL BALL was mildly brushed by an inner foe at the start,
tracked three wide, chased while clinging to place around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and got outkicked by outer foes for minor placings.
ENVOUTANTE stalked two wide, then from between horses into the far turn, but came under a drive turning for home, lacked a true response, and faded.
TOWN AVENGER stumbled at the start but was not severely costed, stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace passing the three furlong pole, and
weakened entering the lane.

TIZ THE BOMB broke through the gate pre-race, ran for a furlong or so before being jogged back and reloaded, stalked two wide, but lost position while
chasing around the far turn as outer foes made moved, tipped six wide for clear sailing entering the lane, and produced a good kick to range up to inner foes
at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage a sixteenth from home, and drove clear. STOLEN BASE sat reserved along the inside, then two wide into the
far turn, swung nine wide and outside of rivals turning for home, rallied with a good kick while shifting inwards through the lane, and reached place
approaching the wire. CREDIBILITY tracked from midpack along the inside, saved ground before shifting five wide in upper stretch, grinded away inside of
TIZ THE BOMB, but was outkicked by that foe leaving the furlong grounds, kept on while gaining place, but lost that position late. RED DANGER was
bumped hard by an outer foe at the start, then took a bump to his hind quarters from an inner rival shortly after, tracked the pace three wide got floated four
wide in upper stretch, but produced a bid at the three sixteenths pole, briefly led leading to the furlong grounds, resisted outer bids leaving that junction, but
was outkicked a sixteenth out. DOWAGIAC CHIEF stalked along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane, vied for the lead between horses passing
the three sixteenths pole, but yielded to outer foes at the furlong grounds. ROCKET ONE lied off of the pace two wide, got hung out five wide around the far
turn, came into the lane eight wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch while put to tight quarters on his left lead, then kept on thereafter. PLAY
ACTION PASS staked two wide, bid turning for home, led in upper stretch before meeting a pair of bids at the three sixteenths pole, then gave way to them
and other outer foes at the furlong grounds. LUCKY BOSS popped the gate opened when TIZ THE BOMB broke through, trailed the field two wide, saved
ground around the far turn, shifted off of the railing in upper stretch, but steadied briefly in traffic at the furlong grounds, shifted inwards, but was not
persevered with thereafter. ON THIN ICE was pinched back early on, saved ground far off of the pace, improved inside of foes turning for home, but failed
sustain that bid. BRIT'S WIT never got involved. MARTINI'NMOONSHINE settled off of the pace, attempted a four wide rally around the far turn before
swinging seven wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick. HEAVEN STREET bumped an inner foe at the start, tugged clear into the first turn, met a bid
turning for home, got headed entering the lane, and stopped. FAST N STEADY was bumped between horses at the start, lied far off three wide and
between rivals, then weakened into the far turn. WAITA MINUTE HAYES took a bump at the start, then got bumped between horses shortly after, lied far off
of the pace four wide, was done early, and eased through the lane.
