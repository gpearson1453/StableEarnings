CALIFORNIA SUZY gave chase through the backstretch and closed the gap at the rail on the turn, dug in entering the stretch and steadily progressed to
take over the final yards. QUEEN OF KANTHAROS drew off to a long early lead, came under pressure into the turn and was steadily handled through the
lane, but gave up the lead in the final yards. LOVE CALIFORNIA came away a step slow then gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail
then flattened. BIPARTISAN BROOKE chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further.

Footnotes
COMMAND THE CAT stalked two deep then took the nod approaching the three eighths pole, drew clear of ELLIE'S LIL MAN approaching the quarter pole
and moved to the rail into the turn, then drew off the final furlong, while the latter rated a slim early lead inside, came under pressure past the half mile pole
and gave up the nod approaching the three eighths, steadied to alter course to the two path into the far turn and settled for second best. OWEN'S WAY
rated close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then flattened the final furlong. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved
ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. FRATHOUSE MUSIC settled off the pace in the two and
three paths the opening turn then showed little response through the backstretch. STEP OUT DANCING raced well back off the rail on the first turn and
never factored. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Command The Cat, lodged by the rider of Ellie's Lil Man, though, found no
infraction.

FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path then dug in from the head of the lane to get
up the final yards. BOUGHT BY DIVA hustled clear and angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, was met leaving the turn and dug in undetermined
handling to put a head in front of LEG UP at the wire while being outfinished for the win, while the latter pressured the pace inside and remained close at the
rail on the turn, dug in gamely through the lane, though, ceded the nod under the wire. ANGELA'S ROMEO broke a step slow and raced well back, started a
bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. PULL UP MY SOCKS chased toward the inside, raced
near the rail on the turn then weakened. CHASE LIL ME saved ground.

Footnotes
JAMMIN STILL rated close off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the quarter, drew
clear midway on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on. GOOFY BOY settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, started a bid
approaching the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the four path of the far turn, finished well to take second later yards and was gaining on the
winner. LOOKIN' SMART settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and dug in to
take third the final yards. KING NEKIA took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure to turn back Marsac
leaving the three eighths pole, was caught toward the quarter, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened inside the eighth pole. DESTINY'S CHARGE
saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened. SWING YOUR SWORD rounded the
opening turn about the four path and never factored. MARSAC angled in to race with the pace two deep, chased from the three eighths pole but dropped
back into the far turn and gave way.
