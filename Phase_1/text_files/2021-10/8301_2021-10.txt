Footnotes
GIANNI LAMBO bumped with a rival at the start while breaking in front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch, bobbled slightly inside the three-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed crop, responded well in
the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. EMPIRE RIDGE broke a half-step slow then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside then in the
two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, pursued the winner in the stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. EMBOITE
(IRE) broke a half-step slow, was taken up early, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail under a drive in the stretch and and
gained late while safely securing the show. JUPITER RAIN broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was asked while moving from the rail to the two path on
the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to respond. HARD TO TOUCH bumped with the winner at the start, bobbled early then dropped back,
fell well behind in the two path on the turn and was no factor. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW

at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. CARAMOCHA a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start,
chased two to three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure
the show honors. I'M FINE chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
CHASING CARA three then two wide in aim of the leader, advanced to take command between foes three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. PRETTY
CLEVER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. PENDOLINO
hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing when displaced from command at
the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home in retreat and tired. BECAUSE OF SUSAN chased two to three wide coming under coaxing tipped
four wide at the seven-sixteenths, angled in to spin three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

extended the advantage into upper stretch then was set down near the three-sixteenths, responded well under the crop in the final furlong and maintained a
safe advantage under a strong drive. TWELTH MAN moved up on the outside to press the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch
under a drive and secured the place while no match for the winner. JERUSALEM GATES was bumped hard at the start then checked sharply, spotted the
front many lengths, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out into the final furlong, brushed with SCOTTO near the wire
and narrowly earned the show. SCOTTO bumped with a rival at the start, dropped towards the rear then settled, was roused while three then four wide on
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, brushed with JERUSALEM GATES near the wire and just missed the show. FAR AWAY LOOK broke
out and bumped hard with JERUSALEM GATES causing that foe to check, was snatched up with the left-rein after doing the damage, lugged out down the
backstretch, drifted from four to six wide while falling to the rear on the turn and faltered.

outside the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, drew off while remaining on her inside lead and was eased up in the final
strides while much the best. WRITE THE CHECK dropped back while void of speed, raced near the rail early on the turn, shifted four wide at the
three-eighths, remained four wide into the stretch, came in a bit around the three-sixteenths and just got up for the place. HALF BIRTHDAY set the pace
under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail under coaxing on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and weakened then lost the place late
while clear for the show. BELLS ON HER TOES was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. BEAUTIFUL BANKS was urged along in the back half of the field, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. LOST ANCHOR tracked
the pace on the outside, chased in mostly the four path on the turn and tired. BACK UP THE BRINKS was hustled from the start then urged along early,
came under restraint near the five-eighths, dropped back five wide on the turn and capitulated. MY FIRST LOVE was urged along in the front half of the
field, dropped back in the two path on the turn and retreated. UNI LOVES A FIGHT broke out slightly and brushed the gate, settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and failed to respond. LA SUA PASTA was hustled from the start, dropped back on the outside under urging then moved in, rounded the

Footnotes
MY ROXY GIRL was well placed down the backstretch, drafted in the two path while behind a quartet of foes on the turn, was given room between horses
inside the three-eighths then accelerated through a gap to take the lead coming to the five-sixteenths, kicked clear outside the quarter-pole, turned into
upper stretch under one pop of a right-handed crop, widened passing the three-sixteenths, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop between the
furlong marker and the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. ANNIKA GOLD bumped with a rival at the start
then dropped back, fell well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path and improved position to garner the place. SARATOGA
BEAUTY bumped with a foe at the start then dropped back, settled off the pace, drafted behind horses in the three path on the turn, waited passing the
five-sixteenths then was roused, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. NO DEAL was
recalcitrant behind the gate, moved out early then settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
SWEET MIA was hustled to the lead, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked then headed outside the
five-sixteenths and tired. AWESOME INDRA tracked the early pace, moved up with five furlongs to run, vied three then four wide on the turn, dropped back
into the stretch and came up empty. COVER PHOTO broke out at the start then was corrected by the rider, chased on the outside while sent hard, went four
then five wide on the turn, moved to six wide late on that bend and capitulated. STARSHIP REINA bumped with an opponent at the start, tracked the early
pace, made a bid with five furlongs to run, vied two then three wide while between foes on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BELLA PRINCIPESSA broke a step slow, moved up into the middle of the field, brushed the rail while advancing closer late on the backstretch, gained
inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, rallied to the lead into the stretch, battled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed. TALES
OF MAKENNA settled off the pace, was asked in the two path early on the turn, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, rallied to make an outside
bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. HIT THE NAIL was taken back after breaking in the front
half of the field, dropped towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, drifted out some while chasing the leaders
into the final furlong and finished willingly while clear for the show. HIYA HARRY was reserved towards the back, saved ground on the turn, gained into
upper stretch but lacked the needed response. RAVING was off very slow, raced at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
bumped hard with a rival then also improved position. SPUN FOR LU LU was placed under a tight hold early then rated off the pace, went around the turn in
the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CAUSEWAY OF DREAMS was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FROSTED BOURBON bumped with a foe leaving the
initial dogleg, went to the front when let out outside the three-quarter-pole then moved clear, raced inside on the turn, was headed into the stretch and tired.
SPILL THE TEA was rated off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and came up empty. BARREL OF
BLISS was hustled to the early lead, lost the advantage outside the three-quarter pole then tracked the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and
capitulated. WHITE HOT was reserved off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, was forced out over heels into the stretch and failed to respond.
INOUAINTALKINTOME bumped with a foe leaving the initial dogleg, moved up with six furlongs to run then tracked the pace, dropped back while moving
from three to five wide on the turn, was bumped hard while out of contention into the stretch and had nothing left.
