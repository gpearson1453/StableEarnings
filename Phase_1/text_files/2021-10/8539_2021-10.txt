Footnotes
ASYOUBELIEVE contested the early pace from off the rail, gained the advantage over MOUNT ASGARD in the final turn, drove clear at the head of the
stretch and was ridden out. SPOT ON DUDE raced wide leaving the chute, angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, drove four wide into lane,
evened out through the stretch and was up in the final strides for place. MOUNT ASGARD contended the early pace in the four path, was unable to move
on with the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole, flattened out in the stretch and was caught late. DARK STORM COMING was not a factor.
RATTLESNAKE JACK disliked going.

LIA'S ON TUNE vied outside for the early lead, cut the corner leaving the backstretch, drew clear entering the lane and won driving.
SAVEITFORARAINYDAY saved ground inside, angled out leaving the final turn, improved position into the stretch but was no match for the winner. I
TRICKED MY RIDE raced wide leaving the final turn and was along in time for show honors. FAIRY BARB brushed in the early stages, chased the eventual
winner and was rundown late. GOLD DIGGIN DARLIN bumped repeatedly from the run away from the gate and yielded into stretch. AY ITALIAN steadied
then bumped inside rival and dropped back.

PARKING PERMIT brushed MR. KALYPSO in the early stages, stalked the pace from the three path, gained the lead at the quarter pole and was ridden
out. WYE CROSS settled in stride, tracked the pacesetters outside, took closer order in the final turn, moved up menacingly at the head of the stretch but
was unable to reach the winner. MR. KALYPSO brushed leaving, set the pace from off the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and
weakened gradually inside. BIG AL'S VISION tracked the pacesetters and failed to threaten. RAIDEN passed tiring. NEVVARE last away and never
reached contention.
