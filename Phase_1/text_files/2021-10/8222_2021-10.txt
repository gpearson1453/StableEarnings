Footnotes
VRONSKY FEINT was away well and set comfortable fractions through the second turn while saving ground, lost the lead to CARASYNTHIA leaving the
turn but battled back and while green in the final sixteenth held on over an oncoming runner-up. BEACHGRASS settled near the rear of the field, saved
ground on the second turn, closed well leaving the turn and was gaining on the winner but could not reel her in while holding for second. CARASYNTHIA
tracked the early pace from a three wide running path, took the lead leaving the second turn but gave way to the winner and was outkicked in the stretch,
just missing for the show. REMEMBER SUE sat just off of the early pace while forwardly place, saved ground on the second turn, gained ground in the
stretch but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SILVER AFFAIR settled in the midflight, was two to three wide on the second turn and lacked a final kick in
the stretch. VALDINI was away slowly and lagged at the rear of the field, was three to four wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LADY MOHICAN was off sharply and set the pace from a ground saving position, shook off RUN D. L. C. nearing the top of the lane and kicked clear in the
end. LOVELY HUSSAR sat off of the early pace, mounted a bid while three to four wide on the turn, gained ground on the winner in the stretch but was
outkicked while on the left lead. SHE'S EXPENSIVE had no speed in the early going, traveled along the four path on the turn and rallied in the stretch to
claim the show but was not challenging the top two. ELLE VICTOIRE settled in the midflight while saving ground and finished evenly in the late going. LIL
TINKER was pinched at the start and was slow into stride, chased the field from the rear while two wide and made a mild stretch bid but was not affecting
the leaders. RUN D. L. C. chased the early leader while three wide, lost ground leaving the turn and gave out in the stretch run. EVENING AMBITION
tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC settled in the midflight, mounted a bid on the second turn while two to three wide, shook off TRASH TALKIN CAT inside of the final furlong and
dug in and held over an oncoming runner-up. CHIEF JACKSON tracked the early pace while saving ground, improved position while moving up the rail in
the stretch, battled in the final sixteenth but could not get by the winner while besting the rest. TRASH TALKIN CAT broke on top and set the pace from a
ground saving position, led into the stretch but was collared by the winner and weakened in the late going. MOUNT PELLIAR had no early speed, saved
ground on the second turn and closed willingly in the stretch to challenge for third. VANTAGE POINT checked in tight quarters into the first turn, prompted
the pace from a ground saving position and was outfinished in the stretch. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was unprepared at the start and spotted the field five
lengths, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor.

PHANTOM INDIAN settled just off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, was deftly steered leaving the turn and had a bold late kick to prevail.
CRYSTAL PROOF tracked the early pace from a four wide running path, mounted a bid leaving the turn to take the lead heading into the lane, had a clear
lead in the final sixteenth but was passed by the winner's quick move and was well clear of the rest. LADY PACIFIC was away quickly and set fast fractions
while saving ground, was confronted on the turn and weakened in the stretch but did hold for the show. TENDERONI chased from the rear in the early
stages, was three to four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. BIG BRAND was away slowly and was hustled to track the early leaders,
saved ground on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. ELA CALIMERA MOU had no early speed and trailed through the early stages, was two to
three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late rally. DUBLIN BLUE ECHO stalked the early pace while forwardly placed, checked in tight quarters on
the second turn and was empty for the stretch run. FLASHIN PASSION pressed the early pace from a three wide position and gave way in the stretch run.
GOVERNOR SPECIAL chased the early fractions from the midflight, saved ground on the second turn and faded in the late going.

TABLE FOR TEN sat just off of the early pace, saved ground along the backstretch and run on the second turn, tipped out to the two path to quickly collar
ROARING TIGER leaving the turn and pulled away in the final sixteenth. HAMMERING LEMON stumbled at the start and settled near the rear of the field,
saved ground on the second turn while improving position, was no match for the winner in the stretch but kept on to secure the place. ROARING TIGER
was away alertly and set all of the fractions from a two wide position, was quickly collared by TABLE FOR TEN leaving the second turn and weakened in the
stretch run. CROWN AND PICKLES settled in the midflight, lost ground on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. BIG CITY BANE had no
early speed, improved position off of the second turn but did not have a final kick in the stretch drive. INFATUATE tracked the leaders in the early going,
was two wide between foes on the second turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. EVENEREVENWORSE stalked the pace from a cluster of rivals in
the midflight, was three wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch. VOICE OF VICTORY chased the early pace, was two wide between foes on the
second turn and faded in the stretch run. DIAMOND DATA was washy in the post parade, tracked the early pace while forwardly placed, lost ground on the
second turn, stopped, was eased and walked off.
