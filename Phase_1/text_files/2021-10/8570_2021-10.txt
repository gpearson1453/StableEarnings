ABSTRACT KAT was allowed to settle early raced between rivals into the turn, was gaining late and was up in time. GO FOR THE LAUGH set a clear early
pace, opened a commanding lead while racing off the rail, couldn't hold off the winner and just missed. LAUGHING STORM was reserved early, advanced
five wide into the turn, was closing late and needed more. RARE COIN raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside and offered no late rally. QUINTON'S
CHARMER was void of any early speed, raced far wide and never fired. MAJORWAYHOME tracked the early pace, raced six wide and was empty late.
CASH CRUZER followed the early pace, raced three wide and faded.

Footnotes
CAIRO KING tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole, opened up and held. SIGALERT was taken back early,
advanced between rivals, was closing late and finished second best. GREY STORM raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside, rushed to the front
through the turn, made a brief lead, couldn't sustain and was empty late. SKY JUMPER was unhurried early, raced seven wide through the turn and
flattened out. DADDY WHAT IF was void of any speed, angled out to the eight path and offered no rally. TIZ WAY COOL set a pressured early pace from off
the rail and weakened. BARBARA'S CHAMP stalked the early pace, raced three wide and gave way. VROYSKY pressed the early pace, went four wide and
faded. KRIS' WILD KAT was taken back and was no factor.
