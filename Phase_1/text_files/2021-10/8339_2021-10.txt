Footnotes
WITHOUTMOREADO took command of his rivals as he made his way up the first backstretch. From there he set a controlled and steady pace meeting with
one, albeir brief, challenge at the irst stretch by SOME RESPONSE, but rebuffed any attempts to best him ultimately crossing the wire unhurried and much
the best. SHOOTIST allowed others to set the pace while he mained in the last tier, picking off remaining rivals one at a time; made a bid turning for home
but needed to settle for second best today. SOME RESPONSE raced mid-pack throughout and although not threatening was in a good position to strike
when called upon. However after racing two and a half miles the rider eased him. MASTER SEVILLE broke well and on top and ran alongside CORKY
LEMON until overtaken by WITHOUTMOREADO up the backstretch. Both showed early foot and as they approached the second of three stretch runs, both
fell. WORZEL GUMMIDGE sat far behind the leaders until he made his bid up the second backstretch, still a couple of lengths behind the winner when at
the 15th fence he stumbled and lost his rider. MR. HAIRE refused to start.

Footnotes
RAKHAA quickly took to the front and was allowed to settle as the pace setter, failing to meet with much of a challenge from any of his foes. POCKET TALK
maintained his place, stalking the leader throughout. POCKET TALK, while turning for home gained a striking position inside the leader. Both turned for
home under strong urging and RAKHAA turned away is foe and crew clear. ROCKET STAR RED Aand DREAM VERSE raced as a team behind the
leaders, biding their time until their move was to be made. However, ROCKET STAR RED stumbled and fell, unseating his rider up the second backstretch.
Quarter of a mile later DREAM VERSE was eased by his rider.

Footnotes
MYSTIC STRIKE opened in front setting a tepid pace which he shared the lead with GOODOLDTIMES (IRE), exchanging the top position through most of
the going until they reached the second backstretch. When at the two mile marker, SCHOODIC began to gain some momentum unter intensifying urging,
and found himself in tight quarters, flanked between the leaders making their way over the fifteenth fence. Turning for home all three were spread across the
track heads apart until MYSTIC STRIKE found another gear and began to draw clear, but SCHOODIC kept pace with the front runner, both drawing clear of
GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) who faded. In deep stretch MYSTIC STRIKE narrowly edged SCHOODIC. The distance was shortened from three and a half miles
to three miles.
