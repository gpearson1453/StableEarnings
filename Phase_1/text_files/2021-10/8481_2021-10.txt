Footnotes
CENTSOFWANDER angled out to stalk the pace, gained a short lead through the second turn, then drew off inside the furlong marker and was kept to the
task. AMES MISTER mid pack, moved up while angling out through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain, then was no match for
the winner in the late going and held the place safe. BUT I DID reluctant to load, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane,
flattened out while gaining the show. PITON well placed, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the
final furlong. SECOND ENCORE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, drifted out and
improved his position. SEA CAPTAIN tracked the pace, angled out to moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and
weakened. HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded through the second turn.

quickly, then made a steady gain and missed. CINCO DE MANDEE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off inside the furlong marker, then

out. BROOKLYNS SURPRISE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened
the final furlong. ROLLING MO ran evenly to the lane, then had no stretch rally.

LIMONATA well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off
the final furlong. SQUAD UP tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and
closed well for the place. ZIDIKAI mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. WATERLOO
SUNSET set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. COURTED stalked the
pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. BENTLEY'S PALACE hopped and broke out at the start,
then was no factor. PEMAQUID DOT was never involved.

Footnotes
ECHO ALPHA SIX tracked the pace pulling, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear
quickly, then drew off and was kept to the task. DECLARED mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a
steady gain and edged up for the place late. BLAKENSTEIN broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane, angled out, made a steady gain and missed the place. BETTYS BOMBER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside into the stretch and closed willingly for a share. LEXATOGA hopped at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch,
was blocked, steadied, then improved his position. OLIVER WITHA TWIST mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the
lane and had no rally. SQUIRREL set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final fulrong. ABANDONED stalked
the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane and faded.
