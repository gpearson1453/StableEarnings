LINE CHANGE was away alertly to set the early pace, then was pressured entering the turn, then shook clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marker,
then shifted out late and held on gamely to prove best under a drive. OUTKISSED was rated along three wide early, eased out on the turn and came five
wide into the drive, closed well in the lane but needed more late. VON HOFF was settled three wide early, then was four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the drive, made a mild rally in the drive while being on the left lead. DATHOSS stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to loom
boldly nearing the quarter pole, lugged in leaving the turn and came up empty. STRONGER THAN DEX was fractious in the gate, then bobbled slightly at
the start, then went up to press the pace three wide and weakened. MR. NINETEEN chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. ICY MINISTER
lacked a rally. BOWIE TWO STEP was off very slowly and never factored.

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE stalked the early pace four wide, made a five wide bid leaving the turn and went on even terms for command by the furlong marker,
then kicked clear to prove bets under a drive. SHELLY ISLAND chased the early pace and steadied slightly nearing the three eighths pole, then came into
the drive three wide, angled in for racing room and rallied well on the inside to gain the place award. HUSHED HIJINKS chased the early pace four wide,
came into the drive five wide and offered a mild rally to gain the show spot. ROYAL THUNDER pressed the pace three wide and hung in the drive.
DRAGON MOON was settled four wide early, then advanced four to five wide on the turn, angled out six wide in the drive and had a belated rally. RISING
PERRY chased the early pace in between rivals, steadied around the three eighths marker, came into the drive four wide and had a late rally. MOSBY'S
RANGER set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed by the furlong marker and weakened the final furlong. JOSEF IS REAL was well placed
early and weakened. NEW YORK ONE was not a factor while four wide. YOU CAN NEVER TELL showed brief foot on the inside and was through early.

Footnotes
AL BROWN was well rated early, made a four wide move on the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. REPLICANT was
reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive but could not go with the winner while clearly second best and was
vanned off after the race. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn to loom boldly but came up empty in the
drive. DON'T DARE ME vied for the early lead on the inside, then shook clear to set the pace, was headed leaving the turn, gave way and was eased the
final furlong. CRYING FOR MORE was settled early while three wide and offered no rally. EL EQUALIZER vied for the early lead in between horses, tired
and was eased. DEJOHN vied for the lead three wide, stopped and was eased. SUPPORTING ACTOR failed to menace while four wide and was eased.
TREMENDOUS was euthanized after he fell and struck his head on the ground during the post parade.

Footnotes
TORCH CARRIER saved ground, angled out four wide at the quarter pole, rallied, angled in late and was up in time under a strong hand ride. LOOKING
FOR LOVE prompted the pace outside of the leader, was clear at the eighth pole but was caught at the wire. EL BOCHINCHE raced in the three path,
altered course to the rail late and then nabbed the show spot. NINE MAST stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid. HIDDEN PERSUASION was
impeded at the start, then rallied belatedly outside. EL MILAGRA raced in the four path with no late bid. CANDY CORNER raced evenly outside. VERYAN
saved ground. GYPSY'S IMAGE stalked in the three path, then faded late. X MARKS THE SPOT was no factor outside. MOSLER'S TOUCH was clear
early, then couldn't last. CHELICHNA was not a factor.

TRUST DADDY dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid to shake clear in the furlong grounds, then held sway late to prove best under a drive.
HOLIDAY HOUSE was rated along three wide early, came four wide into the drive and closed well late. RADICAL RIGHT stalked the early pace and came
into the drive four wide but had no punch in the drive, bested rest. HE GONE dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the final furlong. ZATIP was off a
step slow, then advanced four wide on the turn and offered a mild late rally. AUCTION KINGDOM was settled four wide early, then was three wide on the
turn and offered no rally while racing evenly. ROLL DEM BONES stalked the pace four to five wide and weakened. NORTHERN AURORA lacked a rally on
the inside. MADE TO BE LUCKY was off slowly, not a factor. FULL OF MISCHIEF failed to menace.
