PUNX sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the lane and lasted under steady pressure.
MCQUEEN'S BULLITT well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn while drifting in, then angled out in the
stretch, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. SKI PATROL well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. ALPHA PREDATOR allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid
four wide into the lane and flattened out. COOL RUNNINGS stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid
between rivals into the lane and weakened the final furlong.

pack, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. WHATISAY well placed, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside and weakened. GRAYS JUNGLE fractious in the gate, steadily lost ground and was outrun.

Footnotes
MCSTEAMY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in the final
strides. WOODCHUCK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late and held the place.
KOBLA MAS stalked the pace in the early going, angled in to track that one through the second turn, then angled out, bid three wide and lacked the needed
late kick. COMMON BOND rushed up to position into the second turn, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
then weakened late and held a share. CUZ well placed, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had a
mild gain. GOLD CZAR mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. SKYDIVING
allowed to settle, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no rally. BETTER TAPIT rated inside,
faded after a half.

moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, evened out while gaining the place. GOODIE GOOMER allowed to settle, looped up
three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and closed well for the show. GREAT CAMANOE well placed and outside, looped to position
three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. TEMPLET ran evenly. LIKEABLE stalked the pace on the
outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. KICK IT CHARLIE was a brief factor.
