Footnotes
DOUBLE BLESSING well placed and outside, looped to a three wide lead through the second turn, angled in and drew off, then was kept to the task
through the lane. MUTARAAFEQ well placed and inside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not
threaten the winner and held the place. CONGRATS AGAIN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch and closed
well for the show. BLACK LIMO allowed to settle, moved up into the second turn, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, dueled
with a rival and held that one off for a share. AUTHENTIC HEART allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, bid on that path, dueled with
a rival and weakened. WICKED MOMENT well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded.
CREATIVE CHOICE pulled to the lead bearing out, bore out further down the backstretch, then dropped back continuing to get out badly on the far turn.

Footnotes
BACKATYA broke sharply from the gate to stalk the early pace, edged ahead of MINISTER QUINN through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept
to the task. MINISTER QUINN sprinted clear early, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then could not resist the winner while clearly best of the
rest. REGIO allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up outside. MY MAN VITO well placed,
saved ground through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, evened and held a share. SOULFUL SONG allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path
through the turn, came through on that path into the lane and flattened. DAVID'S CUPID mid pack, looped four wide through the turn, bid on that path and
had no rally. PALIMONIUM broke in at the star, lost ground three wide through the turn and had no stretch rally. LOZANO broke out slightly at the start and
was forced to check on heels, then had a wide trip. ON JET HEIR sent from the gate could not stay with the top flight, angled in and faded in the turn.

Footnotes
LEMIEUX sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, sprinted away from a challenge through the second turn, then drew off in the lane under mild urging.
FISH MOONEY mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. BRITTIZ well placed
and outside, gained a striking position outside the leader, bid, drifted in and weakened. RUNAWAY BREEZE mid pack, saved ground on the two path
through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, drifted in and held a share. YES I'M SPITEFUL well placed and inside, lost some ground
through the second turn, angled out bumping a rival for room into the stretch, then could not gain. STRAIGHT TO GO allowed to settle, saved ground on the
two path through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch, was bumped and could not gain. SCIENCE FRICTION broke out at the start, was never
involved.

FATE OF OPHELIA settled off the pace along the inside, advanced between foes around the far turn, swung five in upper stretch, closed outside and was
up in the final strides. CULTURED was very rank at the start, veered out and slammed into SHORT CIRCUIT, prompted the pace two wide, took the lead
near the quarter pole, edged clear near the sixteenth pole and led until the final strides. ISADORABLE AIDA tracked the pace two wide, bid three deep
around the far turn, vied outside of CULTURED through midstretch, had the rider lost the whip near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. MIDNIGHT
BELLA saved ground in range, tipped two wide nearing the lane and finished evenly while lacking room throughout the stretch run. SHORT CIRCUIT was
slammed at the start, raced off the pace two wide, edged closer at the rail around the far turn, was blocked inside to the sixteenth pole, angled out late and
improved belatedly. MADEIRA WINE set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN failed to menace while racing two and
three wide.

Footnotes
MAKE IT BIG broke awkwardly and steadied back to last, tracked the pace inside, angled out into the stretch, brushed with CLAPTON kicking into high gear
in upper stretch, caught LIGHTENING LARRY from outside and drew clear. LIGHTENING LARRY broke in bumping THE GREEN CRUSADER at the start,
was well placed outside, looped up three wide then four wide through the turn, reached the front outside SPUNTACULAR in upper stretch, then drifted out
and was no match for the winner. CLAPTON was bumped lightly at the start, steadied from between horses getting outpaced past the three-eighths, moved
out widest for the drive, brushed lightly with MAKE IT BIG and was outkicked to the finish. SPUNTACULAR stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short
lead a quarter-mile out, then weakened in the stretch. THE GREEN CRUSADER was bumped between horses at the start, shifted out four wide late on the
turn, and had no rally. JUST LEO set the pace inside, fought back when hooked on the turn, but had nothing left late.

Footnotes
FUTURE FLAY broke sharply at the start to stalk the early pace, battled inside SADE PURSE gaining a short lead into the stretch, bumped with that one
and edged further ahead. SADE PURSE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid into the lane, drifted in bumping the
winner and was bested to the wire. YEGUITA QUEEN rated back early, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch
and evened out. BELLA SOFI broke out at the start, set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, stayed on when challenged, then weakened in the
stretch. FASTLIFE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and improved position. WATER WIZARD mid pack, moved up two
and three wide through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and faded. KIZZY mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, then had no
stretch rally. EXAGGERATED MOMENT reared up at the start and had a wide trip. SHES SKY HIGH was no factor. SHE DOESN'T KNOW lunged at the
start, was never involved.
