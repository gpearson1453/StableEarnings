Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN settled between runners at the back, remained between foes then driven two wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied four wide and
drew clear inside the sixteenth pole. WILDER THAN MOST showed speed from inside then dropped back to stalk the pace, tipped three wide in upper
stretch and got up for the place. FERRARIANO sped to the front, cleared and crossed to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, met the challenge from
VIKING PLUNDER around the second bend, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought back into deep stretch and got edged for the place. VIKING PLUNDER
drifted out around the first turn, raced up close then bid outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. COOL YOUR
JETS angled to the inside early, steered out on the far turn and came three wide into the lane and lacked further response. HAPI HAPI went three deep into
the first turn then got floated out by VIKING PLUNDER around the bend, continued outside rivals in the middle stages, exited the far turn two wide and
weakened.

BRIGHT LEAF chased widest up the backstretch, went four then three wide around the turn, rallied to the front in midstretch under right-handed urging and
kicked clear. TOWN BOY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival, took the turn three then two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, led briefly past the eighth pole
but proved no match for the winner. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT allowed to settled in the early going, moved to the inside, exited the bend two wide, angled out
in upper stretch and was along for the show. BIG SWEDE stalked the speed in the two path into the turn, angled down to the rail to save ground and
weakened in the drive. EYE CANDY RANDY sped clear from inside, inched away around the turn, saved ground to the stretch, clung to the lead with a
furlong to go and gave way in the final furlong.

ELEVADO stalked the pace outside a rival, went two wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch, put in a late bid and got up in time. SUMTER got
bumped from outside at the start, set the pace under pressure from inside, inched clear around the turn, led into deep stretch and got nailed at the wire.
BEEF WINSLOW pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader two wide around the turn, could not find the needed late kick and held the show.
TREBBIANO traveled in mid-pack and moved down to the inside, shifted out to the two path around the turn, then tipped out into the stretch and kept on for
a minor award. FIGHT ON RON tracked off the inside, went two then three wide around the turn, sustained an injury late and walked into the van following
the race. RIVIERA CHAMP broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked from inside on the turn and could not rally. ROY C raced off the a pace outside a
rival, traveled two wide around the turn and never made an impact. RAKU FIRING sat off the pace next to ROY C, saved ground to the stretch, then moved
out and could not rally. HANNIGAN angled to the inside on the backstretch, steered to the three path around the turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to
menace. DEL MO got forced in leaving the gate, trailed early on, saved ground to the lane and was not a factor.

CALIFORNIA STREET came away a bit slow then dropped back after taking a bit to get going, moved closer into the turn, bid inside and took over at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared nearing the quarter pole, roused in upper stretch and drew off then coasted in late. SMILEFORME stalked the speed quartet
early on, angled in around the turn, never threatened the winner but was clearly second best. BUTTERED NOODLES vied for command from inside up the
backstretch, took a short lead into the turn, could not contain the winner midway around the bend and flattened to third. PLATINUM EQUITY vied three deep
to the turn, chased the winner four wide into the drive and faded. P R RADIO STAR vied four deep up the backstretch, lost contact and chased the winner
three wide leaving the bend and weakened. ITSTHATTIME vied for command between rivals, dropped back around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
ONE TIMER broke out and bumped rival, hustled between runners and brushed with FORBIDDEN KINGDOM then dueled for command from inside,
cleared that rival around the turn, carried a comfortable lead into the final sixteenth and held well. TIME TO PARTY broke in and bumped leaving the gate,
tracked in the two path through the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied and kept gaining to the wire. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM got bumped on both
sides at the start, brushed with ONE TIMER again early, went up to duel for the lead outside ONE TIMER, lost contact with that rival around the bend,
chased two wide into the stretch and held the show. MISS ALACRITY stumbled and bumped with inner rivals in the beginning, showed early speed four
deep then chased the top pair and angled down to the two path, steered to the rail on the bend and saved ground to the stretch, moved out then shifted
back inside in upper stretch and lacked a bid. BLAME IT ON ROSE bumped at the start, dropped back early, raced along the inside then moved off the rail a
bit on the turn and failed to menace. ROCK THE BELLES showed early speed from inside then got crowded by ONE TIMER early and dropped back off the
pace, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and could not rally.

stretch run to secure the place. DESERT DAWN traveled three then two wide around the first turn, steered to the inside for the second bend, drive along the
inside through the turn and kept on to gain the show honors. CENSORSHIP went five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, raced widest up the

Footnotes
CORNICHE took control early from inside, showed the way to the far turn, tested by ROCKEFELLER around the bend, kicked clear into the stretch and
drew away under strong handling. PAPPACAP forwardly placed off the inside, driven three wide into the stretch and finished willingly to hold the place.
OVIATT CLASS unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally. ROCKEFELLER
raced up close to the outside of CORNICHE, pressured that rival around the far turn, could not match strides into the stretch and waekened. FLYING
DRUMMER stalked the pacesetter from inside, saved ground to the lane and weakened. FINNEUS drifted out around the first turn, raced off the pace, came
three wide into the drive and never responded to urging. JOKER BOY hopped and stumbled at the start, tracked two wide then moved further off the rail,
tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
GRAZENINSTILETTOS ducked in early then got straightened out, split foes around the turn, came three wide into the drive, tipped out upper stretch, flew
late and inhaled the runner up. BIG SUMMER closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter, bid two wide around the turn, cleared in upper stretch, led
into the final sixteenth and was run down by the winner. SPANISH CHANNEL stalked in the two path through the turn, finished willingly but could not
summon the needed late kick to threaten the top pair. PIAZZETTA tracked along the inside to the stretch, moved off the rail approaching the eighth pole and
failed to threaten. AUSTIN JAMES broke out and bumped rival at the start, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, angled in around the bend, tipped out
with three-sixteenths remaining and could not rally. VA VA VOOM off alertly to begin and went for the front, set the pace up the backstretch, pressured from
outside around the bend, held a narrow lead into the stretch and weakened. SHEZ OUR ARCH off slow at the start, went two to three wide into the stretch
and passed tired rivals. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR got bumped from inside at the start, forwardly placed in the beginning, navigated the turn three wide and
faded. SELF ISOLATION chased outside rivals early on, entered the turn five wide, angled down to the three path and could not rally. CHAO MAR lacked
early speed, traveled two to three wide into the stretch and was never a factor. O SHUGAH MINT tracked off the rail or outside a rival, went four wide
through the turn and never responded to urging. LITTLE SUSIE lost her path at the start, took the turn four to five wide, lugged in midstretch and had little
left.
