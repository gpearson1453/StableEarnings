Footnotes
JACKLIGHTING broke out to exchange contact with Mindyourpsandqs then settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and drew to near even
terms three wide approaching the head of the lane, then dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod the final strides. DEPUTY JAMES stalked two
deep, drew to even terms at the seven sixteenths pole and continued close on the far turn, dug in gamely through the lane but relented the nod in the final
strides while beating out LIL TOUGHMAN for second, while the latter rated close inside then took the lead between horses past the three eighths pole,
contested the far turn at even terms nearest the rail, ran briefly clear past the eighth pole but was outfinished the final yards after a game stretch duel.
MINDYOURPSANDQS exchanged contact with Jacklighting leaving the gate and came through the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and raced evenly through the lane. MIKI came away a step slow and was shut off at the break,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE rounded the
opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. WINTER IS HERE set the early pace inside, was met at the
seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened leaving the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
KALENJIN settled off the early pace inside then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead two
deep past the quarter, dueled clear approaching the top of the stretch and dug in under determined handling to hold PLATINUM FROLIC at bay, while the
latter rated a slim lead inside and dug in to clear Until Now at the five sixteenths pole, but was caught at the rail past the quarter, dug in gamely from that
point but grudgingly ceded in the duel through the stretch. UNCAPTURED RUBY rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced toward the
outside into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn off the rail and got up for third the final yards. STAY OUT
raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew close at the quarter pole but started to fade
midway on the far turn. HIGHTIME VALENTINE settled off the pace about the three path, bid into the far turn and raced in the three path through the turn,
left the turn outside and passed rivals. TAKE CHARGE TINA saved ground, showed little response through the backstretch and lacked room at the rail on
the far turn. UNTIL NOW stalked two deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled close from that point but steadied past the five sixteenths
pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn.

BROTHER CORBIN took quick control and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear into the far turn and was
steadily handled through the lane. TWEET THIS settled close inside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn and dug in through the stretch to hold second. MOONLIT NIGHT stalked from the two and three paths, challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
dropped back into the far turn and ran in the three path through the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and was gaining on the runner-up. SASSY KING
raced well off the pace and saved ground, bid past the three eighths pole, angled to the five path through the far turn and improved his position while closing
the gap. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled off the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in
the four path and flattened in the lane. BURN THE SHIPS rated just off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths

Footnotes
SUPER WILDCAT became a bit edgy in the gate then hustled along at even terms through the opening three sixteenths, contested the edge from the three
eighths pole, dueled clear into the stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on. U R THE LUCKY ONE engaged in close chase through the backstretch
and contested at a slim disadvantage two deep on the turn, dropped back into the stretch but came back in later yards and was gaining on the winner.
SENSE OF MUSIC chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and ran evenly through the lane. DAMISELA was bumped
sharply at the start then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five path, was carried out then bumped by YEYETZI into the stretch but finished evenly
outside, while the latter veered outward to make sharp contact with Merry Maid at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, bore
outward to make contact with Damisela into the lane then flattened the final furlong. SLIP SLIDIN gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and proved
empty in the lane. WESTERN MOVIES contested the early pace at even terms then gave chase from the three eighths pole, checked at the rail into the turn
then faded toward the head of the lane. MERRY MAID was bumped sharply outward and into Damisela at the break, picked up the chase outside then
rounded the turn off the rail.
