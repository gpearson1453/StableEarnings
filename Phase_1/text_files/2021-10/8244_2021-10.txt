Footnotes
QUICK SAND AA was raided along 2 wide early, eased out on the turn to make a 4 wide move, drew off on the stretch while being ridden out, much the
best. HIGHH MAINTENANCE was allowed to settle while three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch to finish willingly,
second best. DANCE WITH ME BW vied for the early lead three wide, then made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out, bested rest.
IRIDESSE had no rally while racing six to seven wide throughout. RB GAIM CHANGER chased the pace then was five wide at the quarter pole but came up
empty. CONSIDER THESS was off slowly and hit the gate then rushed to the lead two wide, then faltered the last quarter. ON THE VERGE vied for the
early lead on the inside but then stopped. Race was hand-timed.
