broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along in third position, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while clear for the show. NO DEAL backtracked straight to the gate while accompanied by two ponies then was loaded with the use of a blindfold,

three wide through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on unable to latch on to the winner through the stretch
while chasing her home in close pursuit. CAUSEWAY OF DREAMS four paths off the inside down the backstretch detached from the top pair, tucked to the

shook clear in upper stretch then came under a right-handed crop, was switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and given one pop inside
that pole then placed under a strong hand ride to the wire while best. FAIR REGIS was coaxed along off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, was
driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. MY ROXY GIRL pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path
on the turn, had the rider lose his crop at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened while able to hold the show.
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE steadied while in tight after the start, settled off the pace, traveled around the early portion on the turn in the two path, shifted
four wide while roused for more at the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SHASTA STAR chased the
pace down the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn and tired. SHE'S A BLACK BELT moved around at the start and was off slow, spotted
the front a couple lengths, settled on the outside, was roused four then three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail. CARAGATE veered in at the start bumping RAYMOND ROAD, chased three paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under light coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly
for the place honors. CARBON crossed to the inside after the start and chased along the rail coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RAYMOND ROAD bumped at the start by the veering in CARAGATE, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SWEET MAEVE tossed her head as the
latch was sprung and lunged from the gate conceding six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside until tipped to the
two path at the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide for home and passed tired rivals. TAKI broke in at the start, chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, continued along the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. WRITE THE CHECK three wide in pursuit down the backstretch,
went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. INKBLOT chased two
to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CHARLIE FIVE O broke out at the start, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, inched away into the final furlong and held under strong urging. GLORY ROAD broke
a bit awkwardly, settled towards the rear under some urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and finished with good energy
to garner the place. POWER UP PAYNTER disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, battled under a
drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. HANDY was ridden along off the pace, went three to four wide
on the turn, barely slipped past inside the injured foe around the five-sixteenths and finished with late. PRINCE JAMES brushed with a rival at the start then
was hustled, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed kick.
DEVIOUS MO settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RACE CRAFT brushed with an opponent at the start, dropped
well back while lacking speed, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide and was no factor. FOREVER WICKED dropped back to the rear on
the outside then angled to the rail, saved ground on the turn, lost action badly against the rail outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. STRIKING
SPEED was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of two rivals under urging, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and capitulated. ADVANCE NOTICE chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, went wrong passing the five-sixteenths and suffered an
injury to his left foreleg then was vanned off.
