MEROKEE dueled inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, remained clear and was ridden out. ARANJUEZ dueled outside for
the lead, chased the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held well for the place award. ON HIS TOES chased two wide, came three
wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and bested the others. TAPATERM chased close up on the rail, continued evenly inside and lacked a winning bid.
JUST CHECKING IN was steadied after the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch and gained mildly. SUMMER BOSS chased
three wide, chased on the turn and weakened. THE COLGATE KID steadied after the start, raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. BUENAS
