Footnotes
TIZ SUSAN ANN was asked for speed early, tracked the leader down the backstretch and into the turn, bid two wide outside of QUEEN'S MISSION past the
three eighths, headed that foe past the quarter pole, and drew off while kept to the task. RONAN was bumped hard by LADY ATLANTIC in the opening
strides and bumped HOOSIER GOLD CASE as a result, settled at the rear, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, began to take closer order past the
three eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, continued to rally while drifting out and was up in time for the place. STACK SHACK tracked the leading
pair early, settled back to chase outside of LADY ATLANTIC past the nine sixteenths, offered a three wide bid approaching the quarter, proved no match for
TIZ SUSAN ANN into the lane, chased on but lost the place in the final strides. LADY ATLANTIC broke out and bumped RONAN soundly in the opening
strides, chased the leading trio early, chased inside of STACK SHACK in the two path on the turn, and lacked the needed kick three to four wide in the lane.
HOOSIER GOLD CASE was bumped soundly by RONAN in the opening strides as a result of LADY ATLANTIC breaking inward, settled near the rear, was
keen to take closer order past the the nine sixteenths, saved ground around the turn, and had no rally in the lane. QUEEN'S MISSION was sent inside for
pace, led down the backstretch and while saving ground around the turn, was engaged by TIZ SUSAN ANN to her outside past the three eighths, headed
past the quarter pole, and weakened inside.

Footnotes
NUMERO PRIMO was sent for speed, soon led, saved ground on the turn, turned back IRISH TUFF when driven in upper stretch and increased his
advantage under a drive. IRISH TUFF was lightly bumped by CHOCOLATE BUNNY in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair three wide early,
continued to track three wide on the turn, bid on that pair past the three eighths, loomed in upper stretch, proved no match for NUMERO PRIMO but chased
on a clear second best. KING'S STORY was off sharply and asked for speed but outsprinted to the top by NUMERO PRIMO, tracked the pace two wide on
the turn, proved no match for NUMERO PRIMO and IRISH TUFF from upper stretch, but chased on well enough to cling to the show. BRIANS WAY chased
midfield down the backstretch and in the three path between horses on the turn, kept on three to four wide in the lane and was outkicked three deep for the
show. BLOOMING GARDEN tracked the leading pair between horses early, saved ground midfield around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, chased
on but was ultimately outfinished between horses late. MAGA COUNTRY broke out and bumped KING ZION in the opening strides, settled near the rear
inside, chased in the three path toward the rear on the turn, passed a few foes in upper stretch but ultimately lacked the needed kick to be a threat.
CHOCOLATE BUNNY broke out and lightly bumped IRISH TUFF in the opening strides, settled near the rear outside, was urged in the four path on the turn
and driven into the lane, but lacked the needed rally. ROCKET RIDE soon lost touch with the field, was driven in the three path in upper stretch, angled
further out and passed tiring foes five wide. KING ZION was bumped by MAGA COUNTRY in the opening strides, settled at the rear of the main group,
raced in the five path on the turn and offered no bid. HIDE AND RUN AWAY tracked the leading pair early, settled back to midfield approaching the turn,
continued to lose ground gradually around the bend and did not rally in the lane.

Footnotes
OEUVRE soon led, set the pace in the two path on the turn, began to draw further clear when hand ridden in upper stretch, went to a brief drive near the
furlong mark, but was allowed to cruise home from just past the eighth pole and won wrapped up. BURNING BUSH settled toward the rear outside, chased
in the five to six path near the rear on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane and was driven, responded with a rally, proved no match for the winner but
outfinished BROOKWOOD HILLS for the place. BROOKWOOD HILLS broke slightly awkwardly and was slow into stride, advanced between horses past
the seven sixteenths, swung six wide into the lane, rallied with interest but was outkicked for the place by BURNING BUSH. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE tracked
the early pace outside of FABULOUS PHILLY, tracked the pace between horses into the turn, was urged in the two to three path past the three eighths but
proved no match for OEUVRE, was driven into the lane, could not keep OEUVRE in her sights, and was outfinished in the final furlong. FABULOUS PHILLY
was bumped by WANDA STRONG in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair between horses early, inched forward inside of BLAZE AWAY N HIDE to
track the pace into the turn, hugged the rail around the bend, swung out three wide into the lane for the drive, and flattened out. TENSE settled inside foes
toward the rear, continued at the inside of the rear group in the two to three path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane and lacked the needed rally.
HEY MA tracked the leading pair three wide down the backstretch and into the turn, continued to track the leading pair in the three path around the bend,
swung into the lane five wide, and flattened out. WANDA STRONG broke out and bumped FABULOUS PHILLY in the opening strides, tracked the leading
pair inside of that foe early, chased the tracking flight into the turn, raced in the three path around the bend, and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS settled near the rear, continued patiently down the backstretch, began to rally into the far turn, improved four wide on the bend,
swung out toward the center of the track in upper stretch, sustained his rally, led past the sixteenth mark and cleared. UNBURNT hung five wide into the
clubhouse turn, advanced to engage outside the leading pair approaching the three quarters, cleared past the eleven sixteenths, set the pace while clear in
the two path on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was headed from the inside by CHARLIECANDO past the three sixteenths, kept on willingly three
wide, could not hold off ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS but came back on CHARLIECANDO late for the place. CHARLIECANDO floated four wide into the
clubhouse turn, tracked the leading quad through that bend, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, was driven in upper stretch
and responded with a bid, dropped inside of UNBURNT, took the lead inside of that foe past the three quarters, but was caught by
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS past the sixteenth and flattened. MCRAGS settled toward the rear, improved three wide down the backstretch, raced four wide
into the far turn and sustained his bid, swung six wide into the lane, kept on willingly but was outkicked. DRAW THE LINE settled toward the rear inside,
early, improved between horses down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, angled inward approaching the quarter and was driven inside in
upper stretch, continued to rally, loomed inside through midstretch, but was outfinished in the final furlong. EGOMANIAC settled at the rear, took closer
order while angled out and urged around the far turn, rallied between horses in the lane and passed tiring foes. MAC PANDOWDY chased midfield early,
was relegated toward the rear into the far turn, improved three wide near the three eighths, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch and ultimately lacked
the needed kick. CONI'S COUP raced at the inside of the leading flight early, settled back to track the leading pair near the thirteen sixteenths, chased
inside foes down the back straight, lost position inside around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and came up empty. SKIP THE SMALLTALK raced
between horses in the leading flight into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair into the backstretch and down the back straight, was outpaced between
horses around the far turn and had nothing further for the stretch. STAR OF STARS raced three wide with the leading flight into the first turn, tracked the
pace into the backstretch once UNBURNT took over, emptied out inside around the far turn and was no further factor.

Footnotes
SUPER SILVER tracked well behind the leading pair, was pushed along into the far turn and took closer order in the four path, went to a drive near the
quarter and sustained a grinding rally, and got up in time outside of RIVER FINN. RIVER FINN pressed the pace outside of WILD FOX, took the lead
outside that foe near the five sixteenths, brushed with WILD FOX in upper stretch and vied outside him, headed WILD FOX for good near the sixteenths, but
was caught by SUPER SILVER late. WILD FOX was sent for speed, set the pace while pressured by RIVER FINN to his outside, was headed by that foe
near the five sixteenths, dug in, brushed with RIVER FINN while vying in upper stretch, lost the lead to RIVER FINN for good at the sixteenth and
weakened. ABUELO NUNO settled at the rear of the main pack two wide around the clubhouse turn, continued at the rear of the main group down the
backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch, ran on willingly but missed the show. THE LAST OPTION settled at
the rear of the main pack inside of ABEULO NUNO through the clubhouse turn, inched forward to chase inside of SMILING SILAS down the back straight,
continued in the two path on the far turn inside of that foe, improved into upper stretch and was in range past midstretch but flattened out late. MANGO
TREE settled at the rear, raced in the five path approaching the far turn, swung out six wide into upper stretch, and took closer order while all out. SMILING
SILAS chased midpack through the clubhouse turn, continued midfield outside of THE LAST OPTION down the back straight and in the three path on the
far turn, and proved empty three wide under a drive in the lane. DARK WOOD (IRE) settled near the rear, raced in the three path down the backstretch,
offered no rally on the far turn and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
JIMMY D tracked the leader outside of RADIANT CASTLE through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair into the back straight, took closer order
down the backstretch, prompted three wide briefly approaching the nine sixteenths, tracked the leading pair while three wide around the far turn, was driven
near the three eighths, engaged three wide near the five sixteenths, took over under a drive with three sixteenths remaining, and increased his advantage
while slightly drifting out. ONE WAY HOME was hustled clear, took prompting from RADIANT CASTLE to his outside from approaching the nine sixteenths,
led clearly again into the far turn, set the pace in the two path, was engaged by RADIANT CASTLE and JIMMY D to his outside approaching the five
sixteenths, tried to go with JIMMY D under a drive in upper stretch, proved no match from the three sixteenths, but kept on well enough to hold the place.
CAMPIONI chased the leading trio inside, raced in range in the four to five path around the far turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, kept on under
a drive, could not match JIMMY D, kept on willingly but narrowly missed catching him for the place. PISTOL BOX settled toward the rear early, continued
patiently down the back straight and into the far turn, began to take closer order approaching the three eighths while racing four wide, swung out seven wide
into upper stretch, and improved belatedly. KREWE CHIEF settled in second last through the clubhouse turn, inched forward inside of HIGH SPIRITS
toward the rear down the backstretch, made an inside bid past the nine sixteenths, improved to track the leading pair in the three to four path on the far turn,
and could not sustain his bid into the lane. BOURBON WISDOM leapt slightly out of the gate, chased midpack, raced inside of TORNADO BOY down the
back straight, chased in the two path around the far turn, was driven inside into the lane but outfinished. TORNADO BOY chased outside of CAMPIONI
through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase outside of BOURBON WISDOM down the back straight, kept on midfield in the four path around the far turn,
and lacked the needed kick three wide in upper stretch. RADIANT CASTLE tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn and into the back straight, inched
closer past the eleven sixteenths, briefly prompted the pace near the nine sixteenths, tracked ONE WAY HOME into the turn, engaged again while in tight
between horses near the five sixteenths, and came up empty between horses in upper stretch. HIGH SPIRITS broke slightly awkwardly, settled toward the
rear, raced outside of KREWE CHIEF down the back straight, flattened back to second last in the four path on the far turn, swung to the eight path in upper
stretch and never threatened. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT settled at the rear, trailed in the five to six path around the far turn, swung out to the ten path in upper
stretch for the drive, and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE was urged along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, continued in a prolonged skirmish for command into the lane gaining
a brief advantage, and met the challenge of DANVILLE to prevail by a nod on the wire under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the first flight three
deep racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling between foes on the far turn, then steadily gained position between rivals racing through
the stretch to challenge for command late but just lost the nod. THE GREEN MO'STER was urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue to upper stretch but yielded to the winner late. RIVER CACTUS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the inside
racing into the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch continuing with interest but lost some momentum when forced to alter course nearing midstretch.
BULLDOG OF BERGEN, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn, faded into upper stretch. CURLINGTON, off slowly, settled last
to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the backstretch to make brief, four wide progress to the far turn but soon emptied out. DOWNTOWNER settled
while angling to the inside in early stages but failed to menace. SHELL FIRE faded early.

Footnotes
LEE'S LUCK broke sharply to gain the advantage while angling inwards to set the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail, responded to firm
handling to turn back challengers racing into upper stretch and edged clear under brisk handling. PRESIDENT ELECT settled along the inside dropping well
off the leaders racing to the turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late to edge rivals for the place honors nearing the wire.
KILLEEN tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals
for a share while outkicked for second. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL, urged along three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue into upper
stretch but weakened late. COME ON DOVER, forwardly placed inside the leader prompting that foe into the turn, came up empty leaving midstretch. BORA
BORA angled inwards tracking off the second flight racing into the turn and continued evenly between foes to late stages. RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT
pinched, then shuffled back at the start, raced wide into the turn and offered no rally. TRE LEE DIVINE tracked off the second flight between foes racing into
the turn and offered no rally. MAXIMUS IMAGE, off slowly, was settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid.
TIMINGISEVERYTHING proved no factor.
