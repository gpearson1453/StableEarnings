Footnotes
SOMES SOUND set the pace from the outset, raced along the rail through the turn then drew away down the lane while ridden out and geared down in the
final stages. TOOBADSOSAD trailed the field early on, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, moved up in the stretch run
while no match for the winner and just up for place at the wire. CATIPARI was steadied back shortly after leaving the gate, chased the pace early, raced in
the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid for place in the final stages but just missed. SHIPPINGPORT tracked the pace
early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the three path into the lane, weakened late in the stretch and just missed place at the wire. BOLD
ADVENTURE was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. SMART TIME was done early.

ADVANTAGE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive for place down the lane and prevailed at the wire.
DONTNEEDANAME tracked the pace early, raced in the three path entering the lane, was under a long drive down the lane for place but just missed at the
wire. AMERICAIN JOEY chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME chased the
pace early, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. BAQUERO FLIES was slow at the start and never a factor. ORO DE

Footnotes
BEVERLY PARK pressed the pace three wide early on, bid outside of TUMBLING SKY into the turn, vied around the bend, then drew off in upper stretch,
and held sway under driving pressure from an inner rival through the final furlong. FUTILE settled off of the pace along the inside, improved into the turn,
chased the leading pair while under a drive around the bend, then shifted off of the railing to surpass the early pace setter for place in upper stretch while
proving no match for the leader. THIRSTY BETRAYAL tracked along the inside, chased from the three path around the turn, changed lead in upper stretch
while getting outkicked for place, then kept on evenly thereafter. ALEX'S STRIKE was allowed to settle at the back of the pace, saved ground far off of the
pace around the turn, and stayed on well through the lane. TUMBLING SKY set the pace, vied inside of BEVERLY PARK around the turn, but proved no
match for that foe entering the lane, and weakened. ARTIE'S LADY failed to factor. TWO DOT never got involved. WEAPON was outrun. HUGH B. chased
two wide and between horses early on, but failed to keep pace approaching the half mile pole, and wilted between horses around the turn.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SAINT broke inwardly and bumped LEAGUE OF SHADOWS into GOALIE at the start, chased the pace three wide while just off, produced a
bid for the lead at the furlong pole, forged an advantage passing that marker, and held from a rallying MIDNIGHT PATRIOT late. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT
tracked two wide, shift five wide approaching the furlong grounds, changed leads at that marker and quickened noticeably, rallied to produce a late bid, but
missed on the wire. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds before getting outkicked by an outer rival,
then kept on between horses to reach show late, and saved that position from a pair of outer foes. NATURAL POWER (IRE) settled far back two wide,
swung six wide entering the lane, got floated nine wide in midstretch, then stayed on mildly while widest of all, but missed show. GOALIE was pinched back
between horses at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field around the turn, shifted five wide and between horses in upper stretch before getting
floated eight wide in midstretch, then stayed on between horses to miss show. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start,
vied two wide, briefly failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, produced a re-bid in midstretch while getting outkicked by an outer foe,
then weakened late. SOUPER DORMY settled off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but got floated six wide while between horses
in midstretch, then failed to menace. AMERICAN MANDATE stalked along the inside, but lacked kick to split foes in upper stretch, got outkicked by outer
foes in midstretch while encountering mild traffic trouble, then faded. TOHUI broke a bit outwardly, set the pace along the inside, briefly cleared in upper
stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, and faltered.

Footnotes
SUPER QUICK set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a bidding FROST POINT in upper stretch, dug in when that foe re-bid in the late stages, and
held gamely. FROST POINT tracked from midpack, rallied four wide around the far turn to range up to a leading SUPER QUICK in upper stretch, but hung
on her left lead in upper stretch which allowed for that foe to inch clear, quickened after changing leads entering the final furlong, narrowed the leader's
margin under extremely vigorous urging late, but missed reaching that foe on the wire. TELLMEONASUNDAY pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep
pace with the leader entering the lane while getting outmoved by an outer foe, then faded in upper stretch, but just saved show. BOW BOW GIRL settled far
off of the pace, shifted to the four path into the far turn before tucking to the two path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss show on the wire.
DISTORTED VERVE trailed two to three wide around the turns, and improved through the lane. DAME CINCO tracked four to three wide around the turn,
but faded entering the lane. MS V TIME lied far off of the pace two to five wide, and failed to factor. TRUMPET LILLY stalked three wide, but weakened
between horses around the far turn. BLUE LILY stalked along the inside, fought with the rider while unsettled in the pocket down the backstretch, then
weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) allowed THREATLEVELMIDNIGHT (GB) to clear off, shifted to the two path to press that foe from the outside into the turn, bid
turning for home, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, shifted ground outwards a bit when the rider changed to left handed urging in midstretch,
and drove clear. BULLSEYE BEAUTY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked the pace from the two path while inside of a pair of foes, tipped three
wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader home, and reached place in the final sixteenth. NAVRATILOVA tracked four wide, but failed to
keep pace with the leaders while getting floated five wide my BULLSEYE BEAUTY entering the lane, then kept on through the final furlong to regain a minor
placing. LADY EDITH lied off of the pace two wide, then chased between horses through the alne. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) set the pace along the
inside, felt stern pressure from ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) around the turn before being headed by that foe passing the quarter pole, proved no match for that
rival in midstretch, then faltered inside of foes late. RISKY REWARD stalked three wide, but faded after being floated four wide entering the lane. AMALFI
PRINCESS settled far off of the pace, mildly picked up stride while shifting two to three wide around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, but lacked a
rally. NEW BOSS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. NO MO' SPENDING bumped with an outer foe at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
JERUSALEMA stalked two wide, then from between horses turning for home, bumped an outer foe while shifting three wide in upper stretch, then stayed on
as the leaders noticeably tired, and got up late. UR MAKIN ME BLUSH lied close up along the inside, bid for the lead inside a pair of foes at the half mile
pole, failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, faded around the bend, but sustained stride through the final furlong as the leaders tired, split foes in
the late stages, but was outfinished by an outer rival. MY ZIP ZIP was brushed by an outer foe at the start, took the turn in the three to four path while far off
of the pace, but bolted to the ten path entering the lane, then somehow was regathered, rallied well through the final furlong, but did not have enough to
catch the leaders. REID'S FANGIRL vied three to two wide, led passing the furlong pole, but tired between horses late. DAWSON SPRINGS bumped with
an outer foe at the start, set the pace between horses at the half mile pole, then only inside of REID'S FANGIRL around the turn, but was headed by that foe
at the furlong grounds, and yielded. KEINO stalked three wide, but was bumped by an inner foe in upper stretch, and faded. SPLIT DECISION chased from
midpack in the three to four paths around the turn, and failed to menace. TINSEL broke a bit inwardly, and failed to factor. MAYSVILLE MISS tracked along
the inside, but was done early. BANNED FROM MIDWAY never got involved. JILLIAN'S STAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, but was quickly
outrun, pulled up around the turn, dismounted and untacked approaching the quarter pole, and was vanned off.
