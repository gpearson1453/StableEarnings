Footnotes
REALIST (GB) rated mid pack, improved to third on the backstretch, gave chase and closed on the final turn, drew off easily after final hurdle. PARISH
DELIGHT (IRE) rallied, ridden close at the final hurdle yet no match for the winner. PROJECT TWO (IRE) traveled always close up and stayed on well.
FAST VISION (FR) raced up with the pace, giving good effort throughout, weakening in the stretch. GHOSTLIGHTER rated held up and was never a threat.
CIRCUS led with a big lead from the start, was pressed at the final hurdle and stumbled over that one unseating the rider. FOG BOUND showed speed for
the first circuit saving ground, then tired and was pulled up. ELUSIVE was pulled up after one circuit.
