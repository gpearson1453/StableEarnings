Footnotes
STELLA MARIE broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace just off the inside on a narrrow advantage, repelled a rival's challenge leaving the turn and
held sway through the lane under firm handling. LADY EXPRESS drifted outwards into the path of LIL BIT TIPSEY in the opening stages, was collected,
then held up along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out to split foes nearing upper stretch, shifted to the four path in the lane and continued with interest
to gain the place honors. JUKEBOX MONEY stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final bid while prevailing for a share. WINNING QUALITY hit the gate, then hesitated at the start losing position to the field, switched out three wide
midway through the backstretch while being urged to advance, lodged a brief bid in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. MY WIFE
IS BOSS tracked just off the pacesetter outside rivals in opening stages, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch.
LIL BIT TIPSEY, carried out a bit in early stages, was steadied a bit between foes nearing the turn and soon faded.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL was bumped by MIZ CLIPPER in the opening strides, pressed inside of RUBY Y'ALL Early, took the lead near the five eighths and
edged clear soon thereafter, sett the pace in the two path on the turn, drew clear in upper stretch and continued to draw off under a mild drive. RUBY Y'ALL
held a narrow lead in the opening furlong while prompted by GO STORMIN GIRL to her inside, stalked that foe from the five eighths, continued to stalk in
the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for GO STORMIN GIRL, but chased on well enough to stay safe for the place.
ENCHILADA settled between horses in the rear flight, chased well behind the leading trio in the four path on the turn, swung into the six path in upper
stretch, and chased on mildly for show. MIZ CLIPPER broke outward and bumped GO STORMIN GIRL in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the
rear flight down the backstretch, raced in the two path with the rear flight around the turn, was driven in the two to three path in upper stretch, and lacked the
needed kick. NEW RULES was bumped by IRISH HALO in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, continued to track in range in
the four path on the turn, proved no match for the top two while racing in the four path in upper stretch, and flattened out. IRISH HALO came out in the
opening strides and bumped NEW RULES, settled three wide in the rear flight early, continued in the four to five path with the rear flight on the turn while
driven, and offered no response.

Footnotes
EASTER MUSIC tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under pressure. BEL BIMBO, brushed at the start, settled between foes racing through the backstretch,
swung out gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, was fanned six wide midstretch and continued with interest to gain second at the wire. RIPE
ATTACK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch but faltered in late stages while
finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. SEEK N JUSTICE joined the pace four wide on the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders on the turn
but continued willingly three wide into the stretch to close the gap but yielded to the top pair late. LONG STATION broke readily, was eased off the pace
after the opening sixteenth, shifted out entering the lane and made a belated bid four wide between foes to close the gap. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL broke
inwards brushing a rival at the start, was settled outside foes, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch to gain position inside foes into the lane, then was
forced to alter course avoiding close quarters nearing the wire. INSTANT WAR, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace racing into the turn,
gave way after a half. GREELEYS ICE, urged between foes pressing the pace, dueled outside a rival to upper stretch and gave out late.

CLOSE TO ME, pulling against restraint along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, bid for command along the rail when
presented an opening nearing upper stretch, altered course midstretch to bid between foes and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. CHAINMAIL
settled last while angling to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, split foes to
bid three deep nearing the furlong marker while shying a bit from the eventual winner midstretch but was just outkicked while prevailing for the place honors.
SATIATE sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, resisted the winner's challenge racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards under
pressure midstretch and yielded to the top pair late. PRESENT OF HERO tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out
last on the far turn, angled inside rivals entering the stretch to gain some position but had no rally. WATCHIN THE WHEELS tracked off the second flight
between foes, shifted out racing into upper stretch and soon gave way. SILVERA, urged to a forward placing attending a rival's pace in the opening half,
was urged to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but emptied out abruptly in upper stretch.

MIZ BLUE was soon clear, was engaged by SPLASH CASH near the five eighths, took brief pressure from that foe before clearing again approaching the
half, set the pace comfortably while saving ground around the turn, was pushed along past the three eighths and opened up further, and continued to draw
off while ridden out and being intermittently shown the crop. SPLASH CASH was keen early while tracking MIZ BLUE, prompted the leader from the five
eighths until near the half mile mark, tracked two wide on the turn, was driven near the five sixteenths, proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane,
chased under a drive and had just enough to hold the place. WAR COLORS settled at the rear, began to take closer order in the two path on the turn while
urged, rallied between horses in upper stretch, sustained her gain well in the two path and narrowly missed the place inside of SPLASH CASH. MS SASSY
ATITUDE tracked the leading pair, chased in the two path on the turn far behind the leading pair, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed
rally. AIKEN TO BE tracked the leading pair outside of MS SASSY ATTITUDE, was driven in the four path well behind the leading pair, came four wide into
upper stretch, and proved empty.

RIVER CACTUS broke readily, conceded the lead to track the pacesetter along the rail as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out three
wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, continued in a prolonged drive between foes and just edged DANVILLE on the wire under firm
left handed encouragement. The latter shifted inwards to track just off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in
tandem with that foe while being fanned four wide into upper stretch and continued with a sustained drive to challenge for command late while just failing to
best the winner. ADMIRAL RETURNS settled well off the field a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through the stretch
and found his best stride in the closing stages to prevail for a share between foes. CURLINGTON settled in the last flight, switched out racing into the
backstretch, raced wide into the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. THE GREEN MO'STER,
urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival leaving the far
turn and weakened in the drive. LAST PROMISE, in touch prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, dueled to upper
stretch and gave out late. SOUL COAXING tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch while a bit rank under restraint, shifted four wide after a
half to lodge a brief bid in that path on the far turn but flattened out entering the lane. BULLDOG OF BERGEN angled inwards tracking off the second flight
racing to the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
W W SCOUT'S HONOR broke out and bumped HURRICANE HIGHWAY in the opening strides, sent clear, set the pace while saving ground around the
turn, opened up further under a drive in upper stretch and held safe all the way under firm handling. HURRICANE HIGHWAY was bumped by W W
SCOUT'S HONOR in the opening strides, settled at the rear early, joined outside FIREMAN OSCAR nearing the half, improved while pushed along in the
four path around the turn, raced five wide into the lane, sustained his rally and got up for the place. AGGRESSIVITY tracked the leading pair down the
backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, came into the lane inside, proved no match for W W SCOUT'S HONOR from upper stretch, kept on
willingly inside under a drive, but lost the place in the final strides. FIREMAN OSCAR settled near the rear early, raced at the rear along the rail around the
bend, took closer order past the three eighths, shifted three wide in upper stretch, waited behind the tracking line, gained between horses three wide past
the sixteenth mark but missed the place. GOING WITH STYLE was squeezed off between horses in the opening strides, chased three wide down the
backstretch, tracked the leading pair three wide on the turn, raced four wide into the stretch, kept on with interest between horses but was ultimately
outkicked for the place. HIDE THE DEMON was reluctant to load, broke sharply but settled back to track W W SCOUT'S HONOR down the backstretch and
two wide on the turn, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, chased on under a drive two wide but was outfinished in the final furlong. MERLIN'S
SONG broke outward, chased between horses early, steadied near the half mile mark and began to drop back, lost ground in the three path on the turn, was
driven four wide in upper stretch and came up empty.

SPINSTER ROAD, bumped by HURRICANE JAKE at the start, was righted to track off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, steadily gained
momentum nearing upper stretch, split rivals just off the inside leaving the furlong marker, then took over and went clear under firm encouragement. MAGIC
MAN'S TOUCH angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the leaders between foes racing into the turn, shifted out four wide entering the
stretch, couldn't match the winner's kick but edged rivals to prove best of the others. BEE HAPPY ATTACK, urged to a forward placing in the three path
pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, moved to close the gap nearing midstretch but couldn't sustain that effort through the last furlong. CHANGE
DIRECTION, caught in tight quarters, then held up at the start, settled well off the leaders, shifted out racing into upper stretch and improved position four
wide between foes. SKIP THE SMALLTALK broke outwards bumping HURRICANE JAKE, was righted, then settled along the rail, tipped out racing past
midstretch and continued evenly in late stages. UPBEAT MELODY was hustled to the lead while angling inside, set the pace on a clear margin to upper
stretch but faltered leaving the furlong marker. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was settled into stride off the inside, then was fanned six wide in late stages while
under pressure to advance but made no impact. CRANKSHAFT tracked just off the leaders three wide between racing into the turn, couldn't maintain
striking distance racing into the lane and drifted inwards through the closing stages. J Z'S LAST TRY tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing to
the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. RAHFEE TOWN angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter inside foes in second flight
racing into the bend and gave way into upper stretch. HURRICANE JAKE, bumped, then forced into the eventual winner at the start, dropped out early.
