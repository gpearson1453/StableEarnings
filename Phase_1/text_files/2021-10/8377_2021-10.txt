horses. ORGANZA slow early lagged to upper stretch rallying late in the three and four paths to be right there at the wire. JANSELLE sent clear set the pace
being collared on the inside on the far turn battling through the stretch matching strides to the wire. COACH MACHEN raced mid pack coming six wide into
upper stretch angling eight wide under left hand urging surging to be right there at the end. ASTROMELIA slow early lost ground to upper stretch being
carried from the seven to the nine path while surging late. CARA LUCIA advanced on the backside chasing on the far turn looming in upper stretch coming
up a bit short near mid track. TAILADIOS faded into the far turn. ECLIPTICALS VISKI had brief speed then gave way on the backside.

TRUE PURPOSE sent clear set the pace racing off the inside to upper stretch angling back in late holding under a drive. SUNDAY IN L B C chased the
pace being held out wide to upper stretch extending in drive vying willingly to wire. S S ALTERNATE chased the pace to upper stretch angling out in mid
stretch gaining late. HELLO MY HALO in tight at the break was rushed early, gained on the turn bidding on the inside down the lane being out finished.
NEVER FOREVER raced mid pack moving evenly down the lane. HELLCAT WARRIOR played no factor. SPECIAL BLUE chased close up through the turn
then faded on the rail down the lane. CYBER AFFAIR was always outrun.
