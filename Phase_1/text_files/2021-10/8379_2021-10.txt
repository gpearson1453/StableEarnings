Footnotes
ORAZIO rated inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out and bid into the stretch, then lugged in slightly under left hand urging and edged up.
DAHOG stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch gaining a
short lead, then was outfinished in the late going. BANDY'S MAP well placed, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. CROW MOON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then weakened late.

LONGSHADOW well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide exchanging bumps with a rival, then dueled, shook clear of that one
and edged up in the final strides. NOBALS stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, shook clear, then was
outfinished. CLOUD PLAY mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled in quickly, made a steady gain
and lacked the needed late kick. THE PENINSULA allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. CHAMPION BY DESIGN never far back, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide exchanging bumps with a rival,
dueled with that one and flattened out. CENTER MID MADDIE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane
and weakened. SAN COSTANTINO rated on the lead, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. RUNAWAY BREEZE
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and improved his position. MARK THE MOOSE was no factor. A CLAIM OF FOUL

Footnotes
WHOOPS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and drew off late.
HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match and held the place. THREE O ONE tracked
the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path and flattened out. BOARDWALK BOB never far back, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. SMILES OF JOY allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide
through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. CHARLIE'S TRAFFIC mid pack, looped up three wide through the
second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened. SHARP'S FLASH well placed and inside, steadily lost ground. POWERFUL POINT lunged, then
ducked in at the start and was no factor.
