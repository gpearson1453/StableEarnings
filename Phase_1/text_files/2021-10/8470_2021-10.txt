between horses in upper stretch being brushed by rival late getting up on the wire for place. NOT SHY stalked the pace bidding clear on the far turn angling
out toward mid track in upper stretch then back inside late brushing rival near the wire. WILMORE raced evenly vying from mid track down the lane needing
more there. DELIA'S PRIDE played no factor. PEACH BELLINI stalked the early pace giving way on the far turn. SEGOVIANA set the early pace then wilted
along the inside on the far turn.
