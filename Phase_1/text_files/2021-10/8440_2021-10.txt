Footnotes
BULLET SPEED showed brief speed then stalked the duel, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied, swept to the lead in the final furlong and held sway
under a hand ride. SEA SCOUT was steadied just out, trailed to the stretch then rallied gamely and was just up for place. LACOUGRA dueled, shook clear
upper stretch, was all out but was passed in the final furlong and lost the place position on the wire. STEEL WOOL settled off the pace, chased two-wide on
the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished gamely. TWICE AS SMART stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn then finished
under a determined drive. VIEW FROM EGBERT dueled, was headed upper stretch and gave way after a brief chase. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT raced in
mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide on the turn but flattened out mid stretch. PERFECT GENTLEMAN was away slowly and settled off the pace,
chased three-wide on the turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
SUN DADDY stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied determinedly, led a furlong out and held under a drive. VIATURE settled
off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the far turn, floated out at the top of the stretch, rallied gamely but hung late. HELL BENT settled off the pace,
closed along the rail and two-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely but in vain. AMMUNITION broke slowly, got up quickly to force the pace, bid into the
far turn, dueled, drifted out at the top of the stretch then evened out in the late stages. BEYOND MY DREAMS pulled to an early lead, set the pace, dueled
on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was quickly passed and faded. FIFTH SEASON, in range, chased four-wide on the far turn but was
unable to threaten in the stretch. BIRCHMOUNT RD stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally. THRU THE VINE
pressed the pace on the 1st turn and through the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and trailed home.

Footnotes
HIT AND RUN brushed with LA CROIX VALMER at the start, closed between foes for the lead, drop back on the turn, re-rallied and got up in time. RIDE
THE WIND raced between rivals in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, was outside the leader in the stretch but was outkicked late.
HATMAKER HOLIDAY was four-wide pressing the leader, gained the lead at the top of the4 stretch and moved clear at the 1/8th pole but was caught on the
wire. HARD STREET was three-wide and pressing the pace, held a brief lead late turn, was headed in the stretch but fought on gamely. NO WHAMMIE,
three-wide in mid pack, was fanned four-wide at the top of the stretch but closed well late. LA CROIX VALMER broke awkwardly, trailed into the turn and
closed mildly down the lane. TRADING BAY was shuffled back early turn, made a mild run upper stretch then leveled off 70 yards out. FOURTEEN DAYS
was inside the duel early, was taken back at the turn, raced in mid pack and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DAWSON SILVER led quickly and set a reserved pace, turned back SON OF MY FATHER late on the backstretch, widened a little in the stretch and held
sway under light handling. NORTHERN CONQUEST raced in striking range, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch
and gained steadily under a determined drive. SUIGU STAR settled off the pace, closed five then four-wide on the final turn and continued to rally outside.
KOMUNIST raced from off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SON OF MY FATHER
showed early speed, pressed the pace, posted a brief bid mid way through the backstretch and dropped back to resume stalking, took another run at the
pacesetter on the far turn but lacked a closing response in the stretch. DR. JEWEL was rated in mid pack, rode the rail throughout and finished evenly.
GRAND GIZMO stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but tired upper stretch. DOC FISHMAN was pinched back just out of the gate,
settled in mid pack, was under a ride but falling back on the far turn, then lacked a closing response. AFLEET EDDIE raced in mid pack, was hustled
four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. L'ETAT (GER) raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, was steadied approaching
the stretch and lacked a rally. PER RULING FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, KOMUNIST WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
