Footnotes
HIAB AL ZAMAN was unhurried early early, moved up two wide around the far turn, raced near the rail in the drive and finished well to get up under steady
handling. FLEET DE SAND showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced just off the inside in the lane and couldn't hold off the winner late to finish
second best. BIG BEN AA settled off the early going, raced four wide around the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and closed in well in
the final stages. HIGHH MAINTENANCE was allowed to settled early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. RB
GAME OVER dropped back early, veered out near the eighth pole while under left handed urging, raced in the four path in the stretch run and had no final
winning bid. CONSIDER THESS was off a step slow, raced four wide into the upper lane and never was a serious threat. MADJESTIC was off slow, raced
widest in the lane and had no late rally. RB WHISTLIN DIXIE was forwardly placed to lay up close and faded while racing near the inside. WMA FIREBALL
failed to respond. BIG PURITY dropped back early, raced six deep into the stretch and never threatened.
