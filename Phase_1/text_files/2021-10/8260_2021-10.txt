Footnotes
MYSTIC GREY away best and cleared rivals quickly, continued clear on the turn and into the stretch, lightly coaxed in the lane to win handily. FANCY
TERRACE chased MYSTIC GREY two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch within range, proved no match and saved
second late. TOMASINO tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, put in a mild rally in the lane to earn third. GIT ON
YOUR PULPIT off a bit slow and the start, stalked leaders off the rail in the two path, continued off the rail on the turn, tipped out three wide entering the
stretch, kept to task in the lane and just missed third. CALIE VIEW stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed
to launch a meaningful rally when prompted in the stretch. JACK COOL tracked leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in the two path on the
turn, entered stretch in range and gave way in upper stretch. BOUNTY HUNTER fractious and reared prior to the start, came away ok and tracked clear
leader along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, started to lose ground when in a in tight position and failed to launch a bid in the lane.
GREAT POWER away a step slow, towards the rear of the field exiting the chute, took a bad step and immediately pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
CLOSE TO NOWHERE away well, cleared quickly on the backstretch, improved position on the turn and into the stretch, and drew off. SOME ROYALTY
chased winner two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the three path and stayed on well enough to save second.
CALIFORNIA COMET tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, took majority of the turn two wide, eased out three wide to
launch bid entering the stretch, responded mildly to urging to get up for third. SWEETENER bumped at the start by LADY BEYONCE, asked for speed and
chased clear leader along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, in mix entering the stretch and gave way approaching the final sixteenth. FOR
MY BROTHER tracked leaders off the rail on the two path on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, attempted to launch bid along the rail in the
stretch, but lacked needed room in the lane. LADY BEYONCE off slow, broke out and bumped SWEETENER at the start, quickly trailed on the backstretch
and failed to have an impact.

Footnotes
DARTMOOR cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, met bid from outside rival in upper stretch and proved best late when switching
leads. MARINO HEAT chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, loomed boldly entering the stretch, and repelled by game
rival in the lane. ANOTHER CHAPTER three wide on the backstretch, bothered by rival early on the turn, continued three to four wide on the turn and
bested rest in the lane under steady urging. MARKSMAN ON TARGET tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, floated out and
bumped by rival early on the turn, continued three wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to be edged out for third. ROSES FOR LIFE tracked inside on the
backstretch, entered turn along the inside, lugged out and bothered foes early on the turn, entered the stretch on the inside and lacked needed response.
LUCKY LUPE off slow, stayed well off the rail on the backstretch, continued well off the rail on the turn, entered stretch along the inside and never
threatened.
