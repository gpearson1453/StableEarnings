Footnotes
LINGUINI stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, angled in and drew off under a drive. POETIC CODE veered in at the start,
checked twice while racing four wide around the first turn, bid four wide entering the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner near the
five-sixteenths pole but was no match for that foe from there. SCHENECTADY STAR dueled inside for five furlongs, could not keep pace with the top two
and stayed on well enough to save the show. DANLEY was shut off at the start, raced in range two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. THE
DUNGEON saved ground and failed to menace. BAD GUS played no factor while racing two and three wide. GUS K was bumped at the start, raced three to
five wide and made little impact. WADADA was bumped at the start, checked midway around the first turn, saved ground early, went very wide into the far
turn, angled back down the three path soon after and never threatened. CORPORATE AFFAIR was rank and getting out under a hard hold while disputing
the pace around the first turn and was through after a half. A TRAINER'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RUNNER-UP AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SCIENCE FRICTION bumped with MORE MUCHO at the start, was taken outside soon after that, vied outside rivals before getting clear past the half-mile
marker and moving in, responded to pressure and dug in to stay in command. SHES A GIFT bumped with MORE MUCHO at the start, briefly contested the
pace inside, stayed on the chase around the turn shifting out three wide, stayed on her left lead through the lane and could not reach the winner. SHE IS
ROYALTY was a step slow to begin, saved ground outrun early, and rallied mildly through the stretch on the rail. DOLCISIMA raced near the inside around
the turn, moved out for the drive and could not gain on her left lead. ALEIDA raced two to three wide, and never factored. OVERTHEBLUESKY trailed to the
stretch, and made no progress on the far outside. MORE MUCHO was bumped between horses at the start, showed early speed, could not keep pace with
the leaders around the turn, and faded on her left lead.

SOPE stalked the pace from the rail, had a clear path inside leaving the three-sixteenth pole, rallied to the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
from there. CURRENT HOPE set the pace along the rail, drifted a bit leaving the three-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and held well between foes
to preserve the place. SPEND BENJAMINS steadied early, advanced three wide around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch but was outkicked outside of
foes. VALID EXCHANGE went evenly while racing two wide. CATCHING FISH dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. WICKED TEMPTATIONS
trailed in the two path. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SEA ART set a pressured pace inside, shook off MI NEGRITA turning for home, stayed on her left lead and widened under a drive. MI NEGRITA pressed
SEA ART from outside for a half-mile, could not stay with that one through the lane on her left lead, but was clearly second best. FULL OF ATTITUDE
bumped with DIGNIFIED at the break, then again a couple strides later, advanced in the two-path coming off the turn, but made no further progress through
the final stages. HYPNOTIZER was ridden along behind the leaders and in the clear on the turn, lacked a response and faded steadily. DIGNIFIED bumped
with FULL OF ATTITUDE at the start, and again soon after that, and retired early. MISS YOUNIVERSE was done early three wide. GRAN MAMIBELLA
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BULLET had his heels clipped early, pressed the pace three wide, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and held clear under a drive.
SAMARONTI was shut off early, raced well back down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly. KIGER chased the pace
three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up for the show. EXCALIBUR was bumped at the start then squeezed back to a clear last early,
saved ground off the pace, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished well outside. UNCLE PIP saved
ground well back and improved position inside of foes in the lane. PROSPECT PROJECT dueled inside of foes down the backstretch, could not quite keep
pace with the winner around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. POWER (BRZ) was outrun inside. FITZ'S MO came out and bumped foes
at the start, corrected back toward the inside and shut off SAMARONTI, recovered to duel between foes down the backstretch but was through after a half.
NIMBLE BEAST came in and bumped EXCALIBUR at the start and again soon after, appeared to clip the winner's heels soon after, raced well wide and
was never in contention. POSEIDEN was bumped at the start, had speed inside, chased two wide around the turn and stopped in the lane. A CLAIM OF
FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF NIMBLE BEAST AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
FIGHTING FORCE was held up early between horses at the back, moved out five wide beginning to take closer order around the far turn, finished
determinedly outside ALADO and bested that one to the finish. ALADO tucked in behind the leaders through the opening fractions, shifted off the inside for
clearance approaching the stretch, caught EXCHANGE DAY to reach a short lead entering the final furlong, stayed on well but could not deny the top one.
HERCULES moved in from the three-path leaving the first turn, came back out with an eighth of a mile remaining and finished with interest to get up for
third. EXCHANGE DAY was nursed along setting an even pace inside, stayed on to midstretch, then weakened on his left lead. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) raced
three to four wide throughout, and lacked the needed response. MY MANE MAN saved ground unhurried for nearly six furlongs, shifted out five wide
approaching the top of the stretch, and made no headway. ADVANCE CASH pressed EXCHANGE DAY from outside for six furlongs, and tired.

FULL DISCLOSURE bumped ADIOS GARY at the start, sped to the front, set a clear pace inside and held clear under a drive. SO DETERMINED broke
slowly, dropped far back early, raced three wide around the turn, stayed on the left lead to deep stretch and finished strongly. HEY HOMBRE advanced
three wide around the turn to loom the main apparent danger to the winner in upper stretch but flattened out. THE BEAST stalked the winner two wide and
tired in the drive. ADIOS GARY was bumped at the start, gave chase two wide and came up empty in the lane. THE MAR chased the winner inside and
retreated nearing the lane. CASHIER CHECK played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
CHOOSE JOY broke a step slow, began taking closer order around the turn three to four wide, rallied to overhaul CAT'S ASTRAY from outside leaving the
furlong grounds, drew clear staying on her left lead, then was vanned off after the finish. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY saved ground to the turn in the second flight,
moved to the two-path approaching the stretch, split horses rallying a sixteenth out and was up inside AWSUM ROAR to grab second. AWSUM ROAR
stumbled at the start, raced forwardly outside, had aim outside the pacesetter turning for home, got outkicked by CHOOSE JOY into the final furlong, and
yielded the place late. BERNIE'S MISTRESS was a step slow from the gate, got hustled up along the rail but steadied and got shuffled back to last, shifted
out four wide attempting to rally coming off the turn, and flattened out. CAT'S ASTRAY got bumped by MOON OF LOVE at the start, dashed clear inside,
got headed with an eighth of a mile remaining, and gave way. MUDSLIDE WICKED was outrun inside to the turn, moved out three wide approaching the
stretch and could not gain. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) broke in bumping CAT'S ASTRAY, pursued that rival from outside early, then weakened approaching the
stretch.

WENT WEST stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of the pacesetter nearing the eighth pole and edged away under a drive. GATSBY set the pace in the
two path, was collared leaving the eighth pole and fought on outside of the winner to hold well clear of the rest. PUDDING stalked the pace two and three
wide between foes, had aim three deep in upper stretch but was no match for the top two. SILVERLY ENOUGH trailed in the two path for a half, passed
tiring rivals and was vanned off after the finish. CAJUN BROTHER had speed three and four wide and tired after a half. TRAVY BOY chased the pace four
wide and five wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SKYWALKING lagged far behind dueling leaders for six furlongs in the two-path, shifted out a bit beginning to close in leaving the far turn, caught WARP
SPEED BABY from outside in deep stretch and was going away at the finish. WARP SPEED BABY dueled outside BACKCHAT as they left the others far
behind early, got the best of that dispute by upper stretch, but was no match for the winner late. CAMPEADOR enjoyed the best view of the battling leaders
alone in third, loomed three wide coming to the top of the stretch, but flattened out through the furlong grounds. NEVERENOUGHCOCO was well back
three wide early, moved inside for the run around the far turn, and offered a mild response on the rail to pick up the last major share. DUEL FUEL was a
step slow at the start, and never got close. BACKCHAT dueled inside WARP SPEED BABY for six furlongs, and faltered. AUTHENTIC HEART tired after a
half-mile inside. WILLIAM BOY never raced contention two wide.
