RIPPOLINO settled off the early duel, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to be clear under steady handling. ONE MOST WANTED
settled to the middle of the pack early on, moved up five to six wide in the stretch run but was no match for the winner. LEAVE 'EM LOADED stalked the
early pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four to five wide in the lane and showed good late interest. WONDERVILLE settled off the early
flight, moved up three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. TYLER TIME was unhurried early, raced along the inside around the far turn, raced
three wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. BARRISTER dropped back in the early stages, raced towards the inside and had
no late response. TRANSFER THE FUNDS raced five wide around the far turn and had no late rally. NTH POWER bobbled at the break, raced four deep
around the far turn and never threatened. JAQUAVIOUS dueled for the early lead and weakened in the stretch run. DIVINE PROPORTION dueled for the
early lead and gave way. IMAGINE NEVERLAND was off slowly, raced along the inside down the backstretch and had no response. GAMBLING MAN
broke to the outside, raced three wide near the quarter pole and never menaced. CUP MATCH failed to sustain a bid. CUBANO CAT raced far back, was
eased and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
LITTLE MS SCARLET broke in, bumped with rival, was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up two wide around the far turn, led inside the
eighth pole, was headed by Gavichi near the sixteenth, came on again determinedly and prevailed under all out pressure. GAVICHI stalked the early pair
down the backstretch, made a three wide bid, led near the sixteenth pole and must missed in a game effort. AMERICAS WOMAN was a bit sluggish early,
rushed three to four wide into the far turn and had no final winning bid. MOSLER'S TOUCH was quick to begin to set the early pace and was empty the final
eighth of a mile. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL settled off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn and had no rally. MASHUGANA was slow early on,
raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. BROADWAY PEGGY was bumped at the break, raced two to three wide and never was a
factor.

Footnotes
RUN ON THE TRAIL was forwardly placed early on, raced three wide through the stretch run, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. HOLIDAY
AVENUE stalked the early going, raced four wide into the upper lane and just missed in a game effort. PAPA CHARLES, bumped at the break, was urged
soon after, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and slowly closed in on the top pair. MONEY CODE dropped back early, raced along the inside around
the far turn and had not enough in the drive. TERP TOWN was slow early, raced three to four wide and had no late rally. NO MONEY DOWN vied for the
early lead along the inside and gave way. BISCOTTO D'ORO was hustled along from the outside, raced three wide near the quarter pole and tired. SAPIO
SOCIAL was hustled early on, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.
