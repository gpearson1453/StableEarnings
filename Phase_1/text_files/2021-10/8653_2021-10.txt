MATOULA broke in at the start, dueled briefly with TARGETED RETURN before shaking away to show the way in hand just off the inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive kept to task. ALPINE QUEEN three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors.
TARGETED RETURN knocked heads early on with MATOULA before easing off to chase inside, tipped two then three wide through the turn getting placed
to coaxing just past the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SCOTT ALAIA chased along the inside
early on before tipping three wide through the turn, tucked to the two path three furlongs from home under coaxing, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and improved position for the last major share. SEAHORSE D'ORO veered in at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths,

just inside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide at the quarter pole and drifted in to the two path straightened away safely clear, edged away under a drive
shying a bit from the crop while prevailing kept to task. I'M OVER U six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the nine-sixteenths,
came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along safe for the place honors.
WORKINGMAN'S DUDE hustled from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path under some pressure from COMPEDENCE IS KEY to the
outside, had that rival advance and was headed for the front five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show
honors, well clear of the rest. HEADS OR TAILS hustled from the start, chased four wide down the backstretch, had EMPIRE STATION tucked in front and
was steadied briefly off that rival's heels before altering to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
three-eighths, cornered two to three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. EL VEINTICUATRO brushed the off side stall at the start conceding
three lengths to the front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.

from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no headway. APPALACHIAN LEGEND got bumped at the start by MRTANDROSEYSBOY, who
broke inwards, then got steadied off the heels of HEADS OR TAILS conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased three wide down the backstretch
and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. EMPIRE STATION broke in at the
start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the nine-sixteenths before tipping back five wide as I'M OVER U took over
the path safely in front, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. MRTANDROSEYSBOY broke
in at the start bumping APPALACHIAN LEGEND in behind HEADS OF TAILS, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped out
