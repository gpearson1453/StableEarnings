Footnotes
FEELING DANGEROUS moved four wide on clubhouse turn to gain the lead, led in between horses on backstretch, repelled those challenges, drew off
stretch and wrapped up near the wire. I AM IT slight bobble start, rated off the pace after a slight bobble, moved up on turn to reach contention, got through
on rail to gain place. KATHERN'S JOY saved ground, shuffled back to last. Angled outside turn and hustled in stretch drive to gain the show. MAXIMO
STRONG trailed field, angled outside to reach contention, looked to be comfortably in the money in the stretch but got caught at the wire to lose show.
KIRBY moved up three wide backstretch to battle for lead, couldn't keep up and faded. SECOND LINE DAVID set pace early, pressed while saving ground,
tired from early effort.

SPIRIT OR SPITE rated patiently, 3w wide move on turn, angled outside to maintain momentum and avoid clipping heels, went by leaders easily for victory.
SUSIKIN set the pace, started to tire in the stretch, tried to hold on but couldn't hold off the eventual winner. PROBABLY GRACE chased the pace, asked
for run on far turn, drifted out slightly while gaining ground, got up on even terms with pacesetter but couldn't go by. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA saved ground,
asked for run on far turn, 4w, empty. AWESOME PAL trailed field, move up with inside trip, no factor. BAYLEAF chased th4e pace and when asked came
up empty.

WILL TAKE ROSES stalked the pace while saving ground, inside move to threaten for the lead turning for home, drifted in the stretch and took lead before
bumping at the sixteenth pole, held for victory. VIKING QUEEN set the pace while facing inside pressure, was herded outside and then bumped at the
sixttenth pole, just missed the win. GRANDMARY stumbled at the start, rated off pace and then made a strong rally in the stretch, but ran out of ground.
OFFLEE GRAYSFUL stalked pace, asked for run on turn but came up empty. MIKEY'S JEWEL trailed, saved ground, tried to make a run but was never a
threat. M. J.'S LADY stalked the pace and tried to make a run on backstretch, but came up empty on the turn and fell back. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH DRIVE AND AFTER A REVIEW, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
