Footnotes
SPRING EMPEROR pursued the loose pacesetter, rallied inside in the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth. ESPRESSO CALIENTE moved clear before
a quarter mile, drifted out badly through the stretch losing the advantage . AHSAD saved ground within range and flattened out in the stretch. DUBROVSKY
broke slowly, saved ground, moved very wide into the stretch and was no threat. MUCHO MAS GRANDE chased near the inside, moved out on the final
turn and lacked a bid. KING'S GOLD dropped back early and stopped losing contact with his field.

flattened out in the stretch. BABA stalked the pacesetters wide then was finished after half a mile. CREATIVE LOVE dropped far behind and was never in

Footnotes
YONDERING raced far behind, swung wide rallying in the stretch to get up in time in the final sixteenth. KOLOHE PRINCE rated inside, bid clear at the
three eighths pole, was collared but continued gamely to the finish. CALL FITZROY settled far behind inside then advanced wide into the stretch rallying.
YES FOR LESS alternated for the lead outside then began tiring on the final turn. PIGGYBANK dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing.
MONDAY'S WITH MIKE stalked the pacesetters four wide, moved closer on the final turn then faded. WARRANT OFFICER was urged close up outside
then stopped after five furlongs. BILL'S MAFIA lacked speed and weakened steadily. TIZ VALENTINO DAZE trailed for half a mile and was never in
contention. WICKED STRONG ALEX led briefly then stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

BAVARIA vied wide down the backstretch, took over on the turn, drew away and remained safe while kept tp urging. SAILOR AGAIN saved ground early,
angled out rallying and was easily second best. SPIRIT WOLF dropped far behind, raced extremely wide throughout and gained late. NEW HAMPSHIRE
made a menacing wide bid on the turn then weakened. DREAMING THOUSAND forced the pace inside to the turn and gave way. BEST START dueled
between rivals to the far turn and faded. I SAW IT ALL dropped back early and was always outrun. SECRET MAGICIAN was a late scratch at the gate on
