Footnotes
WAR CROSS broke well to press the early pace two wide, assumed command entering the far turn, set the balance of the pace and drew off under right
handed urging to win going away. ASSUMPTION stalked the pace into the stretch, advanced in the six path and finished well clear for second. STAY
THIRSTY AMIGO settled mid pack and finished with good courage along the inside. COMPLY passed tiring rivals outside. BREEZY MONEY broke sharply,
set the pace along the inside to the far turn then weakened. LAKE NAKURU hopped at the start and was no threat. GALTERO was outrun. POMPEY'S
RULE was no factor. EXONERATED PREZ was through after a half.

STAR RULES never far back while settling four wide, surged three wide entering the far turn, made the lead midway on that turn then widened the balance
of the trip at will to win as her rider pleased. KETTLE KING stalked the pace from the start, swung wide, drifted out in deep stretch to mid track and finished
second best. VOLUME OF TRUST unhurried early, also swung wide and closed a gap late in mid track. ONE CRAZY RIDE set the early pace inside, had
speed for seven furlong then weakened. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL inside, failed to respond. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR showed little. SPLIT MY BRITCHES was
outrun. SOMETHING SACRED pressed the pace while hung four wide into the first turn, made the lead before a half then was used up. THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
THE GOSPEL OF MARK stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly three wide in the six path and was along in time. SAMURAI WAY dueled for
the lead two wide until deep stretch and gamely gained second. BRILLIANTBENNY battled for the lead along the inside until deep stretch then was
outfinished. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE stalked the pace and went evenly in the three path through the stretch. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM failed to menace.
HAPPY TAKEOVER was no threat. WESTERN HOPE was wide early and always outrun. DANES CHORD also wide early, showed little. FLAT OUT OF
CREDIT was through after a half.
