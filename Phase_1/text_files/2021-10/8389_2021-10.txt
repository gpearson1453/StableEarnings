AMERICAN FORCES dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid entering the turn to shake clear, then drew out in the stretch to prove best under
a drive. ROCKSTAR ROMEO was off a step slow, then made a four wide move on the turn, but flattened out while staying on for the place gamely.
SULTANNES CROWN was bumped and checked nearing the five eighths marker, then settled, eased out and made a five wide bid by the quarter pole, but
hung in the drive, missed place. DON TATTO passed the tiring rivals. FLAT BUSTED vied for the early lead on the inside and faltered.
READTHETRANSCRIPT vied for command between horses early then folded up.

Footnotes
DOLLARIZATION was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the three sixteenths and drew off in the stretch to prove
much the best under a drive. ECONOMIC POWER prompted the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to gain a short lead leaving the turn,
but proved to be no match for the winner in the drive while saving the place award. ELUSIVE JESTER was reserved early, then advanced four wide by the
quarter pole but finished evenly while being along for the show award. JOZANI R V F was void of early speed, came wide into the drive and had a belated
rally. MIDTOWN set the early pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. MACHO SMOKE was four wide into the first turn, then moved over to the inside
on the backstretch, was on the inside on the turn and came up empty in the drive. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA failed to respond. AZZARRO stalked the early
pace four wide and stopped.

FYVIE was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a mild drive. EMILIA STRONG
was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, angled in by the three sixteenths pole and was along for the place award, second best.
PROMINENT HENNY dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain command, then weakened in the stretch, held show. MIA
CALIA was settled back early, then advanced on the inside on the turn, finished willing on the inside angled out in deep stretch and bested the rest.
ZORRITA lacked a rally. SINFUL BEAUTY chased the early pace four wide and weakened. BUTTON CANDY failed to menace. MNEMOSYNE was not a
factor. FALSE RULING dueled for the early lead on the inside and stopped badly.

SUNSHINE MAX stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. SOUL STORY
was allowed to settle four wide early, made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly to be clearly second best. GOSIGNAL was off
very slowly, then was sent up four wide to chase the pace four wide, then angled in by the three sixteenths pole, and was up for the show on the inside.
SPOOKY ONE set the early pace on the inside, then shifted out three wide by the three sixteenths pole and weakened. HURRICANE AMIGO chased the
early pace in between horses, came four wide into the drive and was empty. PALACE SUPERNOVA was off slowly, chased the pace from the inside and
stopped. SUNSHINE MAX did unseat the rider behind the gate and ran off a short distance delaying the start of the race about three minutes.

LITERALLY was bumped hard at the start, then prompted the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to gain command by the quarter pole, then
was confronted by TRIPLE A PLUS by the furlong marker, dug in gamely and held on late to prove best under a drive. TRIPLE A. PLUS was well rated
early, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, went on even terms for command leaving the furlong marker but was outgamed by the winner late.
VENOMOUS STATE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the stretch and was along for the show award. JOVIS broke outwardly at the start, then
set a fast pace on the inside and gave way. ASPECT broke in and bumped rival, stumbled and lost the rider at the start, walked off. There was a stewards
inquiry into the start of the race but after review the race was left as is.

Footnotes
COURTING JENNY dueled for the early lead in between rivals, made a bid leaving the turn and drew clear, then was ridden out to prove much the best.
GROTON ST SCOUT was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and rallied well in stretch. IL MIO AMORE was
rated along two wide on the turn, shifted out leaving the furlong marker and finished willingly but needed more. FIRST LADY MAGGIE prompted the pace
five wide and made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. SNIPER SIS passed the tiring rivals. FARFALLA pressed the early pace four
wide and in between rivals then faltered in the drive while on left lead. GIVEN ACHANCE was off slowly, failed to menace. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER chased
the early pace and weakened. MAD MOMMA dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.
