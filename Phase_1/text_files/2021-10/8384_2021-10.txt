HIT THIS TOWN tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path through the stretch proved best. PUT A HEMI IN HER set the
pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. CAPTURE THE RIDE was unhurried early, saved
ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. OPTIMYSTICAL was off the pace, hustled along on the turn and from the six
path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. JMR AWESOM SILENCE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but failed to fire. LILLZ NOT

DYNAMITE KARMA stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. SUMMER RETREAT
showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TALE OF VIENNA was
unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. AMNESTY tracked from the outside and had a
good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. LEONARD'S BAY was well back, showed little and from the four
path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

DE ONLY SOLUTION was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch prevailed. A GERSHWIN TUNE was well back, closed
the gap on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed. UNO CHAMP was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. KEEP GOING stalked the early leaders and was roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch had no response. NO EXIT showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

OVERSTATE tracked the leaders from the outside, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SPACE
GENERAL was in range, a factor on the turn and had a bid in mid stretch but was outfinished. CURT'S ANGEL was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SELFLESS DEVOTION stalked the early leaders from the inside and was roused on the turn
but needed more. EASY ACCESS was away alertly and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and had nothing left.
ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. SMART N QUICK was well back, showed little and was never in
contention. WONDERFUL SOFIA was off the pace and showed nothing while outrun.
