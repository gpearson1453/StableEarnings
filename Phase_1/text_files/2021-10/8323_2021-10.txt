SPEIGHTSFORD stalked the early pace then took over two deep midway on the first turn, drew clear of Fu Man Sue approaching the quarter pole and
opened up at the rail on the far turn, then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. SOUND OFF saved ground well off the early pace, bid
past the five sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the three path of the far turn, dueled for second in the upper stretch and was gaining late on the winner.
FU MAN SUE had the early lead inside but was caught midway on the opening turn and stalked from the half mile pole, engaged in close chase leaving the
three eighths but dropped back approaching the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn then ceded second in the upper stretch. ANOTHER VICTORY
settled off the early pace about the three path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail then flattened the final
furlong. NOMO RON raced off the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.

LONGSTORYLUCY saved ground racing well off the pace, bid into the backstretch and circled rivals five wide on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch
handling and reached the front the final yards. CHEESE LOUISE took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final yards.
CASTLEINTHEMEADOW rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and got up for third the final yards. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, threatened at the rail a furlong away but flattened stride the final sixteenth. MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the rail the first
turn, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole then flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. LIL MISS FIBER was shuffled back early and
rounded the first turn about the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY stalked the
pace two deep into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and gave way the final furlong.

angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the five path then dug in through the stretch to take second the final yards. WILLIE THE WHALE
gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the four path of the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BEARCAT KITTEN pressured the early pace
inside but dropped back at the three eighths pole and flattened stride through later yards. EPIC WEST exchanged light contact with Won Dozen Banks
leaving the gate and raced off the pace inside, steadied at the rail nearing the turn and showed little further.

threatened three wide nearing the head of the lane, took the lead mid-stretch and raced clear under the wire. CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the rail the
first turn then eased outward to give chase into the backstretch, ran in the five path of the far turn and closed through the lane to take second later yards,
while gaining on the winner. LOVE TO ZOOM stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged approaching the three eighths pole, contested the turn at
a close disadvantage two deep, took a slim brief lead between horses nearing the eighth pole but was caught mid-stretch and flattened later yards. CRUZ IN
THE CASTLE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail most of the
far turn, was caught toward the head of the lane, dropped back inside the eighth pole and flattened stride. WALK A FINE LINE saved ground off the pace,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. CARSON CASTLE rounded the opening turn about the
five path then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, though, flattened stride in the three path of the far turn. DIXIE SUNRISE veered out and was roughed at

Footnotes
BURN THE SHIPS rated close inside the opening turn, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close three wide nearing the top of the
stretch and dug in under steady handling to take over later yards. SUSPIROS rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch,
challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled mostly at even terms with MARSAC from that point, dug in gamely to better that opponent, but was
outfinished in late yards, while the latter stalked the earlier pace two deep then took the lead past the half mile pole, dueled at mostly even terms from the
three eighths, was caught in later yards and flattened nearing the wire. SCOTTISH MAN settled back about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, improved his position in the five path of the far turn then ran evenly down the lane. GOOFY BOY rounded the opening turn in the
three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and raced evenly in the stretch. PERUVIAN DANCER was not a
factor. WONDER HOW set the early pace inside, was caught leaving the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the five
sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. DEPUTY DREW was never a factor. SAGE CANYON dropped well back early on.
