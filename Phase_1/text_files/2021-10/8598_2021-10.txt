Footnotes
WE BE THERE vied briefly, moved clear on the turn and remained safe driving. GRUNTLED pursued inside, angled out on the turn, loomed a threat and
continued willingly. UPTOWN SHOES chased three wide then flattened out in the stretch. AUSTIN WHYLIE dropped back inside and lacked a rally.
TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced between rivals down the backstretch, moved inside on turn then faded. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN raced within range outside
and gave way after half a mile. GO SKIPPY GO lacked speed inside and was never a factor. KINDA CLASS'Y flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
TAQSEEMAAT rushed to contention between foes, awaited room on the turn, angled out rallying and moved clear. SHETALKSTOMUCH squeezed back at
the start, lagged far behind, moved extremely wide. GOING GOING GONE vied between rivals early, bid to the front at the quarter pole and weakened. GET
HER READYEDDIE fractious in the gate, offered a strong move on the turn then flattened out. LADY MISTRESS came out at the start causing crowding
then was always outrun. GONE DREAMING broke alertly and led in the two path, moved inside on the turn and faded. LA LUISA saved ground close up,
eased back into the far turn and retreated. LIAM'S LADY prompted the pace wide down the backstretch and was not asked stretch through the stretch.

LAWLESSNESS settled in the two path, advanced on the final turn, took over into the stretch then remained clear driving. MR. TUTTLE controlled the pace
inside, widened on the final turn, was passed but angled out and came again. LT. COLUMBO saved ground just off the leaders and won the battle for show.
LIBERTY RUNNER far back inside, moved very wide into the stretch without menacing. JO JO KATZ hard ridden on the final turn, swung out but flattened.
PETER G. FOX was fanned wide into the first turn, remained wide and weakened late. SMOKUM PEACE PIPE prompted the pace outside to the final turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
CANT STOP THIS MAN controlled the pace inside, battled when challenged then moved clear in the final yards. UNIQUE PATH stalked the winner, earned
a narrow lead at the eighth pole then was outfinished. PRINCIPINO trailed early inside then closed strongly too late. HORSE BE WITH YOU saved ground
close up and continued willingly. BIZZY GILLESPIE chased between rivals down the backstretch and faded. MASTER OF WAR raced off the leaders in the
two path and weakened. LOULOVESTHERIVER dropped back wide and was never a factor. JOE THE BOSS dropped back early and gave way readily.

GOD STILL LOVES ME saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and gamely held off rival to the finish. XENATOWN pursued the loose pacesetter,
rallied but was outfinished late. EIGHT DANZAS lacked speed, advanced wide with some late energy. SUPER DUPER FLY controlled the pace, widened
easily on the turn then drifted out tiring in the stretch. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS chased in midpack near the inside and lacked a rally. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS
raced within range three wide and flattened out in the stretch. NO SYMPATHY dropped back early and was never a factor. LA LA LUCY trailed early and
was never in contention. DREAMANYTIME stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

wide into the stretch and surged late. SUNDAY INN was urged close up between rivals and finished willingly. BRAZILIAN BAY moved clear inside, was
engaged in midstretch then weakened slightly. TUFF BIRD prompted the pace wide down the backstretch and continued well. REIGNING FIRE dropped
well behind, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. REITERATE prompted the leader inside then proved empty in the stretch. KARABESSA forced the
pace outside and weakened steadily. MON CHERIE lacked speed and was never in contention. SIDEREAL bumped at the start and raced far back
throughout. BANGLE GAL chased wide early and gave way readily.

rivals rallying on the final turn and finished gamely for the place. DOC MEEKS advanced wide into the far turn and continued willingly. GOLD INCLUDED
weaved through traffic, was blocked at the quarter pole then flattened out. UNCUT quickly sprinted clear, vied inside then proved empty in the stretch.
TOMARIE lagged far behind throughout racing wide. BLUE SHINE engaged the pacesetter outside after a quarter mile and gave way. KINKY SOX raced
close up inside then stopped losing contact with her field.
