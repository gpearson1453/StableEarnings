SHE'S SO GOLDEN Away well, set the pace along the two path, opened up some leaving the furlong marker and was ridden out. MIZZYS IMAGE Tracked
in hand along the rail, chased in the lane and then was clearly no match. MISS ROSS Close up along the three path early, saved ground into the lane and
failed to threaten inside. ADIRONDACK QUEEN Tracked five wide early, four wide into the turn, three path out of it and weakened. INHONOROFOWENJR
Tracked from between four wide early, three path into the turn and weakened. DONNA'SWAY Lagged back along the rail, angled wide in the lane and was
not a factor.
