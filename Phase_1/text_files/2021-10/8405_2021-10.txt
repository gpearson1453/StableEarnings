nearing the quarter pole, proved no match for the winner and lost the place late. PURELY SILVER was well placed early on the inside and weakened.

KAFFEINATED was settled on the inside to the five sixteenths pole, then eased off the rail leaving the quarter pole and came six wide into the stretch,
closed full of run to get up in time under brisk handling. LEFTATTHEALTAR vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn and
move to the inside, then remained clear by the furlong marker, but was caught late to just miss. QUEEN ROSEMARY was bumped at the start, chased the
pace three wide, then was in between horses leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly but needed more. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS broke inwardly at the
start, chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. MUNNY CALL vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. PRAYFORACURE had no
response.

TANYA'S GEM stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command three wide, then edged clear leaving the sixteenths
pole and prevailed late under a drive. TWIRLING WIND vied for the early lead on the inside, then steadied leaving the three eighths pole, then was roused
by the quarter pole, then closed well on the inside under heavy crop urging. OUR SWEET GIRL pressed the early pace three wide, then made a bid and
dueled for command two wide, continued to duel for the lead by the furlong marker but faded late. LIL TATER was rated early while two wide, swung out six
wide for the drive and rallied late. DETERMINED LOVE chased the early pace, made a five wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. SNOW
FORECAST lacked a rally. TRIXIE'S TIME hesitated at the start, not a factor.
