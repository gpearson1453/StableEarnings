Footnotes
MURGATROYD prompted the pace three wide, bid entering the lane, took over passing the three sixteenths pole, drew clear with MRS. NUSHI giving
chase, and safely held sway to the wire. MRS. NUSHI stalked along the inside, chased the leaders under urging around the turn, shifted four wide entering
the lane, then kept on in pursuit of MURGATROYD through the final furlong, gained mildly, but did not have enough to catch her. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE
brushed an outer foe at the start, tucked to the rail to track the pace along the inside, vacated that path turning for home before swinging five wide entering
the lane, and stayed on to reach show approaching the wire. CALL ME PENNY vied for the lead two wide, led around the turn, but was headed by an outer
foe passing the quarter pole, and tired. BIG BUGG'S GIRL broke a step slowly, saved ground while trailing around the turn, then improved between horses
late. SCENIC VIEW tracked from the four path around the turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and failed to menace. MASTERFUL MISTRESS was
hustled early on to show the way from a pair of pressing bids, but was headed by those rivals at the three furlong pole, and weakened entering the lane.
ALITTLESLICEOF PIE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, then never got involved.

Footnotes
CURLY RUTH stalked along the inside, chased through upper stretch after shifting two wide, tipped four wide at the furlong grounds to be outside of the
leading pair, then produced a late kick to surge approaching the wire, and got up late. SWEET MELANIA bobbled a bit a the start but was not costed early
positioning, stalked the pace three wide, crept closer to prompt the leaders into the far turn, bi outside of BREEZE RIDER in upper stretch, dueled with that
foe through the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer surging rival while prevailing in that battle for place. BREEZE RIDER pressed the pace two wide,
stalked the leader down the backstretch before bidding into the far turn as SWEET MELANIA forced her hand, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, dug
in to resist that rival's bid approaching the final furlong, dueled gamely thereafter, but was overhauled by an outer foe and was bested for place. MARKET
RUMOR settled off of the pace, took the turns two to three wide, came into the lane four wide, got floated five wide approaching midstretch, then chased
evenly while hanging on her left lead. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) was bumped between horses at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted two to
three wide entering the lane, then chased from between horses in upper stretch before fading. ALTA'S AWARD bumped an inner foe at the start, trailed
along the inside into the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and moved up. GOOD FIGHT never got involved. ENOLA GAY was outrun. WINTER
SUNSET set the pace along the inside, managed a clear lead down the backstretch, but met pair of bids into the far turn, got headed entering the lane, and
weakened in upper stretch. BACCHANALIA tracked from the three path, was taken in hand into the backstretch and minorly costed positioning, then
weakened between horses at the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
CENTER AISLE managed a clear advantage around the turn, and steadily widened that margin under driving pressure through the lane. GERRI B tracked
the clear leader from the rail and inside of a trio of foes into the turn, became the closest pursuant to the leader turning for home after those rivals tired,
shifted outside of the leader entering the lane to take aim, but failed to keep pace with that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and safely held place.
FABRICATE settled at the rear two wide, gained four wide turning for home, and stayed on. ROC'S PRINCESS got restless waiting for the gates to open,
trailed the field around the turn, swung five wide turning for home, and moved up without threatening before leveling off. CODE NAME KATE broke
outwardly, but was forwardly placed four wide, shifted three wide around the bend, then faded in upper stretch. DUPLICITOUS chased the pace three wide
and from between horses, then weakened at the three furlong pole. SILVER STRAND stalked two wide and from between horses, then faded turning for
home.

Footnotes
CHANGE OF CONTROL stalked two wide from the three path around the turn, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, rallied to reel that foe in
approaching the final sixteenth, and drew clear. AMBASSADOR LUNA set the pace along the inside, maintained a narrow advantage from a vying YES IT'S
GINGER around, shook clear of that foe entering the lane, but met CHANGE OF CONTROL's bid inside the final furlong, got bested at the sixteenth pole,
then saved place from a rallying rival. CAMPANELLE (IRE) was taken in hand shortly after the start and unable to achieve early positioning, settled off of the
pace, swung six wide turning for home, and rallied well through the lane, but missed reaching place. IN GOOD SPIRITS stalked along the inside, but only
managed to chase through upper stretch before fading. LAGERTHA (CHI) tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and failed to
factor. YES IT'S GINGER prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but was repelled entering the lane, and weakened. CATCH A BID failed to
factor. LEAD GUITAR was never involved. VIOLENZA tracked from midpack three wide, shifted five wide at the quarter pole, and tired. SHE'S SO SPECIAL
saved ground in midpack, but weakened turning for home. PER RULING #21-0101 FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, IN GOOD SPIRITS
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SIGHTS sped clear passing the half mile pole, showed the way in the three path around the turn, shifted further outwards while kicking clear in
upper stretch, and drew off. FAST AND FLIRTY lied forwardly placed, took the turn in the four path, and rallied to reach place late. TAKE A STAND got
pinched between horses at the start, advanced between horses into the turn to press the leader from the outside, but proved no match in upper stretch, and
lost place late. LA BOMBONERA settled off of the pace, split foes two wide turning for home to bid for place inside of rivals in upper stretch, but flattened
out. CUPID'S STRIKE hopped at the start, saved ground off of the pace, advanced inside of foes entering the lane, and chased late. OCEAN SIZE failed to
menace. MALIBU KENDALL lied close up in the two path early on, stalked into the turn, but came under coaxing to keep pace at the seven sixteenths pole,
failed to sustain position, and faded. RED HOT MAMA tracked from the five path around the turn, and faded through the lane. ENCHANTED TRAIL
prompted the pace setter from the inside early on, but chased that foe into the turn before weakening. CHAMPAGNE SISTER was outrun.
