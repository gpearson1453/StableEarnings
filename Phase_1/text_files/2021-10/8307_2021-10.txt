Footnotes
GANDARI rated a slim lead inside, came under light pressure toward the three eighths pole, kept the edge at the rail on the far turn, drew clear midway
through the turn and was only mildly urged in the lane. MISS WILD stalked the winner off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced at a
close disadvantage two deep to the mid point of the far turn, but, dropped back from there and had to settle for second best. MISS GRANDSTANDER
became a bit anxious in the gate then settled off the pace inside, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in
the lane. CALLINGHERCOLLINS settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole but flattened in the
four path of the far turn. AMBER ROSE ADAM rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS raced off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the three path of the far turn.

LAVELLO angled in to stay with the early leader then took over two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated a slim lead, kept the edge through the far turn
and dug in determinedly to deter that one through the lane. MOLLY BOLTS raced well back from early contention, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths
pole and angled outward on the far turn, entered the stretch about the five path and steadily closed to take second the final strides, while gaining on the
winner. HARDSCRATCH angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught at the nine sixteenths pole and gave close chase through the backstretch,
remained a close threat through deep stretch then ceded second the final strides. WILD CAPPUCINO saved ground the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. WIN THEN GRIN settled off the pace in
the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, then flattened through later yards. JEAN GREY
was not a factor. FINDER ANGEL R V F saved ground on the opening turn and picked up the chase into the backstretch, then weakened into the far turn.
VIOLANE stumbled and lost her rider leaving the gate.
