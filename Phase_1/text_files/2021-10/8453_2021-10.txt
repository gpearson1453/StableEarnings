Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER set the pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane then drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. FREER tracked the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but was no match for the winner late in the stretch run. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR raced back
early on, was three wide along the turn, in the four path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch drive. JOVIAL stalked the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. COMMODORE PERRY was never a threat. SCAT SHACK was never involved. GUNDUZ lost action
along the backstretch and was done early.

CAMP DAVID pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, led entering the lane, and drew off through the final furlong. CURBSTONE set the pace,
met the winner's bid around the far turn, proved no match for that rival entering the lane, and was second best. WICKED GENIUS tracked three wide,
secured show around the far turn, and was best of the rest. TRAVEL GUIDE made little impact. TONKAWA SPRINGS stalked along the inside and faded
around the far turn. FREEDOM'S WAY broke outwardly, then never got involved. HASHTAG NO WONDER failed to factor. FAITH RUNNER lied forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, then faded around the far turn. BIG WOO broke slowly, then was outrun, eased around the far turn, then jogged
across the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BIG CITY MOMMA settled off of the pace, gained in the four path around the far turn to bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of STREET MISSY in the late
stages, and prevailed on the wire. STREET MISSY tracked three wide, prompted the pace around the far turn, bid outside of BERALE entering the lane as
BIG CITY MOMMA ranged up along side, forged an advantage between those foes a sixteenth from home, but was nailed by her outer counterpart on the
wire. BERATE cleared off around the first turn, showed the way from a pair of rivals into the far turn, dueled inside of multiple foes in upper stretch, but
yielded late. SOUTH GEORGIA stalked along the inside, but failed to bid while chasing the leading trio through the lane. WILD EMPRESS stalked two wide,
bid for the lead between into the far turn, but faltered approaching the five sixteenths pole. SOVEREIGN APPEAL took the first turn in the four path while off
of the pace, and never got involved. ROCKET ON BOARD was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
SHANTISARA (IRE) stalked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn, took dead aim on her leading stablemate entering the lane, forged an
advantage at the three sixteenths pole, produced a strong turn of foot when let out passing that marker, spurted clear with authority, and widened.
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) set the pace, showed the way while well in hand around the far turn, but had little resistance for a bidding SHATISARA (IRE)
when roused at the three sixteenths pole, quickly proved no match for that rival, but safely held place thereafter. BURNING AMBITION led early on, but was
taken back to stalk along the inside passing the wire for the first turn, tracked comfortably from the pocket, but was outmoved by an outer foe entering the
lane, shifted off of the railing approaching the furlong grounds while securing show, then kept on. NICEST (IRE) saved ground off of the pace, then
improved to reach a minor placing in upper stretch. QUEEN GODDESS tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before tipping four wide
entering the lane, but brushed an outer foe in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. CLOSING REMARKS settled far back two wide, swung six wide turning for
home, and failed to factor. CLOUDY DAWN (IRE) lied off of the pace two wide, then three wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to make
an impact. FLIPPANT trailed along the inside, gained four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, got floated five wide by QUEEN GODDESS
entering the lane before being brushed by that foe in upper stretch, then failed to sustain that bid between horses. EMPRESS JOSEPHINE (IRE) pressed
the pace two wide, but came under a drive into the far turn, lacked a response while getting outmoved entering the lane, and weakened between horses in
upper stretch.

DUCALE set the pace inside of a pressing KING'S MISCHIEF, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, and held from an oncharging rival late. WINTER
POOL settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide down the backstretch, tracked from between horses around the far turn before swinging five
wide entering the lane, then rallied with a stout kick in the final furlong, ranged up to the leader late, but ran out of ground. MALIBU STAR lied close inside of
the leaders into the first turn, stalked into the backstretch, but only managed to chase the leader home through the lane. KING'S MISCHIEF vied for the lead
two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and yielded between. TRASHTALKINYANKEE stalked three wide, ranged up to
the leading pair turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, chased through upper stretch, and faded. MR. TIP lied off of the pace in the four
path around the first turn, took the far turn three wide and between horses, but tired entering the lane. HUNT THE FRONT broke slowly and trailed the field,
swung six wide entering the lane, but failed to menace. MISTER CANDY RIDE was never involved. OTTOTHELEGEND tracked from the two path,
attempted a four wide rally around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane.

surged, but was overhauled by a pair of outer foes approaching the wire, and saved show. SIGNIFY pressed the pace two wide, drifted to the six path
entering the, leaned further out in midstretch, but straightened in the final furlong, kept on to attempt a re-bid, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides
approaching the wire, and failed to reach show. LEMOS CUNHA saved ground from midpack, and chased the leaders through the lane, and stayed on
between horse late. REAGAN'S EDGE settled off fo the pace two wide, came into the lane three wide, but was outkicked when put to tight quarters by
