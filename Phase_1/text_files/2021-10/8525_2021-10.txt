Footnotes
PRIORITIZATION set an uncontested pace inside, continued to save ground through the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and drew off while kept to
the task. NEW YEAR SURPRISE chased midfield, bid three wide into the far turn, raced in range in the three path around the far turn, came three wide into
the lane, proved no match for the pacesetter from upper stretch but chased on second best. OPUS EQUUS came in and bumped BEHAVIN MYSELF in the
opening strides, tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and two wide down the backstretch, was urged in the two path within range behind
PRIORITIZATION on the far turn, came under a drive into the lane but could not match the top two. DYNABLUE raced near the rear through the first turn,
settled back in the rear pair outside of BEHAVIN MYSELF into the backstretch, chased two wide in the rear flight, chased in the three to four path around
the far turn, came four wide into the lane and ultimately proved no threat. BEHAVIN MYSELF was bumped by OPUS EQUUS in the opening strides, raced
at the rear through the clubhouse turn, continued at the inside of the rear pair down the backstretch, was urged in the two to three path on the far turn and
driven near the three eighths, raced into the lane between horses and lacked the needed rally. DASH TO THE CASH was a bit keen inside to the clubhouse
turn, joined inside of OPUS EQUUS into the back straight to track the leader, weakened inside from the half, was driven approaching the quarter pole, but
offered no response.

Footnotes
AIKEN TO BE angled to the inside in early stages stalking the pacesetter inside a rival racing into the bend, tipped out racing into upper stretch to split rivals
nearing the furlong marker, took over and edged forward late under firm handling. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL, held up off the second flight while angling to the
inside in the opening furlong, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail for the place honors. CHROME
ATTACK, reserved while angling to the rail in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position inside foes, then came out racing past the
sixteenth marker to bid between foes but lost some momentum when racing in tight quarters nearing the wire. LIPLINER sped to the lead while angling to
the inside in the opening furlong, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch but weakened leaving the furlong marker. SAVVY ALLY settled well
back in early stages while angling nearer to the inside, then split foes racing into the stretch to make some belated progress. WILLOW MOON was rated off
the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch while being prompted to advance and lost some momentum when drifting
five deep in late stages. BELLE BREZING was settled outside foes racing into the turn and offered no rally. MARY OF BETHANY, slow into stride, switched
outside rivals after the opening sixteenth, raced wide to the stretch and proved no threat. VENUS IN FURS tracked off the second flight between foes racing
to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. HONEY MUG tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper
stretch and soon gave way. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN made brief pursuit of the leaders outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper
stretch. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) was urged pressing a rival's pace racing into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
RIDER OF CHROME ATTACK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
KING'S STORY was sent to the lead, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch, was engaged by
MUNCH past midstretch and found enough to hold him off despite drifting slightly out and in. MUNCH tracked the leader inside, continued in range along the
rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, rallied and loomed outside of KING'S STORY past the furlong mark, but hung. IRISH TUFF was herded out
by MAGA COUNTRY in the opening strides, raced inside of OXWOOD in the rear pair early, raced three wide in the rear flight around the bend, swung five
wide into the lane under a drive, rallied with good late interest but missed. OXWOOD was keen early while racing two wide in the rear pair, bid four wide
from the seven sixteenths, was driven four to five wide in upper stretch, but leveled out in the final furlong. BLOOMING GARDEN tracked the leader two
wide, was driven three wide in the lane and flattened out. HOUR NAP raced three wide in the rear flight early, bid into the bend and chased three wide
around the turn, dropped to the inside in upper stretch and continued to improve under a drive, but weakened in the final furlong. BRIANS WAY chased
between horses, began to flatten out two wide from near the three eighths, came three wide into upper stretch, drifted out and ultimately proved empty.
MAGA COUNTRY broke outward, settled toward the rear inside, began to weaken inside from near the three eighths, was driven inside from upper stretch
and had no more for the drive.

Footnotes
CONVICT PIKE was prompted to a position between foes racing to the first turn tracking off the first flight, angled to the rail on the backstretch, steadily drew
into striking position racing into the far turn, split foes with a quarter mile to go to wrest a clear advantage, then held the challenge of EMPTY HOLSTER
through late stages under firm handling. The latter was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, switched outside rivals nearing the far
turn while being prompted to advance, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to challenge for command and contested the issue
outside the winner to the end while proving only second best. RIVER FINN, urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the first turn, shifted inwards on
the backstretch to track off the first flight, then continued evenly between foes into the stretch to prevail for a share. DRAMATIC KITTEN, bumped at the
start, settled well off the leaders while angling to the inside, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and improved position between foes just off the
inside late. MISTER CHARMING, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, advanced on the leaders to lodge a brief challenge
racing into the far turn but came up empty between foes entering the lane. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT settled into stride outside rivals racing to the
backstretch, was fanned six wide into upper stretch while being roused to advance, exchanged some contact with ROAR OF THE LION midstretch while
shifting inwards under pressure but sustained his late momentum to gain some position. ROAR OF THE LION, held up avoiding close quarters in early
stages, settled last to the far turn, gathered momentum while angling out five wide in upper stretch, was bumped, then squeezed between foes in tight
quarters midstrech and had no final kick. ZARMAE settled out of striking distance shifting a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide
racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. OVERPRAISE settled outside foes dropping off the second flight, raced three deep between foes
into upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. STAGE DOOR angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the leaders but faded after a
half. UPBEAT MELODY sprinted clear while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dueled for command inside rival racing into the second bend and
gave way abruptly once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
DRAW THE LINE chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued midfield down the backstretch while edging closer to the leader behind the
tracking flight, bid three wide into the far turn, encroached outside the leader past the three eighths in the three path, continued to loom outside the leader
through upper stretch, wrested the lead past the furlong mark and edged clear. PRINCE OF MAYHEM broke in and bumped TOWN AGENDA in the
opening strides, cleared quickly and opened up a gaping lead through the first turn, carried a diminishing but still clear lead down the back straight, saved
ground on the far turn, was engaged by DRAW THE LINE past the three eighths, clung to the lead past the furlong mark, and proved second best. TOWN
AGENDA was bumped by PRINCE OF MAYHEM in the opening strides, chased inside through the first turn, edged closer to the leader inside of MAC
PANDOWDY down the backstretch, was in range two wide through the far turn, came into the lane two wide behind the leader, chased on under a drive but
could not reel in the top two. LONESOME DREAM settled in second last, was urged in the two path through the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch
under a drive, and ultimately proved no threat. RETAIN came out in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed down the backstretch and in the four path
on the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, and offered no rally. MAC PANDOWDY was fractious in the gate, chased the leader through the clubhouse
turn, took closer order on the leader between horses down the back straight, weakened between horses from near the three eighths, floated six wide into
the lane and had nothing further for the drive.

Footnotes
STAR OF KODIAK was rated between foes in the opening three sixteenths, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the turn, swung out five wide in
upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. TUFF ATTACK ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to
stalk just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, split rivals three deep to gain the advantage
leaving the furlong marker, resisted the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe nearing the wire. HERE COMES KYLE tracked off the second flight outside
foes in early stages, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a
share late. FINNEGAN (IRE) angled to the inside in early stages racing just off the second flight, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch,
then advanced through close quarters between foes gaining position to the end. BIARRITZ shied from TUFF ATTACK at the start, was quickly righted to
pursue the leaders four wide to the turn, moved to lodge a bid three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in late stages. KENNESAW, urged between
foes disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command while angling to the inside nearing the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way
leaving the furlong marker. TIZRIK, urged inside foes pressing the pace in the opening furlong, tracked off the leaders racing into the turn and steadily faded
into upper stretch. OMAR ATTACK settled along the inside early and proved no threat. CHANNEL WON was urged to force the pace three deep in the
opening furlong, shifted in entering the turn to press the issue between foes to upper stretch and abruptly gave way. OL GREY GHOST tracked off the
second flight along the inside, shifted out nearing the lane but soon faded. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE proved no factor.

Footnotes
W W CANDY settled near the rear of the main group, rallied four wide on the turn and into the lane, engaged outside of WILL KNOWS near the three
sixteenths, led approaching the furlong pole and drove clear two wide. WILL KNOWS vied inside foes early, shook to the lead past the nine sixteenths, set
the pace in the two path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch and ran clear of everyone but W W CANDY, was engaged by that foe near the three
sixteenths and headed near the furlong pole, chased on willingly but proved second best. DEVIL'S RULE hopped as the gate opened and was slowly away,
trailed through the opening half mile, raced three wide into the stretch, angled out toward the center of the track in upper stretch, and showed good interest
late. GONEGHOST was reluctant to load, vied three wide early, tracked the pace three wide after WILL KNOWS took over the lead near the nine sixteenths,
chased three wide around the turn, swung five wide under a drive into the lane, continued to chase under a drive but was outfinished in the final furlong.
SPLASH FOR GOLD settled at the rear of the main group, was pushed along into the turn, chased in the three path around the bend, was taken six wide in
upper stretch and passed tiring horses. MORRISTON vied between horses early, tracked between past the nine sixteenths as WILL KNOWS shook to the
lead, tracked two wide into the turn, bid three wide on the leader approaching the quarter pole, but emptied out into the lane. PACHI was soundly bumped
by GIVIN UP NONE in the opening strides, chased behind the tracking flight, was pushed along in the two path on the turn and driven inside in upper
stretch, and came up empty. GIVIN UP NONE broke out and bumped PACHI in the opening strides, raced in range inside, was pushed along at the inside of
the tracking flight around the turn, tipped out two wide to bid on the leader approaching the quarter, but proved no match into the lane and weakened two
wide.

into the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch to advance on the leader, moved to challenge that foe in late stages but proved only second
best. CHICKS FOR FREE was settled outside foes in the last flight early, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and came through inside foes to gain
position to the end. Z U AT THE RACES, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled well off the leaders inside foes on the backstretch, shifted off the inside
racing into upper stretch, then split foes while caught in close quarters midstretch to improve position to the end. RENEGADE BOB was settled between
foes in the last flight early, raced wide into the stretch but proved no threat. AGAVE KID was urged exchanging some contact with SAND MOUNTAIN in the

Footnotes
SASSY LIKE JULIA settled near the rear three wide early, was pushed along and gained steadily five wide on the turn, sustained that bid into the lane, led
near the three sixteenths, and drove clear of HEY MA past the furlong mark. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE was briefly driven to keep pace from near the rear inside
early, continued near the rear inside around the bend, rallied under a drive inside in upper stretch, kept on willingly two wide and caught HEY MA for place
in the final jumps. HEY MA tracked the leader inside down the back straight, continued at the inside of the tracking flight into the turn, tipped two wide past
the three eighths to bid outside of CHICKADEE, raced into the lane in range between horses, was outkicked by SASSY LIKE JULIA to the lead near the
three sixteenths, proved no match for that foe from the furlong mark, and was nailed late for the place. DRAGONFLY KISSES settled at the rear, trailed in
the two to three path on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, and showed good late interest. STARSOVERPARADISE was reluctant to load, chased
outside of FAIRY KERI early, was pushed along three wide into the turn to join the tracking flight, raced four wide around the bend, came three wide into the
lane, and flattened out while drifting in. MY BACK PAGES settled between horses near the rear early, was driven near the rear in the three to four path on
the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, and passed tiring foes. CHICKADEE was anxious in the gate, sent to the lead, saved ground while setting the
pace on the turn, was headed at the three sixteenths and weakened inside. ANGIE'S REVRAC was keen early, tracked the leader outside of HEY MA,
continued three wide between horses in the tracking flight on the turn, began to weaken approaching the five sixteenths, and offered no more under a drive
in the lane. FAIRY KERI chased inside, came two wide into the lane, and offered no response.
