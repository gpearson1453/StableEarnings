SOPHIE RULES pressed a narrow lead through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch being ridden out in the three path. BLUEGRASS CANDY chased the
pace through the turn racing inside to upper stretch rallying in the two path to clear as second best. SWEET BELEN stalked the pace racing four wide into
upper stretch wavering there giving an even finish. SECRET AFFIRMATION lagging through the turn raced three path down the lane gaining a touch while
no menace. COUNTRY ASSETS was never involved. FLAT OUT APPEALING pressured the pace through the turn then wilted along the rail the final eighth.
YOUR EYES TO MINE was always outrun.
