ANGLE OF ATTACK well rated would save ground through the backside having to wait for room on the far turn finding said space past the quarter pole
splitting horses in upper stretch showing full of run to win clear. DOLCI unhurried early circled out giving a quick burst four deep outside the quarter pole
taking the lead to upper stretch only to be overpowered from the inside in the late going. JAIL HOUSE CODE set a pressured pace dueling on the far turn
ceding in upper stretch fading along the inside. QUARANTINA bobbled at the break hurrying after to join the pace pressing to the far turn beginning to
weaken near the quarter pole fading in upper stretch. TALK RADIO raced evenly through the far turn tiring in upper stretch. NOMBRE pressured early then
gave way on the far turn.
