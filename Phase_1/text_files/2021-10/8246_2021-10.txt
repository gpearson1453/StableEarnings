stages on the inside, then stalked two wide, moved up four wide on the far turn and closed well late outside rivals in deep stretch. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY
set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run and battled on to the end. STAR FLARE raced three wide early,
pressed the pace in the two path, chased on the far turn and tired. LAST GREAT raced off the pace inside and had no rally. JOY'S PRIDE was fractious in
the gate, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. PATRONA raced four wide early, then three wide off the pace and gave way. MAGICAL
ROMANCE dropped far back early and was outrun.

Footnotes
BEATBOX settled comfortably off the pacesetter while close up, bid two wide on the far turn, took charge at the top of the lane, responded and sprinted to a
clear lead, then dug in determinedly late to hold off the runner up. MAGICAL MARRIAGE tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn,
angled out entering the stretch, closed willingly outside of BEATBOX but could not get by that rival. DESERT COWBOY was forced out five wide entering
the first turn, then settled in the trailing position, moved up inside on the far turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch run. LE COSTE pulled early racing on
the inside, settled off the pace, waited for room on the rail midway on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane and rallied outside.
HE'SAREARVIEWTOWN showed good early speed, set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled with the winner turning for home and then weakened.
STEEL PIER raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. STASH MY CASH shifted out four wide entering the first turn, continued with a wide
trip and gave way. LOVED AGAIN raced three wide early, was steadied on the first turn, continued between rivals, then four wide at the half mile marker
and gave way in the stretch.
