Footnotes
SMASH dueled early, shook clear down the backside, repulsed a bid at the quarter pole, drew clear late under strong handling. BIG TRUCK tracked four
wide down the backside, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, was outfinished late but was second best. SPIN DOCTOR raced mid pack early, had a
mild bid in the stretch and was best of the rest. CAT'S CURIOSITY pressed early and tired after three quarters. ITASCA allowed to settle, failed to menace.
PRETTY STORMY dueled early and gradually weakened. PORT HUNTER was no factor. BLAME IT ON EDDIE was outrun.
