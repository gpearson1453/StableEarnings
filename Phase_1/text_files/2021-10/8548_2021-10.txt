Footnotes
BEAU LUMINARIE settled off of the pace two wide, commenced a rally while shifting three to four wide turning for home, then determinedly sustained his
charge through the final furlong to reach BOURBON CALLING on the wire. BOURBON CALLING pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses around
the far turn, forged an advantage passing the furlong pole, dug in as BEAU LUMINARIE menaced late, but was nailed on the wire. QUARTERBACK DAK
set the pace, showed the way from a pair of vying rivals around the far turn, clung to a narrow advantage through upper stretch, but was headed passing the
furlong pole, and held show from a pair of rivals on either side. MYSTIC NIGHT stalked along the inside, but came under coaxing into the far turn as outer
foes bid, shifted to the two path, then three path, entering the lane, but lacked a true response, and only managed to chase between horses. SHORTLIST
saved ground from midpack, awaited racing room around the far turn, then rallied along the rail to attempt a bid for the lead in midstretch, but flattened out.
TWENTY TWICE trailed around both turns, swung five wide turning for home to be widest of all, then stayed on without threatening the leaders. CANDY
TYCOON broke a step slowly, tracked three wide and outside of rivals, ranged up to the leading pair into the far turn, but faded between horses in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER settled off of the pace, tracked from the two path around the turn, smoothly shifted five wide entering the lane to split horses,
produced a good kick in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole, forged a narrow advantage late as RAM menaced, and gamely turned that rival
away. RAM trailed, swung nine wide in upper stretch, rallied well outside of foes to take aim on the leading pair in the final sixteenth, reached the leader's
throatlatch a few strides from the wire, but was denied getting past. PIPELINE stalked three wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage at
the furlong pole, dug in to resist HE'SMYHONEYBADGER's bid approaching the final sixteenth, but was bested by that foe and another rallying rival in the
final stages. IRISH UNITY vied two wide and between horses early on, allowed those foes to kick on at the five furlong pole, attempted to shifted outside of
those rivals shortly after, but was denied that racing lane by PIPELINE, stalked under mild coaxing two wide and between horses around the turn, then
chased evenly through the lane. PICKIN' TIME was brushed mildly between horses at the start, raced far off of the pace three wide into the turn, swung
seven wide turning for home, but failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. COOL QUEST dueled for the lead three to two wide, led narrowly around the
turn before drawing clear entering the lane, but offered little resistance for an outer rival at the furlong pole, and weakened. RUNWAY MAGIC tracked from
midpack four wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, but failed to bid and faded. BOCA BOY was chirped at early on to duel for the lead inside of a pair of
rivals, then just inside of COOL QUEST into the turn, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. SOUP AND SANDWICH stalked comfortably along the
inside, but offered no response to urging in upper stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
MEGACITY set the pace along the inside, was roused to resist BIZZEE CHANNEL's bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew away from that foe entering the
lane, and held sway while drifting outwardly through the final furlong. BIG DREAMING broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner foe at the start,
tucked two wide in midpack around the first turn, picked up stride while shifting four wide turning for home, rallied on his left lead to take aim on MR DUMAS
for place in midstretch while no match for the leader, and sustained his grind to wear down that foe for that position on the wire. MR DUMAS stalked along
the inside, gained place while shifting off of the rail to chase the clear leader, shifted further out to stay outside of that drifting foe while meeting BIG
DREAMING's place bid approaching the final sixteenth, dug in for that position, but was nailed on the wire. BIG AGENDA settled far back two wide, shifted
five wide entering the lane, but lacked a true rally to produce a bid, and saved a minor placing. HIERARCHY saved ground at the rear of the field around
both turns, shifted to the seven path entering the lane before tipping eight wide in upper stretch, then moved up without threatening. BIZZEE CHANNEL
broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by the leader entering
the lane, and yielded. ARGENTELLO (IRE) broke a step slowly, rated at the rear of the field two wide, gained three wide and between horses into the far
turn, awaited racing room behind traffic turning for home, tipped seven wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. ENGLISH BEE stalked two wide and
between horses, but faded on his left lead after being outkicked in upper stretch. BEAT LE BON (FR) hesitated significantly at the start, lied far off three to
four wide, swung eight wide entering the lane, and never got involved. SILVER N LAI tracked three wide, but faded while being floated wider turning for
home. SPECTACULAR GEM saved ground off of the pace, but faded.

Footnotes
CARAMEL SWIRL settled off of the pace three wide, tipped five wide entering the lane, took a brush from inner JOY'S ROCKET while commencing a rally in
upper stretch, bid along with that foe passing the furlong pole, dueled through the late stages, and prevailed on the wire. JOY'S ROCKET stalked along the
inside just behind the leaders, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted outside of the trio of leaders passing the quarter pole, brushed CARAMEL
SWIRL in the process, rallied inside of that foe to bid simultaneously with that rival passing the furlong pole, dueled gamely thereafter, but was nailed on the
wire. CILLA vied two wide and between horses, shook clear of those rivals in upper stretch, but met JOY'S ROCKET and CARAMEL SWIRL's bid passing
the furlong grounds, and yielded a sixteenth out. SHALIMAR GARDENS saved ground in midpack around the turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, and
chased on his left lead to reach a minor placing. SOUPER SENSATIONAL was void of early speed, checked behind a troubled ZAINALARAB passing the
five furlong pole, tucked into the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up. OBLIGATORY trailed in the two path, shifted to the seven path in
midstretch, and stayed on without factoring. MISS SPEEDY prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, then weakened between horses in
midstretch. STRONG SILENT set the pace inside of a pair of foes, but gave way to them in upper stretch, and weakened. MINUTE WALTZ lied forwardly
paced two wide and between horses, shied mildly from an inner foe in upper stretch, and faded. SOMEONE SAID SO tracked four wide, but faded in upper
stretch. ZAINALARAB steadied between horses at the five furlong pole, and never got involved.

Footnotes
SANTIN settled off of the pace, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid in midstretch, and forged an advantage entering the final sixteenth. PINE
KNOLL tracked from midpack, gained two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, bid in midstretch as SANTIN ranged up, but was bested by
that foe at the sixteenth pole. RICOCHET lied off of the pace two wide, gained three to four wide around the far turn, but flattened out in midstretch. EL
SOCIO broke sharply and set the pace, cleared when let out entering the lane, but offered little resistance to a pair of foes passing the furlong pole, and
yielded. GINSBURNED stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring WING COMMANDER turning for home, shifted to the three path at
the quarter pole, and chased the leaders home. HEALING failed to factor. NATHAN DETROIT lagged behind and never got involved. WING COMMANDER
stalked two wide, but weakened turning for home. NICE ACE was a bit reluctant loading, tracked three wide, ranged up two wide turning for home, but
weakened in upper stretch.
