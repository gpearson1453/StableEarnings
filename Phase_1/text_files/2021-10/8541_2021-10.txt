RELAX TOWN went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, pulled away and won easily. DATSWHATILIKE raced within striking distance, moved up on
the outside around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. DOUBLE PRIORITY raced within contention, made a late bid,
proved no match for the top two, but was an easy third. ZION'S CALL broke out at the start, racing in the rear, gained ground and finished willingly. BIG
BOSS MAN pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and faded. GOTTATAKEHIMTO raced evenly near the middle of the field and was
never a factor. AMBASSADOR HOUSE lacked early speed, came around the second turn on the outside and was never close. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE
pressed the early pace and dropped to the rear.

and was just up. SUCRE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled deep in the home stretch and just missed. KRIS T. raced near the back
in the beginning, came around the final turn on the outside, made a late bid and was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. MEMORY

UNIFIED REPORT stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up entering the final turn, dueled down the lane with FAMILY CREED and drove clear
before the wire. FAMILY CREED pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the final stretch, couldn't keep up with UNIFIED REPORT
late, but proved best of others, vanned off after race. FIESTY FIST bumped at the start, raced near the back in the early part, made a wide bid and proved
third best. DREWMAZING broke in, went to the front, saved ground and faded. TRUE DEAL raced near the back, drifted out around the first turn and was
never a threat.

CHAMBERS CREEK vied for the early lead, took command, drove clear and was kept to the task. KUDOS TO YOU raced within striking distance, made a
bid, couldn't catch CHAMBERS CREEK, but was a clear second. RICH DREAMS raced within contention in the beginning, eased back, made a late bid,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. HUSHED COURT ROOM broke in, bumped rival, raced near the middle of the field, made a mild bid
and was outfinished for third. LAST GHOST lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. A. P. STYLE shuffled back at the start, racing in the
rear and was never a threat. CLEVERINDA broke out, bumped, raced near the back and showed little. REMI'S ROSE vied for the early lead and was
finished early. ELLIE'S A WILDCAT raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.
