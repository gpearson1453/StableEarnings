Footnotes
LOOKATLITTLEFERRIS took a quick lead and set a pressured pace, dueled clear into the turn then taken in hand later yards. RUNNING ROY pressured
the early pace inside, steadied while attempting to bear out approaching the turn, actually did bear out through the turn then dug in outside through the lane
and settled for second. ARE YOU HAPPY gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and came along for third later yards. EASILY
INFLUENCED chased the early pace outside, initially followed Running Roy wide into the turn but angled to the inside midway through the turn then
flattened the final furlong. BOSEY broke through the gate prior the start, picked up the chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little further.
CHAPPIE JAMES gave chase toward the outside then rounded the turn about the four path. NODUS angled to the outside to give chase and was not a
factor. The Stewards posted the inquiry then entertained a claim of foul against the rider of Lookatlittleferris, lodged by the rider of Running Roy, though,
found no foul.

Footnotes
FOREVER TAKES TIME chased off the rail down the backstretch, drew to even terms two deep midway on the turn, took the nod into the lane, dueled clear
mid-stretch and held on well. MASTER THIS hesitated at the break and was also slow getting into stride, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn near the rail, angled to the four path into the stretch and dug in to take second later yards. IN HIGH GEAR angled to the inside to set a pressured pace,
rounded the turn at the rail, was met midway on the turn, dropped back mid-stretch then flattened later yards. QUID PRO QUO chased inside, raced near
the rail on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. MEGALODON'SREVENGE gave chase well off the rail, angled extremely wide leaving the turn and could
only improve his position. JUBA'S FANCY chased, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. GOLDEN METTLE was not a factor and
raced in the four and five paths of the turn. TAKE A SWING was kept in check through the backstretch and raced off the rail on the turn.
NEEDNOEXPLANATION gave close early chase but bore out while fading on the turn.

Footnotes
MOONLIT SHADOW tapered in to race with the pace through the front stretch and took the nod nearing the half mile pole, came under pressure past the
three eighths, was met leaving the five sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then dug in determinedly to take the nod
through later yards. JAMESTOWN ROAD rated close toward the inside, started a bid at the rail midway on the far turn, appeared a solid factor at the eighth
pole and dueled gamely to the finish while relenting the nod late yards. BRONZE DIVA raced with the pace through the front stretch and continued at near
even terms leaving the half mile pole, gave chase toward the three eighths, recovered a slim lead past the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the
rail on the far turn, was headed past the eighth pole, steadied from tight quarters between horses mid-stretch and weakened. HERETODAYGONMANANA
saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path
then flattened down the lane. ETERNAL HEART exchanged contact with TIZBIT leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn in the three path then stalked
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn, while the latter exchanged contact with Eternal Heart leaving the
gate, rounded the first turn about the three path then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn.
KATALIMA settled back off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the
incident in mid-stretch, though, made no change.

TO THE FRONT chased toward the inside, angled inside the drifting Zaino Boyz entering the stretch, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily
handled to the wire. BLACK CANDY chased off the rail, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled through the stretch to take second the final strides but
was outfinished for the win. ZAINO BOYZ surged clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the
turn at the rail, drifted into the stretch, was caught mid-stretch then outfinished for second late strides. UNNAMED SOLDIER gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and finished well while gaining on the top three. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN became a bit anxious in the gate
then hopped at the break, picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly to pass rivals. SINGANOTHERSONG gave
chase toward the outside, raced in the five path of the turn and showed little further. ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail
then weakened.

Footnotes
TAPIZAR GIRL saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail through the turn, dueled for the lead past the eighth pole, raced
clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. BELLA GABRIELLA settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid approaching the three
eighths pole, dueled to a slim brief lead three wide midway on the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole then relented the final sixteenth. SUPER
EIGHTY EIGHT settled off the pace inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the far turn,
angled four wide into the stretch and finished well to take third later yards. PLAY CHARADES rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole, was carried to the eight path toward the head of the lane then finished evenly outside. COFFEE AND HER settled back off
the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path, angled inside the drifting Peachy Between Us at the eighth
pole and finished evenly. BETTER BOAT tapered in and took the lead nearing the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving
the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened approaching mid-stretch. CHERISH YOUR DREAM rounded the
opening turn about the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the eight path of the far
turn and showed little more. PEACHY BETWEEN US stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened while drifting on the
far turn. BURNISHED BRIGHT settled off the pace in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn.
JASIRA showed little response through the backstretch.
