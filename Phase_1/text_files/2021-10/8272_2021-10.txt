Footnotes
BLUSHING BETTY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
gained a short lead, then shook clear and drew off, while being kept to the task. KEYPIT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid
three wide outside the leader, then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. UNWANTED INPUT mid pack, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the show late. WATERLOO SUNSET sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. ZIDIKAI broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and evened out. COUNTESS JESSICA was no factor. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, BLUSHING BETTY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

PATTI D allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear late. WILD IRISH
tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. HUNTRESS MOON allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, angled out for clear racing room, then drifted in and lacked the needed late kick. POSH PLAYDAY set the pace just off the rail, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. GOLDEN SWEETS stalked the pace on the outside and faded three wide through the
turn. BOCA well placed and outside, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and had no rally. BACK TO BUSINESS was
no factor, inside. LIGHTNING FIRE stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded
the final furlong.

Footnotes
PATROL mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rival, shook clear, then drew off the final furlong. WILD WINTER allowed to
settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled in for clear racing room and closed well for the place. SCOBY
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong.
OLDZFOURFORTYTWO well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. RED HOT
LOOKS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. KING ECLIPTICAL mid pack,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and had no rally. FAHRENHEIT reared badly at the start and was no factor. A
