Footnotes
JOHN'S ROCK close up from the start, closed willingly on the far turn four wide then three wide into the stretch, made the lead and shook clear under left
handed urging. IHADADREAM trailed into the far turn, swung wide, rallied in the six path and gained second. CENTRIFUGE allowed to settle, circled rivals
rapidly five wide making the lead on the far turn, set the pace into the stretch, angled in two wide then was outfinished. ENJOY BASEBALL stalked the early
pace, offered a bid along the inside into the second turn and was also outfinished. INCORRIGIBLE stalked the early pace, loomed boldly four wide nearing
the far turn then came up empty. MAGICAL EXPRESS pressed the pace along the inside through the clubhouse turn, made the lead, set the pace to the far
turn then gave way. KLAATU rushed to the lead three wide before a quarter, had speed for a half then stopped.

SALLY STRONG chased the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to make the lead, shied from the whip repeatedly through the stretch, was well handled
and maintained her advantage under brisk handling. MATT'S HONEY unhurried early, rallied steadily along the rail through the stretch and got up for
second. LIBERTY BELLE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for nearly six furlongs, shifted outside the winner then was
outfinished in the six path. BALLROOM BLITZ chased the pace from the inside, angled outside entering the stretch and finished evenly in the seven path.
ARTISTIC JEWLER failed to menace. SHE'S CRAFTY was outrun. KITTY EXPRESS was no threat. THE RIDER OF LIBERTY BELLE LODGED A CLAIM
