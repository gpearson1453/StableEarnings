Footnotes
GET BACK GOLDIE vied briefly from inside then cleared on the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, kicked clear around the final bend and held a
comfortable margin to the wire under strong handling. ROY C off a bit slow to begin, tracked outside a rival then between foes, took the second turn two
wide and finished well for the place honors. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS stalked the pace from inside, paused briefly at the three-eighths, stayed inside to the
stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SUNDOWN WARREN rated in midpack on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and improved position.
LOOKOUT POINT traveled along the inside early on the moved off the rail, went two wide through the far turn and could not rally. RIVIERA CHAMP broke
well and showed early speed outside a rival, ceded control around the first turn, stalked from outside up the backstretch, chased three wide leaving the bend
and faded. STATE OF THE UNION off a step slow to start, pulled a bit early, reserved near the back, came three wide into the lane, moved out in the
stretch and failed to threaten. CHRIS FIX off slow to begin, angled to the inside, moved out in the middle stages, angled back to the rail around the far turn
and was not a factor. HANNIGAN pulled and fought the rider early, came four wide into the drive and weakened. RECAPTURED FREEDOM got bumped
and forced out early on the first turn, settled near the back and failed to menace. WALKING BOSS raced between foes then lugged out and bumped rival
early on the first turn, remained off the rail, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA STREET off a bit slow to begin, settled at the back, angled four wide around the turn, ranged up three wide into the stretch, rallied to the front
in upper stretch, cleared briefly at the eighth pole and held well under urging. DEFENSE WINS stalked inside a rival along the inside, tipped two wide
leaving the turn, steered back to the inside in the stretch, rallied and gained the place. PLAY CHICKEN stalked the lone leader outside a rival, bid alongside
at the quarter pole, took over soon after and led into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong and got edged for second.
BEAR CHUM (AUS) in range off the inside, navigated the turn three wide and lacked the needed response. MARINERS WAY sped clear from outside,
challenged from outside with a quarter mile remaining, relinquished the lead leaving the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
LURE HIM IN rated off the rail in the early going, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, came in a bit at the three-eighths, took aim three wide into the
lane, bid alongside at the eighth pole and drove past. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE tracked the pace from inside, raced a bit off the rail into the lane, moved back
inside and rallied along the fence to earn the place. SECRET CLUB tossed his head and came away last, unhurried in the early stages, advanced four wide
on the final turn and put in a mild late bid. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) hustled to the front from inside, took an awkward step on the dirt crossing but recovered
quickly, set all the pace to the stretch, received a challenge with a furlong to go, lost the lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded lat. LUVLUV reserved in the
early stages between foes, angled out to the four path on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the final furlong.
PROUD PEDRO (FR) taken to the inside early, shied from the rail entering the clubhouse turn, lacked room past the three-eighth pole, angled off the rail
and could not rally in the lane. EXALTED JOY stalked in the two path, got shuffled between foes past the three-eighths pole, dropped back from inside on
the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
LUCK OF THE DRAW showed early speed three deep then took back to stalk the top pair on the first turn, raced up close four deep at the seven-sixteenths
pole, vied challenged three deep on the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and shook free to win going away. MONGOLIAN WIND raced between foes early
then dueled for command outside a rival, vied three deep into the far turn, between foes around the bend, dueled with LUCK OF THE DRAW in upper
stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the late stages but was clearly second best. UNBROKEN STAR off a bit slow at the start, settled off the
pace, moved closer then bid between past the half-mile pole, vied inside on the far turn, then weakened in the drive. INVICTATATUS showed early speed
along the inside, dueled for command in the early stages, vied with rivals into the far turn, lost contact with three-eighths remaining and faded in the lane.
MAJOR CABBIE raced up close four deep into the first turn, dropped back to chase widest of all, sustained an injury past the half-mile pole, unseated the
rider, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BIG SUMMER broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked the top pair outside a rival, took aim three wide into the lane, drew alongside at the eighth
pole, dueled with KITTEN'S KID in the furlong grounds and edged the runner-up on the line. KITTEN'S KID set the pace under pressure, held a short lead
on the inside through the turn, put away FEELING GRAZEFUL in upper stretch, met the challenge from BIG SUMMER with a furlong to go, battled to the
stretch and missed. ISSA COURT showed early speed then rated just off the leader on the inside, saved ground around the turn, lacked room in upper
stretch, gained a clear path and finished willingly for the show. FEELING GRAZEFUL pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, lost contact in
upper stretch and flattened to a minor award. PIAZZETTA raced in mid-pack early on, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the stretch but never
threatened. CHAO MAR moved to the inside while settling off the pace, cut the corner into the drive and never rallied. SPANISH CHANNEL traveled in
midpack outside a rival, went three wide into the lane and could not rally. BIG NEWS COMING got bumped from outside at the start, raced between foes
near the back, steered four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SHANGHAI DAZZLER tracked two to three wide around the turn and weakened.
SHEZ OUR ARCH raced three deep near the back of the pack, got floated five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MISTAKA dropped back early,
moved down to the two path, went three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

QUEENGOL pressed from between rivals, dueled around the turn, took full control in upper stretch, lost command on a lead change at the sixteenth pole,
switched back to the correct lead late and came back to edged the runner-up. BIG SWEEP off a bit slow to begin, tugged from inside behind the pacesetter,
waited for room around the turn, rallied between foes in the stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole but faltered in the closing moments. FOUNDER'S DAY
reserved in the early going, went three to four wide around the turn, four deep in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. FULL OF GRACE attended
the pace three deep early, chased the top pair around the turn two to three wide and churned on for a minor award. HONOR AMERICA set the pace under
pressure on the inside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
NEPTUNE'S STORM raced up close to the outside of the speed, bid alongside around the second bend, took over with a furlong remaining, cleared briefly
with a sixteenth to go and prevailed. ORDER AND LAW stalked the leader from inside, saved ground then moved out in the stretch, closed well but was too
late. LAMBEAU set the pace on the inside, met the challenger from outside on the far turn, fought back in upper stretch, lost command at the eighth pole
and stayed on to secure the show. MAJESTIC EAGLE came away a bit slow, moved to the inside while allowed to settle, taken off the rail on the
backstretch, went two to three wide around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and needed to find more in the final sixteenth. DUBBY DUBBIE coaxed
from the gate, settled off the pace, angled to the inside in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SHOOTERS SHOOT went three then two wide around the first
turn, chased in range outside a rival, exited the far turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BARBWIRE pressed the pace from outside, challenged leaving the far turn, grabbed the lead at the three-sixteenths pole, cleared at the eighth pole, then
held the runner-up at bay. TOUCHDOWN BROWN off a bit slow from outside, went three wide around the first turn, angled to the inside in middle stages,
steered out and came four wide into the lane, rallied outside the winner but was not enough to get by. DIVINE ARMOR raced two wide then moved to the
rail on the clubhouse turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. WILLY THE COBBLER raced along the inside
then moved off the rail on the first turn, went two wide into the second bend, angled out and came four wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and
kept on to round out the superfecta. SYNTHESIS set the pace under pressure from outside, pressed upon with a quarter of a mile remaining, lost command
at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened in the late stages. JACK SPROUT settled off the pace, angled inside a rival entering the stretch and had little left
for the drive. FAMILY BIZ was a bit rank between rivals at the start then became hard to ride entering the first turn, guided off the rail, raced three deep at
the back, trailed four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
TONITO'S got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, allowed to settle off the pace, raced in the two path into the turn, swung out and entered the stretch
six wide, closed fast and inhaled the runner-up in the final sixteenth. SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH went up to challenge for the lead from inside early, cleared
at the seven-sixteenths pole, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth marker and got run down by the winner. URBAN
broke well then settled outside rivals, took the turn three to four wide, went between at the eighth pole, tipped outside late and got up for the show. SHE'S
SO SHINY away quickly from outside, dueled for command outside a rival, could not keep up leaving the backstretch, chased two wide into the turn, moved
out and came four wide into the stretch, kept to task in the drive but finished evenly late. SILENT BEAUTY tracked the pace on the inside, hugged the rail to
the stretch and improved position. BOOZE RUNNER stalked the pace on the inside then exited the bend two wide and lacked the needed late punch. MISS
MATTIE B got bumped on both sides at the start, checked between early, raced four deep on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane, got crowded
between foes at the eighth pole and could not summon a late bid. ENGLISH MEADOW broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled to the inside and
settled off the pace, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and passed tired rivals. KJOS KID shifted in and bumped rival at the start, came over a bit
again early, chased outside a pair of rivals, three then four wide around the turn and weakened. VULIN chased off the rail then between foes early, took the
turn two wide and weakened. LONELY ON TOP stalked between rivals, two then three wide around the turn and weakened. ONE ARROW off slow to begin,
lagged behind up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and was never a factor.
