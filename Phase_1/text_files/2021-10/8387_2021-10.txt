LOOPY advanced into the far turn wresting the lead outside the quarter pole digging in four then five wide down the lane holding daylight to the wire.
AZLYNN'S DREAMER tracked the pace vying in the three path in upper stretch angling out to the four slot mid stretch pressing the winner to the wire.
ADULTING broke sharply setting the pace through the backside being engaged on the far turn weakening there near the rail. COOLER SCHEDULE stalked
the pace chasing into the far turn, wavered into upper stretch finishing evenly in the four path. MERMAID KISSES in tight at the break played no factor.
WALKIN PRINCESS was never involved. POPPY'S GIRL had brief position then faded nearing the half.
