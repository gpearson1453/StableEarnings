Footnotes
SOUTHERN RUNNER pressed the pace outside then wore down the pacesetter following a long drive. THAT'S RIGHT moved clear inside, drifted in slightly
near the three sixteenths pole and was nailed nearing the wire. CAVE MAN chased wide throughout and continued willingly. ULTIMATE DARE broke
slowest, advanced inside, was taken up sharply, struck the rail moving into the stretch losing any chance.. RAGING TEMPEST dropped back early and
weakened steadily. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of ULTIMATE DARE against the rider of THAT'S RIGHT for interference near
the head of the stretch, THAT'S RIGHT was disqualified and placed fourth.

FLIGHT RISK settled inside, swung very wide into the stretch and surged to get up in time. AMERICAN ROMA stalked the leaders outside, led on the final
turn but was caught late. MACH TRIAL angled inside advancing on the final turn then weakened in the stretch. SPRING EMPEROR chased three wide and
lacked a solid rally. ARRIVEDERCI controlled the pace for five furlongs and faltered. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE dropped well behind, moved extremely wide
into the stretch. GET THE W saved ground close up for half a mile and faded. CATCH FIRE saved ground off the leaders and was never a factor.
DIAMOND SETTER dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

ASSUME CONTROL controlled the pace inside, widened on the final turn and remained safe driving. FINE ONE WON reserved close up outside, pursued
the winner, finished gamely but proved no match. CHARITY STRIPE dropped far behind inside then closed well while no threat. MISS LOYALTY broke
sluggishly then passed fading rivals. MINESHAFT MAGIC prompted pace inside for five furlongs and faltered. SENSE A MILLION rated behind wall of rivals
and lacked a rally. MISS DILLINGHAM lunged at the start, moved quickly to contention then tired. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE chased off the pace and gave
way readily. LORDEN'S LOVE stumbled badly at the start unseating her rider.

LAZARETTO rushed to command outside, drew away on the turn and remained clear driving. HACHACHA far back early, moved wide on the turn and
rallied for the place. RISING STORM advanced in the two path, split rivals rallying in the stretch. ILOVECHARLYBROWN trailed early, moved inside and
closed big gap too late. I SAW IT ALL was urged close up inside to the stretch and faltered. COMBAT RIBBON chased very wide throughout and lacked a
rally. EXTREME FORCE chased wide down the backstretch and came up empty. EXPENSIVE dropped far back and was never a factor. BEST START
lacked speed wide and was always outrun. DAGGERBOARD raced wide and weakened steadily. BIG TIME OPERATOR flashed speed then stopped
abruptly.
