Footnotes
STEEL CITY DUDE was ridden along out of the gate and vied outside of WADADA, shook free past the half mile marker and held firm around the turn,
roused for more turning for home, had more left in reserve and finished clear. UNION FREEDOM tracked the top flight though early stages, launched a bid
for STEEL CITY DUDE midway around the turn, edged closer to to the winner but had to settle for second best. KUHL STAR was forwardly placed through
the backstretch then headed in pursuit approaching the quarter pole, was ridden along two wide into the lane and finished clear over the rest. FROSTY
WARRIOR raced off the pace, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BAD GUS settled through the backstretch, hustled up on
the inside around the turn and never threatened. ALABAMA JAMMA was off slow at the start, was reserved along the outside and never reached contention.
WADADA vied with the winner through the backstretch then steadily faded. POWER G was restless in the gate and never menaced.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY raced up close just off the leader in early stages, hustled along two wide into the lane then advanced to challenge for the lead at the
eighth pole, dug in gamely along the outside of MUTED and edged by in late strides. MUTED was a half step slow at the start then surged between foes and
took over the lead, held on top over close running LIGHTENING LARRY around the turn, saved ground then came under attack from aforementioned foe at
the eighth pole, fought back from the inside and got denied late. YES I'M A BEAST tracked in close range near the inside, given cue three wide leaving the
turn and sustained a steady bid through the lane. DEAL GO DOWN steadied inside near the half mile marker, angled out late on the backstretch and failed
to move into contention. RUSSIAN TO WIN showed response in the opening quarter then retreated.

GRRR hit the side of the gate at the break, stalked on the inside through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, roused forward and
took over the lead from POLITICAL RIOT near mid-stretch then held late over surging NOT SO EASY. NOT SO EASY was unhurried and saved ground,
rode the rail around the far turn then angled out approaching the upper stretch, got clear and kicked in four wide, surged to the wire and just missed.
SULEMAN settled off the pace between rivals, responded along the outside under pressure in the lane and rallied to take a share. BIG CITY RED settled
and saved ground near midpack, sat patiently around the far turn, headed in pursuit two wide at the head of the lane, raced in strong contention at the
eighth pole but lacked the needed kick to move on. POLITICAL RIOT stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved up two wide and took over the
lead at the quarter pole, remained on top into the lane then got collared by the winner and gave way in the final furlong. TRACEABILITY fanned four wide
heading into the first turn then rated near midpack, hustled along three to four wide around the far turn and failed to move on. KLEON settled through early
stages, advanced to race in range at the quarter pole then gave way. KHOZANDO raced in the back then wide into the lane and failed to move on. NO
GETTING OVER ME raced in range through early stages, came under a ride around the far turn, failed to advance and gave way. GUNMAN set the pace,
got collared near the quarter pole and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
KHOZMORE was forwardly placed in the opening quarter sitting in striking range of the top pair, let out a notch and advanced to challenge for the lead three
furlongs out, match strides around the turn then came under pressure at the top of the lane, responded willingly and kicked clear. COREY tracked the top
flight in the opening quarter then hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and got up late to capture place.
RESTOFTHESTORY moved up the inside in opening stages and matched LIZA STAR for the lead, dueled inside a duo around the turn then failed to move
on with winner at the head of the lane, stayed on and got edged late for place. BARGAINAIRE tracked the top flight near the inside, swung out four wide
heading into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LIZA STAR gained the advantage soon after the start then was quickly matched by RESTOFTHESTORY,
took on the added challenge of the winner at the three eighths pole, dueled between foes around the turn then gave way in the lane. NACHO MAMA shifted
off the inside and raced in the back, was ridden along three to four wide around around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
TWELVE VOLT MAN dueled inside of BIG THORN though the backstretch, continued to battle inside of rival around the turn, shook free under pressure at
the head of the lane, stayed on gamely and kept clear. MAGIC ECLIPSE tracked the embattled pair through early stages, tipped out three wide and given
cue near the quarter pole, sustained a solid bid through the lane but could not get to the winner. BIG THORN dueled outside of TWEVLE VOLT MAN
through the backstretch and around the turn, could not kick on with the winner in the upper stretch but stayed on for a share. CREATIVE CLOUD rated near
midpack along the outside, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn and failed to move on. MENELIK stalked the embattled pair through the
backstretch, remained in range three wide around the turn then weakened. DEVOTED KITTEN settled inside not too far back for a half then angled out and
steadily weakened. SEAZAN raced in the back, went six wide into the lane and made no headway.

Footnotes
SPECTACULAR GAL settled nicely while rated through early stages, let out a notch and moved up to take a slim lead at the quarter pole, responded
willingly when put to a drive turning for home and drew off through the lane. SPLICER tracked the pace near the inside, lodged a rail bid around the far turn,
came off the inside in the lane and lasted for place. CAGUA raced wide on the first turn the remained unhurried, swung wide into the lane and rallied for
show. BABY BLUE raced off the pace, cut the corner entering the lane then angled out a path and finished evenly. MY D'VALENTINE settled inside not too
far off the early pace, hustled up on the rail around the far turn, stayed on two wide in the upper stretch then flattened out. DOLCISIMA was reserved in the
back, went four wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. MISS BETH'EL raced wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, gained three to four
wide turning for home then weakened in the lane. UNBRIDLED CHROME raced near midpack and had no response when called upon. RACHEL DREAM
raced near the back then two to three wide into the lane and never threatened. OODLES ON FIRE saved ground and failed to move into contention. CUPID
AUSTIN stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a bid entering the far turn then came up empty near the quarter pole. LIBERTALIA set the
clear pace, got collared by the winner around the far turn then retreated.
