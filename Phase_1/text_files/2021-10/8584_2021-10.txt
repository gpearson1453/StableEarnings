Footnotes
ALL AMERICAN JEWEL went evenly through the turn surging to hook rival in upper stretch drawing out late. MORALITY CLAUSE off slowly gave a mild
move on turn finding a belated burst to save place. QUICKSTRIKE away alertly set the pace through the turn being hooked in upper stretch weakening
under pressure. DATA PRINCESS pressured the pace through the turn wearing down the final eighth. JACKIE MILTON flashed early speed weakening on
the turn fading to upper stretch. SOUPER CAPACITY played no factor. DADDY'S STORM was never involved. BEE WINGS folded up on the turn. YOUR
EYES TO MINE gave way on the turn.
