Footnotes
VENERATE lacked early speed, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command four wide leaving the eighth pole, put away those rivals leaving the
sixteenth pole and lasted over LOYAL LOUIE'S late charge. LOYAL LOUIE tracked the pace two wide, shifted widest nearing the eighth pole and closed
outside to just miss. EMICRACK (CHI) steadied early, advanced three wide around the turn, led briefly leaving the eighth pole and was outkicked. THE
GLADIATOR (CHI) chased the pace two wide, lacked room for most of the stretch, angled out in deep stretch and improved position. GUNMAN set the pace
in the two path and tired in the final furlong. C. P. A. GENIUS was reluctant to load, checked early, raced three wide and never threatened. FACTORINO
had speed inside and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH was never far back, ranged up to poke a head in front outside of INDEED INDEED with five-sixteenths remaining, took over at the
top of the stretch, drifted out while clear and widened under busy handling. JUST PLAIN ORNERY absorbed a hard bump from PANADERO and was
knocked outward a couple paths at the break, began to advance out of the second flight after a half-mile four wide, could not menace the winner in the
stretch but ran on clearly second best on his left lead. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was a step slow to begin, saved ground throughout and failed to menace
with an even finish. PANADERO broke out slamming into JUST PLAIN ORNERY, was outrun early inside, drifted six wide at the top of the lane, and
continued to drift out past the middle of the track late. EYE ON THE CANDY chased the leaders from outside for a half, and tired. INDEED INDEED vied
early inside CREATIVE MAGIC, shook clear after a quarter-mile, showed the way into the turn two wide, got headed by the winner near the five-sixteenths
and folded up. CREATIVE MAGIC vied outside INDEED INDEED leaving the chute, could not keep pace with that one approaching the turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
CASANOVA QUEEN broke alertly, closed the gap on SENA THE DUCHESS from outside approaching the turn, took over past the three-eighths, remained
clear to 70 yards out, then had enough to hang on. COMMISSIO broke outward, chased three to four wide to the top of the stretch, finished willingly outside
the winner but came up just short. SENA THE DUCHESS dashed clear after the start, could not cope with CASANOVA QUEEN midway on the turn, and ran
on well enough to remain clear for the show. OUR GIRL was outrun early inside, moved to the two-path leaving the turn and could not threaten. MILENITA
was finished early. EFFIES GIRL retired soon after going a quarter-mile.

GONE NUTS prompted the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch, drew clear and switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and held clear
under a drive. UPTOWN LIGHTS raced off the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch and surged between foes. EL BAILADOR was in range three wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and just lasted for the show. ALWAYS GAMBLING was devoid of speed, raced two wide around the turn, shifted
further out in upper stretch and closed with a rush. SIMPLIFICATION saved ground in range, angled four wide in upper stretch and went evenly.
IMPENETRABLE set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. CASSIDYS GOLD was outrun while racing two wide. TOYI hopped at the start,
raced three wide and played no factor.

SHEZA HAPPY GIRL pursued the leaders from a distance, gradually moved out four wide around the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, and kicked in
late to get up. PALMGIRL set the pace removed from the inside, remained clear past the eighth-pole, yielded to the winner late and just saved the place.
EMUNAH pressed PALMGIRL from outside to the stretch, stayed on with good courage while widest and was inching closer to the finish. SCIENCE got
outpaced by the leaders around the turn, came four wide into the lane and ran on evenly. DON'T LOSE HOPE veered out sharply at the break, trailed
outside to the stretch, moved inward and could not gain.

LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN was in range inside, tried to split rivals near the seven-sixteenths pole but was forced to take back and go around three wide, angled
back in near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied inside, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and pulled away under confident handling late. KATE'S KINGDOM
raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, continued to gain two wide around the far turn, took a brief lead
nearing the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner in the final seventy yards. CENTSLESS DRAMA pressed the pace two wide, dueled outside
down the backstretch, cleared entering the far turn, set the pace along the rail from there to the sixteenth pole then weakened. COPPER failed to menace
while racing two and three wide. PLATINUMCENTS hopped and hit the gate to get away last, steadied along while trying to get out around the first turn,
went four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. KARENVILLE dueled inside for a half then retreated. TAKE ME AS I AM was outrun inside. JOSEFA
stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S ROSE was coaxed along to stay in range early inside, shifted out three wide looming between horses at the top of the stretch, stayed on task
and wore down ACTING LUCKY from outside. ACTING LUCKY vied inside BARGAINAIRE for three furlongs, edged away turning for home, stayed on well
but could not withstand the winner. MASTERING BELA raced three then four wide for the opening three-eighths of a mile, had aim outside the leaders
through the stretch but did not have enough. BARGAINAIRE contested the pace outside ACTING LUCKY to the top of the stretch, then weakened. TRUE
ATKA broke a step slow, and never factored. VICTORY CRUSADE trailed inside throughout.

Footnotes
MORE ADVENTUROUS bumped with ECCENTRICO at the start, raced off the pace four wide, kicked in in upper stretch, blew past the leader leaving the
eighth pole and drew off under mild urging. BACKATYA prompted the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, held clear past
the eighth pole but had no answer for the winner. ECCENTRICO bumped with the winner at the start, raced well back four wide and was along for the show.
SUNSPOT stumbled a few strides after the start, trailed outside early, angled to the rail entering the turn and improved position inside. SHIRLEY'S
SHERMAN chased the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. MINISTER QUINN steadied near the half-mile pole, saved ground in
range, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. WHISKEYONHISLIPS was in range three wide, was in a bit
tight in upper stretch and retreated. REGAL HOLIDAY set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the lane.
