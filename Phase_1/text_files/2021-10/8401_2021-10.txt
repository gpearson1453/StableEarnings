path into the lane, strolled past the leader and drew off down the lane while geared down to the wire. SUPER SPORT set the pace early, was on the inside
into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. LADY CLEMENTINE tracked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane and was no
match for the top two down the lane. BENEDICTINESISTERS was bumped shortly after leaving the gate and trailed the field early on, was in the five path
into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. LIVING FOR TODAY raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane and empty late in the stretch run.

STAND TALL tracked the pace from the outset, was in the three path entering the lane for the final time, made a bid in the upper stretch, inched clear near
the eighth pole and held sway in the final stages. HONOR HOP stalked the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid three wide down the
lane but did not have enough in the late stages. ASK BAILEY broke awkwardly and was bumped at the start, chased the pace early on, was in the three
path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but lugged in and hung in the final stages. FIRST COURSE trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the
lane for the final time with a belated gain in the stretch run. CAT'S PAJAMAS chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and flattened out late
in the stretch drive. SPANX LEGACY raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch. PETER'S KITTEN raced back
early on, was in the five path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch. UNDISTURBED set a clear pace early along the first turn,
remained in front along the backstretch, was in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN chased the pace early on,
went wrong nearing the wire for the first time then was pulled up and vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
ONE FAST CAT prompted the pace three wide, vied outside of ON K P around the turn, took over entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure
through midstretch before being put to hand urging in the final sixteenth. BEER CHASER vied for the lead inside of ONE FAST CAT, then from between
horses leaving the five furlong pole as ON K P rushed inside, failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, chased them from between horses around
the bend, shifted three wide in upper stretch to regain place while proving no match for the leader, then held that position from an outer MISTS OF TIME
through the late stages. MISTS OF TIME stalked three wide before being floated four wide entering the lane, but was outkicked for place by an inner foe in
upper stretch, kept on to vie for that position in the final furlong, but failed to reach BEER CHASER late. VIOLENT PASS saved ground off of the pace, and
failed to factor while passing a tiring foe in midstretch. ON K P got hustled to lie close up along the inside in the opening furlong, but pulled on the rider to
improve to vying position passing the five furlong pole, showed the way inside of ONE FAST CAT in the early stages of the turn, but proved no match for
that foe entering the lane, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
ARM CANDY tracked comfortably from the two path, shifted four wide and outside of URBAN FAIRYTALE in upper stretch, rallied with that foe to bid
passing the furlong marker, dueled through the late stages, and edged an advantage in the final sixteenth. URBAN FAIRYTALE stalked along the inside,
shifted outside of the leading pair approaching the final three sixteenths, rallied inside of ARM CANDY to bid with that foe inside the furlong grounds, dueled
with that rival through the late stages, but was outfinished. SUN SUMMERS tracked from midpack while hung in the four path around the first turn, shifted
from the three to four path around the far turn before being floated five wide in upper stretch, then chased inner rallying foes home to reach show in the final
sixteenth. EMPRESS ELEANOR settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted five, then six, wide in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of foes for a
minor share. TIMELESS ROSE showed the way from a pressing NAVAL LAUGHTER down the backstretch, got headed by that foe turning for home, but
regained an advantage in upper stretch as her rival tired, but hung on her left lead, faltered passing the furlong pole, then was eased up after the rider stood
up approaching the final sixteenth. PICASSO COLLECTION settled far back two wide, cut the corner turning for home, and improved without threatening.
DISCREET KITTY shied into the first turn from an inner rival, stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, then weakened in upper stretch.
GAMBLIN TRAIN lied far off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. NAVAL LAUGHTER came out into the first turn causing DISCREET KITTY to shy
into FUNNYBET, pressed the pace setter in earnest from the outside, came under urging into the far turn to bid with five sixteenths to go, briefly showed the
way entering the lane, but was re-headed by his inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, then weakened between horses passing the furlong grounds,
and was eased late. AUDREY'S TIME saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. FUNNYBET shied into the first turn from an inner foe, raced rankly
around that bend due to the incident, then trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
FIRE SWORD set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a vying SWIFTSURE around the turn, repelled that rival and shook clear passing the
quarter pole, then held sway safely under driving pressure. KINETIC SKY broke a beat slowly and trailed the short field around the turn, drifted inwards
while chasing the main pack in midstretch, but was steered four wide inside the final furlong to split foes passing the sixteenth pole, then belatedly surged to
reach place on the wire. THERIDEOFALIFETIME tracked two wide, and between horses around the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, grinded away
to bid for place in midstretch while not threatening the leader, reached that placing a sixteenth from home, but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe.
SHADOW MATTER had a visible layer of sweat on his left shoulder entering the gate, tracked from off of the pace three wide, got floated four wide entering
the lane, chased without progressing through midstretch, then kept on late. UPSTRIKER was also warm pre-race, chased along the inside, saved ground
before attempting a bid for place inside of foes in upper stretch, but yielded a sixteenth from home. SWIFTSURE pressed the pace two wide, vied around
the turn, but was turned away entering the lane, then weakened between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA ANGEL settled far off of the pace, took the far turn in the four to five paths before swinging eight wide entering the lane, then produced a
steady grinding rally outside of foes while hanging on her left lead to reach the leading pair on the wire. DIAMOND WOW tracked four wide, ranged up to the
leaders turning for home while well in hand, produced a good kick when let out in upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of TURNERLOOSE approaching the
final sixteenth, got herded outwards from that drifting foe while forging an advantage, led late, but was nailed on the wire. TURNERLOOSE set the pace
along the inside, shook clear turning for home before being maneuvered to the three path entering the lane, remained clear into the final furlong, but was
tested by DIAMOND WOW leaving that station, drifted out while resisting that foe's bid, but was headed a sixteenth out, continued to drift, and was bested.
DRESSED lied off of the pace in the three path, gained in the five path around the far turn, managed a grinding rally through the lane while chasing between
horse, but lost momentum when herded outwards in the late stages by the leaders, got outkicked approaching the wire, and leveled off. OPALINA brushed
the gate while hopping a bit at the start, lied far back two wide, shifted to the four path around the far turn before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and
stayed on between horses. ROUGHLY A DIAMOND saved ground while tracking the pace, but failed to produce a bid. MISTHAVEN (IRE) settled far off of
the pace, took the far turn in the three path before shifting six wide entering the lane, and chased between horses through the final furlong before leveling
off. KNEESNHIPS saved ground far off of the pace, moved to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses late. BHOMA stalked along the
inside, but chased through upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. QUEEN JUDITH trailed, came into the lane in the seven path, and moved
up. RIGBY stalked three wide, crept forward turning for home, but tired in upper stretch. BOXING DAY tracked two wide, but faded through the lane.
ONTHEONESANDTWOS pressed the pace two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED.
