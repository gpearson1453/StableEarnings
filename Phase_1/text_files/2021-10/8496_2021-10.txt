OUCH THAT HURT Set the pace along the rail while pressed, responded leaving the furlong marker and drew clear late. SPARTINA SPLASH Well placed
along the three path, gained on that path to almost reach the leaders, challenged a furlong out to no avail but did hold the place. SINGLE VERSE Broke
slow, saved ground on the turn and finished well inside. RISKY ANALYSIS Unhurried along the two path, eased out a path into the lane and lacked the
needed rally. CLARA'S GONE WEST Contested the lead along the two path to the lane and tired. CITY TEMPER Broke a step slow, four wide on the turn

issue along the two path, took over nearing the furlong marker, was soon collared and then finished clearly best of the rest. CHRISTMAS DINNER Well
placed along the three path, angled out, was no match for the top pair but finished with interest. STABILIZE Well placed four wide on the turn into the lane
and weakened. TREATHERLIKESTAR Saved ground and tired. OFFLEE IRISH Ducked in at the start, two path on the turn, was outrun. LUNE LAKE Set
the pace along the rail while pressed and then was leaving the three-sixteenths pole. HEARTBUSTINGIRL Broke slow, checked in the chute, five wide into

Footnotes
A VOW OF BEAUTY In hand along the three path, gained along the rail on the last turn to reach the leader, put that one away and under pressure got the
job done. KODIAK BROWN Unhurried along the two path, three path into the final turn, eased out into the stretch and rallied. BETA Vied for the lead two
path, battled the winner into the lane and finished with interest. DR. MARBOOZ Unhurried along the rail, two path on the last turn, angled out some and
made a late bid. HERECOMESTHEJUDGE Well placed four wide to the lane and weakened. MAGNETRON Vied for the lead along the rail, checked into
the last turn and tired. INALIENABLE RIGHTS Hopped at the start, three path on the turns, was not a factor. FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR Saved ground after a
half mile and tired. A COLT NAMED SUSIE Broke slow, four wide leaving the first turn and continued four wide into the lane.
