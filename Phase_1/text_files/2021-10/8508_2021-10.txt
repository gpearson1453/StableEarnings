Footnotes
QUEEN SHASTA vied for early lead, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide rally and drove clear before the wire. VELVET ISLE raced within
striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HANGING LAKE void of early
speed, moved up around the turn, split rivals down the lane and finished willingly. GABY'S PROMISE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
lacked a late kick. BUILDING HOME dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. DROP O' CHOCOLATE raced within contention, settled in the
middle of the field and finished evenly. WISH FOR INTEREST raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
SOPHISTICATED GIRL vied for the early lead, faded and was no threat late. BACK INTHAT ACTION void of early speed and was never close. ARKANSAS

Footnotes
THEBOYZHOUR unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, split rivals down the lane, dueled late with WARRIORS GEM and
prevailed for the win. WARRIORS GEM raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid, took the lead, was collared down the
stretch by THEBOYZHOUR, dueled and was outfinished for the win. ONEHOLYLION raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no match for
the top two. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY lacked early speed, showed late interest, while finishing wide, but was no factor. STORMATION raced within striking
distance and faded. HOT TEN raced in the back of the pack in the beginning and passed tired ones late. G DON'T KNOW raced evenly near the back and
was never a threat. D'YETI MAN pressed the early pace and dropped back. RED RED WINE shot to the front, opened up for the field and stopped.

Footnotes
MADISON'S PLACE went to the front, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and held off a late challenge by BLAZING CHARM.
BLAZING CHARM raced within striking distance, moved up outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane and was outfinished. MARIPOSA D'ORO
vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. ORB'S SOUL lacked early speed, steadied entering the backside,
lacked running room, made a late mild bid, but was no factor. MARY JACK pressed the pace, had a wide trip, moved up but was no threat. FLAT OUT BIG
MONEY raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and faded. FRIENDLY AND KIND raced evenly near the back and was never close.
SHE BEGAN AGAIN always raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and showed little. GALAXY THIRTYSIX raced near the middle
of the field, dropped back and put forth dull effort.

Footnotes
BELLAMY CAY pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved the best late. TECATE TIME broke in, raced in the middle of the field, saved ground
around the final turn, made a rail bid and was a clear second at the wire. HEART THAT BINDS broke out, raced near the middle of the pack, came around
the first turn on the outside, made a bid and got up for third. SHADES OF TRUTH sprinted to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. GATOR PROUD had
an awkward start, racing in the rear, showed late interest, but was no factor. SPIRITED BEAUTY broke out, raced near the middle of the field and put forth
an even effort. OUR AMEN bumped at the start, raced near the back and was never a factor. EVE'S DELIGHT brushed at the start, pressed the early pace,
saved ground around the final turn and faded. LIVELY LEA raced within striking distance and made a steady retreat. EXPLOSIVELY HOT void of early
speed and showed little.
