Footnotes
SOCIETY JOE showed early speed and moved to the rail on the first turn, set a pressured pace, turned back a rival entering the far turn, quickened and
moved clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a drive. SAMUEL H forced the pace, failed with a bid at the far turn, was hustled along and
finished under a determined drive. PARTY OF NO was pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, circled six-wide leaving the turn and rallied gamely.
SIAKAM raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. DENMARK was away slowly and
settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide on the far far turn then leveled out in deep stretch. QUANTUM VELOCITY was off slowly, stalked the pace,
chased three then two-wide on the final turn, moved to the rail in the stretch but evened out. ST. PADDY'S DADDY raced in mid pack while racing four-wide,
chased on the far turn and finished gamely. GENDRAGON raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide on the first turn, was hustled four-wide on the far
turn but failed to menace. BIG TIME GIZMO settled in mid pack, saved ground but lacked a rally. SYNCHROMESH hopped at the start and was rated off
the early pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
D'S BEN led into the first turn inside three rivals, traded the front with the eventual place finisher until the stretch, then traded the front with the eventual third
place finisher to his inside at the sixteenth marker, finally holding off another bid by his pace buddy in the last forty yards. PICCADILLY BEAU stalked and
pressed the winner throughout inside a couple of other rivals, actually got a head in front momentarily nearing the stretch but the winner hung tough,
repelling that challenge and another bid from this game fellow in the final forty yards. ROCKET PLAN sat inside behind the top pair who dueled throughout,
looked every bit a winner in midstretch when the rail opened up and did head bob for the lead with the winner at the sixteenth pole, but couldn't seal the
deal, hanging late to be third best. AMBERWOOD was three wide in midpack on the first turn, loomed outside the top pair turning for home but levelled off in
the late going, only able to grab a minor award off his wide trip. TRACKING GOLD stalked four wide outside rivals on the first turn, fell back still in the three
path on the far turn but did come on again down the lane to pick off a few foes in the final sixteenth while in the two path. KITTEN'S BOY sat in midpack two
wide on the first turn, eased back to trail into the far turn and circled the field entering the stretch in the five path, stalled in the final seventy yards when in
position to get a piece. ENGLISH ILLUSION pressed the leaders while three wide on the first turn, began to drop back into the far turn and retreated down
the stretch. SUITEDCONNECTED trailed for most of the way, made a mild move up the fence on the far turn but it did not result in a contending position.
