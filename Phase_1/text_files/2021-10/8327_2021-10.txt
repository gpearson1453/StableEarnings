MAP THE MOMENT pulled and was steadied early on, then settled off the pace, moved up between rivals, made a strong three wide run on the far turn,
swept to the lead past the quarter pole, drew off under energetic handling and coasted home in hand. HOME BY SEVEN bobbled at the break, raced off the
pace inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run and got up late for second. PASS THE SALSA tracked close up on the inside,
came through on the rail to challenge on the far turn, dueled, dug in on the rail in the stretch and was outkicked for the place spot. INERTIA set the pace

off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail and closed late in the two path. BAY JEWEL was steadied at the start, raced off the pace, moved
up three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. MAGIC MOONSTAR chased inside, raced between horses in the stretch and tired. JEN'S BATTLE
stalked three wide, chased between rivals at the quarter pole and tired. DONNYBROOK GIRL chased close up outside a rival, came three wide into the lane
and tired. ODDSONDUSTYMILLER was outrun.
