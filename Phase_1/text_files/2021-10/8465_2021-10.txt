Footnotes
DEFENDANT broke sharp and showed the way then briefly conceded position to TRUELY AMBITIOUS, re-gained a clear advantage around the turn, went
three wide into the lane and stayed sharp under a mild drive. SENORITA SALSA raced outside off the second flight in early stages, gained position three to
four wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured place. FOR EVER OURS raced inside a foe off the top two leaders leaving
the backstretch, angled out two wide around the turn and sustained bid for a share. EXAGGERATED MOMENT raced in the back, swung four wide entering
the lane and passed tiring foes. SUNDANCE PEAK raced in contention off the pair in early stages, hustled along two to three wide around the turn then
failed to keep pace in the lane. FABIOLA PRINCESS raced between foes just off the second flight through the backstretch, was ridden along four to five
wide into the lane and failed to move on. MAVI saved ground through early stages, hustled along three wide into the lane and posed no threat.
SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER got in tight quarters along the rail and was taken up shortly after the start, quickly dropped back and never menaced. TRULY
AMBITIOUS took over the lead soon after the start, showed the way into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
PALOMITA set a pressured pace on the inside, shook free from MOANAS POWER late on the turn, gained a two wide advantage at the head of the lane,
widened under pressure and stayed sharp. AWSUM ROAR chased on the inside around the turn then tipped two wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid
through the lane and gained second best. REAGAN'S ROSE raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the turn, took the inside position in
the stretch run and got a head up for show. WAR STAR raced in contention off the top pair, was ridden along three wide around the turn, went four wide into
the lane and chased on evenly in the final furlong. MOANAS POWER applied pace pressure to PALOMITA in opening stages and continued to force the
issue into the turn, could not move remain in touch with eventual winner turning for home then gave way past the furlong marker. NIKEE KAN showed
response three to four wide around the turn, went five wide into the lane and had no late kick. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) chased in contention in the opening
quarter then retreated around the turn.

with rival turning for home, launched a game re-bid in the upper stretch, gathered momentum under steady pressure and got by in deep stretch. WOW RUN
broke sharp then quickly came under attack from GOLDEN SODA, vied inside of rival while maintaining the a slight edge then shook clear turning for home,
remained clear at the furlong grounds then drifted out wider and got wore down in deep stretch. BOGGIEMIESTER was ridden along in steady pursuit,
saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and continued a steady bid for a share. SIR SAFFER was forwardly placed in opening stages
and chased the top pair around the turn, went three to four wide into the lane and evened out. TOTALLY LIKE MOM was ridden along three wide around the
turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. SWIFTWISH veered in at the start, chased two to three wide and failed to move into close
contention. TRINNI SURPRISE got pushed inward by SWIFTWISH at the start and came away slowly, trailed in the back and had no response.

Footnotes
MIZZEN tracked the top trio though early stages, crept up closer then given cue turning for home, came four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under
a strong hand ride and kicked clear at the sixteenth pole. SWEET PENELOPE gained the early advantage and held firm around the turn, saved ground into
the lane, stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner in late stages. ILKNUR raced off the early speed, was ridden along two wide around the
turn, tipped out for wide for the drive and gained a share. IDEAL BREEZE chased up close just off the pacesetter, sustained a close bid around the turn then
flattened out in the lane. TIME'S ON MY SIDE got bumped back at the start, trailed the field, went three wide into the lane and never threatened.
KARATBARS raced up close just off the early leader, sustained two wide bid around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. CASANOVA QUEEN
bumped with TIMES'S ON MY SIDE at the start, saved ground throughout and failed to move into close contention.

AWESOME BEACH steadily edged up soon after the start and vied outside of rivals into the turn, stayed on gamely with LAUDA SPEED in the lane, battled
heads apart, dug in under strong handily and edged away in final strides. LAUDA SPEED briefly vied between rivals then dueled inside of AWESOME
BEACH around the turn, fought back from the inside in the final furlong, dug in gamely racing heads apart then got denied in final strides. WICKED
TEMPTATIONS tracked the embattled top flight through early stages, give cue at the quarter pole, sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and
finished well clear over the rest. QUICK STEP ED raced between foes in the opening quarter then hustled up for response around the turn, came three wide
into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MONY raced off the pace then five wide into the lane and move into contention. OPTIMAL COURAGE briefly held
the advantage then quickly came under pressure from outside duo, vied into the turn then failed to keep pace approaching the five sixteenths pole and gave
way. VALID EXCHANGE was not too far back in the early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and steadily faded. TREASURE RUN
saved ground and had no response.

Footnotes
SHE NASTY was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced three to four wide around the first turn, dropped inside and saved ground off the early pace,
began to take closer along the outside around the turn, given cue turning home, cleared on top in the upper stretch, then angled in under left handed
pressure and stayed sharp. SNEAKY CHEEKY stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a bid for CANDY MEISTER nearing the quarter
pole, raced near the lead then got collared by the eventual winner in the upper stretch, stayed on with response and edged foe for place. OCEAN SAFARI
steadied shortly after the start and steadied along while being rated under a snug hold around the first turn, settled in the early backstretch and tracked the
pace to the far turn, launched a bid turning for home, raced near the lead then got collared by the winner and ran on for show. EISWEIN raced in range
three to four wide, edged up closer and loomed a threat at the quarter pole, went four wide turning for home and failed to sustain bid in the lane. QUEEN
CAMILLA broke through the gate and unseated the rider but did not get away, raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a needed
rally. DEL REY DOLLY tracked the pace on the inside then steadily weakened around the far turn. CANDYMEISTER gained the advantage soon after the
start and set the pace through the backstretch, got headed by SNEAKY CHEECKY leaving the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, remained in range around the turn then given cue turning for home, advanced to
challenge TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR for the lead, dueled gamely inside of rival, held a neck advantage and refused to let rival by. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR was
forwardly placed out of the chute and stalked the leader through the backstretch, moved up in hand to take control from BIMINI at the quarter pole, cleared
on top then came under attack from PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL, dueled gamely along the outside and just missed. RACE DAY SPEED raced off the early pace,
began to edge up closer late on the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid for the top pair and cleared the rest. PLAYERA
raced in range three to four wide through early stages, remained in contention around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. BIMINI held a clear lead
out of the chute, set the pace through the backstretch then lost the lead to TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR at the quarter pole and steadily faded. JOST SAYIN was
reserved in the back, saved ground around the turn and had no response. VICTORIA'S DANCE dropped far back after the half and jogged in.

ROYAL WAR tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, loomed a threat at the quarter pole, given cue turning for home, responded willingly, took
over the lead from JOE PHILLIPS in the upper stretch and pulled away. JOE PHILLIPS set a pressured pace then shook free past the quarter pole, led the
way at the head of the lane, got collared by ROYAL WAR nearing the furlong marker, stayed on with response under pressure and held place. BYE BYE
DAVID raced off the pace, was ridden along the inside around the turn, took closer order the tipped two wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid and
gained on place. POSEIDONS MYTH was allowed to settle through early stages, was ridden along two wide around the turn then three wide into the lane
and never threatened. PONGO LOUIE was unhurried, went two to three wide into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. JOYFUL SURPRISE pressed
the pace through the backstretch, remained forwardly placed to the five sixteenths pole then failed to keep pace and dropped back. JOHNNIE GOT JETS
raced three to four wide around the first turn, raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and had no response. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA lost contact
