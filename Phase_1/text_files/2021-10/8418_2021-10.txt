INDIAN HEART well placed, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead and
held under steady pressure. BONKERS set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, edged ahead again through the
second turn, then lacked the needed late kick. BOCA well placed, looped to position three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane,
then flattened and held the show. MOON HILL vied for the early lead on the outside, pulled to a short lead down the backstretch, stayed on when
challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. LITTLE EMPIRE improved her position. DUPLICATED evenly for a half,
faded.

marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. WORKING OVERTIME allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
the stretch and closed well for the show. TREASURE THE STORM mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, then lugged in slightly,
steadied and flattened out. WATCH ME TANGO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and weakened the final furlong. CLASSY LYNN stalked the
pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
SPETTACOLI (ARG) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and held. KIKINBOY mid
pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed well for the place. GOLD WING well placed,
looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. C THE KING allowed to settle, moved up two
and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and had a mild late gain. MAD JACK allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second
turn, bid on that path into the stretch and ran evenly. BIG RIG allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the
lane and evened out. CARISSIMO passed tiring rivals. ENGLISH LAUGHTER mid pack, faded after a half, inside. TALK LESS well placed and off the rail,
faded through the second turn. LOVE SICK KITTEN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and had no rally.
