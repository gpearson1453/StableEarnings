RUN TO DAYLIGHT was bumped inward and into Ryan's Sword leaving the gate and settled back toward the inside, started a bid at the seven sixteenths
pole, steadily progressed to take the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened through later yards. AMIDSHIPS raced
with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, took a slim lead nearing the half mile pole, came under pressure at the three eighths,
raced clear toward the far turn but was caught at the rail midway through the turn and ceded the final sixteenth. RYAN'S SWORD was bumped at the break
and raced with the early pace inside, showed the way from the five eighths pole but was met nearing the half pole, gave chase through the backstretch,
dropped back at the rail nearing the five sixteenths pole then flattened in the lane. ROLL DEM BONES settled off the early pace in the two and three paths,
bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn and drifted into the stretch. MY PHOENIX raced off the pace in the three
and four paths, was well back leaving the first turn and showed little response. STRONG FIBER broke in to make contact with Run To Daylight and raced
with the early pace two deep while between horses, stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was briefly
headed into the stretch but dug in determinedly to hold off the game challenge of NO CHANGE, who saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, started
a bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, took a brief nod into the lane, drifted while giving up a
length past the eighth pole, but dug in gamely to recover and finished well while running out of ground. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY rated close inside, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. BOSS E BOOGS rounded the first turn in the three
path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged three wide at the three eighths pole, but dropped back from between horses at the eighth pole and
flattened stride. MISSIONSNINETYNINE raced with the early pace two deep then stalked into the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole,
dropped back from between horses at the five sixteenths pole and faded off the rail on the far turn. ALLEN CAN DO IT settled off the rail on the first turn,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride about the four path of the far turn. AZURE FIRE was not a factor. MINISTRY OF
MAGIC raced well back.

PENGUIN POWER angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in
under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. FANCY CONCHO settled off the pace in the four and five paths on the first turn and raced outside into
the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch to take second the final strides.
BOASTER saved ground well off the early pace then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the five path of the
far turn and dug in to take third at the wire while outfinished for second. COMMAND THE CAT steadied approaching the first turn and raced in the five path
through the turn, closed toward contention nearing the three eighths pole, challenged at the five sixteenths and raced close off the rail on the far turn,
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from third under the wire. TRIPLE BAD steadied lightly early on and settled off the pace and off the
rail, chased from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn. RUSH TO THE CASTLE came out at the break then stalked off the
rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. THORN OF ROSE HILL was shut off at the break and saved
ground while racing well back. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE mostly saved ground and was through after a half mile. DERBY DAY DREAMS stalked the pace off

Footnotes
STAR OF NIGHT saved some ground early on, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and challenged nearing the head of the lane, took the nod
mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of PRIVATELY, who stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, drew close
toward the three eighths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was headed leaving the eighth pole and
dug in gamely to mid-stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. BRIDGING THE GAP became edgy in the gate then rated close, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the lane and flattened mid-stretch, but held on for
third. POWER FORWARD was shuffled back early and rounded the first turn in the three path, left the turn outside, bid approaching the seven sixteenths,
raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out into the lane and finished evenly. GRACE ELIZABETH settled off the early pace about the three path, started an
outside bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. LIKE ME OR NOT saved ground the first turn then eased out into
the backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed rivals in the lane. COACH RUBE took over
nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths, was caught at the five sixteenths then faded
into the far turn. SHERWOOD LADY showed little response past the three eighths pole. MISS WAVE stalked two deep, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. LADY STORM saved ground.

nod three wide midway on the far turn, raced clear into the lane and drew off under steady handling, though, was taken in hand late. BOUNDTOBEBAD
stalked the pace two deep and took the nod between horses nearing the half mile pole, was met approaching the three eighths, dueled close at the rail on
the far turn, but dug in under steady encouragement to hold second. THE BETTER ONE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in to take third later yards and was gaining on second. SEE YA
MANANA stalked the early pace about the three path, challenged three wide approaching the half mile pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took a
brief lead past the five sixteenths but was caught midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. NURSE TOMPKINS raced well back from early contention
then bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly outside. SHE FIGURES raced well off the pace
about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. COMMCAT raced well off the pace
and showed little response through the backstretch. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG was never a factor. AZZURRA took a quick lead to rate the early pace
inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase, then weakened leaving the five sixteenths pole. UNRULY JULIE raced off the pace inside and showed
little after a half mile.
