Footnotes
SPICE IT UP chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved up under minimal encouragement to be on near even terms into the lane, was
asked for more while moving into the four path straightening in the lane and drove clear. PABLO'S MINX tracked the pacesetters while in the two path
through the turn, shifted into the four path into the lane, had aim on the winner outside the eighth pole, could not gain on that one then was kept busy to
remain clear for the place spot. MYSTICAL JUSTICE saved ground through the turn while along the inside, came off the rail to pass a tiring rival in upper
stretch, continued on under a drive and was up for the show spot. ABBY'S DESTINY was in the three path through the turn when never far back, swung into
the lane from the five path and never was a serious threat. WEIGHTLESSNESS was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. MAJESTIC
CLIMB set the pace from the outset while near the inside through the turn, was clear in mid-turn then gave way entering the lane.

ROYAL ROSIE chased the duel into the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane from the four path, took aim on the leader outside the eighth pole then
methodically reeled in the leader and edged up late. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE vied for the top spot between rivals, shook cleared into the lane, remained
clear with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. MI ESTRELLA raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane, bid after straightening,
appeared to be a threat with an eighth to go then finished evenly while clearly best of the rest. CANDY RAID raced in the five to six path through the far turn,
came into the lane from the seven path and moved up while never a threat. SHEZ RECKLESS was bumped by her stablemate at the start, chased the pace
from the four path through the turn and tired after entering the lane. UPSIDE DOWN broke outward and bumped rival at the start, raced in the four or five
path through the turn and never factored. MAW'S GLORY vied for the lead from between rivals early, chased the pace through the turn and was empty into
the lane.

Footnotes
SACRED KIKI BIRD set the pace from the outset while near the rail and under pressure from the outside, continued with a short lead through the turn,
inched up inside the eighth pole then was all out to hold to the wire. NYOMAN was in the three path through the turn and into the lane when never far back,
shifted to the inside just past the eighth pole and rallied near the rail to just miss. UNCLE MOMO pressed the winner two wide through the turn and into the
lane, raced in the four path through the stretch and was inching up at the end to just miss. HIDDEN PROMISE saved ground through the turn and into the
lane and offered a belated gain while not a threat. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from
the five path, loomed as a serious threat with an eighth to go then hung in the last seventy yards. PREPARE FOR GLORY raced in the two path through the
turn, swung into the lane from the six path and gained belatedly. CABOT TRAIL was in the two path through the turn and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked inside, bid at the three-eighths pole, went clear in the stretch, then held sway under steady urging. MY BARILEY saved
ground, stalked the pace, bid three wide at the three-eighths pole, then couldn't get to the winner. BERN N ASH was six wide around the first turn, then
pressed in the five path before giving way. HEIRLOOM KITTEN stalked the early pace in the three path, bid at the five-eighths pole, pressed the pace in the
three path but faded in the stretch. LEMON AND DIEM raced in the four path before fading in the stretch. CORRADO saved ground, then lacked a late bid.
NO SLO MO pressed the early pace in the five path, then raced three wide before fading. GRAND DESIGN was not a factor. COMPLICATE was clear early,
then raced in the two path and gave way.
