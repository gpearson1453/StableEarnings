LOUD LOUD MUSIC hustled to the front from the gate, angled to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, then drew away under right-handed urging and
steady handling late. CECILE'S CHAPTER raced in range outside a rival in the two path, tipped three wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to best the
rest. DEL MAR DRAMA rated outside the leader in the early going, chased a bit off the rail into the drive, lacked a bid in the stretch and got outkicked for the
place. ZABAVA stalked along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and flattened. DONUT GIRL off slow to begin, tucked inside for the clubhouse turn,
saved ground to the stretch, moved out in lane and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MISS TOKYO got floated in from outside and bumped inner rival early, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, went two wide around the turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, bid three deep with a furlong remaining, took over in midstretch and held off SWEET DEVIL in the closing moments. SWEET DEVIL got
bumped on both sides early, tracked the pace between rivals, lacked room at the quarter pole, tipped out to a clear path, steered out in the stretch, rallied
but was too late. ACAI broke well and came in some early, dueled for the lead from outside, took over in upper stretch, lost command in midstretch and
yielded to the top pair. TRIBAL BID shifted out and bumped rival at the start, coaxed to the front to duel for command, fought to upper stretch and weakened
in the furlong grounds. TAKETHEDIAMONDLANE got knocked into inner rival at the start, received another bumped soon after, saved ground into the
stretch, moved off the rail in the drive and lacked a late bid. REV RITA shifted in and bumped rival at the start, got sandwiched between and checked soon
after, saved ground around the turn then tipped off the rail and could not rally. MIND MELD tracked three deep around the turn, moved out in the drive and
lacked further response. CHROME OF OUR OWN got bumped both sides then checked twice early, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PICK YOUR BID tracked outside a rival up the backstretch, took the turn four to five wide, rallied late and got up in time. MAD CATTER dueled for the lead
from inside, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, drew away in upper stretch but got run down late and a nailed on the line. SIR FLATTER traveled along
the inside, moved out a bit on the turn, came out into the stretch and rallied for the show. TRY TO CAPTURE dueled for the lead from outside, lost contact
with the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, altered away from riderless horse into the stretch and flattened out. D D S EXPRESS broke in and bumped
rival, chased off the rail then became hard to manage around the half-mile pole, went three then two wide around the turn and finished with a mild rally.
EIGHT MAKAR sat off the pace, got floated out and impeded into the stretch and weakened. CIRCLE BACK got bumped from outside leaving the gate,
raced off the rail then angled in for the turn, checked inside the riderless horse early on the bend, angled out and came three wide into the stretch and could
not rally. LITTLE MISCHIEF showed brief speed then ceded the lead to the top pair, chased three to four wide around the turn and weakened in the drive.
EIGHTEEN MAVERICK coaxed from the gate, lacked early speed, saved ground trailing around the bend and had little left for the drive. GERLACH'S got
knocked into rival at the start then clipped heels and lost the rider shortly after and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED D D S EXPRESS FROM FIFTH AND PLACED HIM UNPLACED FOR BREAKING AND BUMPING GERLACH'S, WHICH THEN CAUSED
THAT RIVAL TO CLIP HEELS BEHIND CIRLCE BACK AND LOSE THE RIDER IN THE PROCESS.

Footnotes
TOERIS chased inside early then switch outside the pacesetter, applied pressure in the middle stages from outside, dueled around the far turn, battled
down the lane and dug in get up at the wire. CARROLL GIRL sped clear and moved inside, set the pace under pressure on the backstretch, dueled into and
around the far turn, maintained a narrow advantage while battling with TOERIS down the lane and was edged on the line. BALLET DANCING off slow at the
start, took the first turn three wide, traveled four deep on the backstretch, angled down to the two path around the far turn, found the rail in the stretch, could
not summon the needed rally but held the show. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN pulled along the inside into and on the first turn, shifted out to the two path,
moved to the rail around the far turn then came two wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. MAGICAL SIGN traveled between into the first turn,
chased off the rail and lost some ground in the middle stages, angled four wide into the lane and weakened. EMPIRE D'ORO went three wide around the
first turn, forwardly placed outside the top pair up the backstretch, lost ground and angled in on the final bend and faded. PERIPHERAL broke slow and

Footnotes
DIRECT LINE off slow from outside, traveled five then four wide on the first turn, stalked up close four deep on the backstretch, chased the leader into the
lane, rallied alongside with a sixteenth remaining and got up. PERFECTO AMOR broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, pressed from outside then
went up to duel for command, cleared around the second bend, urged right-handed in the lane, received challenge from outside and yielded grudgingly.
MONGOLIAN LEGEND got brushed from inside at the start, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid between at the nine-sixteenths pole, put in tight
entering the far turn and lost a bit of ground, chased two die into the drive, then re-bid late inside the top pair but was needed to find more. EXALTED JOY
traveled four then three wide around the first turn, between foes on the second bend and could not rally. THE BEAT got bumped leaving the gate, traveled
two wide around the first turn, settled at or near the back outside a rival, took closer order leaving the backstretch, went outside rivals on the far turn, came
four wide into the lane and went evenly late. BORKAN took control early, challenged from outside and dueled for command, lost contact past the
five-sixteenths and weakened inside. LIGHTNING FAST settled along the inside, moved off the rail backstretch, came four wide into lane and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
VIA EGNATIA chased outside a rival, asked around the turn, went two to three wide into the stretch, collared rival in midstretch, took over with a sixteenth to
go and held the runner-up at bay. IAN GLASS stumbled badly at the start, settled in midpack, angled three wide around the turn, rallied four deep then
outside the winner but could not get by. BLAMELESS stalked from inside, went two wide into the drive, between foes in upper stretch, angled in near the
sixteenth pole and finished willingly for the show. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) got bumped leaving the gate, dueled for command from outside, cleared
rival at the quarter pole, led to midstretch and yielded with a sixteenth remaining. SEEKING REFUGE settled off the pace outside a rival, went two to three
wide into the drive and lacked further response. ALL EYES WEST tracked from inside, angled out into and upper stretch and was not a factor. CASTLE
tracked off the inside, came four wide into the lane, chased four deep with a furlong to go, flattened out in deep stretch, then was vanned off following the
race. ADMIRABLY raced off the pace, saved ground on the inside, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace. PSYCHO DAR dueled from inside into
and around the turn, lost contact with a quarter of a mile remaining and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
BAROSSA position up close early outside the pacesetter, coaxed with five-sixteenths remaining, asked for more past the quarter pole, dueled down the
stretch and wore down rival in the closing moments. DURANTE showed speed from inside, set the pace with company to the outside, maintained a short
lead through the far turn, remained under threat from BAROSSA but resisted into and deep stretch then yielded grudgingly late. BREAKFAST RIDE stalked
on the inside then shifted to the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and held the show. SOUTH STREET sat off the pace, saved ground to
the stretch and improved position. CABO SPIRIT raced in range early on, lost ground on the second bend, came three wide into the drive and lacked a rally.
HAPPY RUNNER went three wide around both turns, drifted in upper stretch and weakened. WAR AT SEA got bumped and shuffled between at the start,
raced off the rail to the stretch and proved no menace. KATONAH raced two wide early, three then two wide on the second bend and made no impact.
NOBLE UNION broke in and bumped rival, went three wide around the first turn, tracked outside a rival in the middle stages, dropped back on the second
bend and faded.
