Footnotes
BLACK LICORICE brushed with a rival at the start then was crowded a bit after breaking a half-step slow, moved up on the outside to prompt the pace while
held together by the rider, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, moved
clear outside the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop while still on her inside lead in upper stretch, widened into the final furlong and remained well
clear under strong urging while continuing on her inside lead to the wire. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT was well spotted just off the pace, came under urging
while inside early on the turn, moved to the two path while chasing around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive between horses and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MALIBU ANTHEM broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, raced in the two path early
on the turn, shifted three wide while asked around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty while best of the rest.
BALINESE came away sharply then angled in while going to the front, set the pace with some company to her outside, was asked while near the rail on the
turn, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. GRACE IN MOTION broke a half-step slow
then was hustled, steadied while in tight coming to the seven-eighths, settled at the rear, saved ground while ridden along on the turn, was driven three wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. UNTAMED LADY was bumped at the start then taken in hand early, moved out then settled on the outside, chased
three then four wide on the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
ATHENRY three wide in pursuit just off a duel, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command spinning three wide into upper stretch, went
clear under a drive to prevail. CHASE THE CAT traded a bump at the start with EL MAYOR, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on between rivals to just get up for the place honors while never threatening
the winner. EL MAYOR traded a bump at the start with CHASE THE CAT, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to share in the show honors on the wire.
TOUGH WORKOUT led early on crossing to the two path, dueled with TACO BEAN to his inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths holding narrow
command, got displaced from the front by the eventual winner and cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages and just preserved a share
of the show honors on the line. PERFECT BANKER bumped between foes at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position. ROGUE LEADER four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened. FREUDIAN ANALYST bumped between foes at the start,
chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four to
five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HOT DOCTOR chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. TACO BEAN forwardly placed from the start, dueled inside of TOUGH WORKOUT coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, yielded the front three furlongs from home narrowly, began to fade and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.
MAJESTIC SKY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, angled four to five wide for home and made no
impact. TAMBURRO'S SOX broke out at the start bumping a pair of rivals against pressure from WAR NOVEL breaking inwards, steadied briefly after the
start as TACO BEAN tucked inwards along with TOUGH WORKOUT from the outside, chased inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home and tired. WAR NOVEL broke in at the start bumping a pair of rivals between he and TAMBURRO'S SOX, who broke outwards, chased just
off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
SINGLE SOUL (GB) was taken in hand early, saved ground under a snug hold around the opening bend, was reserved at the back, went two then three
wide on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside to make a bid outside the furlong marker, gained the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. MADE IN ITALY (IRE) was taken under a hold early then rated in the three path, ranged up on the far
turn, made a bid under urging at the quarter-pole, gained the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive while coming in some into the final furlong and was
overtaken but clear for the place. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS established a forward position early, went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the
pace on the outside, was guided around the far turn in the two path, dropped back into upper stretch then moved out and weakened but held the show.
FLAUTO went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way while in hand, vied along the rail on the far turn, was asked late on
that bend, spun into the stretch in the two path then lost the lead around the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. L'INDISCRET
rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn and came up empty. SECOND ROW
CENTER leaned out at the start, was taken under tight restraint early then reserved on the inside, came off the rail while roused late on the final turn, spun
four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VILLAINOUS got pinched back at the start due to pressure inside from FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL and pressure outside from a trio of rivals, chased along the
inside confidently handled near the rear of the field, began to advance midway on the turn and tipped to the two path inside the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide into upper stretch loosely splitting foes before being set down straightened away, rallied under a drive to engage and collar the leader just inside the
sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail. MEXICAN WONDER BOY broke in at the start in concert with flanking rivals, established the front
shortly after and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from a pair, remained just off the inside through the turn slipping away at
the five-sixteenths and widening his command, spun two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole but coming under growing
threat, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker and ran on to safely preserve the place honors on the line. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL broke out slightly at
the start pinching back VILLAINOUS against pressure outside, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors while well clear of the rest. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and passed tired rivals.
LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE broke in at the start pinching back VILLAINOUS against pressure inside, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. LOST IN ROME broke in at the start, prompted
the leader from the outside three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and went six wide into
upper stretch, then backed away tiring to the finish. RAGTIME BLUES forwardly placed five then four wide, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KENNER showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped closer to the rail, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths and proved best under steady urging. CATCHING CUPID
was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, drafted behind the leader passing the five-sixteenths, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and secured the place while unable to threaten the winner. ASYMMETRIC settled on the far
outside, was roused in the five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick but was clear for the show. CURLIN'S
WISDOM bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, chased in the four path through the turn and tired. DEVIOUS
BANKER pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated. ASTRAL WEEKS
broke a bit slow, angled out early, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. LAZZARITO was off slow then ducked in, spotted the front a
few lengths, settled at the rear, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. PURSUIT OF JUSTICE bumped solidly with a rival at the start then bobbled a
tad, raced just off the pace on the outside, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCESS FAWZIA four then three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. CLARA
PEETERS (GB) three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
between foes near the eighth pole, dug in and was collared near the sixteenth pole, ran on to safely secure the place honors. TIPLE (IRE) broke in at the
start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show
honors. SAILINGINTOTHEWIND advanced after the start to take over command six furlongs from home and show the way in hand along the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole, weakened in the late
stages. MY SWEET WIFE chased along the inside just off the pace early on, continued inside into the turn and was shuffled back from the seven-sixteenths
to the three-eighths pole as SO GRACIOUS backed up in front of her, tipped out to the two path near the five-sixteenths under urging and angled four wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid with too much to do. SO GRACIOUS showed the way early on from the two path before being displaced by
SAILINGINTOTHEWIND six furlongs out, tucked inside into the turn and faded along the rail taking MY SWEET WIFE in behind with her backwards, took
the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
NOSTALGIC dropped back while lacking early speed, settled well off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run,
moved out while rallying in upper stretch, closed strongly to go past the embattled leaders inside the furlong marker then powered away impressively to
prove much the best. INTO HAPPINESS disputed the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dueled with
SAFFRON MOON into the final furlong and defeated that foe for the place but was no match for the winner. SAFFRON MOON contested the pace on the
inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dueled with INTO HAPPINESS under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened but just held the show. HANDBELLE settled on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn, moved out
around the furlong marker and just missed the show. TOOSWEETTOBESOUR prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
chased four wide on the turn and tired. CHASING ARTEMIS angled in early then settled towards the inside, checked along the rail at the half-mile pole and
dropped back, moved to the two path before the five-sixteenths and had nothing left. MAKE A WISH was urged along off the pace, dropped back while
moving from the two path to the rail turn on the turn and faltered. MORNING IN AMERICA was off slow then bobbled, raced at the back on the outside
under some restraint, went four then five wide on the turn and also faltered.

STOLEN HOLIDAY chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two then three wide with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths and angled out five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside taking command in the last jumps to the finish to prevail at the end.
O'GOTTEN GIRL coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home, dug in dueling with ABUSE OF POWER through to the sixteenth marker, then got caught in the final strides and was forced to settle for the
place honors. ABUSE OF POWER broke in a step at the start brushing JADES GELLY, ranged up inside rivals to take command after the start and showed
the way along the inside while in hand, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, dug in dueling to
the finish trading command until headed for good a sixteenth out, fought on inside to preserve the show honors. HARPER'S IN CHARGE just off the inside
in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and was paused briefly before taking the inside
route into upper stretch, was ridden along lightly in behind foes until tipped to the three path a furlong out, then kept on to just miss for the show honors.
TUSCAN QUEEN three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
bid but was outkicked. JADES GELLY got brushed at the start by ABUSE OF POWER, who broke inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made some late headway.
SUSSEX GARDEN (IRE) coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and stayed
on one paced through to the finish. SCREAMIN' BY four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, tipped four to five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. LILLY SIMONE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased just off the inside under a ride with five-sixteenths remaining,
spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BRAVO REGINA four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, angled six
wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

upper stretch, responded well under the crop in the drive and held under strong urging. SMOKIN' JAY was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong and finished with good courage to narrowly get the
place. SNOW HOUSE prompted the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased the winner determinedly
in the drive and just missed the place while able to get the show. KAWHI ME A RIVER settled towards the rear, swerved out late on the backstretch, tucked
into the three path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finnished willingly while improving position. OCALA DREAM settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. EASY TIME bobbled just after the start, settled just
off the pace, was taken up while in tight near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. CROWDED TRADE settled at the rear of the field, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, was roused four wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. INDIAN LAKE was sent from the gate then taken in hand early and rated off the pace, came back under urging in the two path on
the turn and also failed to rally. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST bumped with a rival at the start while off a half-step slow, moved up on the outside then stalked
the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and came up empty. TOWN OF GOLD bumped with a foe while off a half-step
slow, was reserved under restraint, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BALI'S SHADE vied from the two path inside a pair down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn continuing to show the way narrowly, spun just off
the inside for home, dug in under challenge and rebuffed the rival inside the final furlong edging away kept to task to the finish. CLASH A. J. chased along
the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to be up for the place honors in the final strides to
the wire. HOT ROD RUMBLE coaxed from the gate, vied four then three wide outside a pair coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, dug in under a drive latched on to the eighth pole before being repelled inside that station and weakened in the late stages getting nailed for
the place honors in the last jumps. CALL MY BANKER five then four wide in pursuit, got let out spinning three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
OUR SON JAKE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. VIBE SETTER coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AMEDEUS MUSIC broke a beat slow when getting away awkwardly at the start, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide for home and made no impact. ALMOND CIDER struck the near side stall at the start, came
under coaxing and vied between foes three then two wide, retreated with five-sixteenths to go, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.
