Footnotes
VIVIEN'S CHARM broke alertly, led the field through the backstretch, responded to pressure into the stretch and held sway. WICKED WIZZY sat just off the
pace from the three path, dropped back through the final turn and rallied late to earn place. ZELDA'S WISDOM stalked inside, lodged a rail bid and was
bested late. TIME CONSUMING tracked outside, pressed the issue near the three eighths pole, but lacked the closing response needed. FIONA BAY trailed
the field, moved up menacingly approaching the quarter pole and came up empty for the drive.

LIL OL FLATTER rated just off the pace, drove wide into the lane, gained the lead upper stretch and won driving. MARACOCA'S DREAM tracked the
pacesetters, swung wide in the final turn, bid gradually outside and was along in time. SIXTYSHADESOFBLUES prompted from the three path, inherited a
slim lead into the final turn and flattened through stretch. INDY FRONT set the pace from between rivals, was unable to move from the quarter pole and was
empty through stretch. WICKED WOMAN chased four wide leaving the backstretch and faded in stretch. FOREVER SPECIAL never reached contention.
GABBY flashed speed inside and stopped.

DO YOU WANNA GO settled three wide early, swung out five wide at the head of the lane, gained the lead into the stretch and drove clear. CARAT'S
SONG contended the early pace from the three path, matched strides inside of CUVEE TEE in the final turn and inched clear deep stretch. CUVEE TEE
pressed the pace while four wide, dueled outside of CARAT'S SONG, battled determinedly through stretch and weakened late. AWESOME GIGI attended
the pace outside, began a bid nearing from the three eighths pole, chased the leaders through the stretch then flattened. SWEATY BETTY tracked the pace
inside and weakened steadily. CATCH THE GAL trailed and offered a late mild bid. TOP DEMON sat in range outside and lacked a response when asked.
BUSINESSINDUBAI raced in the four path and failed to menace.

ENTITLED STAR sat in striking distance, waited in traffic leaving the backstretch, found an opening along the rail then gained the lead and held. GOOD TO
ME raced from the back, took closer order leaving the backstretch, raced wide into the lane and was gaining on the leader late. PUDDLES stalked the
pacesetters from the three path, pressed the issue approaching the three eighths pole, chased into the stretch and flattened. DONT GET SMART chased
four to five wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide in the far turn prompting action, drifted wide leaving the final turn and yielded. WITT NINE
attended the pace inside, checked hard at the three eighths pole and retreated. CAGEY vied between foes and faded steadily. *Delay of Post Time- there
was a delay of post due to an incident in the gate. **STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry near the three eighths pole but made no
change.

Footnotes
MI REYNA showed early speed then opted to settle just off the three path, angled out nearing the quarter pole, was given her cue into the stretch and won
driving. FLORIST reserved off the pacesetters early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, gained the lead at the five sixteenth marker and was
outkicked. PIPER ROSE dropped back at the start and lodged a late bid in the stretch. EXACTLY chased outside throughout and passed tiring rivals. CAPA
BELLA saved ground and failed to threaten. EDGE OF OKOTOKS stumbled leaving then prompted the pace and was unable to keep pace with the field.
NO BAKK TALK set the pace just off the rail, tired early and was eased.

Footnotes
MISS DIRECTED pressed the pace outside of SANDY BEACH, gained the lead into the stretch and held sway. SMILE MARY raced three to four wide into
the lane, closed well outside and was up just in time for second. YUKON MIST tracked inside, swung out five wide at the quarter pole, moved up menacingly
at the head of the stretch and flattened late. AMBER RIDGE rallied belatedly outside. DANCING ZAZINGA gained closer order through the far turn, lodged
an all out bid into the lane and weakened late. OMEGA GAL hustled away then dropped back, lodged a mild bid and faded. SANDY BEACH set a pressured
pace, was overtaken near the quarter pole and retreated along the rail. APRIL'S IMPERIAL never reached contention. STORM CANYON was never
involved. LIL MISS MUD flashed early speed outside and tired. SOLANA outrun throughout.
