round into the turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, was blocked behind the leaders in mid stretch then split rivals in late stretch to be up for the place.

stretch. STALEMATE chased the early pace while three wide then made a bid four wide in the stretch and finished well. DONT FLOAT THE ICE set a fast
pace and was nicely rated on the turn, was roused in upper stretch but weakened in late stretch. OKIE FRONT stalked the pace while inside, saved ground
