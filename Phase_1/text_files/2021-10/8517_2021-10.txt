Footnotes
AMI'S LINK was bumped by a rival at the start and settled off the pace along the rail, hugged the fence on the far turn and into the stretch, angled out at the
eighth pole and drove by the tiring leaders at the seventy yard pole, needing the wire to hold off a late charger. FLAT OUT VIXEN broke out and bumped
with the eventual winner at the start, trailed along the rail around the first turn, came out midway on the far turn to four wide at the quarter pole, out in the
seven path turning for home and closed resolutely widest while not changing leads, just short of getting up late. UNDER THE EYE sat in midpack while two
to three wide on the turns, bid for the front in upper stretch and got the lead at the eighth pole, not changing leads and tiring at the sixteenth marker, holding
onto the show spot to the wire. TIZ MY RIGHT chased three to two wide on the first turn, was up to stalk the frontrunner on the far turn and dipped to the rail
when that one drifted out in upper stretch, only able to hold onto a minor award late. SLYDINI lost her footing at the start but recovered quickly to get the
lead into the first turn, held the front despite drifting out into the stretch but tired and lost positions in the final furlong. MAMITA'S CHICA was three to two
wide and off the pace on the first turn, rallied three wide on the far turn and inside the eventual place finisher heading home but her rally stalled in the final
furlong. NAKED ILLUSION sat three to two wide off the pace on the first turn, came two to four wide into midpack on the far turn, rallying past rivals down
the lane despite lugging in the entire way. SILENT MAMBA chased while hard held along the rail, angled out at the quarter pole but did not come up with a
bid down the lane. SAMURAI FIGHTER two wide and chasing the leaders on the first turn, began to fall back when two to three wide on the second turn and
did not respond when asked. DESERT POEM moved nicely from her outside post over to midpack along the fence around the first turn, but it was to no
avail as she retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BISCUIT steadied at the break and settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide late turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied gamely and
was up late under a brisk hand ride. JUSTLEAVEITALONE stalked the pace, forced the pace late turn, bid upper stretch, battled to the wire and was beaten
by the closer in the final yards. DICTATE led quickly, set a reserved pace, was engaged upper stretch, dueled to the end but was caught late. ERASMO'S
GIRL raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn and was all out in the stretch. SHES THE NORTH stalked the pace, chased two-wide
late on the far turn then finished evenly. TEMPEREYA settled off the pace, closed to mid pack on the backstretch, was hustled three-wide on the far turn
then finished evenly along the rail. PRACTICAL GIZMO settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
OLD SECRETS sat along the rail and off the pace early, rode the fence on the turn and angled out into the stretch, getting a seam in upper stretch and
getting by at the sixteenth pole, clearing off in the final seventy yards. POLAR APPEAL was in tight soon after the start, chased while on hold along the
inside, angled out at the quarter pole and got a brief lead before the eighth pole, immediately tackled by the winner, second best today. SEAMIALAUGH
broke in at the start and settled outside off the pace, advanced between runners three to five wide on the turn and tipped out to the five path turning for
home, closed resolutely down the lane to grab the show spot in the final seventy yards. THATSMYKINDANIGHT sat three wide in midpack early, came
three to five wide on the turn and out in the five path in upper stretch, unable to match the kick of the third place finisher but best of the rest with her mild
run. RAKASA won the break but allowed a rival the front, stalked and pressed that one, getting her head in front late on the turn and battled that one down
the stretch as the top trio went by. HIGH SOCIETY GIRL broke in and bumped a rival at the start, led under stalking pressure until headed by her pace pal
late on the turn, game with that foe to the wire but outkicked by the top three finishers. IS THERE A FOREST brushed with a rival at the start, chased two
wide and tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, no bid forthcoming. LOADED QUESTION was crowded between at the start and fell off the pace, came
two to four wide on the turn inside the eventual third place finisher, dipping to the inside in upper stretch and levelling off in the final sixteenth.
WHATSWRONGWITHYOU trailed by a wide margin down the backside and was only able to pick off one straggler down the stretch. EL BAYERN was four
to five wide on the turn and dropped in to the fence when retreating down the lane.

GOSPEL WAY led quickly, set a reserved pace then widened through the stretch under light encouragement. GREEN FLEET settled off the early pace,
closed mildly on the backstretch, was hustled three to five-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. POUND GREEN pressed
the pace into the backstretch, closed into the far turn and forced the issue, chased into the stretch but the leader had quickly got away from him and he
chased to the end. BLAST IN THE SNOW stalked the pace along the rail, was hustled on the far turn but leveled out in deep stretch. READY HERO raced
in mid pack along the rail, was hustled on the far turn, chased into the stretch, was all out but failed to menace. MUCHOKOVA settled in mid pack and came
three-wide through the first turn, chased two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and showed some interest in the stretch. CANADIAN PHAROAH
settled off the pace, raced two and three-wide on the first turn, chased hard three and four-wide on the far turn, tucked in behind rivals upper stretch and
never reached cotnetnion. INFAMOUS COVERT stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.
