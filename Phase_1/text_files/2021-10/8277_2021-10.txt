the turn and held show. STORM RISK was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. DRENA'S

PENNIESFROMABOVE forced the pace, dueled on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. MI TIA REGIS was well back,
gained ground on the turn and was up for place. PIPPI set a pressured pace and had the lead on the turn but weakened through the stretch. SIMPLY A
ZOOMER was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. ELUSIVE GEM was in tight early and had a
good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. DONT WAKE THE BEAR was hustled early and raced evenly on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. STORY STRAIGHT was in range early but trailed the field on the turn while outrun. A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
