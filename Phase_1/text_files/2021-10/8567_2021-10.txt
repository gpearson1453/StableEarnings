Footnotes
AURELIAN MAN settled off the pace, put in tight quarters at the three-eighths pole, exited the far turn three wide, rallied to the front at the eighth pole and
drew clear. SANTOS TO WILSON broke out and bumped rival, dueled early then chased the leader from outside, applied some pressure into the turn then
lost contact again around the bend, bid between rivals in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner but held the place. MY SUMMER DREAM off slow
at the start, angled to the inside, got crowded entering the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, moved out to a clear path and finished willingly.
GRANDCONCOURSE GUY brushed with inner rival at the start, dueled briefly before taking full control, pressured into the turn then inched away again,
vied with rivals in upper stretch, lost the lead at the eight pole and weakened. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS showed early speed then chased the pacesetter up
the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) bobbled and brushed with rival at
the start, stalked inside to the stretch, was boxed in through the lane and could not get out to a clear path to make a run. TOP ROYAL off slow to begin, took
a bad step crossing surfaces early, traveled along the inside then tipped out into the stretch and was not a factor.

DOZO vied between foes for command, steadied when MAJESTIC GIGI crossed over at the five-sixteenths pole, switch out to the three path, re-engaged
that rival in upper stretch, took over nearing the eight pole, kicked clear midstretch and held late. VEGAN threw her head and came away slow, raced
outside a rival at the back, eased out to the five path around the turn, closed well and kept gaining to the wire. SOLITAIRE lacked early speed from inside,
went two wide into the stretch, rallied between foes late and gained the show. FLAT OUT JOY off slow to begin, well placed behind the trio vying for
command, angled out and came four wide into the lane but faltered in deep stretch. MAJESTIC GIGI vied three deep to the turn, cleared and crossed over
to the two path midway around the bend, tested in upper stretch, relinquished the lead and weakened inside the furlong grounds. SWEET SONNY vied for
command from inside, chased MAJESTIC GIGI past the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SMILIN EVIE broke in and bumped rival at the start, closest in pursuit to the turn, chased to then three wide around the turn, rallied to the front in upper
stretch, cleared rival approaching the eighth pole and held safely in the closing moments. MO CONNELLY got shuffled between foes early, chased inside to
the turn, taken out to the three path around the bend, rallied and closed the gap while earning the place. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE stalked up the
backstretch, saved ground through the turn, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner and churned on to secure the show. BONNIE
BRAE off slow to begin, raced five wide into the turn, four wide leaving the bend and improved position. ADDYDIDIT lacked early speed, took the turn two to
three wide and never made an impact. HER PERFECT VISION got bumped leaving the gate then hustled early, sped clear from inside, pulled to a larger
lead on the turn as the rider tried to rein him in, led two wide into the lane, overtaken in upper stretch and tired. PRESKITT stalked the leader outside a rival,
dropped back three then two wide on the turn and weakened. NATION OF LAWS tracked the pace outside rivals, dropped back around the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
STORMING LADY stalked the pacesetter on the inside, tipped two wide leaving the bend, headed rival at the eighth pole, took over soon after and drove
clear. TRICKLE IN away quickly from outside, set the pace and crossed over to the inside, showed the way into the stretch, headed by STORMING LADY
with a furlong to go, lost the lead shortly after and stayed on to hold the place. INVINCIBELLA (GB) settled inside, saved ground the turn, angled out in
upper stretch and finished well for a clear third. MELTING SNOW off a step slow to begin, traveled in the two path into the turn, angled five leaving the bend
and bested the rest. FANTASY HEAT off a bit slow in the beginning, tracked off the rail, two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and could not
rally. ROSE PRINCESS stalked the speed outside a rival, took the turn two then three wide and weakened.

SEA TO SUCCESS attended the pace three deep, bid outside the leader into the stretch, cleared past the furlong marker and drew away. JOE DON
LOONEY chased along the inside the eased out to the three path on the turn, summoned a mild rally but could not threaten the winner. CRASH CORRIGAN
off slow to begin, raced three to four wide around the turn, moved inward in the lane and got up for the show. HALF RIGHT dueled outside a rival for the
lead, put away that foe around the turn, dueled inside of SEA TO SUCCESS in upper stretch and weakened. THE BEAT dropped back early, navigated the
turn five wide and was not a factor. SENSEMAKER stalked the pace outside a rival, went four then five wide around the turn and came up empty. ASCOT
STORM hustled from inside, went up to duel for the lead, weakened around the turn, tired in the drive, bled following the race and walked off.

Footnotes
BIG COUPE away quickly then ceded the lead to LAKER MAMBA, continued up close to the outside of that rival, drew alongside and raced on even terms
with a quarter of a mile remaining, took over leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off. BENDER steadied briefly when crowded on the
inside by rival soon after the start, stalked the pace from inside, tipped two wide in the lane and bested the rest. LAKER MAMBA sped to the front, set the
pace on the inside, pressured on the far turn, headed at the quarter pole, lost command soon after and flattened to third in the furlong grounds. ME B
BUBBA T off slow to begin, pulled and was rank into the first turn, settled into a stalking position between rivals, came two wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. ALGERIA (IRE) got floated out a bit on the first turn, stalked the three deep and faded in the drive. ACHILLEUS off slow to start,
lagged behind early, saved ground to the lane and was always outrun.

Footnotes
EDA went up to flank the pacesetter from outside, challenged around the turn bend and assumed command at the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch and
maintained a comfortable margin under mild urging. LADY T broke a step slow and got shuffled between runners at the start, navigated the turn four wide,
finished well through the lane, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. BENEDICT CANYON stalked the top pair three wide to the turn,
remained three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SHES BOUT A MOVER away quickly in the beginning, cleared and crossed over, set the
pace on the inside into the turn, challenged by EDA around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole, then weakened in the stretch run. CADILLAC
MARGARITA stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail, dropped back and trailed well behind through the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ALTRUIST tracked wide early then angled down to the inside, came out and bumped rival at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied to the front with a sixteenth
remaining and drove clear. CABO SPIRIT hustled to the front early, vied between rivals to the turn, dueled outside a rival around the bend, cleared into the
stretch, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole and held the place. DANCING RINCA chased outside rivals early, angled out and came five wide into the
stretch, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. KID CORLEONE chased along the inside, waited for room around the turn, angled three wide leaving
the bend, got crowded between rivals midstretch, then steadied off heels late. WALL STREET TRADER off slow to start, settled off the rail, swung five wide
into the lane and improved placing. FACETIOUS chased off the inside, got bumped between and squeezed back at the past the five-sixteenths pole, angled
inward in upper stretch and flattened. MEMES off a bit slow to begin, steadied off heels early, raced greenly into the turn, altered out in upper stretch and
improved position. KING APOLLO off slow from inside, altered out early, went four wide into the lane, lacked room in midstretch and could not regain
momentum. MALIBU MAYHEM off a bit slow to begin, climbed over the dirt crossing, traveled along the inside, then came off the rail leaving the turn and
failed to menace. LIL BRO COOP vied for the lead from inside, dueled around the turn and gave way in the stretch. EL POTENTE hopped slightly at the
start, recovered quickly to vie for the lead three deep, chased the top pair around the turn, bumped with rival past the five-sixteenths pole, got bumped again
in upper stretch and faded.
