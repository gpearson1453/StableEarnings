Footnotes
GHOST SQUAD showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail drifted out a bit in upper stretch and was all out to hold on. BUCKSHOT PETE had
the perfect trip behind the speed along the rail when the leader drifted out came through and was gaining late and just missed. BEHOLD DE FLAME
showed good early speed in the two path but could not go with the top two in the late stages. KITTEN'S BULL raced three wide on the turn and never
mounted a rally. ROYAL LEIGE raced along the rail on the turn came wide into the stretch and could not make up the needed ground. MACHO MADNESS
was off very slow spotting the field four lengths and raced wide on the turn. ORPHAN ANGIE chased the pace on the inside but tired in the stretch.

came out for the drive and was finishing with interest. BREAKIN DAYLIGHT chased the pace in the two path but tired in the stretch. TAP A MIRACLE was
well off the pace and lacked a rally. MORO TRUMP chased the speed duel on the inside but tired on the turn. CREASY was away in good order quickly
