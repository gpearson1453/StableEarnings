was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. STORMY SUMMER set the pace but chased on
the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. POWER HOUSE was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but failed

WEISSER forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. TOBRUK showed
speed from the inside, had a good position on the turn and vied from the four path through the stretch but was second best. BALA FALLS was off slow and
forced the pace on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was all out. MR CHANGUE was in touch and saved ground on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. DYNA'S GAMBLE showed no speed, trailed the field on the turn and from the seven path at the top of
the stretch was not a factor. TWEET KITTEN was up close early but lost ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. WILEY O'RIELLY was in touch, moved up
on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch held show. CHARLIE'S GAME was in range but checked into the turn and from the six path at the
top of the stretch finished evenly. ABSTEMIOUS was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. SOFIA'S SLUGGER
was in pack and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. FRAT PARTY showed speed from the inside but chased
on the turn and weakened through the stretch. SAVVY'S SISTER was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
LENCHES GIMME set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held sway. WARNING BELLE tracked the early
leader, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. ROMANTIC BLISS was in touch and raced evenly
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JACK'S MEMORY was well back and saved ground on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch had no impact. INTRICATELY was in range but chased on the turn and had nothing left.
