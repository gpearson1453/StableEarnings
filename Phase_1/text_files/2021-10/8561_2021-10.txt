Footnotes
DANZATALE was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, edged closer to race in striking range at the
quarter pole then edged up three wide approaching the head of the lane, dueled outside of BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY through the stretch run, dug in gamely
under firm handling and edged by late. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY settled through early stages then made a mid-race move to challenge TONALA for the
lead, vied around the turn then got by rival while taking on the challenge from DANZATALE, dueled gamely inside the winner through the lane and got
denied in final strides. ASPROPODIA tracked the pace through the backstretch, saved ground on the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive,
sustained a steady bid and gained show. PADDY KAYE'S WILD angled off the inside and remained unhurried through early stages, launched a three wide
bid around the far turn, came out wider for the drive, stayed on with response in the upper stretch then evened out and lost show. TONALA led the way out
of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch then took on the challenge from BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY entering the
far turn, failed to match strides turning for home then gave way in the final furlong. TOURING EGYPT secured inside position around the first turn, angled
out around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and offered no late bid.

SIGRUN FAST BOY was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide into the backstretch, rated off the second fight then given cue midway around
the far turn, circled up three to four wide to reach the embattled duo at the head of the lane, dug in under left handed pressure and edged away. CHROME
REPUBLIC was washed out going to the post, came away in good order and raced up close two wide around the first turn, applied pace pressure to JULIUS
THE GREAT through the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn, took on the added challenge of the winner at the head of the lane, could not
move on for the win past the eighth pole but stayed on with response for second best. CROWN OF HONOR tracked the top pair through early stages, was
ridden along the inside around the far turn, came out three wide in the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. JULIUS THE GREAT cleared and crossed
over to the inside soon after the start, set a pressured pace over CHROME REPUBLIC to the far turn, vied past the quarter pole and into the upper stretch
then failed to keep pace and gave way. DAISY'S DOC secured inside position around the first turn and raced in range tracking the pace through the
backstretch, came under a ride on the rail around the far turn, failed to move on and steadily weakened. MACEDONIAN settled in the back through the early
going, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, advanced into contention at the five-sixteenths pole then failed to sustain bid late on the far turn and gave
way.

LOVIN LIVIN lacked early speed and raced in the last flight, went two to three wide around the turn then came out wider for the drive, responded willingly
under pressure, kicked in along the outside and finished going away. WELL SHES HANDSOME raced up close tracking the early leader, moved up to
engage IZSHEFROSTED entering the turn, battled for the lead past the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. PALMGIRL
lightly bumped with IZSHEFROSTED at the start then raced in range through early stages, was ridden along the rail around the turn, stayed near the inside
through the lane and prevailed for a share. IZSHEFROSTED lightly bumped with PALMGIRL at the start then was sent hard out of the gate and held a slim
lead, dueled inside of WELL SHES HANDSOME around the turn, battled on past the furlong marker then came up tired. BRIGHT AND SHINY chased up in
range through early stages, came out four wide into the lane and flattened out. WATER WIZARD raced in the last flight, came wide into the lane and had no

racing room at the head of the lane, was put to a drive three wide, surged to the wire and got a head up in final stride. DIGNIFIED held a slim lead in
opening stages then conceded position to rail running JODGE JUDITH, weakened off the top trio then launched a re-bid with a quarter-mile remaining,
sustained a steady bid near the inside through the lane, took control from weakening CHESS NOT CHECKERS then got caught on the wire. CHESS NOT

Footnotes
KAHIKO stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved up and matched strides with YOLANDA's PRIDE around the far turn, edged away on top
turning for home, held a clear advantage two wide at the furlong marker and remained clear. LOVELY LUVY settled inside through early stages, tipped out
around the far turn then was put to a drive three to four wide at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer then finished with response and gained
second best. ZARINA was not too far back in early stages then launched a three wide late on the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and got
edged out late for place. STARSHIP NTERPRISE tracked the pace along the inside, was put to a drive along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the
drive then ran on evenly in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT BELLA was unhurried through early stages, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, shifted
out five wide at the head of the lane and failed to kick on. ONYX was forwardly placed through the backstretch, remained up close three wide into the far
turn then came up empty at the five sixteenths pole. YOLANDA'S PRIDE showed the way through the backstretch, vied for the lead with the winner around
the far turn then came up empty in the lane. QUEEN OF GOD raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a needed rally.
JABUTICABA was rank and checked heading into the first turn, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, took closer order, then failed to sustain bid and
steadied while tiring in the lane.

Footnotes
ROD TWO ROD got bumped at the start then tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid for the embattled duo midway around the
far turn, ran on four wide into the lane, dug in determinedly in pursuit of DOMINICAN ICE in the final furlong and got by rival in deep stretch. DOMINICAN
ICE got bumped at the start then set a pressured pace, began to duel for the lead outside of LOGICO at the half mile marker, battled on around the turn
then shook free turning for home, stayed on gamely, held a slim lead with a sixteenth left to run then got wore down by the winner. LOGICO applied pace
pressure to DOMINICAN ICE in early stages then matched strides for the lead going by the half mile marker, battled on around the far turn, could not
maintain equal terms turning for home but stayed on with response and just lasted for show. DOWN TO BIZZNESS tracked the pace through early stages,
hustled up along the rail around the turn, stayed near the inside through the lane and just missed show. BLIND EYE veered out and bumped with rivals at
the start, raced in range then came under a ride two wide around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and failed to kick on. CASSIDYS GOLD got
bumped at the start and raced off the pace, came two to three wide into the lane and had no response. RED ROAD got bumped at the start, was forwardly
placed through the backstretch then retreated entering the far turn. ONE MORE DAY got bumped between rivals at the start, was reserved in the back and
never reached contention.
