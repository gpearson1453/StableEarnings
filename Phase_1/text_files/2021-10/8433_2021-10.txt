backstretch, moved up between rivals around the far turn, raced two to three wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. MIDNIGHT

middle of the pack, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. SHIMMERING LEROID settled off the early pace, raced along
the inside around the far turn, shifted three wide in the lane and had no rally. SOMETHINGANDCHANGE dropped back in the early stages, raced four deep
into the upper stretch and had no late response. UP HER SLEEVE was unhurried in the early stages, raced three to four wide through the stretch and had
no response. BANDFROMTHEBAR was sent along to set the early pace and gave way in the drive. MENELAO was slow early and never threatened.

SHE'S A BIG DEAL stumbled at the break, quickly recovered to lay just off the early leader, raced four to five wide through the drive and was clear late
under strong encouragement. MOODY WOMAN settled off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn, continued to race near the inside in
the stretch run and got up for the place position late. HICKTOWN broke to the outside, stalked the early pace, moved four wide near the quarter pole, raced
four to five deep in the lane and had not enough for the top pair. CHICA RABIOSA settled off the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough in the drive. CABRA CHICA was unhurried early, raced three deep around the far turn and had no late rally. TOY TIGER was quick to begin to set
all the pace and gave way the final eighth of a mile. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

well to get up under steady handling. MISS OLD BAY showed good early speed to set all the pace, was clear inside the eighth pole but couldn't match
strides with the winner late to finish second best. LONG POINT BEACH was slow early on, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and had not enough for the top pair. MI CLEOPATRA AND I stalked the early pace, raced five deep into the upper stretch and had no final winning
bid. ELLIE BE DANCING raced in tight quarters in the early stages, was up close along the inside and tired. NETTI GIRL failed to sustain a bid.

EIFS was bumped at the break, settled off the early going, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up in his final stride under
strong encouragement. CAROLINA ICE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole, led near the wire and just missed in a
game effort. PRINCESS KILLMAIN dropped back in the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled six wide through the stretch run and
closed well late. NELLYSFORD stalked the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, raced three deep through the stretch, bit tight near wire
and kept on late. ROCKSTAR GIRL was off slowly, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and closed too late. MAGICAL LUNA showed good early
speed to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ALGODONAL broke out at the break, bumped rival, raced four to five wide in the
stretch, was in tight quarters near the eighth pole, angled out and had not enough. CATERINA ONE settled to the middle of the pack early, waited just past
the quarter pole and checked sharply near the eighth pole while racing three to four wide. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM was forwardly placed to lay up close while
racing between rivals and tired. WILDCATTIN failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SLAATS pressed the early pace while racing between horses, built a clear lead through the stretch under steady pressure and was in hand in the final
stages. YO NESSROUNDONKERN was forwardly placed, to lay up close early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the
winner. VINNY was quick to begin to lead in the early stages and weakened a bit through the drive. RHUMJAR stalked the pace, raced four wide around the
far turn and had no late response. KEEN ON YOU was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. BLAMEITONTHEFUN
raced far back and never threatened.

strong handling. MO NORMAL was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced two to three wide and kept on to the wire. VIBRANCY settled off the
early going raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. DOUBLE BLESSED was forced six wide around the first turn, settled off
the early pace, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole and had not enough. MAHKATO stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. INANNA'S QUEST was reluctant to load, raced up close early and weakened in the latter stages. SMART
ENTRY raced in a bit tight soon after the break, was slow early and never was a factor. RUNAWAY MONET raced towards the inside and had no response.
FOLLOW THE FLAG raced five wide around the first turn, was four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MOON CHANT set all the pace from

AMERICAN PLAYBOY raced up close while racing between rivals, moved up four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong
encouragement. BUST'EM KURT showed good early speed, led inside the eighth pole, raced two to three wide in the drive and finished second best. OFF
COURSE was bumped at the break, moved up five wide through the stretch run and made a good late bid. FREE SQUARE broke to the outside, showed
good early speed from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. MR. NINETEEN settled off the early pace, raced six wide into the upper stretch
and had not enough. ONE TEN dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. NATAGAR was squeezed back at
the break, was coaxed along to stalk the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DIVINING STONE failed to respond. AWESOME STEPHEN settled
to the middle of the pack early, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SPEED SLOT was slow early and never threatened.
