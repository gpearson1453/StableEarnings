Footnotes
BILLY'S BET vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead to take control past the half-mile marker, cleared with three-eighths remaining, led into deep stretch
and held well. OUBABE tracked the pace from inside to the lane, got bumped by ORTH in upper stretch, tipped off the rail and was gaining outside the
winner. LIBERTY FOREVER vied three deep early, chased the leader three deep into and around the turn, stayed within striking distance through the final
furlong but finished evenly late. OUTTA HAND stalked three deep early on, raced outside a rival on the turn, shifted out into the stretch and kept on for a
minor award. HEAVEN'S MUSIC vied for the lead between rivals up the backstretch, chased between foes around the turn and weakened in the drive.
ORTH coaxed from the gate then lacked room and steadied early, chased between foes then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend,
came in a bit and bumped rival in upper stretch and weakened. SYNNIN AND WINNIN broke out and bumped VANISKY, taken back by the rider and angled
to the inside, shied from the inside entering the turn, remained along the fence and failed to menace. EREBUS sat off the pace, went two to three wide
around the bend and made no impact. VANISKY got bumped leaving leaving the gate, trailed early off the rail, traveled three to four wide around the turn
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CARELESS KITTEN bumped with inner rival at the start, showed speed and dueled outside NEW SOI PHET, cleared approaching the three-eighths pole,
asked with a quarter of a mile remaining, drifted out under left-handed urging and bumped rival at the sixteenth pole and held to the line. WARRENS
CANDY MAN went three then four wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair outside a rival, went three deep on the far turn, drew alongside and got
bumped by CARELESS KITTEN with a sixteenth remaining and just missed. NEW SOI PHET bumped leaving the gate, hustled from inside, went up to duel
for command, could not keep up nearing the three-eighths pole and chased along the rail into the drive and kept on to secure the show. CLUB MESQUITE
off a bit slow to begin then checked when losing his path soon after the start, went three then two wide around the first turn, chased between on the second
bend and flattened out. FUNKENSTEIN off slow from outside, went four wide around the first turn, remained wide up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
five then four wide and weakened. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL MADE BY THE RIDER ABOARD WARRENS CANDY MAN AGAINST
CARELESS KITTEN FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE SAME INCIDENT.
AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CARELESS KITTEN FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND MAKING CONTACT
WITH WARRENS CANDY MAN AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE, WHICH COST THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
SUGARY settled on the inside, moved to the two path on the far turn while closing in, took over leaving the bend, kicked clear at the top of the stretch and
was kept to task to the wire. OVER ATTRACTED raced tight between rivals nearing the first turn, lacked room into the lane, started to make an run but had
her progress halted in midstretch, found a clear path and rallied late to get up for the place. STAR OF AFRICA was closest in pursuit while still well off the
pace, closed in on the far turn, finished evenly in the lane and got edged for second. RUNWAY DREAMER traveled three deep then moved to the two path
around the first turn, raced outside a rival then two to three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late punch. TIZNO'S DILEMMA raced near the back
of the field, exited the far turn two wide, angled out and improved position. ROSE PRINCESS off alertly and opened up a large lead in the early stages,
showed the way with a comfortable lead to the far turn, held a diminishing advantage approaching the quarter pole, overtaken leaving the second bend and
weakened in the lane. DID I STUTTER tracked in the two path or outside a rival, went three wide into the drive and weakened. WIND TARTARE (FR)
bobbled at the start, traveled two wide then moved to the inside to save ground and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MR. DOUGIE FRESH sped clear around the first turn and moved inside, set the pace under pressure on the backstretch, cleared at the seven-sixteenths
pole, saved ground into the lane and inched away under right-handed urging. SAYIN GRACE stumbled badly at the start, steadied off heels into the first
turn, settled in the two path outside a rival, angled out in the stretch and got up for second. SECRET TOUCH raced in range off the rail, three then two wide
on the far turn and got edged for the place. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT chased on the inside early then switched outside leaving the first turn, went up to press the
pace on the backstretch, chased the winner around the far turn and weakened. VERY IRISH went three wide around the first turn, moved out widest on the
backstretch, traveled four then three wide on the second bend and also weakened. SABUDA stumbled badly at the start, stalked from inside and came up
empty in the lane.

Footnotes
STEAK AND CHEESE unhurried in the early going, raced outside a rival, moved up to mid-pack in the middle stages, angled out into the stretch, surged to
the front at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BUD KNIGHT bumped from inside at the start, settled inside from off the pace, tipped two wide leaving the far
turn, angled out with a furlong remaining and rallied for the place. ROCKS AND SALT sat well off the pace, split foes near the quarter pole, angled out into
the stretch and got outkicked for second. STONE'S RIVER dueled early from outside then ceded the lead on the first turn, was rated outside the lead in
middle stages, chased two wide into the drive, bumped with rival in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. TRIBAL WAR CHANT angled down to the
two path early, went up outside the top pair on the backstretch, bid alongside the leader on the turn, led in upper stretch, was overtaken with a sixteenth
remaining and weakened late. OX BRIDGE dueled for the lead then cleared around the first turn, showed the way to the second bend, met the bid from
outside on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. AVIGALE (IRE) raced off the rail, came three wide into the drive, bumped with inner
rival in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. TEMBO trailed to the far turn, angled four to five wide around the second bend and failed to menace. BOLD
VOYAGER broke out and bumped rival, traveled in mid-pack on the inside, moved into the range leaving the backstretch, waited for room on the far turn,
gained a clear path into the stretch but lacked room behind horses through the drive and could not rally. SEARCHING FOR GOLD went four then three wide
around the clubhouse turn, raced outside rival, dropped back around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BIG MOON unhurried in the beginning, went four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, moved down to the two path, angled four wide leaving the second
bend, took over inside the eighth pole and drew away. MEDUSA'S GAZE settled inside, ranged up on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, quickly
cleared inner rival, held a short lead to the eighth pole but was overtaken shortly after crossing that marker, could not go on with the winner in the furlong
grounds and held the place. DYNAMITE QUEEN went four wide around the first turn, three then two wide on the second bend and finished willingly for the
show. SLEW SOUTH got knocked into rival at the start, moved to the inside then angled out around the first turn, angled six wide leaving the far turn and put
in a mild late bid. CURIOUS INJI broke out and bumped rival, tracked off the inside, four wide into the lane and flattened out. ALLISON'S SURPRISE got
bumped from inside at the start, lacked early speed, came four wide into the stretch and made no impact. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR was a bit crowded and
intimidated entering the first turn, chased in the two path then three wide into the lane, came up empty in the lane and was eased in the stretch. STRIKING
TIGRESS away quickly then ceded the lead on the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, tired in the drive and was
eased to the wire. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY stalked the pace from inside, moved out on the backstretch, went three wide into the lane and was eased to the
wire. RATTRAPANTE sped to the front while four wide into the first turn, cleared and angled down to the two path around the bend, opened up on the
backstretch, started to weaken on the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole, gave way in the lane and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
TILTED TOWERS sped to the front then cleared inside rival near the nine-sixteenths pole, crossed over to the inside, saved ground around the bend,
inched away in upper stretch and held safely late. CUCINA saved ground on the inside, tipped out and went in between runners and got put in tight quarters
by STAR RACER shifting out, continued on willingly and gained the place. FIGHT ON dropped back early and moved to the inside, angled out into the
stretch, drifted in late and got edged for second. ROOKIE MISTAKE raced in mid-pack early on, went two wide around the turn, floated out in upper stretch,
continued to give chase but got crowded between rivals late. LITTLE JUANITO showed early speed then ceded control to TILTED TOWERS, chased that
rival on the inside to the stretch and lacked a late bid. STAR RACER broke well and was forwardly placed from outside, driven two wide into the lane, shifted
out in upper stretch and weakened. BEAR CHUM (AUS) raced off the pace early on, came three wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DEFENSE WINS chased the pace outside rivals then three wide into the turn, loomed outside the top pair and was driven three wide into the stretch, rallied
three deep and struck the front with a furlong remaining and drove clear. PLAY CHICKEN raced in range early on, took the turn two wide, lacked room into
the lane, tipped out and finished well but could not get by the winner. CHARGE CASH set the pace under pressure, held a short lead through the turn and
upper stretch, relinquished control at the eight pole and stayed on for third. FAST AS CASS pressed the pace from outside into and around the bend, could
not keep up with the top pair entering the final furlong and weakened late. INDY JONES sat off the pace outside rivals, took the turn three wide and could
not find the needed response. SPEED PASS came away awkwardly, dropped back early, took the turn four wide and never threatened. BARBIERE steadied
briefly off heels early, lost ground up the backstretch, came out nearing the stretch and failed to threaten. DARK PRINCE traveled in mid-pack on the inside
and could not rally. AFTERNOON HEAT stalked between foes then lost ground past the half-mile pole, asked two then three wide on the turn and
weakened. REBEL WAR off slow and crowded at the start, checked behind rivals early, angled to the inside, exited the bend two wide and never responded
to urging. PELICAN WAY steadied briefly early, raced off the pace then trailed four wide into the lane and tired.

SOLO ANIMO away quickly then ceded the lead around the first turn, went up to press the issue at the half-mile pole, took over between rivals at the
three-eighths pole, dueled leaving the turn, cleared at the eight pole and held safely. EAGLE CHIEF settled in the two path, moved out on the backstretch,
took closer order between rivals, angled out into the stretch and rallied for the place. CIRCUMVENT stalked off the inside, vied three deep into the turn,
dueled leaving the far turn and could not match the top pair late. WORLD CRUISER broke out, went four wide around the first turn, steadied off heels at the
nine-sixteenths pole, went three deep at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide leaving the turn and kept on for a minor award. ROSENQUIST raced in
ranged off the rail, raced outside a pair of rivals at the halfway point, exited the far turn four wide and weakened. TIZ TACT TOE sped clear around the first
turn, took pressure at the four furlong mark, lost command at the three-eighths pole, lost contact with the top pair at the quarter pole and weakened. HULK

stretch and weakened. STAR SAILOR went three then four wide on the first turn, got bothered by rival near the five-eighths pole, came three wide into the
drive and had little left. ASSURANCE hit the gate and came away slow from inside, was rank and pulled early to the five-eighths pole, went three wide

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE took the first turn five wide, raced in mid-pack on the backstretch, bid four then three deep on the far turn, led into the stretch, kicked
clear in upper stretch and drew off. MORAZ traveled four wide around the first turn, chased three deep on the backstretch, challenged three deep then two
wide between rivals on the far turn, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch but bested the rest. STELLA NOIR showed speed along the inside, led
to the far turn, vied with rivals around the far turn, lost command past the quarter pole and weakened. SWEET PEARL off a bit slow to begin, settled on the
inside then moved closer up the backstretch, lacked room when trying to go inside the leader into the far turn, continued to chase along the fence, shifted
out into the lane and flattened to a minor award. MONGOLIAN PANTHER forwardly placed inside a rival early on then chased between on the backstretch,
went two wide into the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. LAST FIRST KISS off a bit slow to begin, went five wide
around the clubhouse turn, remained wide and came six wide into the stretch and weakened. NICE ICE raced up close early outside the leader, put in a mild
bid at the three-eighths, vied between foes briefly then failed to match strides approaching the quarter pole and tired down the lane. STYLEDOME (IRE)
settled off the rail near the back, came four wide into the drive and had nothing left for the stretch run.
