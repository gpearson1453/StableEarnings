LULA'S ROADRUNNER stalked the leaders four wide, took over midway on the final turn and remained well clear under mild urging. ANGEL RAPHAEL
settled inside, advanced on the final turn and held place. QUIET PLEASE prompted the pace outside, faded briefly then came again. MANI PEDI raced
close up wide then proved empty in the stretch. PEARLY QUEEN set a measured pace inside to the far turn and faltered. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT broke badly
then raced far back throughout. SUNDAY INN prompted the pace along the inside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
WICK settled inside, bid on the final turn, angled out and pulled away under moderate coaxing. SPIRIT WOLF ducked out at the start, raced wide, angled
inside rallying in the stretch. SPARTAK lagged far behind then offered some late energy to get up for the show. SINASHACK vied along the inside, moved
clear on the final turn and weakened. CITY GUY dueled outside for five furlongs and faded. BRIDLECREST lacked speed, moved inside and no factor.
BLAZING ISLAND saved ground off the pace and gave way. COUCH DREAMS pursued the loose pacesetters and stopped abruptly.

RISQUE REBEL vied outside with a narrow edge then pulled away in the stretch after repelling that challenge. SOCIAL GROUP dueled inside, dropped
back into the stretch then angled out but proved no match. OFF THE MEDS raced very wide then offered a mild rally to earn the show. LUCKY HERO
chased within range between rivals then flattened out in the lane. KINGS HIGHWAY lacked speed inside, moved briefly closer before half a mile then faded.
BOSTON LIGHT stalked the dueling pacesetters outside and faded in the stretch. INDIAN COUNSELOR dropped back wide and weakened steadily.

NO SALT rated at back of the pack, circled his field with a strong rally and was up in time late. SOUPER ENERGIZER settled close up three wide , led in the
stretch but was nailed. ONE TWO KID dropped well behind then closed well outside through the stretch. CHAO rated inside, awaited room on the final turn
then rallied nicely. BORGOBYTHESEA set a pressured pace for three quarters and weakened. MONGOLIAN HERO lagged far behind inside then passed
fading rivals. ROBERT'S LUXURY chased wide, moved briefly closer before half a mile then faltered. REPEATED PROMISE forced the pace to the far turn
and gave way. MYSTERY BANK prompted the leaders wide briefly then stopped abruptly.

THE BIG BLUFF vied along the inside then edged away from that opponent through the final furlong driving. TWIXY CAT held a narrow advantage outside
to the eighth pole and tired. OUR MAN LUKE chased in the two path and raced evenly through the stretch. NICE OF ME dropped back three wide
throughout and lacked a rally. STRUM AND PLUCK saved ground just off the leaders and faltered. DON'T RECALL was urged off the pace outside and
never menaced. RUN FAST underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke extremely rank in a complete tangle while tossing his head repeatedly..

Footnotes
BELLARMINE HALL rated three wide, bid into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong. LEASE quickly sprinted clear, widened before
half a mile but was nailed late. KNOW IT NOW pursued the leader inside and continued willingly to the finish. CASTAGNO dropped well behind, advanced
inside, angled out in the stretch and rallied. MEAN MACHINE trailed far behind inside then closed the gap while no threat. REBEL TRAVELLER saved
ground off the pace and lacked a rally. I AM THAT I AM carried out into the first turn, remained wide and was no factor. NINE TOE JOHNNY bore out into
the first turn and was always far behind. NORTHERN EXPRESS pursued the loose pacesetter outside then stopped abruptly.
