Footnotes
TOM'S BEAUTY raced close up between early then dropped back a bit to stalk and angled inside, waited for room in upper stretch, then gained a clear path
with a furlong remaining, rallied up the fence and kicked clear. GRANOLA GIRL settled outside a rival, went three to four wide into the stretch, steered out
and closed well for the place. PRETTY RENA brushed from outside at the start, forwardly placed early on, traveled two wide then a bit off the rail into the
stretch, floated out by rival and bumped approaching the eighth pole and got outkicked by the top pair. MUSIC FESTIVAL coaxed from the gate but could
not match strides early, steered down to the two path, exited the bend two to three wide, lacked room in midstretch, then kept on between foes late.
SADDLE UP JESSIE off slow to start, came out into the stretch and produced a mild rally. FLUENT broke in and brushed rival, chased up close, went four
then three wide around the turn, got bumped nearing the eighth pole, drifted in midstretch and lacked the needed late kick. BOOZE RUNNER took a slight
hop out of the gate but still came away in good order, went up to vie for command from inside, took the lead into the turn, cleared briefly in upper stretch,
drifted out approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. KEYCHAIN GIRL tracked the pace outside rivals, came five wide into the
stretch, drifted in at the eighth pole and could not rally. SO SOFTLY away quickest in the beginning, vied for the lead three deep into and around the turn,
could not keep up leaving the bend, steadied at the eighth pole and once more near the sixteenth marker and weakened. LOVE GONE WILD vied for the
lead between rivals, dueled into the stretch, got bumped on both sides near the eighth pole, checked in midstretch and weakened. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH BOOZE RUNNER DID DRIFTED OUT AND LOVE GONE WILD CHECKED IN THE STRETCH,
THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

VELVET GHOST stumbled at the start but recovered quickly to vie for the lead outside rivals, chased the leader three wide around the clubhouse turn, went
up to apply pressure in the middle stages, challenged into the far turn, dueled around the bend and down the stretch, then dug in late to edge the runner-up.
FLOYD KNOWLES showed speed from inside, took control around the first turn, gained company on the backstretch, dueled through the far turn and battled
down the stretch, finished gamely to the wire but was bested by the winner. ARTHUR SPOONER chased two wide around the first turn, traveled a bit off the
rail into the lane and lacked a late bid. CHRIS FIX off a bit slow to begin, went two then three wide around the first turn, moved out and stalked widest,
angled to the two path around the second bend and weakened. TEX HANLEY off slow to begin, trailed early, lost ground into the far turn, pulled up around
the bend and walked off.

Footnotes
MO FORZA allowed to settle in the early going, went two then three wide around the first turn, advanced outside rivals on the second bend, tipped out in the
stretch and rallied to get up late. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT raced four deep crossing the finish line the first turn, cleared and crossed over around the first
turn, challenged and overtaken by RED STORM RISEN on the backstretch, battled with that rival into and around the far turn, regained command at the
quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch but got run down late. HIT THE ROAD came away alertly then got crowded a bit and took back off the speed,
pulled a bit around the clubhouse turn, lacked room on the inside behind a rival at the five-sixteenths pole then shifted to the two path, angled out in the lane
and finished well but could not get up for the place. RED STORM RISEN had early speed then chased SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT into the first turn, pulled
behind that rival around the first turn, angled out and went up to challenge for command, took over at the half-mile pole, battled through the second bend,
lost the lead with a quarter of a mile remaining, lost contact in upper stretch and flattened in deep stretch. ORDER AND LAW stalked the pace outside a
rival then off the rail, angled in on the far turn and could not offer the needed response when called upon.

BIG NOVEL chased the leader on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail and came three wide into the drive, overtook KISS MY KAT and clear with a
furlong remaining, then drew away in the late stages. BOLD CHOICE tossed his head and came away slow, saved ground along the inside, moved out in
the stretch and showed late effort to earn the place. KISS MY KAT away quickly then cleared CAUSE SHE'S A LADY and angled to the two path, showed
the way through the turn and into the drive, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY broke well then chased the
pacesetter from off the rail, went two to three wide around the turn and weakened. MADIHA got bumped from outside leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack
early on, angled five wide into the stretch, drifted to the inside through the lane and lacked a rally. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ broke in and bumped rival,
angled in from the three path to save ground around the turn and made no impact. UNWRITTEN CODE chased outside a rival then came four wide into the
lane and faded.

COMMANDER (FR) brushed with inside rival leaving the gate, steadied briefly off heels early, moved to the inside and saved ground around the turn,
angled out and drew alongside in upper stretch, cleared inside rival with a furlong remaining and inched away. CREW DRAGON dropped back early, came
out into the stretch, drifted inward through the lane and rallied for the place. WHOOPING JAY brushed with the winner at the start, stalked the pace from
inside, lacked room behind the leader then bumped rival late on the turn, put to right-handed in the drive and got outkicked for second. COULTHARD (IRE)
tracked outside a rival then between foes around the turn, got bumped late on the bend, was floated out and checked in upper stretch, kept to task but
lacked room and checked again at the eighth pole, moved inward and kept on for a minor award. FRATELLI dueled for the lead from inside then cleared into
the turn, showed the way in the two path into the drive, relinquished control in upper stretch and weakened inside. PERFECTIONISTIC chased three deep
around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, got crowded by CREW DRAGON in upper stretch and also weakened. THANKS MR. EIDSON dueled
outside FRATELLI early, chased that rivals three to four wide around the bend and weakened.

EIGHT RINGS away quickly to take control, pressured briefly then cleared inside rival and angled to the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, then drew away
under hand urging. TAISHAN coaxed from the gate, applied some early pressure then angled outside to chase the leader, continued closest in pursuit from
the two path to the far turn, could not summon the needed rally in the lane but stayed on to secure the place. PROVERB trailed early, crept closer up the
backstretch on the inside, eased off the rail and entered the lane two to three wide and lacked a late bid. PARSIMONY settled off the rail, angled to the
inside on the far turn, tipped three wide in the stretch and got outkicked for the show.

remaining and stayed strong to the wire. ONE FAST BRO tucked inside on the first turn, angled five wide on the second bend, drifted inward in the lane and
finished well to earn the place. SECRET CLUB sat off the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, moved out and rallied for the show. MEMO
DADDY (CHI) traveled in mid-pack early on, angled four wide then shifted in upper stretch and needed to find more late. FIRST PREMIO went three wide
around the first turn then moved to the inside, steered out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. DOMINANT SOUL settled in the two path then between
runners, tipped out into the stretch, got bumped in upper stretch and kept on to improve. U. S. DANGER away quickly, set the pace on the inside, vied
briefly then moved clear again, showed the way into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) stalked the pace on
the inside, saved ground to the lane and could not offer the needed response. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR chased around the first turn then went up to press
the pace briefly on the backstretch, lost contact and chased the leader two wide to the stretch and weakened. LAKER MAMBA stalked off the rail, came
three wide into the drive and was not a factor. BURNIN TURF forwardly placed off the rail, went three deep briefly at the five-eights then dropped back off
the leader, got bumped and checked between rivals in upper stretch and faded. PARNELLI off slow and lost path at the start, raced in mid-pack early on,
came three wide into the drive and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL pressed from inside then had the rider's right rein break at the five-eighths pole, continued alongside then took over at the half-mile pole,
cleared around the turn, then drew off under right and left handed urging and coasted in late. FLAGSTAFF tracked off the rail then angled in nearing the
turn, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, came out at the eighth pole, then drifted out further through the late stages and held off C Z ROCKET
for the place honors. C Z ROCKET was off a bit slow to begin, trailed to the turn, angled four wide around into the stretch and could not get past
FLAGSTAFF for second. COLT FICTION stalked off the inside, navigated the turn two to three wide and weakened in the drive. COLLUSION ILLUSION
chased the speed outside a rival, went four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. VERTICAL THREAT away quickest in the
beginning, led early with DR. SCHIVEL to the inside, lost command at the half-mile pole, chased from the two path through the turn, got forced out with a
furlong remaining and weakened.

Footnotes
GOING TO VEGAS jumped out quickly to take control and moved inside, led clear into the stretch, challenged by LUCK in the final sixteenth and held
gamely. LUCK brushed with rival leaving the gate, raced off the rail then moved into the two path, took closer order into the far turn, rallied outside in deep
stretch but could not get by the winner. DOGTAG stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, finished willingly along the fence through the lane but lacked
the needed late punch. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) bumped rival at the start, got forced out and bumped outside rival early, was closest in pursuit from the two
path, chased between foes leaving the final bend and never produced a bid. RIDEFORTHECAUSE got floated out and bumped early, raced in range in the
two path then between rivals leaving the backstretch, came two wide into the drive and lacked the needed response. MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) was rank
crossing surfaces early, angled to the inside while racing near the back, saved ground then tipped out in the stretch and failed to threaten. RED LARK (IRE)
brushed with inner rival at the start, reserved in the early stages off the rail then steered to the two path, exited the final turn three wide and failed to
menace. CRYSTALLE came away slow and tossed her head at the start, raced widest up the backstretch then angled to the three path for the far turn and
was not a factor. FAST JET COURT (BRZ) bumped leaving the gate, became rank and drifted out early then settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MEDINA SPIRIT sped to the front and moved over to the inside, set the pace with TIZAMAGICIAN alongside up the backstretch, cleared around the far turn,
inched away in upper stretch, urged right-handed with a furlong remaining and widened under hand urging. STILLETO BOY stalked the pacesetter on the
inside, given his cue with a quarter mile remaining, moved off the rail in the stretch and bested the rest. EXPRESS TRAIN went three wide around the first
turn, tracked between rivals in the middle stages, lacked room behind rivals on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and gained the show. TRIPOLI
traveled four deep then four wide around the first turn, raced in range off the inside, driven three wide into the lane and faltered. TIZAMAGICIAN chased on
the inside then moved out and pressured MEDINA SPIRIT, lost contact on the far turn, chased between runners into the stretch and weakened. IDOL went
three then four wide around the first turn, remained four wide to the stretch and failed to menace. AZUL COAST went three deep around the clubhouse turn,
stalked three wide to the far turn, exited the bend four to five wide and faded. MIDCOURT sat off the pace in the early stages, steered out and driven five to
six wide into the stretch, pulled up and eased with a furlong to go, eventually crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
UNITED came in and bumped rival at the start, went three wide into the clubhouse turn, between rivals on the backstretch, angled out and was driven five
wide into the lane, rallied from outside and got up at the wire. ACCLIMATE coaxed from the gate to show speed, got floated out crossing surfaces the early,
cleared first time through the stretch to take control, set the pace on the inside then two wide into the lane, led into deep stretch and got nailed at the wire.
FRIAR'S ROAD raced wide into the stretch for the first time then moved to the inside, saved ground then moved out in the lane, split foes and rallied
between the top pair late to miss. AWARD WINNER tracked the speed from inside, looked to rally up the inside but had the opening close at the eighth pole,
gained a clear path and finished willingly to the wire. MASTER PIECE (CHI) sat off the pace, raced three wide then between rivals, came two wide into the
stretch, finished well but lacked room behind ACCLIMATE late. CUPID'S CLAWS angled down to the two path then moved out on the backstretch, steered
in a few paths nearing the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and produced a mild rally. RED KING angled to the inside, moved off the rail on the
backstretch, entered the stretch two to three wide, angled to the inside in the lane and failed to threaten. READY SOUL raced between early then moved to
the three path, chased four wide into the stretch, lacked room from upper to midstretch and could not regain momentum after gaining a clear path.
NEPTUNE'S STORM broke a bit slow then got bumped from both sides, went to the front then drifted out crossing surfaces early, ceded control and
remained forwardly placed, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) off slow to begin, steered to the inside, asked
around the far and angled out to the three path but lacked room through the lane with no room to advance. CAMINO DEL PARAISO came out and bumped
rival at the start, stalked off the rail, exited the final bend four wide and weakened. MEDIA BLITZ tracked four wide early, raced in mid-pack outside rivals on
the backstretch, lost position leaving the backstretch, trailed four wide into the lane and tired.
