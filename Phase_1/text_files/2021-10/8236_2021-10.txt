Footnotes
TRAFALGAR broke a step slow, settled far off of the pace, shifted four to five wide turning for home while picking up stride, then sustained a long rally
through the lane to wear down the clear leader inside the final sixteenth, and drove clear. UNPREDICTABLE BAY set the pace along the inside, shook away
from chasing foes entering the lane, maintained a clear margin well into the final furlong, but was worn down inside the final sixteenth. MAHONEY ROAD
prompted the pace two wide early, chased the leader around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and lost place a sixteenth from
home. CHILENO failed to achieve early positioning between horses early on, took back to settle off of the pace after a furlong, commenced a three to four
wide rally around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, shifted inwards to attempt a show bid in the late stages, and kept on.
SCATTERSHACK lied far off of the pace three to four wide, and steadily improved through the lane. BRIGADIER GENERAL stalked along the inside, but
chased the leader around the turn, and tired in upper stretch. ALMUAHED hesitated at the start, saved ground from midpack around the turn, but faded
turning for home, then passed tired foes late. ORDER OF THE DAY pressed the pace three wide early on, took back to stalk approaching the five furlong
pole, but faded around the turn. MONOLOGUE broke slowly and trailed the field around the turn, swung to the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor.
KNOWHOWIKNOW tracked from midpack two wide into the turn, but faded. DRIVEN ONE was done early. WOLFE COUNTY tugged to a two wide stalking
position early on, but came under coaxing to keep pace into the turn, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO established a clear advantage into the first turn, showed the way while well in hand and staying a path or two off of the inner railing, maintained
that clear margin from chasing foes while being guided to the four path entering the lane, then glided away under very light urging through the the final
furlong. INDEPENDENCE HALL stalked the clear leader along the inside, came under rousing to hold that position behind the clear leader into the far turn,
disposed of his place-vying counterpart entering the lane before attempting a rail bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, but proved no match for that foe
passing the furlong grounds, and was clearly second best. SHARED SENSE saved ground off of the pace, shifted two wide while aiming for a rally between
horses, but only managed to battle for show inside of TACITUS through the late stages, and prevailed. TACITUS trailed after a bit of a flat-footed start early
on, shifted to the three path into the first turn to improve to a tracking position around that bend but came under a drive to sustain a gain passing the half
mile pole, but only responded mildly through the lane, vied for show outside of SHARED SENSE through the final furlong, but was bested for that positoin.
CHESS CHIEF was allowed to settle early on at the rear of the field, trailed into the lane, and never got involved. SPRAWL stalked two wide, came under
urging to keep pace into the far turn, sustained chasing position around that bend, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
SHE CAN'T SING prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead into the turn, quickly assumed command entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and
was driven home to seal the deal. JILTED BRIDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated kindly far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, split
foes two wide in upper stretch while commencing a rally, then sustained that charge to claim place at the sixteenth pole while not threatening the leader.
COMPELLING SMILE trailed in the three path into the turn, tipped six wide passing the quarter pole, and stayed on well to reach show. HIMIKO settled far
off of the pace, lied at the rear of the field in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in upper stretch,
attempted a show bid inside of foes late, but was outkicked for that posiition. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL set the pace along the inside, met the winner's bid
into the turn, proved no match for that foe turning for home, the lost place a sixteenth out and faltered late. RECODED lied off of the pace two wide, shifted
four wide around the turn, but lacked a rally. VELVET CRUSH raced off of the pace four wide, then faded five wide turning for home. GRAND CRU CLASSE
broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn, chased turning
for home, but faltered between horses approaching midstretch. RISING SEAS stalked along the inside, faded turning for home, and further weakened in
upper stretch. PORTAL CREEK tracked three wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
PLAINSMAN settled off of the pace three wide, advanced in hand to track the leading group around the turn, shifted inwards entering the lane to split foes
two wide in upper stretch, bid for the lead at the furlong pole, kicked clear leaving that marker, and safely held from BEAU LIAM to the wire. BEAU LIAM
broke a step slowly, shifted outside of foes to regain early position, prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, got floated to the four path turning
for home, but required rider encouragement to change leads entering the lane causing him to be outkicked by an inner foe approaching midstretch, then
chased that foe home to prove second best. ATOKA set the pace two wide, shifted to the three path turning for home while vying between horses, but was
headed by a pair of foes on both sides passing the furlong marker, and yielded. RUSHIE tracked four wide, stalked while being floated to the five path
turning for home, but only managed to chase the leaders evenly through the lane. SOUTH BEND trailed early on, commenced a two wide rally turning for
home, sustained that mild gain while steadily shifting ground to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to threaten the leaders late. MR DUMAS vied along
the inside, but gave way to outer foes approaching the furlong grounds. GUEST SUITE lied off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the six
path entering the lane, and failed to factor. EXCULPATORY stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn, but failed to bid before
weakening. MO MOSA stumbled significantly at the start, then was outrun along the inside, bled, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
HAPPY AMERICAN was off a bit slowly, settled far off of the pace two wide, advanced to track the pace in hand three wide around the far turn, split foes
two wide in upper stretch while commencing a rally, the bid between the leaders a sixteenth out, and quickly drove clear on his left lead. RUNNIN' RAY
broke through the gate pre-race, but was quickly reloaded, broke sharply, pressed the pace two wide, vied turning for home, forged a very narrow
advantage in midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. CHEFFY tracked three wide, gained four wide turning for home, but leveled
off in upper stretch, chased before being outkicked by an inner foe passing the furlong pole, then kept on for a minor share. LAUGHING BOY set the pace
along the inside, dug in to resist outer bids turning for home, but yielded passing the sixteenth pole. CALIBRATE tracked from midpack along the inside,
took the far turn two wide, and stayed on through the lane. DECISION MAKER had a slow start between horses and trailed the field early on, rallied six wide
and outside of foes through the far turn, but only mildly sustained that bid through the lane while lugging in through the final furlong. CORRADO failed to
factor. CARILLO lied off of the pace four wide, gained ground five wide around the far turn, but faltered between horses entering the lane. AMANI'S EAGLE
was bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked two wide, bid for the lead three wide turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
BLANKET OF ROSES saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. GENTLE SOUL never got involved. ISLAND BOY bumped an outer foe at the start,
stalked along the inside, but faded into the far turn.
