Footnotes
LAURA'S ANGLE settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path into the backstretch, commenced a rally into the far turn to press the
leading pair around that bend, then sustained his bid to vie for the lead outside of TEMPLE BELLE in upper stretch, exchanged brushes in midstretch before
forging an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed while receiving a bump to her hind quarters at the wire. TEMPLE BELLE stalked three wide,
then vied two wide around the far turn, took control turning for home as LAURA'S ANGEL menaced alongside, dug in while exchanging brushes with that
bidding rival through midstretch, but was headed a sixteenth from home, then came out an bumped her counterpart at the wire while being bested.
HOSTILE PRINCESS lied far off of the pace three wide, failed to advance between horses approaching the half mile pole, but shifted outside of them into
the far turn, rallied well in the four path around that bend, claimed show at the furlong grounds with multiple lengths to find on the leading pair, but leveled
off, and held that position late. MADAM PIE stalked comfortably along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, then kept on late,
but failed to regain show. SUA SORELLA set the pace, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes into the far turn, but weakened turning for home.
IPSUM GRATUS was void of early speed two wide, improved in the five path and outside of foes around the far turn, but failed to menace. EIDA'S STORM
tugged while tracking in the three to two path around the first turn, and tired. FRONTIER DYNASTY failed to factor. INSPEIGHTFUL got rank at the start,
stayed unsettled while advancing in the four path around the first turn, then faded into the far turn. I'M STYLIN got restless waiting for the gates to open,
then never got involved. GET CLEAR lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but was through after a half mile. THE RIDER OF TEMPLE
BELLE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST LAURA'S ANGEL FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
COUSIN LARRY broke half a step slowly, settled off of the pace along the inside, smoothly shifted four wide into the far turn while commencing a rally, blew
past a trio of inner foes entering the lane, then took over and drew off. TIZ RYE TIME stalked along the inside, but lacked a kick to split the leading foes into
the far turn, got outmoved by an outer rallying COUSIN LARRY entering the lane, shifted outside of that foe in upper stretch, and chased him home well to
cut the gap late. BEACHWALKER set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes into the far turn, but offered little resistance to
a bidding COUSIN LARRY passing the quarter pole, and yielded thereafter. SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN tracked two wide, but got outmoved by an inner foe
into the far turn, and failed to factor. GENERATOR pressed the pace two wide, required coaxing down the backstretch to keep pace, then faded between
horses turning for home. BELAFONTE broke a step slowly, lied at the rear of the field three wide into the first turn, but advanced into the backstretch to a
pressing position at the five furlong pole, but tired at the half mile pole.

Footnotes
BARSTOW was bounced around between horses at the start, rushed to a stalking position along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane, ranged up
to the leaders at the furlong pole, and drove clear. RELATIVLEA trailed two wide into the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch while commencing a
rally, then shifted back to the three path at the furlong grounds while aiming to split horses, and sustained his bid to reach place on the wire. WHISKEY
GENT pressed the pace two wide, bid turning for home, led passing the three sixteenths pole as BARSTOW menaced, but was outkicked by that foe
passing the furlong grounds, proved no match, then was nailed on the wire for place. BIG PETE broke inwardly, stalked three wide, got floated four wide by
an inner foe while getting outkicked by that rival, then kept on thereafter. REMEMBER NORMANDY set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the
three sixteenths pole, and yielded through the final furlong. FATHER PATRICK saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. KEEN MIND tracked from
midpack two wide, shifted four wide into the turn, and faded. MAMANEEDSNEWSHOES got caught five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and
never got involved.

HOPE AND DIGNITY prompted the pace three wide, chased the clear leader through upper stretch before ranging up at the furlong grounds, forged an
advantage passing that marker, inched clear, and held gamely from a pair of inner bidding foes late. THING stalked comfortably from the pocket, shifted to
the three path approaching midstretch, attempted to split the leaders passing that marker as an inner rival bid, but failed to reach the outer leader while
achieving place. CARAMELITO saved ground at the rear of the field, rallied well along the fence through the lane to bid for the lead inside of foes in the final
furlong, but was kept at bay late, and missed reaching place. CHIEF HOWCOME dueled for the lead along the inside, scooted clear entering the lane, but
was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, and yielded between horses late. ROCKSTAR RO tracked along the inside, swung four wide passing
the quarter pole, and chased the leaders home well while grinding away. BEZOS settled far off of the pace three wide, altered course six wide at the three
sixteenths pole for clear racing room, and stayed on. MAXI BOY (GB) was slow into stride, lied at the rear of the field two wide into the turn, split foes five
wide approaching midstretch, but failed to menace. SUPER DESIGN lied off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. CHEEKY CHAPS stalked two wide
and between horses into the turn, shifted outside of the leading trio approaching the five sixteenths pole, but drifted further out entering the lane, then lacked
a kick in upper stretch, and faltered between horses. SCIENCE (IRE) lied forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but got floated five wide before
fading turning for home. DR. DUKE dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. CONTINENTAL COINS tracked
four wide, but got floated six wide turning for home, and faded.

wire. PASS THE PLATE trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, made a late bid three wide but was kept at bay and
lost place at the wire. DOMINGA chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run.

drive while drifting out and prevailed in the final stages. PIECE OF MY HEART stalked the pace early, was in the two path through the turn, inched ahead
near the eighth pole while under a long drive, drifted out through the drive and did not have enough in the final stages. POWDER RIVER chased the pace
early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. MOVIE MOXY
chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch run. BREAK CURFEW was

a bid down the lane under a long drive and just missed at the wire. ALREADY CHARMING set the pace early, raced in the two path into the lane, was under
a long drive down the lane, drifted out badly and was caught in the final stages. JACCACI stalked the pace early, raced in the three path entering the lane,
made a bid down the lane, was carried out a bit and did not have enough in the final stages. PARIS PARAMOUR raced rank into the first turn, was steadied
