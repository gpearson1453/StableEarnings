Footnotes
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, bumped with KAREN'S COVE while
rallying five wide into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead near the furlong marker then drew clear under strong urging. TAPIZEARANCE pressed the
pace on the outside of three foes, vied in the four path on the turn, led into upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner near the furlong marker and proved no
match while clear for the place. FLOWERS FOR LISA lacked early speed, started the turn in the three path then shifted five wide, moved to six wide later on
that bend, floated seven wide into the stretch and was up for the show. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in
upper stretch, raced between foes into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed response. TALE OF MIST broke a half-step slow then dropped back, was
reserved off the pace, went four then five wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond. THE GREAT DANSKY disputed the pace between horses,
vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. KAREN'S COVE had his head turned at the start then
was taken up and off slow, moved up on the outside, chased five wide on the turn, was bumped into upper stretch and capitulated. WINNING DRIVE was
coaxed along while contesting the pace on the inside of a trio of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and also tired.
SHAMROCKED disputed the pace between horses, vied in the three path under urging while still between foes on the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and faded.

drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. DREAMS OF TOMORROW three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped to the three path nearing the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to preserve the place

tipped out to the four path near the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to close in missing for the place honors. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME coaxed from the
gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered in the inside route into upper stretch and kept on through to the

wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, took the lead around the quarter-pole then shook clear, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and was
overtaken while clear for the place. BROADWAY FORCE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path under urging on
the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. EVERYONELOVESLINDA was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure
from the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole and gave way. OH MRS. MAISEL was well placed just off the pace,
drafted inside on the turn, was given her cue with five-sixteenths to run, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. CELESTIAL bumped with a rival at
the start while off a bit slow, settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CONTINENTALCONGRES broke out then bumped with

REGAL QUALITY settled off the pace, drafted inside to the two path early on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, rallied to lead while given a large
gap at the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, extended the advantage under the crop into the final furlong, remained under the crop until just before
the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. KUMAR settled off the pace, was asked three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five
wide later on that bend, turned into the stretch under a drive, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead
and finished willingly for the place. MARBLE MOON settled at the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished with
good energy to garner the show. PLAYWRIGHT settled towards the inside, was roused on the turn, angled four wide late on that bend, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick. PAUL THE WAITER settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. BIG MOUNTAIN showed good speed, set the pace with some company to his outside, lost the lead into the stretch and
gave way. HUSHION tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, was urged along while continuing four wide passing the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the
two to three path on the turn, dropped back under urging passing the five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch and tired. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER

Footnotes
WOODBINE WAY established the front crossing to show the way in hand along the inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner
into upper stretch and got roused straightened away, went clear under a drive kept to task. JASMINESQUE three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner.
FUNWHILEITLASTED chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then weakened
in the late stages. SASSY MELISSA broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, bobbled at the break recovering outwards and brushed
KHALI MAGIC, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. HOHOHOHO forwardly placed
just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
A RING THING three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside for home and weakened. TAKE IT OFF lunged and got away to an awkward beginning when the assistant starter made
inadvertent contact with the rider with his right arm and came inwards bumping KEMBA, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, cut
the corner into upper stretch and tired. KHALI MAGIC got brushed at the start by SASSY MELISSA, chased along the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. KEMBA got bumped at the start by TAKE IT OFF, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths and tired. SUDDEN IMPULSE three to four wide in pursuit, got ridden along at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TROUBLESHOOTER settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside, closed
fast to get the lead just inside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady handling. EMPEROR'S CAUSE was hustled from the start, settled towards
the front, was asked while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch under the crop, took a brief lead into the
final furlong then was headed by the winner and proved no match while clear for the place. PURPLE HEARTED showed good speed, set the pace under
pressure to the inside, vied in the two path on the turn, moved clear coming to the quarter-pole then was put to a drive, lost the lead near the furlong marker
and weakened but held the show. OUR MAN MIKE was urged along off the pace, moved closer while four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and capitulated. RUN FOR BOSTON dropped back while ridden along, went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor. BIG CASTLE was rated just
off the pace then let out while two then three wide on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and tired. COPPER
CHALICE was hustled from the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up
empty. IT'S GRAVY pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, drew even leaving the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn and had nothing left.
CLEVER FELLOW was a touch slow into stride, raced at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn and showed little. GREAT WORKOUT broke
awkwardly and was off a bit slow, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
