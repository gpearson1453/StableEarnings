Footnotes
JUMP INTO THE FIRE sped clear early on, managed a clear margin around the turn, and inched away through the final furlong. SUNSET AT MALLORY
chased the leader two wide, and proved second best. TRIBORD tracked the leading pair from the three path around the turn, but only managed to chase
them through the lane without progressing. FLIRTATIOUS KITTY broke slowly, settled off of the pace, improved two wide around the turn, and kept on for a
minor share, but failed to threaten. BRODY SLAM bobbled slightly at the start, lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to make an
impact. SPEED ZONE chased from midpack along the inside around the turn, and failed to factor. MINI DRESS lied far off of the pace three wide and failed
to factor. ASIA ASIA got a bit antsy before the gates opened, then lunged inwards at the start, chased the leaders two wide and between horses before
being bumped by those foes when put to tight quarters into the turn, then quickly faltered approaching the three furlong pole. ON MY OWN was never
involved.

Footnotes
COVE BLUE set the pace outside of a vying THE QUEENS JULES down the backstretch, cleared that foe into the turn, showed the way in hand around the
bend, then responded when roused in upper stretch, and drew off willingly. THE QUEENS JULES vied along the inside of COVE BLUE early on before
allowing that foe to clear into the turn, stalked two wide, chased entering the lane, but failed to match strides in upper stretch, then lasted for place. FROLIC
MORE was last away, lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, grinded away through upper stretch to claim show inside of TOAS inside the furlong
pole, altered course outside of a tiring rival at the sixteenth pole to bid for place, but missed reaching that position on the wire. TAOS stalked the leading pair
from the three path around the turn, then tired through the lane while drifting a bit outwards. NEWS BOX saved ground off of the pace, but faded through the
lane. FIRE MARSHALL BILL trailed by a distance early on, and never got involved. ROCK ON KITTEN chased the pace early on, but faded between horses
around the turn.

Footnotes
BLOSSOM ROAD cleared and crossed over after half of a furlong, set the pace along the inside, met SHANIAH's bid into the turn, vied inside of that foe
before repelling that rival approaching the furlong grounds, and drew clear. SHANIAH took back to allow BLOSSOM ROAD to clear early on, pressed that
foe from the outside, bid into the turn, vied through upper stretch, but was repelled approaching the furlong pole, and proved second best. TAPTIME tracked
the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn, and stayed on through the lane for a minor share. FORTUNA ADIUVAT lied forwardly placed in
the three path and between a pair of rivals through the turn, but failed to produce a bid. OOPSY DAISY stalked inside of a pair of foes while a path off of the
rail around the turn, but tired through the lane. FINE PROSPECTURE was getting out early and required rider correction which caused her to lag well
behind the field, and showed little. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF SHANIAH vs BLOSSOM ROAD FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
THE OPENING FURLONG, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
ALEXANDROS settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole to attempt a rally, took aim on the clear leader
in midstretch, ranged up to that foe a sixteenth from home, and edged past. MACHISMO set the pace inside of a pressing MO'S MOJO around the turn,
shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, but was collared by ALEXANDROS passing the sixteenth pole, and was bested. MO'S MOJO prompted the pace
two wide, vied around the turn, but was repelled in upper stretch, and yielded. BROTHER AARON stalked along the inside, and chased along the rail
through the lane. ESKENFORIT never got involved. LOST IN LIMBO stalked two wide, and faded through the lane. MOROCCO chased three wide, but
faltered approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
VIDAL dueled for the lead inside of ROOSTER RUN, shook clear of that foe at the furlong grounds, and was drew off. ROOSTER RUN dueled for the lead
outside of VIDAL, but failed to match strides at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. ROWLEY'S DREAM got rank briefly early on when ROOSTER
RUN cleared across his path, stalked the leading duelers three wide around the the turn, but only managed to chase them through the lane. THEN WE'LL
BE GOOD broke slowly, lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to menace. MEATABALL broke slowly, lied at the rear of the field in
the two path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. KISSALOT stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home.
