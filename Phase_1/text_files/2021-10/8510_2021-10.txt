Footnotes
SHEA ON A MISSION was forwardly placed in opening stages and stayed on two wide around the turn, remained game in pursuit of AMERICAN EXPRESS
In the stretch run, dug in under steady pressure along the outside and got up in final strides. AMERICAN EMPRESS held a slim lead in opening stages then
took clearer command and held firm around the turn, roused for more turning for home, stayed on with good response but could not hold off the late surge
from the winner. COMMISSIO came away last and raced off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, came out five wide turning
for home and churned on for a share. SADE PURSE raced in range through early stages, urged three wide around the turn then flattened out. CAJUN
SPICE was not far back in the opening quarter, continued a three wide bid in range at the quarter pole then got carried out wide by FUTURE FLAY late on
the turn, continued wide into the lane and had no late response. FUTURE FLAY bumped with rivals at the start, raced up close in early stages, continued a
bid into the turn then drifted out wide past the quarter pole and faded. ANGELS CAN FLY bumped with rival at the start, lacked speed, saved ground around
the turn and had no response. LADY SIMPATIA bumped at the start, lacked speed, raced two wide around the turn and never menaced.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MALLOMAR stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch then moved up to engage RAKI at the quarter pole, gained a slim advantage
entering the top of the lane then pulled away under steady pressure. WONDER BLONDY was off a bit slow at the start then rated near midpack along the
outside, given cue three wide leaving the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and gained place. RAKI cleared and crossed over to the
inside around the first turn, set the pace to the far turn then came under under attack from the winner at the quarter pole, could move move on for the lead at
the head of the lane and gave way. PASSION PLUS raced in range through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, came out wider
for the drive and needed more for late impact. CLASSY OF COURSE raced in contention tracking the early pace, hustled up on the rail midway around the
turn, tipped out two wide for the drive and evened out. MONEY FACTOR was a half step slow at the start the settled not far back two to three wide, urged
for response around the far turn and failed to move on. CHARGE IT JENN was not too far back through early stages, saved ground and offered no late bid.

Footnotes
ALOBRAH was a step slow at the start then powered forward to a clear lead, set the pace and saved ground around the turn, roused for more turning for
home, had more left in reserve, dug in under firm handling and held clear. DOMINANT JOY tracked the pacesetter while racing clear over the next pursuer
around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, stayed on gamely in pursuit for ALOBRAH but could not get to rival and had to settle for second best. TONE
ELISE was forced to check at the start and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and captured show. FLECHE D'AMOUR
raced off the early pace, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn then got edged out late for show. ALEIDA stumbled sharply and veered at the
start, hustled up going by the half mile marker, saved ground into the lane and never threatened. ONLY GIRL got bumped and forced to check at the start,
raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. STARE IF YOU MUST chased the top pair through the backstretch, lost ground on the leaders around
the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
AMAZING TRIP held a length lead on top over ARETE'S CHALICE in the opening quarter, widened advantage while still unasked around the turn, tapped
on the shoulder turning for home, had plenty left in reserve, stayed near the inside and stayed sharp. ARETE'S CHALICE prompted the pace in the opening
quarter then remained forwardly placed behind the leader around the turn, launched a three wide bid entering the lane, was no late match for the winner but
finished clearly second best. BRAVO ZULU hit the gate and bumped with TRUE BEAST at the start, raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide
into the lane and got a head up late to take show. INES'S HATS raced in range off the top trio, was ridden along three wide around the turn, angled inside at
the head of the lane and got edged late for show. HOTLINE TO HEAVEN saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention. MAKIN IT LOOK
EASY stumbled at the start but still managed to sit in close range, remained forwardly placed around the turn then faded at the head of the lane. TRUE
BEAST bumped with BRAVO ZULU at the start, had the rider drop the crop five-sixteenths out, and had no response.

JULIE BIRD (IRE) tracked the leader into the turn, was ridden along the inside then tipped out three wide for the drive, remained game in pursuit of
BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY and got up on the wire. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY cleared on top and angled inside in opening stages, held a slim lead over
EMPEROR'S SONG around the turn, dug in determinedly and held a slim lead mid-stretch then got denied in final stride. BONHEUR raced off the early
speed, swung four to five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and captured show. KAY'S PROJECT raced outside a foe in the second flight around
the turn, came out four wide heading into the lane and chased on evenly. EMPEROR'S SONG raced up close two wide around the turn, continued in striking
distance into the final furlong then had no closing response. GREGS POSSE raced off the second flight heading into the turn, saved ground into the lane
and failed to move on. AUDREY raced in the back, went four to five wide into the lane and failed to respond. V K PRINCESS raced off the pace, saved
ground around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL held a slim lead out of the chute and set a pressured pace over close running SMOOTH AS GLASS, edged away on top still unasked
around the turn, raced two wide into the lane and drew off under a strong hand ride. SMOOTH AS GLASS applied pace pressure to PRETTY RACHAEL
through the backstretch, launched a bid for rival around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a steady three wide bid and finished
second best. MISS ITALY was reserved through early stages, saved ground around the turn and stayed on for a share. DINNER AT FIVE tracked the top
two leaders through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn then gave way. I'M A COCO PEBBLES raced off the pace, hustled up two
wide around the turn and failed to move on. GRAN RESERVA raced in range through the backstretch then steadily weakened. SILVER PACKAGE slightly
bobbled just after the start and came up empty after a half.
