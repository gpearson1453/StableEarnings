LOVELY LYDIA was rated along early, then was guided out and made a three wide bid on the turn, then dueled for command by the quarter pole to the
furlong marker, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under right handed urging. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST was away alertly to set the pace
on the inside while clear, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and dueled for command to the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner
late while clearly second best. AMEN SYLVIA chased the early pace, then was on the inside on the turn, swung out three wide for the drive but offered no
rally while besting the rest. FLATTERING RUBY stumbled at the start, then chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the drive but came up empty.
MS TEEK was off slowly, then settled back early, raced three wide by the quarter pole and offered no rally.

Footnotes
A MAIZE ZING RIP was away alertly and crossed over to set the early pace while racing on the inside, then drew out leaving the turn and was clear by the
furlong marker, then started to tire late but held sway to prove bets under a drive. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA steadied shortly after the start, then shifted to
the out side and made a five to six wide run on the turn, closed the gap late on the outside. AUTOMATE chased the early pace from the inside, then was
shuffled back on the turn, then shifted out leaving the turn and rallied late. COMMISSIONER BIGGS chased the early pace from in between horses, then
steadied around the nine sixteenths pole, then came three wide into the stretch, and was gaining late in between rivals. KRACHENWAGEN was bumped at
the start, chased the pace four wide and in between rivals, made a four wide bid on the turn and then was empty. READY AND RICH was bumped at the
start, tracked the early pace and made a mild bid five wide on the turn and weakened. The jockey on WAHOOWA WAHOOWA claimed foul versus the
winner for interference shortly after the gate, after reviewing the replays the stewards left the race as is.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT HAULER was well placed early on the inside, then eased out on the turn and made a two wide bid in hand to be clear by the quarter pole and
dropped over to the inside, then started to wander leaving the turn, shifted out four wide by the furlong marker and responded to crop urging to draw off in
the final furlong to prove best under a drive. DAKOTA OUTLAW was hustled after not breaking that sharply, was three wide into the first turn, then got to the
front and set the pace and moved to the inside, was headed on the turn, shifted out to make a bid four wide leaving the turn but flattened out, clearly second
best. FOLE'S NOTION was allowed to settle and advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and got the nod for the show award.
CRYPT was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, then was outfinished for the show spot. GREAT BEND passed the tiring rivals.
TUCKERTON BAY was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and tired. IRISH CHARLIE failed to menace. BOCK chased the pace three
wide and stopped. MR CLIPBOARD was not a factor.

IZZADORA BELLA vied for the early lead and made a inside bid leaving the five sixteenths pole to shake clear by the quarter pole, then drew out in the
stretch to prove best under a drive. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, then shifted out four wide leaving the turn
for aim, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. LOLANITA was allowed to settle while three wide, then came four wide into the
drive but offered no rally while besting the rest. GIZMO'S DESTINY chased the pace four to five wide down the backstretch and weakened. MAGALIE was
off a step slow, then settled towards the inside and lacked a rally. LADY JOANNA vied for the lead three wide to the far turn and tired. LUNAR STAR stalked
the pace four wide and stopped.

STUDIO B pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch while being kept to
pressure. SMART TWO A T was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide, came four wide into the drive and finished willingly to be clearly second
best. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved early on the inside, swung out five wide for the drive but offered no rally on the top two while besting the rest.
EXECUTIVE DECREE chased the pace four to five wide and weakened. FORMAN THE FOREMAN set a pressured pace on the inside of the winner but in
the two path and faltered. MCPHERSON was allowed to settle while five wide, came seven wide into the drive and was not a threat.
