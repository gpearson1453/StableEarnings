AGORA was four wide into the first turn while clear, set the pace down the backstretch while off the inside, then dug in gamely in the stretch and held on late
to prove best under a drive. PRIDE IN THE BIZ chased the early pace three wide, advanced while two wide on the inside and made a inside bid leaving the
turn, but hung late. NEARLY MISSED was allowed to settle early, made a four wide middle move to be in contention on the backstretch, but flattened out in
the drive. COLOR FORCE chased the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled back on the backstretch, made a inside bid on the turn, clipped heels of
PRIDE IN THE BIZ leaving the quarter pole and stumbled, regained footing leaving the turn but lacked the needed winning kick. GIZMO'S PRINCESS was
reserved early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole but offered no significant rally in the drive. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS was allowed to settle early,
made a three wide middle move in between rivals on the backstretch and weakened.
