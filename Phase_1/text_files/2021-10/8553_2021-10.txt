stretch drive. HICKORY MADE raced off the pace, moved up on the turn and finished evenly. KAZ'S PRINCESS reluctant to load, then was off slowly,
checked at the three eighths marker dropping back, then closed belatedly inside. DARESCA raced off the pace inside, checked entering the turn, continued
inside and failed to threaten. MARGIE DAREST reared up at the break, outrun early, raced three wide on the turn and did not factor. BUTTON CANDY
