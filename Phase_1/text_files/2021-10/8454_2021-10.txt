Footnotes
FLOATING BY , four wide around the first turn, prompted three wide and well in hand leaving the three quarter pole, bid outside SIMMARD SHENANIGAN
to add more pressure heading towards the far turn, dueled and took a slim lead with a quarter to go, battled outside CONGRESS HALL from the head of the
lane, lost command near mid stretch then battled back under right handed rousing to regain command in the final yards. CONGRESS HALL eased back off
the leaders while saving ground mid way on the first turn, checked off heels soon after, regrouped and edged up to track rivals into the far turn, dropped
down and lodged a rail bid to make it three across approaching the stretch, dueled and gained a slim lead near the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but
wasn't quite good enough in the final strides. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN eased out early and pulled her way to the front heading to the backstretch, went
clear and set a rated pace two wide, handled outside pressure from the winner into the far turn, staved off that one to the quarter pole, shifted out with
pursuit then drifted late while coming up empty. OLIVE'S BUMPA , four wide early, dropped in some nearing the five eighths and faded. GLORY MARCH
forced the early pace, saved ground leaving the five eighths and faded.

Footnotes
LONG DISTANCE LOVE prompted the pace outside YOU NEVER CALL, overtook that one in upper stretch and drew clear under steady handling.
SPECIAL FREEDOM stalked the pace off the rail, was three wide turning for home and rallied slightly. SECRET PRIZE lacked speed, swung four deep
leaving the turn and rallied mildly. YOU NEVER CALL set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. HUMMIN' THE FUNK , near the inner rail
in upper stretch, swung to the five path near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. ELLAROUGE , pinched back after breaking slowly, lacked a response
and was eased in the drive. EL MILAGRA gave way on the turn and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
MINNETONKA bobbled at the break and was bumped soon after, regrouped and vied to the inside of SASSY BABE, eased back off that one nearing the
turn and stalked, had her heels clipped by BOURBON WILDCAT near the three eighths, eased out and took aim three wide entering the lane, closed in
under pressure, took a slim lead with a furlong remaining, dueled under left handed asking to the sixteenth pole then held firm through steady hand
encouragement late. SASSY BABE popped the gate pre race, had speed outside the winner and then went clear into the turn, set the pace two wide into the
stretch, dug in when confronted, battled gamely through the final furlong but wasn't quite good enough. AMERICAS WOMAN , off the pace while saving
ground, angled five wide into the stretch, advanced between runners in mid stretch, altered in towards the rail for the final seventy yards and finished well to
be gaining. BAY OF ANGELS unseated her rider when fractious in the gate, raced off the early pace while three wide, angled wider into the stretch, moved
up in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. TEA IN CHINA , fractious in the gate, rated early while off the rail, advanced three to four wide around the
turn, had aim in mid stretch then faded late. SOME NIGHTS , off slowly, lagged off the pace, angled out and circled seven wide into the stretch but failed to
generate a run through the final furlong. BOURBON WILDCAT tracked to the inside of rivals, clipped the heels of the winner and was taken up sharply mid
turn, recovered to make a mild three wide run in mid stretch, failed to continue on then faded under a hand ride. SALAMINA , towards the inside, steadied to
avoid BOURBON WILDCAT mid turn, angled out and came up empty. SHYLA GIRL flashed speed then chased between runners, angled in approaching
the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. ORDINARY GIRL moved up three wide into the turn, chased to upper stretch and faltered.

ground around the turn, remained near the inner rail in upper stretch, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied mildly. AMERICAN BOUND showed

Footnotes
MOQUIST drifted out at the break, straightened and advanced inside foes to take over leaving the chute, went clear and set a rated pace two wide, turned
away FRAUDULENT CHARGE around the turn, kicked away after being roused near the three sixteenths then held firm under a mild drive. BELLE OF THE
NORTH , pinched back at the break, recovered and settled well back while inside, came under some pressure leaving the far turn, angled out advancing
near the quarter pole, dropped back inside and finished with good energy. FRAUDULENT CHARGE was sent up between foes early on and stalked three
wide, lodged a mild bid leaving far turn but was quickly turned away, gave hard chase past the quarter pole, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded.
MOONSAFE angled in early, pulled her way forward while saving ground nearing the half mile marker, gave pursuit to the quarter pole then weakened. MY
MY GIRL was steadied early on, chased two wide and weakened. MOVIE SCORE , forced out a bit at the break, rushed up, chased four wide mid turn and
weakened. MISS MARLEY gave brief chase four wide and retreated. FLAVA'S DREAM , five wide early on, faltered.

POLISHED GAL broke alertly, hugged the inner rail under confident rating, swung outside in mid stretch, closed strongly, led near the sixteenth pole and
was beginning to edge clear at the wire. CHROMEPLATED HEART circled the turn three deep, took the lead in upper stretch and was no match for the
winner in the drive. HONORGETIC , along the inner rail around the turn, raced in the two path inside horses in the stretch and rallied. NOT MY MONEY
hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. WHAT A TRICK , three wide on the turn, failed to rally.
RAPIDASHQUEEN , never a factor, passed tired rivals. PRETTY LORI set the pace in the two path on the turn and gave way. NOT ON MY WATCH , four
wide turning for home, retreated.

DEPOSITORY bobbled at the break, straightened and took over leaving the chute, set the pace about two wide while handling outside pressure, was roused
clear soon into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, drifted in when switching over to his left lead, got back on his correct lead late and proved
much the best. INK , three wide between rivals early on, was under a hearty ride pursuing outside runners mid turn, shifted out five wide and churned on
willingly. WHATCHASAID , close up four wide outside rivals early on, dropped back mid turn, angled wider in the drive and came back on. REASSURED ,
bumped at the break, corrected and stalked inside, was under pressure past the three eighths and faded. RAPID RESPONSE leaned in and bumped with
ROYAL NUMBER at the start, pressed three wide outside the winner, stayed willingly to the sixteenths pole hen gave way. ROYAL NUMBER , bumped and
pinched back at the break, raced between runners early on, failed to kick on under pressure past the three eighths and gave way.

AMERICAN BASTET accelerated to the early, raced near the inner rail around the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away under
pressure. MATTITUDE saved ground around the turn, angled out turning for home, was taken back to the rail, chased the winner and was best of the
others. BY THE HOUR outrun, hugged the inner rail on the turn and passed tired rivals. MAGGIE'S BID , unruly in the starting gate, was well positioned
three deep on the turn and faltered in mid stretch. HITECH IS BACK briefly chased the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, faltered and
was eased. ROYAL APPOINTMENT , two wide on the turn, faltered approaching the stretch and was eased.
