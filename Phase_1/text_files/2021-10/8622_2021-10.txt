through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and dug in to take second mid-stretch. EXCUSES EXCUSES was hustled along inside
and took the lead at the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, was caught at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn, angled to
the three path into the stretch, lugged in across the path of Pettyforurthoughts mid-stretch and finished evenly. IHEARTRAINACOMN chased toward the
outside, rounded most of the turn about the four path, was carried outward nearing the top of the lane and passed rivals. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS came
in at the break then picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail, checked off the heels of Excuses Excuses mid-stretch and flattened stride.
WITNESS THE ENERGY was shuffled back on the chute then gave chase through the backstretch, entered the turn about the three path, angled out toward
the head of the lane then flattened the final furlong. HAZY WINTER raced well back and rounded the turn about the three path. The Stewards reviewed a
claim of foul against the rider of Excuses Excuses, lodged by the rider of Pettyforurthoughts, and as a result, disqualified the former for lugging across the
path of the latter mid-stretch.

ALPINE MOON settled off the pace inside on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead
toward the quarter, raced briefly clear mid turn, dug in to turn Vintage Gin back mid-stretch and just held off the later arrival of SECRET CASTLE, who
stalked inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadied at the rail at the five sixteenths, recovered stride into the turn, eased to the three path entering the
stretch, dug in to take second later yards and just missed. VINTAGE GIN took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the
pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, was caught at the rail nearing the quarter, though, continued a threat to mid-stretch before
relenting. SHERWOOD LADY stalked the pace from the three path, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close to the quarter, then faded
in the three path of the far turn. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG saved ground.

WEAVINTHEBLOCKS became a bit anxious in the gate then settled off the early pace about the three path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. KID GENIUS
contested the pace two deep and took the nod nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn, came under steady handling leaving the
turn but was caught flattening stride later yards. CAYATANO rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and raced at the rail on
the far turn, came again through the final furlong and was along for third late. SALTY J J contested the pace inside, was met at the five sixteenths pole and
engaged in close chase from that point, but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. GHOST MINE saved ground and showed
little response through the backstretch. WE GOT THE MONEY saved ground. TEDDY TED settled back in the three path the first turn, never factored and
was eased.

SONDE AFFAIR settled back off the rail the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and came between horses midway on the far turn, left
the turn four wide and dug in to take the nod the final yards. LOVE TO ZOOM rated a short lead inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths
pole, held a clear advantage at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was caught and gave up the nod the final yards.
CREATIVE SPLENDOR settled off the rail the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened
inside the sixteenth pole. POWER SONDE stalked two deep and challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail most of the far turn
but drifted into the stretch and flattened. CEDARS BULLS EYE became fractious in the gate and had to be reloaded, saved early ground then eased
outward into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn. HOW IS SHE raced well back in
the three and four paths and never factored. TEST ME I DARE U rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled outside into the backstretch, bid
toward the three eighths pole then weakened in the six path of the far turn.

Footnotes
BRANDYURAFINEGIRL angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail approaching the
top of the stretch and was steadily handled through the lane. PLANETARY stalked in the three and four paths the first turn then engaged in close chase
leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the top of the stretch but dug in for second mid-stretch. OUT OF ROMANCE stalked off the rail on the
first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then relented second mid-stretch. MISS BEE HIVING saved
ground well off the pace on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid at the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far
turn and passed rivals in an even finish. WOODSONG'S CASTLE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn in the three path and showed little further. LADY CINCO DE MAYO rounded the opening turn in the four path and never factored.
NEEDACARCALLLOUIE saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn then weakened.
