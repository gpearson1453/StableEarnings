and was all out through the stretch. STELLA UNREAL was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no

LOUEMMA tracked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. YES PLEASE stalked the
leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path through the stretch was no match for the winner. HASN'T HIT ME YET was
away alertly and had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. SUBZERO PLUS was up close early and roused on the
turn but had no response. CRUMLIN EXPRESS was off slow and showed little in a dull effort.

KATZ THE MUSIC was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. WONNEFRAC
stalked the leaders from the outside, had a good position on the turn and vied from the five path through the stretch but was outgunned. C BY THE SEA was
in mid pack, roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. TOPPING THE CHARTS showed no speed, saved ground
on the turn and was the best of the rest. MAKE IT RAIN showed speed from the inside and was a factor on the turn but flattened out through the stretch.
ROYAL FANFARE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. SAVUKA was well back and showed nothing while outrun.

CASSIE'S RAINBOW was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY
was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SOMEONE ELSE tracked the
leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. LOADED ONCE MORE was hustled early
but chased on the turn and had no late kick. MS SUEDOO was off pace and showed little while outrun. KEEP YOUR SILENCE was well back, showed
nothing and was never in contention.
