Footnotes
AVASARALA was bumped between horses in the opening strides, sent to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, opened up further when driven
in upper stretch, and held sway while kept to the task. CHARLO bumped with AVASARALA in the opening strides, tracked the early pace outside of
HOODWINK, continued to track in the three path on the turn, proved no match for AVASARALA when driven in upper stretch, but kept on willingly to prove
second best. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS chased three wide down the backstretch, edged closer in the four path on the turn, steadily drifted out while driven
down the lane, proved no match for the top two but kept on best of the rest. SPECIAL CONQUEST settled at the rear inside, was driven approaching the
turn for home, continued under a drive inside down the lane, and passed tiring horses inside. HOODWINK was keen inside early, tracked the leader early,
began to flatten inside horses while racing in the two to three path on the turn, drifted out midstretch and ultimately lacked the needed kick. LA
GUERRERITA chased inside of foes midpack early, continued to chase in the two path on the turn, swung out and did not find the necessary rally three
wide in the lane. AKA LIONESS broke out and bumped AVASARALA in the opening strides, settled in second last, continued two wide in the rear pair on
the turn, was driven between horses in the lane but never threatened. EMILY BUG chased between horses down the backstretch, chased in the five path
outside of LA GUERRERITA on the turn, continued five wide into the lane, and offered no response under a drive.

Footnotes
CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, urged to a position racing just off the first flight while caught four wide through the first turn, pressed the issue three deep after a
half, went clear on his own courage racing into the second bend, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch and came under firm encouragement to maintain
a safe advantage to the end. THIRSTY OWL, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outside to the backstretch, couldn't match the winner racing into
the far turn, continued in pursuit of that foe to late stages and proved best of the others. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE angled inwards to, press the pace between
foes racing to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders after a half to track those rivals a bit off the inside, was prompted to regain contention swinging out
to the five path in upper stretch but made no real impression. OFF TO THE BEACH was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch,
shifted out to the four path in upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. POINT OF DIRECTION settled last while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. ARTIE AND JESSIE flashed brief pace three deep between foes racing through the first turn, gave way early,
was pulled up on the far turn and vanned off the course.

Footnotes
LUCKY SHOT broke slightly inward and bumped ASTI SKY in the opening strides, prompted the early pace outside that foe, tracked three wide on the turn,
was pushed along to engage approaching the quarter pole, raced three wide with the leading flight into the lane, took the lead approaching the furlong mark,
and cleared under a mild drive while drifting out. ASTI SKY broke a step slowly, was bumped by LUCKY SHOT in the opening strides, set the pace inside
while taking some early prompting from LUCKY SHOT, cleared briefly while positioned two wide on the turn, was engaged by both LUCKY SHOT to his
outside and MASQUERADE BALL inside into the lane, lost the lead to LUCKY SHOT approaching the furlong mark, proved no match but kept on second
best. MASQUERADE BALL tracked the leading pair, saved ground through the turn, bid inside of ASTI SKY into the lane, proved no match for the winner
and was outfinished for place. RUNQUIETLY settled toward the rear early, improved to chase while saving ground around the bend, was driven inside into
the lane, shifted three wide in upper stretch, kept on willingly and missed the show. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH settled at the rear, raced in the three to four
path on the turn, raced three wide into the lane and angled further out toward midstretch, and improved mildly past tiring horses. TRIPLE CHROME chased
outside early, improved to track the leading pair outside of MASQUERADE BALL approaching the half, chased four wide on the turn, was driven into the
lane while still four wide, and flattened out. MAGIC MONDAY veered out in the opening strides, settled near the rear, improved position slightly while racing
five wide around the turn, but could not sustain a rally between horses in the lane while racing a bit greenly. EL CARDINAL hit the gate, chased between
horses early, settled back toward the rear past the five eighths, raced between horses into the bend, raced in the three path on the turn, was driven into the
lane and offered mild improvement to midpack, but emptied out. TRUIST chased between horses early, settled back toward the rear into the turn, was
relegated to the rear near the three eighths while racing in the two path, was driven into the lane and came up empty.

HUSH Y'ALL was prompted to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter near the inside racing to the backstretch, responded racing into the second
bend to challenge for command between rivals, pressed the issue outside a rival past midstretch and edged forward late under firm handling. SATIATE
sprinted to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace inside rivals to the second bend, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but
proved no match for that rival late. LADY BREXIT settled between foes racing three deep into the first turn, shifted out four wide while being prompted to
advance nearing the second bend, but couldn't match terms with the top pair in the drive. PRESENT OF HERO, reserved between foes racing to the
backstretch, switched outside rivals racing through the far turn to be fanned four wide in upper stretch but had no closing bid. RISKY RISKY RISKY was
rated in close quarters along the inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. SILVERA, caught four wide racing into the first turn,
continued in brief pursuit of the leaders three deep between to the far turn and gave out early.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE was fractious in the gate, broke sharply, pressed the pace three wide, was driven two wide in upper stretch while still outside of STELLA
MARIE, headed that foe midstretch and edged away. STELLA MARIE shook to the early lead inside of ALMAFUERTE and CONSTANCIA, set the pace
while pressed by those foes, clung to a narrow lead inside of ALMAFUERTE in upper stretch, but was headed for good midstretch and chased on second
best. HOPPESTRY chased inside early, improved into the turn, tracked the leading trio three wide, swung four wide into the lane, proved no match for
ALMAFUERTE and STELLA MARIE from upper stretch, but kept on willingly under a drive to give chase to the finish. LADY EXPRESS settled at the inside
of the rear group early, continued in the three path on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, and responded with a mild late rally. SHE'S A BIG STAR
was reluctant to load, steadied early after MY WIFE IS BOSS broke outward, chased outside of STELLA MARIE early, continued midfield four wide on the
turn, was driven five wide into the lane, drifted out further but kept on willingly. MY WIFE IS BOSS broke outward, raced between horses in the rear flight
early, continued two wide near the rear around the bend, was driven four wide into the stretch and chased on evenly. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN settled three
wide in the rear flight early, raced in the four path with the rear pair around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and ran on only evenly. JUKEBOX
MONEY tracked the leading trio inside early, chased while saving ground around the turn, took mildly closer order inside in upper stretch but emptied out
late. CONSTANCIA attended the pace between horses in the leading flight down the backstretch and through the turn, proved no match into the lane and
emptied out between horses.

Footnotes
JEFF THE LION was rated just out of striking position outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to gain
terms with the leaders four deep nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge for command in that path approaching the furlong marker, then responded to
firm handling to wrest the advantage while shifting inwards under pressure to go clear late. LAND MARK DEAL angled to the inside stalking just off the
pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, came through close quarters to bid for command along the rail nearing midstretch and
edged rivals for the place honors late while failing to match the winner. LAST PROMISE sped to the fore along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow
advantage under rating to the second bend, dueled for command between foes just off the inside racing through the stretch but yielded to the top pair late.
DUCHOSSOIS, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, moved to challenge the pacesetter in the three path leaving the midway
point of the far turn, continued to dispute the issue in that path between rivals to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. BATTLE CREEK settled last
near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside rivals nearing the far turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and gained some position while
making no real impact. JUSTENUFFTUFF, reserved outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, never gained striking distance.
COCKALORUM settled between foes racing to the first turn, angled inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but had no rally.

MISTER KELLY took early pressure while setting the pace inside, inched clear into the turn, edged further away past the three eighths, went to a drive near
the three sixteenths and remained clear while kept to the task. RIDE RICHIE RIDE bumped with TODDLES in the opening strides, tracked the leading trio
down the back straight, tracked the leading pair while saving ground on the turn, proved no match for MISTER KELLY in upper stretch when put to a drive,
but chased on well enough to hold the place. TOM'S LAST GENERAL chased outside BABA'S BOY early, improves approaching the half mile mark to
chase outside of OUTRIDER, continued just behind the tracking flight in the three path on the turn, shifted out six wide near the three sixteenths, rallied
under a drive and narrowly missed the place. TOWN AGENDA settled near the rear, was patient in the three to four path on the turn, was driven two wide in
the lane, and responded with good interest through horses. LT. JUNIOR GRADE pressed the pace between horses early, tracked the leading pair two wide
on the turn, was driven three wide between horses in upper stretch, proved no match for MISTER KELLY and RIDE RICHIE RIDE, and flattened out. WISE
KHOZAN settled toward the rear, raced in the five path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and improved belatedly. BABA'S BOY chased inside of
TOM'S LAST GENERAL early, settled back toward the rear approaching the half mile mark, chased in the three to four path on the turn, was driven six wide
between horses in the lane but came up empty. COCO BRAVADO broke out and bumped TODDLES in the opening strides, nonetheless came away
sharply, was outsprinted to the lead by MISTER KELLY and LT. JUNIOR GRADE, tracked three wide, settled back off the lading flight into the turn, tracked
the leading pair four wide around the bend, was driven four to five wide in the lane and flattened. TODDLES bumped with RIDE RICHIE RIDE in the opening
strides and was them bumped by COCO BRAVADO, raced toward the rear down the backstretch and in the six path on the turn, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
FIELD LETTERS, off a bit slowly, was taken in hand avoiding close quarters in the opening stages while switching outside rivals, was prompted to advance
nearing the turn, rallied four wide through the bend to gain contention in upper stretch, then continued with a sustained response to wrest the advantage and
go clear late under firm encouragement. MAYSTART, came through tight quarters at the start to track off the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to
the turn, was prompted to advance in that path nearing the lane, angled to the rail in upper stretch to bid for command inside the pacesetter in tandem with
the eventual winner but was outkicked while his rider appeared to lose his whip in late stages. GHAALEB'S APPEAL tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in
second flight in early stages, tipped out midway through the turn to race three deep into the lane and continued evenly between foes to prevail for a share.
AROSE FOR LYLA broke inwards brushing a rival, was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance three deep
between foes when caught in close quarters nearing upper stretch, then was fanned five wide avoiding traffic but lacked the needed late response. WILLOW
MOON sped clear of the field soon after the break while angling inside, dictated the pace under rating racing into the turn, held sway under pressure into
upper stretch but gave out between foes in late stages. TOTALLY DOVISH angled inwards to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to
the turn but faded early. FOX FREY settled between foes dropping off the second flight and offered no rally. PALAGO, off a step slowly, was held up along
the inside in early stages when avoiding some traffic and failed to menace thereafter. COWGIRL KIMMIE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight
in the opening stages but retreated early.

improve but was ultimately outkicked four wide. RULE FOLLOWER was awkward into stride, settled near the rear between horses early, began to improve
when driven in the six path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and offered mild belated improvement. FINAL CALL broke out and bumped JUST
BEN in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, was urged in the five path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, turned six wide into
the lane, and passed tiring horses. FLORIDA FLASH chased inside of JUST BEN down the back straight, was pushed along in the three path on the turn,
improved slightly while chasing inside in upper stretch, but flattened out late. LAST SPRING pressed the early pace outside of TWIRLING ROSES and
SILVER DASH, tracked them in the four path on the turn, proved no match to that pair into the lane and weakened. JUST BEN was sandwiched between
horses in the opening strides, chased outside of FLORIDA FLASH early, kept on between horses in the four path around the far turn, came three wide into
the lane, and weakened. STRATUS STORM settled near the rear outside foes early, was relegated to second last into the turn, was driven in the two path
around the bend and two wide in upper stretch, but never threatened. COPPER CROSSING settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, took slightly
closer order in upper stretch, but could not sustain a rally.
