UNCLE IRISH raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the backside, chased two wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed
outside, dueled with COURVOISIER in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed at the wire. COURVOISIER raced four wide early, then stalked two wide,
pressed the pace, bid entering the far turn, dueled, gained a short lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely when challenged by UNCLE IRISH and battled on
determinedly to the finish. MUGSY MALONE set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BOLD MEDICATION tracked early
on along the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn and failed to rally. ECONOMIZER was reluctant loading, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
MISS CENTRAL steadied at the start, stalked two wide, made a four wide run on the turn, charged to the front, kicked clear and held on late. JACRODRA'S
DEVIL stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, dug in along the inside, angled out at the sixteenth marker and came again late.
OUTWORKABLE vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, stayed on well and dug in late to hold third. HIGH DOLLAR DATE raced two wide off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, finished evenly and just missed for the show spot. ICY REPLY was reluctant to load, raced off the pace inside, moved up
entering the stretch and steadied at the eighth pole to avoid an injured rival. ANAHIYA'S DREAM vied two wide for the early lead, chased on the turn and
tired. ONE PAIR OF HANDS chased inside, gave way, was eased up in the stretch and walked off. SHE'S LUCKYINLOVE was off slowly, trailed the field,
moved up outside rivals entering the stretch, then was injured at the furlong marker and pulled up, vanned off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run,
the race was declared official.
