Footnotes
IVY LEAGUE pressed the pace from outside, challenged around the far turn, dueled and took over at the eighth pole, put away inside rival then met the rally
from FEATHERS and held that rival at bay. FEATHERS (IRE) stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, stalked the pace from inside, angled out and came
three to four wide into the lane, rallied from outside but could not get by. GET ON THE BUS stumbled a bit at the start, angled to the inside quickly, moved
to the two path on the clubhouse turn, came back to the inside in the middle stages, angled four wide leaving the second bend and rallied for the show.
CIDER APPLE (GB) got bothered a bit at the start, bumped with inner rival soon after, unhurried settling at the back, saved ground on both turns, steered
out in the stretch but needed to find more in deep stretch. KARTVELIAN (IRE) settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the first turn, came back to
the two path and remained there through the second bend, churned on down the lane but never threatened. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) set the pace from inside
under pressure, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining and weakened late. FOR THE GOOD TIMES broke
out, bumped with rival soon after, stalked the top pair off the inside, raced off the rail into the stretch and weakened. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) came away
slow then got bumped and had her path taken, pulled first time through the stretch, dropped back around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
NIGHTLIFE jumped the track crossing surfaces early, reserved in the early going, angled three to four wide into the stretch, rallied five wide and got up late.
SAVVY GAL broke well, jumped the track crossing surfaces early which caused her some momentum, remained forwardly placed, challenged around the
turn, took over in deep stretch but got outkicked by the winner. INVINCIBELLA (GB) raced in range up the backstretch, angled in to save ground on the turn,
moved out a bit and lacked room behind a pair of rivals in upper to midstretch, found a seem late and finished well between to gain third. VELLA attended
the pace three deep, chased three wide into the lane, kept to task through the final furlong and finished willingly four deep and between late. SWIRLING
bobbled at the start, recovered and went up to take control from inside, dueled on the turn and into the stretch, held a narrow advantage entering the furlong
grounds, fought to deep stretch and yielded late. A DIME FOR ME off slow to begin, settled on the inside, exited the bend two wide and failed to menace.
MAGICAL GRAY broke well from outside, was forwardly placed four deep, chased four to five wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ESTABLISHED away quickly to begin, had speed between rivals then took back to stalk and switch to the outside, chased three to four wide into the stretch,
drew alongside with a furlong remaining, took over soon after and drew clear at the sixteenth pole. KNEEDEEPINSNOW dueled for command from outside,
battled two to three wide into the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole, then stayed on to hold the place. I GOT NO
MUNNY tossed his head and hopped at the start, recovered to get in range of the leaders, chased four to five wide into the lane and evened out in deep
stretch. FORE LEFT dueled for command from inside into and around the turn and into the stretch, fought to the eight pole then lost contact in midstretch
and weakened. SURFING STAR sat off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn and was never a factor. WICKED TRICK off a bit slow to begin,
chased on the inside then a bit off the rail into the drive and could not rally.

Footnotes
NEW HEAT off slow to begin, unhurried at the back early on, forced out by rival entering the stretch, rallied from outside and surged late to overhaul the
runner-up. KLEEN KARMA bothered from inside at the start, moved to the two path to track the pace, angled three wide leaving the far turn, rallied outside
the top pair in midstretch, led into the final sixteenth and got run down near the wire. ZYDECO MAMA broke outward, sat off the pace in the two path, came
four wide into the lane, rallied but was not enough. CEDAR'S STARS (GB) tracked along the inside, lacked room in upper stretch, found an opening and
rallied between runners with a sixteenth remaining and missed the show. FEARLESS GIRL (IRE) stumbled a bit at the start, tracked off the rail then moved
inside for the clubhouse turn, tipped three wide nearing the top of the stretch, waited for room in upper stretch, moved to a clear path and put in a mild late
bid. ROSE'S CRYSTAL settled inside near the back, angled out leaving the far turn, lacked room behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch, altered to a clear
path and kept on. UNICORN sped clear from inside, challenged from outside with a quarter of a mile remaining, held command to midstretch, lost the lead
with a sixteenth to go and weakened late. ULTIMATE HY broke out, was a bit rank first time through the stretch, traveled in range off the inside, bid
alongside at the quarter pole, challenged into deep stretch and weakened late. MERCY MERCY stalked in the two path, got shuffled entering the stretch
and weakened.

SO VERY SMART cleared quickly to take control, drew away around the turn, then widened in the drive and was ridden out to the wire. ROSES R BLUE
bobbled leaving the gate, ran up on heels, checked and bumped rival past the seven-sixteenths, saved ground through the turn, could not make any
headway on the winner in the stretch but was clearly second best. SUPERSONIC FLYER chased outside a pair of rivals, took the turn three wide and
lacked a serious bid. DUAL REALITY off slow from inside, traveled along the rail then moved to the two path by inner rival, exited the bend a bit off the rail,
moved out in the stretch and improved position. NAN ELIZABETH traveled along the inside into the turn, angled out around the bend then altered around
rival past the quarter pole and could not rally. TIZ MY PRINCESS sat off the pace, dropped back on the turn, came out at the top of the lane and made no
impact. PLATONIC forwardly placed between rivals, got bumped by inner rival past the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted out and checked off the heels
SUPERSONIC FLYER past the quarter pole and weakened. SHEILA'S CHARLIE broke out, traveled in mid-pack early, chased near the back four wide into
the lane, angled out in upper stretch and tired.

WARREN'S SHOWTIME tracked the leader two wide then three wide into the stretch, split foes with a furlong remaining, closed fast outside the top pair in
the final sixteenth and drove past nearing the wire. SEDAMAR stalked the pace from outside, headed rival at the half-mile marker, dueled leaving the turn
and held a short lead into the stretch, battled down the lane and was overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. ANNA FANTASTIC established the
front quickly, set the pace early on and moved to the inside for the turn, headed by rival at the half-mile pole, lost command but continued duel from inside,
fought back through the final furlong and stayed on for a game third. BELLA VITA off alertly to begin then was rated off the inside, took the turn three wide
then came four wide into the drive and failed to produce a bid. CASSIE BELLE stalked the pacesetter from inside through the turn, urged right-handed in
upper stretch then switched to the left-hand with a furlong to go and failed to responsd. PULPIT RIDER off a bit slow and got shuffled back at the start,
traveled five wide around the turn and could not summon the needed rally.

lacked room on the far turn, got bumped from outside in upper stretch, split foes with a furlong to go, rallied and overhauled the runner-up despite a trouble
trip. PRECIOUS INSIGHT stalked the pacesetter early, drew alongside at the nine-sixteenths pole then lost contact again, challenged nearing the
five-sixteenths pole on the far turn, dueled and led into the stretch, put away rival with a furlong remaining but was run down by the winner. CANDY ON TOP
tracked the pace in the two path through both turns and finished willingly for the show. ROUBAIX sped clear from outside and crossed over, pressured at
the nine-sixteenths pole then moved clear again, challenged again by same rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled leaving the turn, lost contact nearing the
eight pole and flattened out in deep stretch. INFINITE LOVE steadied and pulled early, chased from between runners in the middle stages, lacked room in
traffic entering the far turn, came four wide into the lane and kept on through the final furlong. SURELY SPECTACULAR fractious in the gate, broke outward
in the beginning, tracked outside a rival then three wide into the lane, shifted in and bumped rival in upper stretch and could not rally. WARREN'S
