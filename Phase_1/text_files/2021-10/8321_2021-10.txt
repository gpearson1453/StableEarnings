Footnotes
CYBERVIKING advanced around the turn outside, got floated out to the five-path challenging outside SARAWAT at the top of the stretch, gained the upper
hand after straightening away and drove clear staying on his left lead. SARAWAT vied early inside rivals, took back and rebid between horses midway on
the turn briefly edging clear, drifted out to the four-path carrying CYBERVIKING along for the ride at the top of the lane, could not withstand that rival through
midstretch and ran on clearly second best. GOLDEN SURVIVOR saved ground outrun for a half-mile, stayed inside for the drive and rallied mildly to go
clear of the remainder. VOICE OF NOW vied early outside rivals, cleared off before going a quarter-mile, showed the way early on the turn in the two-path,
then succumbed to challenges and retreated after a half. MORICHE was outsprinted to the stretch, and made no progress on his left lead. REGIO bumped
with DAVID'S CUPID at the start, saved ground to the turn, and faded approaching the stretch. DAVID'S CUPID bumped with REGIO at the start, briefly
contested the pace between horses, and was through early.

Footnotes
TREVESS raced off the pace three wide between foes, angled further out in upper stretch, closed steadily outside, was up with about seventy yards to go
and edged ahead under a drive. LOVELORN LADY trailed outside early, circled four wide around the turn, took over near the quarter pole, cleared off in
upper stretch, led past the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner late. THE GREAT KATH saved ground in range, could not match strides with the
top two in the lane but stayed on to gain the show. LADIES' CHOICE steadied early, chased the pace two wide between foes, steadied again near the
quarter pole, shifted out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and improved position. ROMANTIC TALE vied three wide down the backstretch,
asserted command and angled in early on the turn, set the pace inside to upper stretch and tired. SILVER TUNES led between foes early, checked entering
the turn and retreated inside. BABY MO had early speed two wide, stopped and was eased through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
VIOLENT ZAP grabbed a short early lead inside CHASING HAPPINESS, fended off challenges from that rival throughout the running, drifted out in the
stretch and prevailed after a hard drive. CHASING HAPPINESS pressed the pace outside VIOLENT ZAP from the outset, and was turned back through a
stretch-long battle while drifting out. LULI'S DANCER could not keep pace with the leaders after a half-mile, and ran on clearly best of the others.
PRETTYKEEN was between horses giving futile chase to the leaders early on the turn, and dropped far back into the stretch. CINDY'S SONG broke slowly
and steadied just after the start, and tired three to four wide after a half.

Footnotes
MORNING COLORS set the pace in the two and three paths while perched in hand outside of two loose horses around the turn, shifted further out in upper
stretch and held sway under a drive. QUEEN CALYPSO saved ground in range, angled widest in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and narrowed the
gap. CAPTURE THE GENIE chased the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. GREGS POSSE steadied early, saved ground and never
threatened. GREEN GAL had brief speed two wide. PRETTY PRINCESS stumbled and lost the rider at the start, galloped along ahead of the field in a
riderless duel inside of KAY'S PROJECT that extended past the wire and walked off. KAY'S PROJECT went to her nose and lost the rider at the start,
galloped outside of PRETY PRINCESS ahead of the field to a head bobbing finish and walked off.

Footnotes
RAISE THE RENT moved off the inside early in pursuit of MISH, challenged for command outside that rival coming off the turn, reached the front just past
the furlong marker and drove clear. MISH popped clear after the break, showed the way near the inside to the stretch, could not cope with the winner
leaving the eighth-pole and ran on much best of the rest. CATCH ON EMOTIONAL lunged at the break and was slowest away, raced four wide through the
turn, was outpaced by the top two into the lane and ran on evenly. TAP GOLD was under a drive on the turn, and could not keep up after a half-mile. JUMP
BACK JACK faded steadily inside after a quarter-mile.

LADY JAE tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. CHARGE IT JENN
raced off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, turned for home just outside of the winner, could not keep pace in upper stretch
but stayed on willingly and was gaining late. I'M A COCO PEBBLES tracked the pace two wide and finished evenly to gain the show. SHADILEE had early
speed inside, settled back down the backstretch, went two wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain. LA CARA BONITA had early speed two
wide between foes, angled in early on the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and churned on inside in the lane. SIMONELA advanced four wide
to the lead around the first turn, vied outside down the backstretch, cleared and angled in entering the far turn, led to upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MISTER LUIGI broke alertly despite losing his footing, pressed RESERVENOTATTAINED from outside, drifted wide into the lane battling for command,
gained the upper hand into the final furlong and edged clear. RESERVENOTATTAINED set the pace near the inside for a half-mile, drifted out steadily just
inside MISTER LUIGI through the stretch, and yielded. BLESSED JOURNEY saved ground outsprinted early, stayed inside rallying mildly into the stretch,
but needed more. FRONT LOADED was a step slow to begin, shifted out four wide advancing after a half, but made no late progress winding up out past
the middle of the track. SPEARGUN faded after a half. DEMOCRACY broke slowly, raced wide and never reached contention. BREEZE ON BY broke
awkwardly, raced three wide and was through early.

Footnotes
POCO CHARLIE settled off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead between foes in upper stretch, brushed
BUFFALO MAX near the eighth pole, edged ahead leaving that marker and drove clear. BUFFALO MAX saved ground well off the pace, angled four wide
midway around the far turn, moved to contention in upper stretch, reached near even terms in midstretch, was lightly brushed by the winner near the eighth
pole, could not quite match strides with that foe from there then steadied in deep stretch to widen the gap. EASY STRIDE saved ground off the pace, went
two wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. VINTNER stalked the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CALL
BROS settled off the early pace two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, reached the front near the quarter pole, vied inside past the eighth pole then
weakened. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE raced two wide in midpack, advanced two wide around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. MISTA DONZELLA
lacked speed inside, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. BEINFUN pressed the pace three wide around the first turn, dueled two wide
down the backstretch and around much of the far turn then faltered. TREASURE RUN vied inside and retreated after six furlongs. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF BUFFALO MAX AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
