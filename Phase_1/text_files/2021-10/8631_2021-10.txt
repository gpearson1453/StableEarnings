Footnotes
NOBLE JOURNEY was hustled from the start, moved up under urging to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, shook clear along the rail
on the turn, extended the advantage late on that bend, came under a right-handed crop turning into upper stretch, drew off under the crop to the furlong
marker then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the best. REUNION TOUR settled off the pace then tucked in behind horses, was
roused in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. ARROWHEART
chased the pace down the backstretch, pursued the winner in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but held the show.
WICKED KARMA broke out at the start, showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, chased the winner past the
three-eighths, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and tired while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch. OUT OF THE BREECH settled off the
pace, moved closer outside the five-eighths, chased inside on the turn and came up empty. BLESS BLESS settled in the back half of the field under some
urging, was ridden along in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. SHIMMERING LIGHT moved out while
settling near the back, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ARTIE'S LIT was reluctant to load, bumped solidly with a rival after the start,
was urged along well back on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. FREUDIAN ANALYST was forwardly placed on the
outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and retreated. CROSSING VERAZANNO bumped solidly with an
opponent after the start, was urged along near the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
SHIPSATIONAL established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing late threat and held well to prevail, repelling the challenger to the finish.
OVERSTEP chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the three path nearing the
eighth pole, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire. WHO HOO THATS ME chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. STERLING HILL six to seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the five path briefly before heading three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. EXCURSIONNISTE three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed,
tucked to the two path through the turn and got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
SUNDAESWITHSANDY coaxed from the gate, came under a hard hold along the inside early on before being given some rein, tipped to the two path
through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

the place. JULIANA'S ROSE broke a step slow, settled off the pace, steadied behind horses late on the backstretch, moved closer while three wide for most

while willingly able to get the show. SINFULLY SWEET broke a step slow, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, gained six wide into the stretch

start then urged along towards the front, dropped back along the rail on the turn and failed to rally. STARSHIP ROGUE was off slow and spotted the front a
few lengths, raced at the rear, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn and was no factor. LIVE IN FIVE bumped with a rival at the start,
moved up on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MADAME

backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, lost the lead inside the three-sixteenths and tired. DAKOTA DANCER dropped
back off the pace under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. ARDUOUSLY bumped with a foe at the start then was

MISS JIMMY was carried in by the winner early then urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, chased three wide into the stretch
and proved no match for the winner while narrowly able to get the place. ESPRESSO SHOT chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the
turn and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while well clear for the show. HANNAH DANCES was hustled from the star then
urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and
came up empty. FIGHT ON LUCY was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, turned into the stretch under

AMERICANREVOLUTION four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, took over command nearing the
quarter pole and swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, went clear under a drive and was under a light hand drive through the
final sixteenth to the finish. WILD BANKER traded a bump at the start with MR. BUFF, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. SEA FOAM
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. DANNY CALIFORNIA three paths off the inside down the backstretch,
went five wide through the far turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major
share. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
tired. TIERGAN chased five to six wide throughout coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and made no impact. THREE JOKERS chased two to
three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and
was eased through the final furlong to the finish. MR. BUFF traded a bump at the start with WILD BANKER, came under coaxing and raced three wide in
closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, retreated through the latter portion of the turn and continued
three wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.
