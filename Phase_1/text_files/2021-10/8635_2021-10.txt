Footnotes
WAR ROGUE broke out, steadied, raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn, made a rail bid and proved the best late. READY
REDDING went to the front, came in quickly, saved ground around the final turn and was outfinished late for the win. MUSICAL MAN vied for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. TIN DELAY broke out, racing in the rear, came
around the final turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. PRE HEAT steadied early, getting in tight quarters, pressed the pace, raced outside
around the second turn and weakened. CH BERN void of early speed and was never close. TOUCH OF GOLD brushed at the start, raced near the back
and showed little. THE TRAINER OF #8 READY REDDING LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #5 WAR ROGUE FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE
LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CREATIVE LETTERS dueled for the early advantage, took command around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. PERFECT PERIGEE broke out,
raced within striking distance, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. ROCK CITY ROCKET showed early speed, forwardly
placed throughout and got caught for second. SING LOUD raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and was outfinished for third. LOUISIANA
THUNDER shuffled back at the start, racing in the rear, made a wide gain and finished willingly. LEYTON'S HIPPIE raced in the middle of the pack, eased
back, moved up late, but was no factor. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY broke in, raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. BOBBY
BOOTS lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was outrun. GRAND PRADO dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and
dropped back. COHERE broke out, raced near the middle of the field and retreated.
