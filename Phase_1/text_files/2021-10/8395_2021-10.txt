MY BEST FRIEND dueled two wide for the lead, continued to duel with CINDY'S PRAYER on the turn, led into the stretch, responded when roused nearing
the furlong marker and then pulled away. LUANN settled off the dueling leaders, chased on the turn, rallied in the stretch run and was along for the place
spot. CINDY'S PRAYER bobbled at the break, dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in along the rail and held on at the wire for
a share of third. STAY OUT settled two wide off the pace, chased two wide on the turn, raced evenly in the lane and earned a share of the show award.
OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. UNCLE MO'S AFFAIR was a bit reluctant to load,
then was off a bit slow and outrun.

late. SAAFEN was outrun early, moved up entering the stretch, angled out and closed belatedly. KIDYOUNOT raced off the pace, chased between rivals on
the turn and had no rally. HAIL SOUTHERN raced off the pace, went three wide on the turn and gave way.
