DONTCROSSFUZZY hustled up out of the gate and gained a clear advantage soon after the start, remained clear near the inside around the turn, roused
for more turning for home, responded willingly, quickly widened to a commanding lead under a strong hand ride then wrapped up late. PLAYBOY ROY
raced outside a duo in pursuit of the early pacesetter, was ridden along going by the half mile marker, sustained steady response around the turn, came out
five wide into the lane, stayed on through the lane and gained second best. NOTION TO TAPIT raced in tracking mode off the pacesetter in the opening
quarter, headed in pursuit mid-way around the turn, roused four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. I'M NOT SLOW was off slow at the start and
lagged in the back, gained a bit of ground three wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. CELTIC SUN tracked the early
pacesetter then chased near the inside around the turn, came out two two three wide entering the head of the lane and steadily faded.

roused for more past the quarter pole, responded under a right handed drive, fended off challengers past the furlong marker, switched to left hand urging in
the final sixteenth and held clear. JOANIE'S SUNSET was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried through early stages, picked up the pace
entering the far turn, came out five wide entering the stretch run, tipped out wider under right handed pressure, pursued the winner through the lane and
produced a solid finish. MAUREENLOVESFRANK steadied nearing the first turn then rated off the pacesetter, launched a bid near the five-sixteenths pole,
roused five wide into the lane, stayed on with response and secured show. ADMONISH tucked inside around the first turn then raced near the rear through
the backstretch, hustled up out of the far turn, came five wide then angled in under right handed pressure and lacked a needed rally. PRINECESS DOIR
tracked the early pace, launched an inside bid near the three eighths pole, remained a presence to mid-stretch then faded. MISS MORENO was forwardly
placed just off the leader then retreated around the far turn. CAIRO QUEEN steadied nearing the first turn, raced in range through early stages the came up

Footnotes
MOQUIST raced along the rail and applied pace pressure to DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA, edged up and matched strides with rival leaving the backstretch,
dueled around the turn then shook free turning for home, had more left in reserve, responded under pressure and kicked clear. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA
broke on top and set a pressured pace over rail running MOQUIST, dueled outside of rival around the turn, could not maintain equal footing turning for home
but stayed on with response and cleared second best. LOOKIN DYNAMIC raced in the back although not too far back, launched an inside bid heading into
the turn, came out three wide into the lane and just lasted for show. NEEDS SUPERVISION raced up close four wide near the half mile marker, lost ground
on the top pair around the turn, swung widest into the lane, stayed on under pressure and just missed show. BLUEFIELD raced three wide in striking
distance in the opening quarter, could not maintain close range around the turn, came out four wide into the lane and had no late response.

Footnotes
AWARD NOMINATED was forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter in early stages then edged up to apply pressure to rival near the half mile marker,
briefly matched strides then cleared on top near the three-eighths pole, widened advantage still unasked then roused for more late on the far turn, came
three wide into the lane and drew off under steady urging. MOHAAFETH rated off the clear top pair through early stages then edged closer late on the
backstretch, launched a bid midway around the far turn, swung five to six wide into the lane and lasted for place. FLYING WITH ANGELS was well reserved
racing in the back, saved ground around the far turn, sustained a rail bid through the lane and just missed place. ALGONQUIN led the way around the first
turn and set the pace, came under pressure from the winner late on the backstretch, could not move on with rival entering the far turn and steadily faded.
THE HONORABLE ONE raced five wide entering the first turn, was reserved through the backstretch and had no response when called upon.
CALLYOURIGHTBACK steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SICK PACK SARA sped to the lead and held a length advantage heading into the turn, roused for more going by the quarter pole, responded gamely,
turned back the bid from LIKELY CHOICE and kept clear. LIKELY CHOICE was away in good order and angled closer to the inside, remained forwardly
placed in pursuit of SICK PACK SARA around the turn, sustained steady response near the inside through the lane and held place. AWFULLY FOXY was
ridden along off the early pace then roused four wide into the lane, responded under a drive and closed with response. PARTY AT PAGE'S was hustled
along out of the gate, chased around the turn then went three wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and narrowly missed show. DEVILISH AFFAIR was
urged along off the early pace, was ridden along four to five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ALWAYS SOMETHING chased up close around
the turn then weakened turning for home. VOLNAY raced two wide around the turn then shifted out wide for the drive and failed to move on. OIL ON
CANVAS raced along the inside and retreated around the turn.

SAN ANTONE tracked the top two leaders into the turn then came under a ride at the five-sixteenths pole, was ridden along the outside into the lane,
remained game in pursuit and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. ZORB sped to the lead at the start, continued on top into the turn then came under attack
from WHERE R U near the five sixteenths pole, continued to dictate terms by a narrow advantage into the stretch run then lost the whip near mid-stretch,
stayed on with response then failed to hold off the winner in the final sixteenth. WHERE U B raced up close just off the leader, then edged up two wide to
challenge for the lead mid-way around the turn, continued with aim on ZORB past the furlong marker then yielded in late stages. BOURBON AND ICE raced
near the inside into the turn, swung five wide into the lane, came in a few paths under right handed pressure and needed more for late impact. NATTY
BEAU was forwardly placed just off the top pair then flattened out mid-way around the turn. NOBLE ENDEAVOR steadied at the start, was ridden along four
wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
HUNTER JOE raced off the early pace then hustled up late on the turn, swung wide into the lane, responded under right handed pressure, rallied along the
outside while steadily drifting in and finished going away. EXTRA MEDIUM chased along the inside around the turn, sustained a steady inside bid through
the lane and finished second best. MONTAUK DADDY sped to the lead at the start, continued on top into the stretch run, dug in under firm handling then
had no closing response left in reserve. ALL THREES raced two wide in pursuit around the turn, stayed on four wide into the lane, remained in contention
but lacked the needed surge for serious impact. GHOST GAME raced off the early pace, roused five wide into the lane, tipped out wider in the final furlong
and finished with response. ABUELO PAPS hustled along in steady pursuit, fanned five wide into the lane, sustained a bid in range a furlong out then
steadied mid-stretch when the winner drifted in. FEDERALE chased up close around the turn, stayed on in the upper stretch then gave way. RAD PAISLEY
was taken up sharply at the start and lacked a needed rally. SUBJECT TO CHANGE got bumped at the start and failed to gain close contention. DIALING
DIXIE was taken up sharply at the start and never menaced. THE RIDER OF ABUELO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HUNTER JOE FOR INTERFERENCE
NEAR MID-STRETCH, THE RIDER OF RED PAISLEY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST FEDERALE AT THE START, AFTER STEWARDS REVIEW BOTH
CLAIMS WERE DENIED

Footnotes
SNEAKINESS was forwardly placed and steadied slightly near the nine-sixteenths pole, vied for the lead outside of ROCK AND FELLERS around the turn
then took on the challenge from REVOLUTIONARY ROAD at the head of the lane, battled on with rival past the furlong marker, dug in gamely and edged
away. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD pressed the pace along the rail then edged back into tracking position, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, vied for
the lead through the lane then failed to be a late match for the winner and settled for second best. KINGSTON PIKE saved ground and hustled up entering
the turn, came out four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. BIG RINNE trailed through early stages, raced wide and passed tiring rivals.
VICTORY ELEMENT chased in range around the turn then gave way. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) hopped at the start, held a slim lead in early stages and
vied around the turn then faded in the lane. ALPHA QUEUE raced three to four wide off the pace and failed to move into contention.
