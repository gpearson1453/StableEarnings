Footnotes
MR. PRODUCTION shot to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, but was no match for the winner. AW SHUCKS raced near the back in the early part, came around the turn on the outside, made a late
bid and got up for the show. WONDER RUN pressed the pace, saved ground and lacked a finish. FUELINJECTEDPRAYER was an early factor, weakened
and was no threat late. FREE INDEED void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was never close. CHEERS TO BERTI always raced near the
back and showed little.

ISOLATION unhurried in the early part, moved up between rivals around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and finished well. KELLYS THE BOSS
void of early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second, while finishing wide. LUCKY LITTLE LADY vied for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a late kick. RIVETRIX raced near the middle of the field, came
around the first turn on the outside, made a mild bid and finished evenly. BIRDCATMOUSE lacked early speed, had an outside trip, improved position, but
was no factor. LUCKY PRIORITY dueled on the front end in the beginning and faded. ENDURING PEACE was an early factor, took the lead entering the
final stretch, ducked in, hit rail and dropped back. DAIGLE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back. TIME FOR A
SONG lacked early speed and was never close. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING
REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

others. KASENS TRAIN lacked early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. CIROC O CLOCK raced near the
back in the beginning, showed late interest, but was no factor. R AND R STAR vied for the early advantage and faded. MULTIDIMENSIONAL raced within
striking distance, dropped back, finished wide and was no threat late. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY raced in the middle of the field and weakened.

Footnotes
TAPSION stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane and proved the best late. SANGRIA
CITY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of
others. I'M ALL SHOOK UP pressed the pace, had an outside trip, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two late. MAMA SAID NO lacked
early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a late gain, but was no factor. CLARA BELLE raced in the middle of the field, came around the final
turn wide and put forth an even effort. TAYLORS BABE challenged for the early advantage and faded. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS void of early speed and
showed little. ANNA CLAUSE always raced near the back and was outrun. SUMMER TSUNAMI raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn
on the outside and dropped back.
