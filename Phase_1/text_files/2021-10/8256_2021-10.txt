Footnotes
AYRTON SENNA stalked the early pace, mounted a bid from three deep on the turn to challenge IOWA HAWKEYE entering the stretch, was challenged by
that foe but wore him down in the end to prevail. IOWA HAWKEYE was away alertly and set the pace, met the bid of the winner off of the turn but was worn
down in the final sixteenth while clear of the rest. AWESOME CURLIN had no early speed, was three wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the
stretch to claim the show. SLOOP JOHN B tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch run. LOVE THAT KID was
bumped at the start by a neighboring rival, checked in tight quarters on the run into the turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. WELL CRAFTED
was away a bit slowly and had no early speed, saved ground while two wide on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. STANWOOD WARRIOR
bumped LOVE THAT KID at the break, chased the early pace from a three wide position, was losing ground on the turn when stopped, was eased, and
walked off.

K P SILVER BULLET stalked the early pace, mounted a bid from four wide on the turn to vie for the lead heading into the lane, battled with TIZ VICIOUS but
edged clear in the end from that rival to prevail. TIZ VICIOUS was hustled to set the early pace, jumped a shadow leaving the seven-sixteenths marker,
saved ground on the turn, met the bid of K P SILVER BULLET off of the turn but could not hold him off in the late going while besting the rest. TALISKER
BAY sat just off of the early pace while saving ground, improved position along the rail in the stretch but was outkicked by the top two while just getting up to
win the nod for third. AUSPICIOUS STYLE pressed the early pace from a three wide position and was outfinished in the stretch run. SUGAR BEETS had no
early speed, saved ground on the turn and did not rally in the stretch run. ELEGANT LAD was away slowly and spotted the field five lengths at the start,
chased the field from the rear and was not a factor.

MY FRIEND TONY dueled with RICKEY B for pace duties, shook off that foe leaving the turn but was confronted in the final stages and determinedly dug in
to prevail. SEQUENTIALLY sat just off of the early quick pace, gained ground leaving the turn and was closing fast in the final sixteenth but was nipped on
the finish for the win while getting the nod for second. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was unhurried in the early going, saved ground while still at the rear on the
turn, angled out to the five path in the stretch to mount a bold rally but just missed. RICKEY B dueled on the front end with MY FRIEND TONY through the
turn, gave ground to that foe leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. CAPE POINT settled near the rear of the field and did not have a late kick in

LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF sat just off of the early pace while in the second flight, saved ground on the turn, steadied in tight quarters leaving the turn and
surged in the final sixteenth to prevail. ROYAL 'N RANDO tracked the early pace from the midflight, gained ground while four wide on the turn to take the
lead entering the stretch but was outfinished by the winner in the final stages while holding for second. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was away alertly and set the
pace from a ground saving position, was confronted by the runner-up off of the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. JESSEBEAR was bumped at the
start and had no speed in the early going, gained ground leaving the turn and finished willingly in the stretch. COWBOY CHARLIE tracked the early leaders
while three wide and gave way in the stretch. NIGHT MISCHIEF chased from the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.
FANTASTIC DREAM contested the early pace with NUESTRO ENGREIDO, saved ground on the turn and faded in the stretch drive.
