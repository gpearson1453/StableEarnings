and held that rival safe to the wire. LIZETTA was reserved just off the winner from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole but could not
reach the winner in the drive. HOT AND SASSY was away in good order then raced off the pacesetters, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly. PET GOLD chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SLIGHTLY lagged throughout.

BETHEL RIDGE broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and held sway to the wire.
ASEAAWINNER was bumped at the start then reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner
late but finished with good energy. JAN'S BEST chased the winner from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. I'M TO BLAME was bumped at
the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. BLUEGRASS RUN raced off the leaders from the
inside and lacked the needed rally. ZEELULA was bumped at the start, lagged early, angled out approaching the stretch and did not menace. PEARL
HASTHE MUSIC was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
STARBOARD LIST sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his margin through the
second turn and was ridden out to be kept to task. WORKING lacked early speed, advanced three-wide through the second turn, was no match for the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. SONIC BOY chased the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
PAMPERS N' BOOTS showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and weakened. DOHENY BEACH was void of early speed, saved
ground through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EL ALTO HOMBRE was bumped at the break, dueled for the lead from the inside with FOREIGN PROTOCOL, disposed of that rival before going a half,
opened a clear lead and held by a diminishing margin. FANTASTIC DAY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out late and
just missed. FOREIGN PROTOCOL broke sharply to duel with the winner, stayed on well in the drive but failed to gain on that rival late. SUNRISE
JOURNEY drifted out through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive.
STRIKE IT LUCKY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. PISTOL POWER lacked early foot,
steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid thereafter. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY drifted out through the first turn, lagged early, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. CODY'S CHOICE was bumped at the start, disputed the pace while racing three-wide for
the opening quarter, weakened soon after and was eased.

STREET MOXIE was away in good order to stalk the pace of OFFICER OF WAR while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with complete authority. OFFICER OF WAR broke sharply to set a pressured pace while saving
ground and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. ATTERCOP was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive.
WILD WILD KINGDOM was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. ARDENLEE STAR was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PEQUENO MONTE lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn
and did not menace. FORT LEWIS RIVERS broke in a tangle, raced four-wide through the first turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
DIECI was away in good order to duel for the early lead with FAR WEST, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and was up in the final yards. FAR
WEST broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied through a vigorous drive and could not hold that rival safe late. MY MAN
DRAYMOND was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the third turn and finished evenly late. SMOKE AND BURN was never far back, raced
three-wide through the third turn and failed to rally.
