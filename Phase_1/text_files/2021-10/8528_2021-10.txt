Footnotes
LADY MAGICA prompted the pace outside R TRUE SENSATION, over took that one in upper stretch and drew out under brisk urging. R TRUE
SENSATION sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail throughout, lost the lead in upper stretch and gamely held the place. DAT DARES GOLD stalked
the pace around the turn, was three wide entering the stretch, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. PARCHED GHOST lacked speed,
swung to the four path at the head of the lane and gained late outside rivals. FAMILY FORTUNE raced along the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the
two path in mid stretch and lacked the needed response. PETION LASS stumbled a couple of strides after the break, raced along the inner rail around the
turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KING BUBBLE (IRE) , patiently handled in range and off the inside, took closer order leaving the far turn, bid to engage the leader past the five sixteenths,
secured command in upper stretch, responded to firmer asking and kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths, was kept alert with left handed encouragement
and held firm. MOKHEEF rated in the two wide, edged up between rivals near the half mile marker, shifted out advancing into the lane and gave game
chase to the wire. TOE CURLIN' KISS angled out early then settled outside a rival, move up leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and closed
steadily. POSTERITY broke slowly, regrouped and settled inside, eased out and moved up between rivals nearing the lane, steadied in close near the three
sixteenths, recovered and offered a late run between foes. ARGENTIC (FR) , three wide in range early, bid two wide and prompted the issue outside the
leader with six furlongs remaining, sparred briefly past the five eighths then shook clear with three furlongs remaining, met an outside challenge by the
winner heading to the stretch, stayed on past the three sixteenths then faded. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was
joined around the second turn, sparred into the far turn, gave hard chase after being headed, continued with some interest to the three sixteenths then
faded. KING OF SPADES saved ground while not far back early on, came under pressure into the far turn, failed to kick on and faded. CHATEAU DE
VIZILLE lost ground four wide, made a run nearing the half mile marker, gave hard chase leaving the five sixteenths then weakened in the drive.
MINISTER'S STRIKE broke a bit slowly after having his head turned as the gates sprung, was a bit tough to settle between rivals early on, angled out and
raced three wide past the wire the first time, failed to go on under asking into the far turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
MISS CHESAPEAKE showed speed between horses, was rated back inside the five eighths pole, circled the turn three wide, swept to command in upper
stretch and drew off while kept to her business. CANOODLE , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, bid inside the winner in upper stretch and
continued gamely. STARTWITHABANG lacked speed, was two wide on the far turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied mildly. PEACE OUT ,
bumped SILVER'S GIRL and was caught in tight quarters when bumped and forced out by DOWN UNDER THUNDER leaving the starting gate, swung to
the four path turning for home and failed to sustain her bid. SILVER'S GIRL , bumped leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, angled in
leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail while setting the pace and faded approaching the eighth pole. RONA was no factor. SUNDOG , swung to the
five path in upper stretch, failed to rally. DOWN UNDER THUNDER bumped PEACE OUT when bearing out at the break and dropped back early.

Footnotes
CORAL SUMMER stumbled at the break, quickly recovered and vied inside rivals leaving the chute, eased back and stalked towards the rail, saw the leader
get away past the three eighths, came back under steady encouragement and bid along the rail near mid stretch, kicked clear under a drive with a sixteenth
to go then held sway. AREEMAA stumbled at the break and then steadied briefly, regrouped and settled well off the inside, came under pressure and
commenced a run past the three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch and closed steadily to gain. SHERIFF'S KID drafted back off the pace about two
wide, moved up under a ride into the lane, eased out past mid stretch and worked between foes, drifted in a bit in deep stretch, had her heels clipped by
FEARLESS LASSIE then kept on willingly. DIAL EMMA REILLY lagged well back early while saving ground, shifted out advancing past mid stretch and
churned on. FEARLESS IDEAS had speed to lead briefly leaving the chute, rated back off foes and stalked, chased four wide into the lane, faded then
altered out to avoid FEARLESS LASSIE in deep stretch. BUST OUT LADY came in at the break and bumped FEARLESS LASSIE, straightened and saved
ground, was under pressure leaving the far turn, faltered and wandered outward in upper stretch. FEARLESS LASSIE , bumped at the break, was sent up
between foes soon after then was a bit keen when clearing, opened up two wide around the turn, saw her lead diminish soon into the lane, was collared
from her inside with an eighth to go, faded then clipped heels and fell nearing the wire. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run. No action was
taken.

Footnotes
LITTLE MS SCARLET wide around the turn, drifted to the six path in upper stretch, took the lead outside foes near the sixteenth pole and drew out. CANDY
CORNER raced in the two path between horses leaving the turn and rallied inside rivals. GYPSY'S IMAGE , bumped by BAD TEMPER leaving the starting
gate, stalked the pace three wide around the turn, was well positioned in mid stretch and flattened out. GUAPA CHICA lacked speed, swung to the six path
in upper stretch and had a slight rally. EXPECT THE SUNRISE opened up on the turn, was well off the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. GOT A
GOOD REASON lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and finished willingly. SEE THAT GIRL hugged the inner rail around the turn while
chasing the pace, remained along the rail through the stretch and weakened. WILLOW'S CHARM raced in mid pack down the backstretch and was not a
factor. BROADWAY TROUPER , no factor, was in the four path between horses leaving the turn. TOP HAT BOSS was checked in tight quarters along the
inner rail entering the turn. VERYAN raced along the inner rail leaving the backstretch and retreated leaving the turn. BAD TEMPER bore in bumping
GYPSY'S IMAGE leaving the starting gate, was five deep leaving the turn and dropped back.

BROKER'S REWARD rated forwardly inside, eased out near the five eighths, bid two wide outside PRINCE PERE nearing the far turn, took command
heading to the quarter pole, was roused clear in upper stretch, drifted in towards the rail then held firm while kept to a drive. CALL ME PLUCKY lost ground
four wide while under rating, moved up under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, continued four wide into the stretch and finished gamely to cut into the
margin. GREAT IDEA rated in mid pack and off the inside, edged up between foes mid way on the final turn, shifted out in the drive and churned on.
PRINCE PERE vied outside the winner around the first turn, dropped in when clearing near the backstretch, set a soft pace inside, took pressure into the far
turn, ceded the lead near the quarter pole, gave chase to mid stretch then faded very late. JOHNNY SACK was steadied off heels around the first turn,
angled out and lost ground four wide, was under pressure past the three eighths, angled out in the drive and came back on some between rivals. NORDIC
RHYTHM , fidgety in the gate, hopped at the break and was off slowly, settled off the pace while saving ground, swung out and offered some late action.
MONSTER MASON stalked the pace three wide, was under pressure with pursuit into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. FULL
DINNER JACKET was steadied along when rank behind rivals early, saved ground leaving the far turn and into the lane, eased out under asking and
worked his way between rivals late. LACCO AMENO broke slowly, raced well wide throughout and failed to menace. MACY'S BOY , taken to rate, saved
ground off the pace, continued inside while in range to mid stretch then faded. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken

Footnotes
JAMES'S MOONSHINE , bumped and pinched back by DON'T DARE ME leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the
stretch, swept to command inside the eighth pole and drew off. DISPUTED NOTION raced in the two path between horses on the turn and rallied inside
rivals. DREAMING OF CARATS set a pressured pace near the inner rail around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and
weakened. ONE MORE FACTOR prompted the pace outside DREAMING OF CARATS, was herded out by that one in mid stretch and weakened. STAY IN
, four wide entering the stretch, failed to rally. DON'T DARE ME came out at the break, checked in tight quarters along the inner rail near the five eighths
pole, chased the pace around the turn and weakened. AMERICAN PIPER was no factor. FORE ON SEVEN , three wide on the turn, gave way in upper
stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
FIGLIO DEL RE (IRE) accelerated inside rivals leaving the chute and took command, set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled with
BACKNTHEWOODS from the quarter pole, lost command to that one near the eighth pole, battled back under left handed asking to reclaim the lead past
the sixteenth marker then was fully extended on his left lead to prevail. CAMINERO , jostled at the break, regrouped and settled off the contested pace while
saving ground, angled out near the quarter pole, shifted further out to be five wide straightening for the wire, closed gamely but just could not get up.
BACKNTHEWOODS disputed the pace outside the winner, drew alongside into the lane, dueled, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, fought on past the
sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly between rivals. SOUPER ROYAL MOON came out at the break and bumped CAMINERO, chased the leaders
three wide, was under a hearty ride pursuing four wide into the lane, ranged up to be on near even terms past the sixteenth marker then hung. ESPRESSO
LUNGO , off the early pace, moved up two to three wide in upper stretch, advanced between runners and kept trying to the line. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR ,
two wide past the half mile pole, angled out soon after, circled four wide under a ride into the lane but came up empty. OSKEE WOW WOW broke slowly,
dropped in and pulled a bit early on, advanced mid turn under asking, continued some progress into the lane then failed to seriously sustain. SHANGHAI
CANDY , four wide, was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOPE HAS A NAME bid inside foes in the opening sixteenth and gained a slim lead, dueled to the inside of MENDING from the five eighths to upper stretch
while being nudged along, shook clear under a stout drive in mid stretch then was kept to solid handling while widening. MEMPHIS MAFIA stalked the
dueling leaders three wide, was under pressure into the lane and kept on willingly to be along for the place. MENDING had speed three wide then dropped
in a bit past the five eighths to duel outside the winner, stayed with that one to the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong.
SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS had speed between foes, eased back leaving the five eighths, saved ground mid turn, swung out four wide for the drive but
failed to muster up a solid run. PRACTICALLY DIZZY , five wide nearing the half mile marker, circled four wide into the lane but failed to pose a threat.
VANQUISHER , off slowly after breaking inward and bumping a rival, raced between rivals while off the pace into the turn, dropped inside and lacked a bid.
THIEF OF HEARTS , bumped at the break, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled out approaching the quarter pole and faded. FANCY PRINCESS , four
wide between runners nearing the half mile pole, dropped back around the turn then came up empty.
