SOUTHEAST ASIA sat just off of the early fractions, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, met the challenge of the runner-up inside of the
final furlong and edged clear in the late going. BLAME IT ON KITTY was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position while three to four wide on
the second turn, battled with the winner inside of the furlong marker but was outkicked in the final sixteenth, while holding for second. NORTHERN QUEST
settled near the rear of the field while saving ground and made a mild late bid in the stretch to challenge for second but could not reel in the runner-up. SKY
NAVIGATOR was away well and contested the early pace with TYPHOON HARRY, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive.

OH BE ONE settled near the rear of the field in the early stages, was two wide between foes on the second turn, rallied leaving that turn to vie for the lead,
kept on in the stretch and was met at the wire by a late charging UPPER ROOM to share the win. UPPER ROOM was unhurried in the early going, chased
the leaders along the second turn while three wide and made a late kick in the stretch to meet OH BE ONE on the wire to share the win. UBER STAR was
off alertly to clear the field into the first turn, set all of the pace from a ground saving position, had a clear lead in the stretch but was outfinished by the top
two while clear of the rest. SIX POINT RACK sat just off of the early pace, vied for the lead leaving the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch drive.
EARNEST prompted the pace from a ground saving position, lost ground on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

winner and just missed for the win while besting the rest. RED DAHLIA prompted the pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch.
SAYITALL tracked the early pace from a forward position and did not mount a late bid in the stretch. BORN TO REIGN chased the early leaders, gave

ALL MY HOPE attended to the early pace from a three wide position, came to terms with LADY MOHICAN on the second turn, turned away that foe inside
of the furlong marker and edged clear in the end. SOJOURNER TRUTH sat just off of the early pace, gave a bit of ground off of the second turn but closed
well in the stretch and was second best. BRITE TAN settled off of the early leaders, mounted a bid while four wide on the second turn and was outfinished in
the stretch. LADY MOHICAN was away well and set the pace while being prompted by the winner, was confronted nearing the head of the lane and
weakened in the late going. CLOCHARD STREET was away slowly and had no early speed, saved ground along the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROWDYROOSTER had no early speed, mounted a quick move along the second turn while four then five wide to rush into contention, battled with
PERSEVERANCE through the stretch and dug in to hold sway for the win. PERSEVERANCE was away well and set all of the pace from a ground saving
position, was confronted by ROWDYROOSTER nearing the head of the lane, battled back against that foe but was bested in the final sixteenth while well
clear of the rest. EXETER stalked the early pace while forwardly placed, saved ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. LOOKIN FOR
GOLD tracked the early pace from a two wide position and faded in the stretch. REFUSE was four to five wide on the first turn, prompted the pace through
the second turn and gave out in the drive.

NORTHWEST FACTOR settled at the rear of the field while saving ground, swung out to the five path for the drive and surged in the final sixteenth to nip
TIP TOP GAL for the win. TIP TOP GAL tracked the early lead, mounted a bid while three wide on the turn, led in the final sixteenth but was nipped on the
wire while besting the rest. DRAW ME was unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the turn and closed well in the stretch to get third. WARM
SUMMER stalked the early pace from a four wide position and did not mount a late bid in the stretch. BRILLIANT BIRD was away well and set quick early
fractions from a three wide position, led leaving the turn but gave way in the stretch. DYNASTY OF HER OWN chased the early pace from a two wide
position and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HYPERSONIC pulled on the jockey in the early going and was rank on the turn, rallied leaving the turn and was up just in time to prevail. REGAL BORN
settled near the rear of the field, mounted a rally from five wide on the turn and just missed for the win while holding for second. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET
tracked the leaders from the four path, closed well in the stretch and was outkicked in the late going. CONCUR dueled for pace duties through the turn while
saving ground, led off of the turn and into the final furlong but was outfinished. FOSTER BOI tracked the pacesetters while three wide, gained ground on the
turn but weakened in the stretch run. ABERDEEN ISLAND dueled for pace duties in the early going, gave ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
AS AMATTER OF FACT sat just off of the early leaders, mounted a bid while three wide on the turn to quickly confront COUNTRY DUDE, had a clear lead
leaving the bend and pulled away in the stretch as much the best. VINNIEBOB tracked the pace from a three wide position, gained ground leaving the turn
and was not a match for the winner but bested the rest. COUNTRY DUDE was away well, set the fractions while being pressured along the turn and
weakened in the drive but did hold for the show. BID ON THE PRIZE was away very slowly and chased the field from the rear, gained ground leaving the
turn and finished willingly in the late stages. WOLF MOON WILSON tracked the early pace from a four wide position and did not have a late kick in the
drive. SIERRA SNOW STORM chased from the second flight and tired in the stretch drive. COMMON CAUSE had no early speed, saved ground on the turn
and was not a factor. ATLANTIC FROG chased from the second flight from the four path and was not a threat. MALIBU GHOST pressed the pace through
the turn and gave out in the stretch run.
