Footnotes
CORAGESCONTENDER chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs
from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to take command in the very last jumps to the finish.
U. S. STEEL coaxed from the gate, vied from the two path with a pair to his outside briefly before establishing sole command tucking inside through the turn,
got set down cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and was caught in the final
strides to the wire. ZANNO coaxed from the start, vied five paths off the inside with a pair to his inside, tucked three wide through the turn in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick. Following a repair to his left front shoe in the
paddock, QIAN B C chased three wide getting let out continuing three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. SO SUAVE (IRE)
crossed to the inside just after the start and chased along the rail down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing
midway, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BIG WONDER coaxed from the gate, vied loosely between foes from the
three path briefly before chasing three then two wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

Footnotes
STERLING HILL stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage just inside the
three-eighths pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, shook off the challenge of KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF into the final sixteenth and
prevailed under strong urging. COZZY'S ATTITUDE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, gained late on
that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF showed speed then dropped just off the
pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, gained to make a bid inside of the winner in upper stretch, battled with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole
then was outfinished and just lost the place while ale to get the show. WICKED BOBBY jostled with a rival early then was taken up and wrestled back,
remained towards the rear under some restraint, was let out four wide on the turn then asked for more outside the quarter-pole, turned five into upper stretch
while put to the crop and improved position. RESILIENT COURAGE bumped with a rival at the start then jostled with an opponent early, showed speed then
dropped just off the pace, lost position with five furlongs to run while replaced in the pocket by KINGDOM ON PAWS, went three wide early on the turn,
passed the three-eighths under some restraint, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
KINGDOM ON PAWS settled off the pace, moved up into the pocket with five furlongs to run, dropped back along the rail on the turn, shifted three wide
nearing the quarter-pole and had nothing left. MONTEGO BAY CIRCLE ducked in leaving the chute, was urged along at the rear of the field, raced inside
early on the turn then moved to the two path, passed the three-eighths under the crop and was no factor. DROSEL DIEM showed good speed, set the pace
under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the three-eighths then headed by the winner and faded.

Footnotes
SUPPLY AND DEMAND got bumped at the start by COPA due to pressure from JAKE ROCKS who veered inwards and in turn bumped HIM SHE KISSES
into ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE, chased briefly four wide before tucking three then two wide down the backstretch, chased just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command just
inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE bumped at the start by HIME SHE KISSES due to pressure
begun by JAKE ROCKS, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn before heading back to the two path midway, spun just off
the inside for home, edged away drifting out under left hand rein work, continued outwards about five paths and was collared just inside the sixteenth pole,
then ran on well clear for the place honors. JAKE ROCKS broke through the gate beating the gate at the start and veered in forcing MR. BRIGGS to be
taken hold of and bumping COPA solidly into SUPPLY AND DEMAND and in turn commencing a chain of bumps through to ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and improved
position to secure the show honors. MR. BRIGGS got steadied at the start when JAKE ROCKS veered directly in front, chased five to six paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. HIM SHE KISSES bumped at the
start by SUPPLY AND DEMAND due to pressure from the veering in JAKE ROCKS, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking to the
inside through the turn, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. COPA got bumped solidly at the start by JAKE ROCKS veering in
and in turn bumped SUPPLY AND DEMAND into HIM SHE KISSES and in turn that rival into ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE, chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, spun just off the inside for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the
start focusing on JAKE ROCKS. After review, it was determined that JAKE ROCKS had broken through the stall door beating the gate and therefore JACK
ROCKS was disqualified and placed last prior to the result being declared official.

Footnotes
FIST FULL OF DICE was taken in hand while five wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside under some restraint, tucked into the two path on
the far turn, raced in hand while in some traffic near the five-sixteenths, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed fast to
make a bid between horses at the three-sixteenths, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. OUT OF SIGHT
stalked the pace while inside of a foe, was asked in the three path on the final turn, gained four wide into the stretch under the crop then made an outside
bid, fought outside of the winner in the final furlong and missed while able to get the place. DUCKPHAT angled to the rail on the opening turn, settled at the
back, went three wide on the far turn, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with good courage for the
show. LADY THORNHILL went to the front, showed the way while in hand, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then came
under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead around the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. TINGLING MINT dropped back
while briefly in tight between foes in the three path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, traveled around the final turn in the two path, shifted four wide
into the stretch, altered out from behind horses while still on her inside lead in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. TAPPLE CIDER
settled while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn and failed to respond. VIVAZANO stalked the pace on the outside in the four to five path, was
asked on the far turn, dropped back five wide into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
DOM'S FEISTY GIRL bumped hard with a foe shortly after the start, recovered quickly and went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, drew
off along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, shortened
stride into the final sixteenth but maintained a safe advantage under a strong drive. CAPTIVATING CARA was forwardly placed on the outside, went three
wide under urging on the turn, gained on the winner in the stretch and finished willingly to safely secure the place. KNOW IT ALL RED settled off the pace,
bumped with a rival while four wide leaving the backstretch then dropped to the three path, turned into the stretch under a drive and gained some while best
of the rest. REELEY PSYCHED broke a bit slow, moved up into the middle of the field on the inside, saved ground on the turn, drifted out near the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response. ESCAPOLOGY broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace, bumped with foes on both sides leaving the
backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. EXACT CHANGE bumped hard with the winner just after the start, tracked the winner
down the backstretch, pursued that foe in the two path on the turn and tired. MYRA FLEENER was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace,
went four then five wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond. OB LA DI was urged along on the outside, went five then six wide
on the turn and also failed to respond. TASSI raced at the rear of the field, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail
on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS FAWZIA was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole then was asked near the
three-sixteenths, moved out shortly thereafter, rallied in the final furlong and closed well to get up late. EVVIE JETS tracked the pace comfortably down the
backstretch then in the two path on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, gained three wide into the stretch then took the lead at the
three-sixteenths, swapped back to her inside lead when put to a right-handed crop while inching clear approaching the eighth-pole, remained on her inside
lead in the final furlong, led gamely to the final strides but was denied but held the place. MESSIDOR (IRE) was bumped hard on both sides at the start then
pinched back, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole. GOLDEN PLUME broke out and bumped hard with a foe then
was taken up, was reserved near the back, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into upper stretch, altered out from behind foes around the
three-sixteenths and improved position. CONTAINED was rated on the outside, came under urging while three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. MISS DELICIOUS went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two
path, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. WINDFALL PROFIT broke in and bumped hard with a foe,
was reserved on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.
