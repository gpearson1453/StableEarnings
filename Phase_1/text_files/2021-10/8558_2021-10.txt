Footnotes
SALINO went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on an easy lead, controlled the action along the rail on the far turn, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, turned back the challenge of the runner-up while switched to a
left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held sway. WICKED HAPPY was taken under a vigorous hold early, stalked the pace on the outside under
tight restraint, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, battled outside of the winner to
the wire and finished with good courage but couldn't get by while clear for the place. EXOTIC CAT settled at the rear, was roused while inside early on the
far turn, moved to the two path near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, angled out sharply inside the three-sixteenths and improved
position to get the show. GAILHORSEWIND broke through the front of the gate after her two neighbors to the outside did the same thing but remained in the
stall, came outward at the start while slow into stride, was taken under a tight hold then reserved on the outside, went three then four wide on the final turn,
was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LITTLE NUTTER broke through the front of the gate inspiring two others to follow but
remained in the stall, was taken under a strong hold early then reserved off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, was asked four wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. SYNONYMOUS was hustled from the start, checked on the first turn then was rank under restraint, raced towards the back under
reserve, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. NEVER CONTENT (IRE) broke through the front of the gate just after the rival to her outside,
was brought back around and reloaded, came under tight restraint early then was rated off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole and came up empty. BALLOT INITIATIVE was hustled from the start then taken in hand, raced on the outside while rated off the
pace, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide on the far turn and capitulated. MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED PENDING REVIEW

Footnotes
STORM ADVISORY chased three then two wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, advanced through the turn and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch seizing the front straightened away, got a tap to the right shoulder and was given some rein and very briefly urged with three-sixteenths to go and
drew clear being placed back in hand while widening away comfortably to prevail. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ forwardly placed just off the inside down the
backstretch, advanced to take over the front at the nine-sixteenths, got out three wide despite correction and a firm left grip at the seven-sixteenths, came
under challenge with five-sixteenths to go and was placed to coaxing at that station, got out floating five wide into upper stretch and was displaced from the
front, dug in under a drive no match for the winner while keeping on to preserve the place honors on the wire. WINNING DRIVE three wide in pursuit down
the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, kept on to miss for
the place honors while well clear of the rest for the show. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. TALE OF MIST five then four wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. FLOWERS FOR LISA hustled from the gate, showed the way six then five paths
off the inside before tucking four wide when headed for command nine-sixteenths from home, went three wide through the turn coaxed along from three
furlongs out, angled six wide at the head of the stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
SY DOG dropped well off the pace, moved closer on the turn, bumped with BAJ while rallying four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead
outside the furlong marker, kicked clear under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride in the final sixteenth while
much the best. BAJ was urged along on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, drafted two then three wide on the turn, was roused nearing the
five-sixteenths then bumped by SY DOG while five wide into the stretch and was along for the place. DR BROWNES MIRACLE was forced in at the start,
settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was guided around the turn on the inside under a tight left-handed grip, lacked room off heels in
upper stretch, altered out at the furlong marker and got up for the show. ANSEL was well placed behind the leading duo, rounded the turn in the two path,
was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened.
AMERICAN DAY was urged along off the pace, went four to five wide early on the turn, dropped to the three path late on that bend and failed to threaten.
JUST JEREMY broke in at the start, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, lost the lead in upper
stretch and tired. PROTONIC POWER was last to commence, dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.
FATHER WALSH contested the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. EXCEPTIONAL was coaxed
along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered. FOLLOWING A TRAINERS INQUIRY BY THE TRAINER OF BAJ AGAINST THE
WINNER AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

MILES D four then three wide in pursuit from the tail of the compact field, got coaxed along with seven-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch,
rallied in tandem with ADARE to overthrown the leader inside the sixteenth marker, then knocked heads to the finish and got the nod on the wire. ADARE
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying in concert with MILES D to
his outside to displace the leader inside the sixteenth pole, dueled to the finish fighting on willingly and lost the bob at the end. CHOWDA forwardly placed
from the start, advanced to take over command seven furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths under challenge from AUBURN HILLS to the outside, took the inside route into upper stretch, repelled that rival edging clear under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught just inside the sixteenth pole while well clear of the rest for the show honors. AUBURN HILLS led early
on before conceding the front with seven-eighths to go to the aforementioned foe, settled tracking that rival from the two path, advanced to issue a challenge
three furlongs from home coming under coaxing at that juncture, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive getting repelled by CHOWDA straightened
away, then weakened to the finish. ASHAAR four wide in pursuit down the backstretch and through the far turn, got coaxed along from the three-eighths,
cornered three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ADVISE AND CONSENT veered out at the start then was corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the
far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, gained a short advantage inside the furlong marker, came in a bit under a right-handed crop around the
sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed. NORTH CAROLINA broke fast and went straight to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner inside the furlong marker, fought gamely
to the wire and just missed but earned the place. CONQUER THE WORLD drifted in while hustled from the start, settled on the inside, came under urging
with a half-mile to run, chased along the rail on the far turn, moved off the rail under a drive around the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show.
ARUBA broke out and bumped very hard with a rival then was taken up, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into
the stretch, drifted in some near the furlong marker and improved position. PARTNER'S HOPE was bumped very hard at the start, became keen under stout
restraint early, was reserved under a very tight hold, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused nearing the quarter-pole and lacked the needed
response. PLEASE THE PHAROAH was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ROCK
SUGAR broke out and bumped hard with a foe, was rated off the pace, went three wide on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty.
PRAYER BOOK broke a bit slow then had his path taken, settled on the far outside, went five wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. NINTH OF APRIL bumped extremely hard with foes on both sides at the start then checked, became very rank under restraint while
remaining out wide through the initial bend, continued rank early on the backstretch, settled more kindly midway down the backstretch, was asked near the
seven-sixteenths, went four wide under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
MISS PEPPINA pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the runner-up outside the quarter-pole, pursued that foe
in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and got up late to prevail. BUSTINMYGROOVE was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
moved up then slipped through a rail opening inside the three-eighths to take the lead, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, bore out badly in the stretch
and was caught late while able to get the place. EAST WING broke a bit awkwardly, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, drifted out
inside the furlong marker and gained but missed the place while well clear for the show. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL bumped solidly with a rival at the start,
settled at the back, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted further out in the drive and failed to
threaten. MISS ALEX settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CHEROKEE
SONG bumped solidly with a foe at the start and was off a step slow, raced at the rear under urging, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and
was no factor. DAZZLING SPEED was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside
the five-sixteenths and faded.

GIGGLE FACTORY attended the leader well rated in the two path, remained on hold until set down spinning just off the inside for home taking over
command, edged away under a drive kept to task to the finish. EXOTIC WEST a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, raced four then three wide in aim of
the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and ran on willingly to chase the winner home along safe for the place
honors. GAMBLING CAT broke in at the start bumping LINNY KATE, tracked the front just off the inside hard held in mid pack, got let out spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch and ran on to just get up for the show honors in the last jump. LIDO KEY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. COMMAND POINT three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid a furlong from home, then weakened in the late
stages. LINNY KATE got bumped at the start by the inwards breaking GAMBLING CAT, tracked the front along the inside under a rating hold, got let out
taking the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path and gained clearance near the eighth pole as OCEAN AIR bowed out inside, then weakened
in the late going. EVIDENCE BASED saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. GREY CHARLOTTE three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped four wide for home

SHAMROCKET settled towards the rear of field while two to three wide, was roused on the final turn, gained to make a bid into the stretch, dueled outside of
the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. BEACON HILL showed speed on the opening straightaway, went around the first turn in
the three to four path, prompted a fast pace on the outside, took a narrow lead in the two path on the final turn, was asked turning into the stretch, came out
some around the three-sixteenths, dueled gamely with the winner in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY
dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, gained to make a bid into
the stretch, battled outside of the top two under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. TIDE OF THE SEA was coaxed
from the gate, showed the way on the inside through quick fractions, lost the lead under urging on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. MO
GOTCHA showed early speed on the outside then backed off the pace, went around the first turn in the two path, settled in third position, saved ground
under urging on the far turn and failed to respond then faltered.

Footnotes
FLIPPING FUN five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to cut into the once clear leader's margin and went on by in the final
jumps to the finish to prevail. SWINTON hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits widening away from the rest
through the turn, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, continued to draw off to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone late threat and
was caught in the final strides to the wire while clear for the place honors. KISSES FOR VAL seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four
wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
show honors. YAH HUH coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. DISTRACTANDATTACK chased five wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot. REMEMBERMOM coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALITE in the gate without aid of an assistant starter, turned his head to right side
as the latch was sprung and got away slowly conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, crossed to the inside and gave chase coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SUIT OF ARMOR bumped at the start by KADEN, who broke
inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. I GEN chased just
off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. PRINCE OF JOY chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response.
KADEN broke in at the start bumping SUIT OF ARMOR, chased four wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and tired.
