OUR SWEET PEA , bumped by BROADWAY MELODY soon after the break, raced in mid pack and weakened. POTION was no factor. BROADWAY
MELODY bumped OUR SWEET PEA when bumped and forced out by SLIP SLIDING AWAY leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the

Footnotes
AEQUOR tracked a contested pace while off the inside, was under a hustling ride from the three eighths, shifted out four wide advancing in upper stretch,
kept on determinedly under strong handling and wore down SEVIER to be up in the final yards. SEVIER sped to command then was joined and headed
from his inside leaving the five eighths, disputed the issue outside REVOLUTIONARY ROAD into and around the turn while under some coaxing, went clear
under firmer asking past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted but just failed to hold in a valiant effort. ROUGH SEA lacked speed under a ride and
off the inside, came four wide for the drive, eased further out while advancing past the sixteenth pole and churned on. GETOFFMYBACK , off the pace and
under asking leaving the far turn, raced four wide in upper stretch, moved up some leaving the eighth pole then flattened out. CAPE LOOKOUT saved
ground chasing the embattled leaders, eased out making some progress into the lane, altered back in for room past the three sixteenths but failed to
seriously kick on. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD was sent up to the inside of SEVIER and poked a head in front leaving the five eighths, handled outside
pressure to the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
PLAMEN prompted the pace outside TITAN'S WILL, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, got into a duel soon after, gained a slim lead in
upper stretch, battled head to head from there and dug in tenaciously while fully extended. TITAN'S WILL leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival,
corrected and dropped in to advance to the lead into the first turn, was shadowed by the winner through the backstretch run, was put to asking when taking
pressure past the three eighths, battled gamely through the final quarter mile and missed in a sharp effort. BIG VENEZUELA stumbled at the break,
recovered and rated off the pace, pulled his way forward between foes past the five eighths, angled in and took closer order into the far turn, had aim off the
duelers leaving the five sixteenths, angled three to four wide into the lane, chased and kept on willingly to slowly bridge the gap. ERAWAN , bumped at the
break, dropped further back leaving the five eighths, saved ground into the lane and had a mild comeback. BRUTUS , bumped both sides at the break,
regrouped and edged up to a forward spot, moved closer three wide into the far turn then lodged a mild bid, chased rivals into the stretch then came up
empty in the final furlong. SASSY KING failed to menace. MISTER WINSTON bobbled slightly at the break then was rank and checked off heels nearing the
first turn, was taken wide for the backstretch run, moved up into the far turn, chased past the five sixteenths, tired and was eased late. TRIPLE
AMERICANO was rated back while saving ground into the first turn, saved ground early, drifted wide nearing the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES settled off the pace and in the clear while three wide, came under a ride past the three eighths, shifted four wide advancing into the
lane, closed steadily under a drive, took over with about forty yards to go and drew clear at the wire. THE KING CHEEK took over early and set a rated pace
towards the rail, took pressure leaving the three eighths, shook clear under a drive soon into the lane, kept on past the sixteenth pole, was taken on soon
after and gave way grudgingly. ROOKIE SALSA stalked the pace three wide, bid three deep leaving the far turn, forced the issue into the lane, gave hard
chase past the eighth pole but came up empty late. ROYAL THUNDER edged up early and stalked towards the rail, was under asking with aim into the lane
but went evenly through the final furlong. SILENT MALICE broke a step slow, moved up two wide early on, raced in range leaving the far turn, failed to kick
on under asking past the five sixteenths and faded. MONEY RIDE tracked THE KING CHEEK, went after that one while under urging leaving the far turn,
forced the issue between foes leaving the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. POINT DRIVEN lacked speed, raced wide for the
drive but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE showed speed then eased back off the leader and stalked between rivals past the half mile marker, dropped in around the turn, bid along the
rail to take over soon past the eighth pole then drew clear under a drive. ZORB sped up between foes and took command after a furlong, set a rated pace
towards the inside, was off the rail and under pressure in upper stretch, was hooked from the inside nearing the eighth pole, failed to match strides but kept
on willingly to the wire. DECORATED stalked two to three wide, was hard ridden past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing the eighth pole and faded.
TAPPIN FOR GLORY , off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane and failed to menace. FRANKEE MERCH saved ground and came up empty.
WARM SUNNY BREEZE stumbled at the break, raced three deep pursuing past the half mile marker and gave way.
