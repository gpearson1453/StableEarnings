Footnotes
ST. LOUIE ARCH well rated while saving ground rallied clear on the far turn drawing off in upper stretch pouring it on while ridden out. HONOR THE TAB
slow early gave a mild rallied to upper stretch out dueling rivals late for place. CIRCLEOFCOLOR raced evenly saving ground to upper stretch being in close
at the rail hanging late. ABUELA CORI advanced on the backside then chased on the far turn, extending down the lane would hang late. UNUSUALGIFT
set a pressured pace ceding on the far turn weakening under a drive. EGALITE stalked the pace weakening on the far turn fading down the lane.
RODSSILVEROAK played no factor. AUTORITA was never involved. CAUSELUCK was always outrun. SHOE BIZ pressed the early pace giving way on
the far turn.
