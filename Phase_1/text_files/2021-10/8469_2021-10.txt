Footnotes
LUCKY ROMANO bumped both sides at the start, tracked clear leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, attempted to go
outside of HOSS CARTWRIGHT, but rival drifted out and LUCKY ROMANO had to go five wide to get around rival heading into the stretch, responded
strong to urging in the lane and drove clear. PROJECT LEADER broke in, bumped rival at the start, chased clear leader along the inside, continued along
the inside on the turn, bid two wide inside of drifting out rival in the stretch and outclosed in deep stretch to be second best. HOSS CARTWRIGHT came out
two paths at the start, showed good speed to clear on the backstretch, drifted out late in the turn to enter stretch in the four path, faltered late in the stretch
and managed to save show. CONEJOS stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the three path and
made a belated rally to almost get up for third. HACK bumped around at the start, tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the
inside on the turn, launched a bold bid entering the stretch along the inside, and flattened in the final sixteenth. SHARP WARNING settled well off the pace
and well off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn four wide and entered the stretch in the seven path, and failed to threaten in the lane. DEBT MONGER
tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. CANNES stayed along the inside throughout
and failed to threaten.

FLASH N CORONA drifted in steadily, best. FAVORITE HABIT drifted in steadily, 2nd best. CELL BOUNCE broke in, solid effort. SINGLE ME avoided
trouble, evenly. ANOTHER EXCELLER broke out, bumped hard start. NOT THAT WILD ducked in, bothered foes. FAST THRU FIRE lost all chance start.
ZZZUUUM ZOOM came in, bumped around start. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START, AFTER REVIEW IT WAS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE DUE TO MAIN CAUSE OF TROUBLE CAME IN LAST
