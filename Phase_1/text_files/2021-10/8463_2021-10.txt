DREAM PEARL stalked the early going, made a steady advance around the far turn and finished well to forge clear late under a strong hand ride. DJUDJU
SEQ dropped to the back of the pack early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the be second best. AURA MAKARINA showed
good early speed set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SKEEDADDLE pressed the leader from the inside and weakened through the
drive. MAKARIOS RC dropped back early, raced five wide near the quarter pole and never was a factor. CODY MAN AA settled off the early pace, raced
three to four wide through the upper lane and failed to respond. THE HALF MILE TIME WAS 58.89.

ROWDY OH raced up close early on, took command through the far turn and held a clear margin under a strong hand ride. SAL MAGLIE settled off the
early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. FLASHIN PASSION stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced towards
the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had final response. ALARMING MOMENT settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had no late rally. BIG EVO was reluctant to load, broke very awkward, veered in soon after the break, raced erratic early and never
threatened. FROST WARNING was quick to begin to set the early pace, was pulled up and had to be vanned off.

EUSTACE raced up close early, took command into the far turn, raced well off the inside through the lane and drew off to be clear under steady handling.
TWIRLING DERBY stalked the early going, raced three to four wide and was no match for the winner. LASTBESTHOPE was slow early, moved up six to
seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. TIME TO ZOOM settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn and had no late
response. PERSISTENCE was hustled along early to set the early pace and tired readily.

QUEEN CARMELITA was sent along to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. LAKER JET pressed the leader from
the inside and could not cut into the margin in the stretch run to finish second best. AROUSE N GO was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide near the
quarter pole and showed good late interest. TICK TOCK stalked the top pair early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning
bid. MERGIE TROID settled off the early pace, raced five wide around the far turn and had no late response. WELL DONE SALLY dropped back early,
raced towards the inside and never was a factor. EVER VIGILANT was hustled early, raced seven wide into the upper stretch, angled in and never was a
serious threat.

Footnotes
ZESTFUL pressed Sash down the backstretch, took command nearing the far turn, raced three to four wide in the lane and held well in a determined effort
under strong handling. HONOS MAN was slow in the early stages, made a steady advance nearing the far turn, raced six deep near the three sixteenths
pole and closed in gamely in the final stages to finished willingly to the wire. TESORO was unhurried in the early stages, moved up five wide near the
quarter pole and had not enough in the drive for the top pair. PEACEFUL TRANSFER stalked the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch,
took aim near the eighth pole and flattened out. SASH (GB) showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened in the drive. PAINT ME LUCKY
settled towards the back of the pack early, angled seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. UNION DANCE stalked the early pace, was
asked nearing the far turn, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late response. HARMON was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack,
raced four wide at the seven eighths pole, raced six deep into the upper lane and had no rally.
