Footnotes
DREAM ISLAND, caught in close quarters while held up between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, lost some position to TEQUILA
REVOLUTION racing into the backstretch, switched outside that foe on the backstretch to gain striking distance nearing the second bend, shifted out three
wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, drifted out entering upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to edge forward
under energetic handling. AULENTI tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing into the first turn, was shuffled a bit losing some position behind TEQUILA
REVOLUTION racing into the backstretch, tipped out nearing the second bend to steadily gain position between foes, was urged to challenge between foes
just inside the winner nearing midstretch but proved only second best. TEST PILOT gained terms with a rival attending the pace racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue into the far turn to strike the front but proved no match for the winner in the closing stages. STONEVICIOUS, urged to the lead along the
inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside rivals into the far turn and gave way into the lane. TEQUILA REVOLUTION exchanged bumps in
early stages, tracked the leaders three deep between foes into the first turn while pulling against restraint, shifted inwards to the rail crossing rival's paths
racing into the backstretch, continued a bit erratically in close quarters inside foes to the second bend and soon faded. ANGEL'S MAGIC exchanged bumps
in the opening stages, was caught four wide into the first turn tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, continued three deep between foes to the
second bend and gave way early. IOWA CLASS, bumped from both sides, then shuffled back in early stages, switched outside foes to race four wide on the
backstretch but never gained contention.

Footnotes
EASTER MUSIC chased the leading trio inside, advanced along the rail around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, headed MAGI at the top of the
stretch, and continued to edge further clear while kept to the task. RIPE ATTACK raced at the inside of the rear group early, advanced to chase outside of
EASTER MUSIC approaching the turn, took closer order two wide between horses around the turn, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for
EASTER MUSIC from midstretch but kept on doggedly to wrest the place. MAGI was sent for speed, led in the two path on the turn while carrying a
diminishing advantage, raced two wide into the lane, was headed by EASTER MUSIC inside him at the top of the stretch, kept on between horses but was
outfinished for place. POWER CRY tracked the pace three wide early, continued in range four wide around the bend, raced five wide to the stretch, proved
no match for the leaders in upper stretch and chased on evenly late. RENEGADE BOB came in and bumped VIRGA in the opening strides, raced between
horses in the rear flight early, continued at the inside of the rear flight into the turn, raced in the three path at the rear around the bend, angled out five wide
in upper stretch, and offered a mild belated gain. VIRGA was pinballed between RENEGADE BOB and INSTANT WAR in the opening strides, settled three
and then two deep in the rear flight, continued in the four path in the rear pair around the turn, swung out and was driven six wide in the lane, and lacked the
needed rally. INSTANT WAR came out and bumped VIRGA in the opening strides, tracked outside of MAGI early, prompted the pace three wide on the
turn, was driven four wide into the lane and emptied out.

Footnotes
STORMINSIDE was urged from the break to gain a forward placing while tipping outside the pacesetter on the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the
leader racing into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch and steadily extended the advantage under firm encouragement. MIAS MOONBEAM, off a step
slowly, settled inside foes in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out late while making steady late progress to edge rivals for the place
honors. TRY TRY AGAIN settled between foes in the last flight early, dropped out last racing into the turn, displayed some late interest while shifting out four
wide racing past the sixteenth marker and prevailed for a share. PITAMAN ducked out at the start, sped clear along the inside dictating the pace into the
turn, proved no match for the winner and faded in late stages. WILL KNOWS tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight, made brief progress in
tandem with a rival to advance four wide into the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. SHWEET PERSUASION, off a bit slowly, never gained contention.
DEVIL'S RULE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was prompted to make a brief, three wide bid between foes entering the turn but quickly
emptied in the drive.

Footnotes
AND WON settled near the rear, was unhurried through the first turn and down the backstretch while detached from most of the field, began to improve in
the four path on the far turn, swung five wide under a drive into the lane, rallied as he angled slightly inward, took the lead approaching the furlong pole, and
took over while kept to the task. MEMORY BANK soon trailed, raced patiently through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order inside
around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, was carried out further by DOLLAR BLUE in upper stretch, continued to improve nonetheless and got up
in time for place. PACKED HOUSE tracked the leader two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, took closer order in the three path
on the far turn, engaged MINNESOTA LUCKY past the three eighths, vied outside that foe from the five sixteenths to upper stretch, could not hold off AND
WON in upper stretch, chased on willingly but was caught late for place. TAP THE MOJO chased at the rear of the main group through the first turn,
continued between horses at the rear of the main group down the backstretch, was urged between horses on the far turn and rallied mildly, came three wide
between horses into the lane, and kept on mildly between horses. DOLLAR BLUE raced two wide at the rear of the main group around the first turn,
continued three wide in the chasing flight down the backstretch and around the far turn, raced four wide into the lane, drifted out further in upper stretch, and
was ultimately outkicked. MINNESOTA LUCKY came away last but advanced outside foes to take the lead into the clubhouse turn, set the pace down the
backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, was engaged by PACKED HOUSE past the three eighths, vied inside that foe from the five sixteenths to the
three sixteenths, proved no match for AND WON from there and emptied out inside. CROCE D'ORO tracked the leader inside of PACKED HOUSE, began
to flatten in the two path past the seven sixteenths, and continued to weaken in the lane. REMEMBER THE MAINE chased inside foes, stopped near the
seven sixteenths, and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
BIRDMAN RICHIE bobbled at the start shifting inwards brushing LIFE IS GRAND, was righted to track just outside the leaders within striking distance racing
into the turn, steadily advanced three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge, was fanned four wide leaving midstretch but continued with a steady
response to wrest the advantage under firm handling. DARE GOES DA DEVIL was rated between foes in early stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch to bid for command along the rail nearing midstretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors while
failing to match the winner. ROCKET MAN ATTACK broke readily, sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage just off the
rail to upper stretch but weakened between rivals late. MEATABALL, off slowly, was settled in the last flight, angled to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground
to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. HERO DRAGON tracked off the leaders six wide racing to the turn, then shifted back to
that path in upper stretch while continuing evenly to late stages. LIFE IS GRAND, carried inwards by the eventual winner at the start, was righted, then
urged between foes to gain a position prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn but faded nearing midstretch. AFTERMATH broke inwards bumping
LAYTON THE DAY, dropped back early and proved no threat. CHEEKERS came through close quarters in the opening stages to make brief pursuit of the
leader between foes into the turn but faded after a half. JACKS SPRING BREAK ducked inwards at the start, then was held up in early stages and failed to
menace thereafter. LAYTON THE DAY, bumped at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
SERENE was anxious in the gate next to a fractious horse, chased outside of SENSE OF SELF through the clubhouse turn, chased between horses down
the backstretch, took closer order between approaching the half mile mark, bid outside of TABLE ONE past the seven sixteenths, raced in between horses
in the leading flight from there, took the lead inside of SMACK near the quarter, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch but nonetheless held command
down the lane. WHITE LIES was fractious in the gate, chased the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair three wide down the
backstretch, was urged four wide into the far turn in range, continued four wide around the bend just off the leading trio, raced four wide into the lane, and
chased on second best under a drive. SMACK stalked outside of TABLE ONE through the first turn and down the back straight, improved three wide into the
far turn as the front ranks closed, took the lead three wide near the three eighths, was headed by SERENE to her inside near the quarter, proved no match
and drifted out midstretch but nonetheless held the show. SENSE OF SELF broke outward, chased inside of SERENE through the clubhouse turn, inched
forward to track the leading pair past the three quarters, continued to track inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, began to lose position near the
seven sixteenths as others rallied outside of her, was driven in the three path past then, swung five wide into the lane, chased on but missed the show.
RAPID TRANSIT raced two wide at the rear of the main group through the first turn, chased at the rear of a compact main group down the backstretch, was
pushed along in the four path around the far turn and driven six wide into the lane, but lacked the needed rally. READY AT MIDNIGHT lightly bumped with
ZANDREA'S in the opening strides, settled at the rear of the main group, was pushed along in the two to three path on the far turn while still at the rear of
the main group, was driven three wide in upper stretch and offered no bid. TABLE ONE set the pace inside, was headed near the three eighths, and
weakened. ZANDREA'S steadied when pinched back between horses in the opening strides, was taken to the rear, trailed the whole way around, and was
not persevered with late.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT broke sharply but settled back to track the leading pair, inched closer in the three to four path past the three eighths, bid in earnest three
wide into the lane, drove to the lead near the three sixteenths, cleared off, and held safe while drifting out and kept to the task. HURRICANE HIGHWAY took
back in the opening strides after BULL HOLLOW broke inward, settled near the rear, began to edge forward past the three eighths in the four path, swung
six wide into the lane, and rallied outside horses with good interest under a drive. BULL HOLLOW broke outward, was sent to the lead, set the pace inside
while pressured by OIL MONEY, was headed by that foe near the three eighths, tracked the pace from there, shifted two wide in upper stretch, proved no
match for the top two late but kept on with enough interest under a drive to hold the show. HIDE THE DEMON tracked the leading pair inside of W W
HOTSHOT down the back straight, tracked in the two path on the turn, swung out and was driven four wide into the lane, and kept on mildly between
horses. OIL MONEY prompted the pace outside of BULL HOLLOW, encroached two wide past the seven sixteenths, led at the three eighths, took a short
lead into the lane, was headed by W W HOTSHOT near the three sixteenths, proved no match and weakened. FIREMAN OSCAR settled at the rear, raced
toward the rear in the two to three path on the turn, began to rally briefly past the five sixteenths, shifted to the inside in upper stretch, and flattened out in
the final furlong. COLONEL KLINK broke slightly awkwardly, settled toward the rear outside of SAMURAI CAUSE, was pushed along in the six path on the
turn and offered a brief bid, raced five wide into the lane, and flattened out. SAMURAI CAUSE settled toward the rear inside of COLONEL KLINK, began to
lose ground inside past the half, and offered nothing further in the lane. WILD WES chased midpack, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, offered
no response and weakened.

Footnotes
SHOWIT was rated off the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, steadily gained on the leaders between foes racing through the turn,
split foes challenging for command entering the stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. KENAI COOL ducked inwards bumping FLYING
BUSINESS, was reserved between foes racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the stretch and continued well to gain the place honors. HER GOLD
MINE, forwardly placed three deep attending the early pace, pressed the issue in that path entering the turn to gain a brief advantage but weakened late.
DARLIN ROSIE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the turn, tipped outside foes in upper stretch and continued to improve position four wide
late. HIDDEN FIGURE tracked off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch, made brief progress four wide racing into the turn to gain striking
distance but lacked the needed late bid. SING ALONG SUZY tracked off the first flight near the inside racing to the bend and continued evenly between foes
in the drive. BABY BEE MERRY, urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way after a half. FLYING BUSINESS, bumped, then caught in close quarters
early, was urged to make brief pursuit of the leaders four wide entering the turn but emptied out in the drive. KURINGAI, bumped, then pinched back at the
start, never gained contention. MORA VALLEY, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, gave way on the turn. DRAMA RUN was
hustled to contend along the rail in the opening quarter but was spent early.
