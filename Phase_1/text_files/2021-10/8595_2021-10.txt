stretch and spurted away late. HARD STING raced in the two to three path along the first turn while back early on, was in the four path into the lane and
rallied down the lane late for place. CHASE TRACKER raced in the two path along the first turn, pressed the pace while two wide, was in the three path into
the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. MAJOR FRONTIER raced in the three path along the first turn, stalked the early pace, was in the five path
into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the
lane and moved up in the stretch. CROWN THE PRINCE was never a factor. THUNDER AHEAD was through after a half. TRADEOFF broke a bit slow at
the start, raced in the two to three path along the first turn while done early.

throughout the stretch run. MACHISMO chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner
in the late stages. VOLUBILE hopped at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the seven path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. LOST IN
LIMBO ducked in the gap after the start, raced on the inside through the turn, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. CAVE RUN was
unprepared at the start and raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane with some gain late in the stretch drive. KITTEN'S MAN chased the
pace early, was in the six path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. COVE BLUE vied for the lead early on three wide, was in the four path into
the lane and faded late in the stretch. ASH FLAT had early speed from between horses then folded up.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DIAMOND settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide at the five sixteenths pole while picking up stride, came into the lane five
wide, rallied on his left lead to bid outside of MOUNT KENYA at the furlong pole, forged an advantage from that foe a sixteenth from home, and drew clear.
BATTLE OF BRITAIN broke a step slowly before being significantly bothered by an inner foe at the start, lied at the rear two wide, tracked from well off of
the pace around the far turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly to reach place in the late stages. MOUNT KENYA tracked from midpack
three wide, ranged up four wide turning for home to bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole as AMERICAN
DIAMOND rallied, resisted that foe's bid passing the furlong grounds, but was bested a sixteenth out, then lost place in the late stages. BROWN DELIVERS
saved ground while stalking just behind the leaders, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but only managed to
chase the leaders home without progressing. COOL RAGS saved ground around both turns in midpack, awaited racing room in upper stretch, split foes two
wide a the three sixteenths pole, but was shut off behind a tiring SIMPLY JACK in the final furlong, then stayed on between horses late. SIMPLY JACK vied
two wide, led briefly in upper stretch, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded at the furlong grounds. CRONUS was slammed by an inner
foe into an outer rival at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field, altered course seven wide in midstretch, and improved. SANCTIFIED stalked three
wide, but was outmoved turning for home, encountered traffic between horses in upper stretch, but was empty once clear, and fadedd. RARE STRIPE
stalked two wide and between horses early on, took back to midpack into the backstretch, then shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally and tired.
UNCLE DUKE broke outwardly and severely interfered a pair of outer rivals at the start, tracked from off of the pace two wide, then faded while getting
floated five wide turning for home. FLYING FRED set the pace, met SIMPLY JACK's bid around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. ROAD
ABROAD got outrun.

Footnotes
SPEITFUL SAM dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, dug in to resist his outermost counterpart's bid in upper stretch, gamely repelled that rival in the
final furlong, and inched away. NAME REJECTED pressed the leading duelers in earnest just outside of their flanks, bid in upper stretch as SPEITFUL SAM
dug in, but was denied reaching that foe's throatlatch, and was repelled late. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but
gave way to them entering the lane, and saved show. READY TO ANSWER lied off of the pace two wide, shifted three to four wide turning for home, but
failed to make an impact. GRANDEUR trailed two wide into the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but failed to factor. ILLBOOTENGOTTY saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LESLIE'S GOLD stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE tracked four wide,
tucked to the three path into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
MORE THAN UNUSUAL rated off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, tipped outside of the leading group at the three
sixteenths pole with multiple lengths to find, then rallied well through the final furlong to edge past those rivals approaching the wire. BELLAGAMBA (ARG)
tracked four wide, bid for the lead three wide and between horses at the five sixteenths pole as JEZEBEL'S KITTEN made an outside blitz, dueled between
rivals through the lane thereafter, but was outkicked by an outer foe in the very late stages. BARISTA stalked two to three wide into the backstretch, bid for
the lead two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole as outer foes ranged up, led from those rivals entering the lane, dueled through midstretch, but was
bested by a pair of outer rivals in the late stages. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN tracked two wide, produced a four wide sweeping move turning for home to bid for the
lead entering the lane, dueled outside of a pair of rivals into midstretch, but leveled off, and was outkicked for a minor placing. THREE FLAMINGOS got
rank inside of foes racing into the first turn, settled around that bend, awaited racing room in upper stretch before splitting foes two wide at the three
sixteenths pole, then chased the leading group home while narrowing their advantage. OXUM POWER settled far off of the pace four wide, and moved up
through the lane. WAIT FOR NAIROBI tracked from the two to three paths, and failed to factor. PYTHONESS broke slowly, saved ground at the rear, and
failed to factor. DISCREET KITTY set the pace into the first turn allowed ASK BAILEY to run off around that bend, but steadied behind that foe when that
rival settled into the backstretch, stalked two wide, tucked to the inside into the far turn, then faded turning for home. VIVIDLY (GB) lied at the rear two wide,
and failed to make an impact. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) lied off of the pace three wide, got floated five wide around the far turn, and failed to rally. ASK
BAILEY broke slowly, shifted outside of rivals into the first turn, rushed swiftly around that bend to clear the field into the far turn, then caved inside of a trio
of bidders entering the lane.
