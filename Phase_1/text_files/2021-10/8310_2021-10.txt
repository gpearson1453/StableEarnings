ULTIMATE BARONESS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up
late. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late and held the

needed late kick. COZZENE'S CAT well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and ran evenly.
CONQUESTHARDCHERRY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and ran evenly in the lane. AT LEAST was never

KISS PRINCIPAL tracked the pace back, pulled to contention into the turn, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader, then made a
steady gain and drove clear. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened and
held the place. ROYAL COURT fractious in the gate, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
closed well for the show. RICHARD HOOTY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and
flattened out. LONGSHANKS broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and passed tiring rivals.
BACKDOORPARTY well placed, lost ground three and four wide through the turn, then had no rally. KRUG ducked out after the star and steadied, then was
no factor.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUNNER set the pace off the rail, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. TRI TRY COLORS allowed to
settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and closed well for the place. ZOODLES allowed to settle,
moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. I'M JUST LAUGHING well placed and between, steadied into the
turn, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong. HESASMOKIN allowed to settle, looped three and
four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. STOCK CHAIN well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside and faded the final furlong. HE'S ON THE FLY vied for the early lead inside and faded through the turn. TOUCH OF LA GREY well placed
and outside, lost ground four wide through the turn, then had no rally.
