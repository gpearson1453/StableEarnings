DIAMOND DUST sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, dueled, edged ahead and held under steady
pressure. RACE DRIVER well placed, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, dueled with the winner and was
outfinished. MERLIN'S SONG allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged
up for the show late. SAMEDI NIGHT allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and gained a share late.
IMPERIAL KING never far back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. WHERE
YOU WAS never far back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker and
weakened. NUEVA YORK was no factor. LIFE MISSION rated close up, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader
into the stretch and had no rally. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RACE DRIVER AGAINST THE RIDER OF DIAMOND DUST WAS NOT

Footnotes
HATS OFF TOO YOU well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, made a steady gain and
edged up in the final strides. SQUIRREL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then was outfinished in a good effort.
JINGLE BELLS hesitated at the start, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the show.
ECHO ALPHA SIX allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. ABANDONED stalked the
pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE allowed to settle,
moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. KIANG mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
and faded the final furlong. BETTYS BOMBER well placed, lost ground three and four wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally.
