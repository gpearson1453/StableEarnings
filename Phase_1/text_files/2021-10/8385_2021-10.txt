Footnotes
HAWK'S RISING was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in the
closing yards. POPPY'S C NOTE broke sharply to set a pressured pace, drifted out into the stretch and just failed to last. HIGH SPEED CHASE pressed the
pace of POPPY'S C NOTE while racing three-wide, was carried out by that rival nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. ACTIVE PASS was
forwardly placed throughout, moved four-wide through the third turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. PASCO lagged throughout.

Footnotes
DYF was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the third turn and wore down DECI in the closing yards. DIECI was reserved just
off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late.
SHOCKAZULU settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the third turn and finished evenly late. FAR WEST appeared rank to placed, moved
four-wide to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way soon after. FOREVER THE CHIEF was away alertly to dispute the pace from the
inside and gave way after the opening quarter. LATITUDEFORTYTWO showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the third turn and was not a factor.
TETON broke sharply to duel for the early advantage while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
GRAZEN VALOR was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with ABRAA JABRAA, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive, drifted
out approaching the stretch and held by a narrow margin. ABRAA JABRAA broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied
through a vigorous drive, was carried out by that rival nearing the eighth pole and just missed. SIZZLING GRACE was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and failed to gain on the top pair in the drive. EMMA'S A BEAST was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and lacked the
needed rally. TEASPOON OF PEPPER settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. HOT AND SASSY showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the
second turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
ROYAL DANIELLE was away in good order to stalk the pace of RHODYISAROCKSTAR while racing three-wide, checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
moved up to take command with a furlong to run and drew off as a handy winner. SKY'S THE LIMIT settled off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing
the three-sixteenths pole, remained inside for the drive and was up for the place. ASPEN AGAIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. JAN'S BEST was void of early speed, angled out nearing the furlong marker and finished
with some late run. RHODYISAROCKSTAR sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong. MISSY
PARKER was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. COASTAL SWEETIE lacked early foot, raced
off the rail through the second turn and did not threaten. COMMACUTEZEE refused to break.

JUST CLASSY was reserved just off the leaders for the opening quarter, moved up four-wide to take command before going a half, opened a clear lead and
drew off through the lane with complete authority. BOTTLE NECK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the fourth turn, could not gain on
the winner but finished with good energy. DON'T RUB IT was away in good order to set a pressured pace, relinquished that duty to the winner after the
opening quarter, chased that rival while racing three-wide and could not gain in the drive. BARBELLO (NZ) showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the fourth-turn and finished evenly late. TIME FOR KISSES was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and failed to rally. LOOKOUT TAYLOR
was squeezed back at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the fourth turn and was not a factor. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI pressed the pace
while racing three-wide and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
CRESCENT WILDCAT was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off through the
lane. CRAZY AL pressed the pace of the winner from the inside, could not gain on that rival in the drive but held on well for the place. HASHTAG BAE was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished willingly in the drive. WORKING hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. MEETMEATTHEBAR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. BOLDLY TRUE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. REIGN ON (GB) showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
