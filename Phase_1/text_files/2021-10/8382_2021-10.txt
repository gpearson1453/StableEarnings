Footnotes
ZIPPIN BY U got away alertly, settled in to stalk, went three wide on the turn then moved out a bit turning for home, had a well-timed ride to edge by late
under confident handling. SILVERS BLING was encouraged along from the break but lacking sufficient speed, got into gear after the opening furlong and
made a swift move to take the lead outside the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn, was challenged in the stretch, hard-ridden at that juncture but
outfinished. YUUUGE PARTY set the early tempo in the two path, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, proved no match for the top pair. WILD
FIREWATER broke awkwardly and steadied slightly, raced three to four wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch. ELIAS CHOICE chased the early
pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, was carried in through mid-stretch and faded. INDY'S CHINOOK chased briefly
inside, dropped back and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

FLYIN FALYNN was outpaced early settling at the rear, fanned eight wide coming out of the turn, drove past late. BULLY BABY advanced four wide on the
turn, drifted out turning for home then drifted in through upper stretch and then back out nearing mid-stretch, was no match for the winner. IZE A CRAFTY
GAL was up close early, went three wide through much of the turn having to switch outside a rival five deep past the quarter pole when in tight and
steadying slightly, faced some traffic as that same rival drifted out at the top of the stretch and again at the eighth pole, kept on. HADDY UP was
forwardly-placed, dueled outside a foe two to three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. EYE ON TIGER raced outside a rival going two to three wide
on the turn and failed to rally. NAUGHTY SWAGGER was reluctant to load, moved forward inside to contest the lead, dueled through the turn on or just off
the rail, weakened. DONNA WHO failed to threaten racing inside. FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDERS OF HADDY UP AND IZE A CRAFTY GAL
AGAINST BULLY BABY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE FORMER OBJECTION WAS NOT ALLOWED BUT THE LATTER OBJECTION RESULTED IN
A DISQUALIFICATION OF BULLY BABY FROM SECOND TO THIRD BEHIND IZE A CRAFTY GAL FOR INTERFERENCE. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SHIO stalked the leaders, advanced four then three wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, was kept busy to hold sway. SCOTTY WHO
contended inside, lost ground into upper stretch but fought on gamely to miss. FORGOTABOUTME was urged from the break, set the early tempo, vied
between two to three wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair. CHAMPITO raced inside on or just off the rail through the turn, failed to rally in the
lane. TRUST THE VAN was mid-pack early, went two to three wide on the turn, needed more. TUCKER D raced outside rivals four to five wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. ATTILA'S LEGEND was outpaced racing wide, went in the five path on the turn and was not a threat. COMEDY KING chased in
behind the leaders three wide, angled to the rail midway on the turn, faded.

SHEZA DANDY R F was urged at the break to press the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, fought gamely to edge past late. TIGHT FITTIN JEANS
was urged forward at the break to dictate terms, faced increasing pressure on the turn racing just off the rail, was outfinished. SHUGS CHARLIE went four
to five wide on the turn mid-pack, ran on mildly to get show honors. LET IT ROLL tracked the leaders just off the fence, moved out from two to five wide
leaving the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MCWEND shifted in leaving the backstretch, went in the three path on the turn, failed to rally. BEAUTIFUL
BOUNTY raced last but one in about the two to three path and failed to threaten. COUNT THEM AGAIN was getting out early, pulled up and vanned off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN attended the pace, moved to challenge four wide between rivals on the turn, drifted seven wide turning for home then came back
in, edged clear late under steady handling. MARKING TIME set the early tempo then vied inside foes but off the fence, yielded grudgingly late. QUATRO
stalked five wide and between foes on the turn, kept on in the lane to narrowly miss second. LINE CALL was fractious in the gate, stalked from outside
going six wide on the turn floating eight deep into the stretch, flattened out. OUR TIME TO SHINE settled off the leaders, raced inside a foe but just off the
rail through the turn, ran on evenly late. BAND OF GLORY contended three wide and between rivals, gave way. INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM raced outside a
rival well back of the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, shifted nine wide in upper stretch, faded.
