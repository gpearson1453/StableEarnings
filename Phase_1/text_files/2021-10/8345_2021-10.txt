bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. EL AHIJADO
pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. CAPT. MAESTRI was bothered a bit at the start and never a
factor. NO SLO MO chased the pace early, raced in the four path along both turns and was empty late in the stretch drive. TIME FOR TROUBLE raced in
the three path along the first turn, was in the five path into the lane while through after a half. EYE OF THE CAT stalked the pace early, raced on the inside

Footnotes
BELL'S THE ONE trailed around the turn, swung four wide entering the lane, rallied with a good kick to bid for the lead at the furlong pole, forged an
advantage from a battling ESTILO TALENTOSO passing the furlong grounds, then held from an oncharging CLUB CAR in the late stages. CLUB CAR
tracked two wide and between horses, pulled briefly into the turn but settled shortly after to stalk around the bend, but patiently awaited racing room turning
for home, altered course five wide and outside of foes passing the three sixteenths pole, the surged in the final furlong to menace outside of BELL'S THE
ONE late, but missed. ESTILO TALENTOSO stalked three wide, bid between horses in upper stretch as BELL'S THE ONE ranged up alongside, but was
outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole, fought on thereafter, but was nailed on the wire for place. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ set the pace two wide, cleared an
inner foe into the turn but stayed in the two path while showing the way from a pressing MISS MOSCAIC around the bend, clung to an advantage between
rivals in upper stretch, but was headed by foes on both sides passing the furlong pole, and yielded. FRANK'S ROCKETTE lied close up along the inside,
stalked around the turn, completed a rail bid in upper stretch while inside of multiple foes, but was outkicked by those outer rivals passing the furlong pole,
and faltered. MISS MOSAIC prompted the pace three wide, then two wide while in the three path around the turn, but faded between horses in upper
stretch. FOLLOWING REVIEW, THE FINAL TIME AND FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED AND EDITED.

Footnotes
BLOWOUT (GB) cleared early on, managed a cleared advantage around the far turn as REGAL GLORY edged up alongside, inched clear of that foe when
set down in upper stretch, but dug in to resist that rival's bid in midstretch, but was unwavering to the finish. REGAL GLORY was forced outwards from an
inner foe into an outer rival at the start, but got nibbled at to rush for early positioning, stalked comfortably two wide, tipped three wide into the far turn to
range up outside of the leaders, sustained that charge to bid for the lead outside of her stablemate in midstretch, dueled with that foe to the wire, but was
unable to reach level terms, and was denied. EMPRESS JOSEPHINE (IRE) tracked from midpack along the inside, tracked two wide around the far turn,
tipped three wide entering the lane to take aim on the leading pair, then chased those rivals home while slowly gaining through the final furlong. ALTHIQA
(GB) saved ground off of the pace, but met traffic trouble while shifting off of the railing in upper stretch, tipped back to the rail approaching the final furlong,
but lacked a kick along the rail through the late stages. ABSCOND stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, then chased before
fading. VIADERA (GB) settled far off of the pace three wide, swung six wide turning for home, and stayed on. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL settled off of the pace
three wide, gained mildly four wide around the far turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, but failed to menace. DADDY IS A LEGEND hit the gate, then got
rank while shying from an inner foe at the start, trailed around both turns, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, and moved upr. DALIKA (GER) broke a step
slowly and was unable to achieve early positioning, tracked while hung out four wide, then weakened on her left lead in upper stretch. HENDY WOODS
broke outwardly, tracked from midpack tow wide, but was put to tight quarters in upper stretch before not making an impact. STAR COMMAND never got
involved. LA SIGNARE (FR) stalked three to two wide, but faded turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch.

RATTLE N ROLL stumbled slightly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, intently shifted four wide into the far turn, rallied swiftly under mild
encouragement around the far bend to bid for the lead entering the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, drew off under driving pressure through
midstretch, and was ridden out in the late stages. DOUBLE THUNDER was last away after a step slow start, saved ground far off of the pace, but came
under urging while shifting to the five path into the far turn, responded and picked up stride to gain around that bend, then stayed on well through the lane to
reach place while not threatening the winner. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke outwardly, but cleared into the first turn, met STELLAR TIP's bid around the far
turn, repelled that foe while offering little resistance to RATTLE N ROLL entering the lane, chased that foe home, but lost place in the late stages.
AMERICAN SANCTUARY checked passing the wire for the first time, settled at the rear along the inside, advanced inside of foes into the far turn, but
encountered traffic in upper stretch, altered four wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on. COSTA TERRA settled far off of the pace three wide, and
moved up in the final furlong. MR. BOUMA took a minor brush to his hind quarters into the first turn as outer foes were stacked up, stalked along the inside,
chased around the far turn, then tired on his left lead through the lane. STELLAR TAP was bumped between horses into the first turn while achieving a two
wide stalking position, bid around the far turn, but faltered while getting outkicked entering the lane. KEVIN'S FOLLY never got involved. GREAT ESCAPE
brushed an inner foe into the first turn causing multiple rivals to be stacked up, tracked four to three wide, but came under coaxing into the far turn, got
outmoved around that bend, then weakened through the lane. SEAL BEACH was jostled between horses early on, steadied hard into the first turn due to
that incident, got keen while tracking from midpack along the inside, then wilted around the far turn. MAC'S TIME lied off of the pace three wide, got caught
six wide around the far turn, and weakened. KING CURLIN failed to factor. DON'T WAIT UP took a bump on both sides into the first, tracked three wide, but
faded into the far turn before weakening behind a tiring SEAL BEACH around that bend.

Footnotes
IN LOVE (BRZ) tracked from midpack along the inside around both turns, shifted six wide in upper stretch for clear sailing, produced a good kick to bid at
the furlong grounds, drove clear passing that station, and drew off. TELL YOUR DADDY stalked along the inside, bumped IVAR (BRZ) outwards while
shifting four wide and outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, grinded away to bid approaching the furlong pole, but was impeded by an inner drifting foe
at that marker, then kept on to secure place. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN stalked three wide, bid turning for home, forged an advantage while hanging on his
left lead at the three sixteenths pole, drifted outwards and bumped TELL YOUR DADDY passing the furlong pole as IN LOVE (BRZ) quickly kicked past,
then gamely saved show. IVAR (BRZ) stalked two wide while a bit keen around the first turn, shifted outside of the leading trio turning for home, but was
bumped three times in upper stretch by a shifting TELL YOUR DADDY, grinded away outside of that foe to attempt a bid at the furlong pole, but was
outkicked by his outer stablemate at that junction while being bumped and put to tight quarters by inner foes, then stayed on, but failed to reach show.
SPACE TRAVELLER (GB) settled two wide, swung seven wide turning for home, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead. FRONT RUN THE FED
saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on between horses through the final furlong. PIXELATE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the six path in
upper stretch with many lengths to find, and failed to factor. DIAMOND OOPS pressed two wide, vied between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked
in upper stretch, and faded. ARGENTELLO (IRE) was slow into stride, swung seven wide, and failed to factor. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) broke slowly and
never got involved. BROWN STORM (CHI) set the pace, met a pair of bids turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. ORDER OF AUSTRALIA (IRE)
tracked from midpack two wide, but came under heavy urging into the far turn, failed to respond, and weakened through the lane.

between horses, shifted three wide entering the lane, and rallied to reach place. SURFER DUDE set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner, but gave
way passing the furlong grounds. HITTING BOMBS settled far off of the pace, swung seven wide turning for home, and improved. GILDED AGE veered
outwards at the start, got caught in the seven path while off of the pace into the first turn, then five to six wide around the far turn, then managed to stay on
late. BOURBON ON FIRE broke a step slowly, lied off of the pace in the six to five path around the first turn, gained four wide around the far turn, but
flattened out entering the lane. NORGAY got keen while shifting outside of foes into the first turn, settled off of the pace along the inside, but was shuffled
behind a stopping foe around the far turn. LET MY PEOPLE GO stalked three wide, prompted down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace turning for
