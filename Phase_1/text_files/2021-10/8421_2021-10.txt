Footnotes
EMMELINE sat off the two duelers down the backside, came three wide on the turn to bid at the quarter pole, shifted in and brushed with the pace survivor
as they turned for home, straightened out and opened up, keeping a safe margin to the wire. TWISTER ALERT off the pace early, came rail to four wide on
the turn and tipped out widest into the five path turning for home, into a clear second spot at the sixteenth pole but no match for the winner. HARD EDGE
led quickly, let a rival take a short lead but re-engaged up the rail down the backside, put that one away but was tackled and brushed with the winner turning
for home, holding the show spot down to the wire. WHO SAYS off the pace and along the rail, put in a mild run down the stretch when angling out to the
three path, outfinishing the balance. MIDNIGHT CHOIR brushed with a rival at the start and chased outside, came into range three wide on the turn and
followed the winner's path into the stretch but could not sustain her bid, stalling in the final furlong. LADY AT BLAME dueled with a rival until late on the turn,
falling back down the stretch. KARAKONTIEPARADISE chased in midpack along the rail, was hustled to get in behind the leaders late on the turn but
stalled in the final furlong. BUTTERED TOAST trailed throughout and never entered contention.

Footnotes
COOL SOCIETY was off the pace and two wide into the turn with one beat, dropped in to the fence and followed the eventual place finisher into the stretch,
stayed on the rail while that one went out looking for a seam and that was the difference, getting through inside and up between to best that one in the final
forty yards. LUCKY GIRASOL came out and bumped a rival at the start and settled off the pace along the rail, angled out turning for home and shifted into
the four path, closed determinedly on the pace survivor and got by along with the winner to her inside, outkicked by that one late. MAKE NO MISTAKE went
to the lead and was stalked and pressed by a rival until putting that one away and clearing off in the stretch, caught in the final forty yards by two closers
with perfect trips. FACTORING broke awkwardly and was pinballed between rivals at the start, in behind a wall of runners chasing the duelers down the
backside, beside the eventual place finisher on the turn but came out into the five path in upper stretch and closed mildly to best the rest. THE GOOD
WITCH chased the duelers inside rivals down the backside, still in behind the leaders turning for home but could not sustain a bid and stalled at the
sixteenth pole. PINO IN A PURSE bumped by a rival at the start, was between runners chasing down the backside and on the turn, but could only muster a
mild close down the lane without threatening. VALLEY GIRL took back from between rivals chasing the early leaders, circled three to five wide on the turn
and floated out into the eight path down the lane, a minor close all she could muster far outside. ANITA GRIGIO sat wide in midpack early, came three wide
on the turn and out in the six path in upper stretch, inching up late without entering contention. CRUMLIN TIME trailed and was two to three wide on the
turn, only able to pass one tiring foe late. NORTHERN RUBY stalked and pressed the leader until the stretch when she got weary of her task and retreated.
