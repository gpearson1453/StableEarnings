BALLROOM BLITZ tracked the pace while saving ground along the rail, made the lead entering the far turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best while in hand. SALLY STRONG stalked and pressed the pace three wide and finished second best in the six path. HIGH FIRE trailed through
the far turn and had a mild late rally in the four path. DRILLIT close up from the start, moved closer two wide before a half then went evenly. MARKET
SUCCESS stumbled and bumped at the start, checked over heels and miss stepped nearing the first turn, altered course outside then was no threat.
CIRCUS RINGS set the pace in the three path for nearly six furlongs then weakened. SOMUCHSUGAR bumped at the start, checked behind rivals at the
fifteen sixteenths pole, remained a sharp threat for six furlongs then stopped in the stretch and jogged to the wire.
