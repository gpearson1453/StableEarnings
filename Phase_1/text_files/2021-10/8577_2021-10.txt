WHERE'S JOEY held a narrow lead inside then edged away through the stretch under mild pressure. RUFFY settled outside the dueling leaders and battled
for the place. IMPERIAL ROAD vied outside to the stretch and weakened slightly. BET ON GRET dropped back very wide then showed some late energy.
PALACE SUPERNOVA chased in the two path, moved briefly closer on the turn and flattened. CELTIC HEART chased inside then began fading on the
turn. MY COUSIN RICH dropped back at the start and was never a factor. STELLA'S TOUR raced outside within range then faded in the stretch. DINNA
FASH moved inside and weakened steadily. CALL HOME dropped back early and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WITTY moved powerfully to contention inside, angled out on the turn then drew off eagerly in the final furlong. ALLEVARE dueled outside, led on the turn,
was no match for winner but easily second best. MUNNY BOLT prompted the pace three wide, faded on the turn then came again for the show. MUTTLEY
pressed pace along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. MARGIN OF AIR raced within range inside then lacked a rally. BOBBYSFRIENDPOPEYE
urged outside down the backstretch and lacked a response. CUNEO dropped far behind and was always outrun. ROAD CALL lacked speed and was never
in contention. DEPLANE dropped back at the start and was always far behind. BIGSHOT ON NOTHING chased in the two path and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE moved clear inside then widened through the stretch while staying safe. THOROVER chased inside, angled out in the stretch and was up for
the place late. DEFIBRILLATOR saved ground off the pace then showed some late energy. JOINT AND SEVERAL advanced wide on the turn then
flattened out late. REFI stumbled badly at the start, trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. MOUNTAIN TREE dropped back wide and was never
in contention. J WASS steadied early and wide on the turn. BRONY BOY stumbled at the start, raced close wide and gave way. DOUGIE raced far back
throughout. COMFORTABLY COOL prompted the pace outside then stopped abruptly.
