Footnotes
FOCACCINA got crowded in traffic early then became a bit rank first time through the stretch, angled outside rivals then moved closer leaving the
backstretch, bid three deep around the second bend, dueled into and down the lane and edged clear. BUY AMERICAN was rank outside a rival first time in
the stretch, advanced up the backstretch and moved inside, shifted to the two path around the far turn, tipped out and rallied three wide in the stretch and
got up for the place. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) away quickly in the beginning, ceded the lead to DEVIL'S MESSENGER and stalked in the two path, closed in
leaving the backstretch, bid outside and took over past the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into and down the stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. BUZZ
OF NEW YORK (IRE) broke slow, became rank between horses first time through the stretch, angled to the inside for the first turn, went between foes on
the backstretch, chased a bit off the rail into the drive and finished well between late. TAKEMEBYTHEHAND (GB) unhurried in the beginning, raced off the
rail then came three wide into the stretch and could not rally. DEVIL'S MESSENGER broke out, went up vie for the lead from outside then cleared, padded
early on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead into the far turn, overtaken past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. WITCH MOON tracked the pace
from inside, looked to make a run from the fence leaving the turn but was in tight entering the stretch, moved off the rail in the drive and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SILVER MOON ROAD away quickly from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, urged left-handed in the lane and held gamely under strong handling. HERD
IMMUNITY broke slow and bobbled at the start, coaxed to take a forward position but lacked room behind SIILVER MOON ROAD and steadied early,
settled into a stalking position on the inside, saved ground into the lane, moved off the rail a bit and continued to give chase behind the leader, moved back
inside in midstretch and kept on willingly to the wire. CUMBERLAND AVENUE bumped rival early, was forwardly placed three deep early on, took aim two
wide into the stretch and could not find the needed late kick. ROOKIE YEAR bumped leaving the gate, raced in range while widest early on, angled down to
the two path around the turn and weakened. CLUB CAL broke in and bumped rival, trailed the field in the early stages, navigated the turn four then three
wide and failed to make an impact. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES got bumped from outside early, went up to chase outside the pacesetter then between rivals,
angled to the rail around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
GO ON off slow to begin, advanced up the backstretch while tugging the rider along, waited for room along the inside through the bend and upper stretch,
gained a clear path at the eighth pole, rallied up the inside and got up late. CALI BAY (IRE) traveled in mid-pack off the rail, traveled three deep on the turn,
came three to four wide into the stretch, rallied five wide and took over in midstretch but got outclosed by the winner in deep stretch. KAZUHIKO (AUS) sat
off the pace, went three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, moved out seven wide in upper stretch, rallied but was not enough. FLINT
STROLL unhurried in the beginning, swung seven wide into the lane, eight wide in upper stretch and put in a mild late bid. SAI CON (FR) away quickly then
ceded control to the top pair, bid three deep around the turn, took over in upper stretch, lost command midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. SECRET
WEAPON chased between then steadied in traffic nearing the turn, went two wide around the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out and failed to
rally. ENCROACHMENT hustled early to go to the front, took an awkward step crossing surfaces early, dueled from outside then pressed to the turn, took
over with a quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. PAUL VINCENTS POEM hustled from the inside early, went up to duel
while taking the lead, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened. JEDI MASTER broke a step slow, angled in
early and settled near the back, moved to the rail around the turn then swung four wide into the stretch, and never responded to urging.

Footnotes
SLOW DOWN ANDY attended the pace three deep, challenged outside the top pair on the turn, gained command past the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear
in upper stretch and drew off under a few taps of right-handed encouragement while drifting in late. MOOSE MITCHELL stumbled leaving the gate, chased
early then went up to duel from outside, vied between rivals through the bend, could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch and kept on to best the
rest. CREATIVE PEAK showed speed along the inside, dueled for command to the turn, vied with a pair of rivals around the bend, could not match strides in
upper stretch and stayed on to hold the show. STRAIGHT UP G chased four deep up the backstretch, four then three wide around the turn and missed the
show. MEDINA MAN tracked along the inside, lost ground around the turn and was never a factor. MR BUG Z chased three wide into the turn, lost ground
and moved to the two path around the bend and never made an impact.

Footnotes
FORTUNATA TENSIO fractious in the gate, set all the pace to the stretch, put to right-handed urging and held gamely. VERY SCARY bobbled at the start,
went three wide around the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, took aim outside the leader in the drive but had to settle for second best. WISHING
ON A STAR was rank in the early stages then was closest in pursuit early on, driven a bit off the rail into the drive and finished willingly inside. LET
FREEDOM REIN rated between rivals, got bumped by inner rival past the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the drive and finished evenly late. A
CROWN FOR KITTEN raced near the back and moved near the inside, went two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane and showed a mild response.
PEANUT BUTTER CUP stumbled leaving the gate, pulled between rivals early then moved inside to stalk the pace, shifted out and bumped rival past the
three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch and lacked a rally. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) off slow to begin, was rank and pulled through the early and got
bumped both sides into the first turn, steadied in tight quarters past the three-eighths pole and could not rally. MACRELLETTA hopped and came away slow
to start, tucked inside early, was a bit rank around the first turn, trailed inside into the lane, angled out in the stretch and improved position. FRENCH
FRANC (FR) settled on the inside, steadied past the three-eighths pole, continued inside to the stretch and failed to menace. SEVEN EXES off a bit slow to
begin, became rank early on then settled on the backstretch, asked in the lane but came up empty. CHARLOTTE HARBOR bumped with rival into the first
turn then went three then two wide around the bend, exited the far turn four wide and was not a factor. K P KRYPTON got bumped into the first turn then
went five then four wide around the bend, came three wide into the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
DOC ADAMS chased the speed from inside, looked to rally up the fence but lost his path approaching the eighth pole, altered out then surged late and
overhauled the runner-up. STIR THE POT sped clear up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside then two wide into the stretch, drifted to the rail
nearing the eighth pole, continued clear to the sixteenth marker and was run down by the winner. CUNNING MUNNINGS stalked in the two path into the
turn, steered four wide leaving the bend, chased outside HONORARY DEGREE in the lane and edged that rival for the show honors. HONORARY
DEGREE chased two wide then three wide into the stretch and lost the show. GORDY'S BOY dropped back early, four to five wide around the turn and
made no impact. KA'NAH chased between then three wide around the turn while losing ground, then weakened in the stretch. INTENSE chased four wide
around the turn and also weakened.

Footnotes
ENGLAND'S ROSE off a bit slow to begin, angled to the inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane, rallied to the front
approaching the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. NORMA JEAN B. chased three deep early then outside a rival on the first turn, angled three wide nearing
the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch, led briefly past the eighth pole, relinquished control soon after to the winner and stayed on to hold the place.
BROOKE (CHI) traveled between runner then became rank nearing the first turn, dropped back to the mid-pack, angled four wide leaving the far turn and
finished willingly for the show. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) raced at the back outside a rival, went between foes into the far turn, remained two wide to the
stretch, roused in the lane and kept on to earn a minor award. GLOBAL BRAND unhurried in the beginning, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and
showed a mild response but failed to threaten. NASTY raced up close outside the pacesetter, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid between in upper
stretch but faltered in the late stages. QUIET SECRETARY sped clear and crossed over to the inside, coaxed with a quarter mile remaining, challenged by
rivals in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead with a furlong to go, then weakened along the inside. IPPODAMIA'S GIRL stalked the pace from inside, saved
ground to the stretch, urged in upper stretch but lacked room and never found a clear path through the stretch run.

Footnotes
SQUALOTORO stalked four then three deep early on, came three wide into the stretch, drew alongside in the final sixteenth and drove clear. HONOR
AMONG MEN pressed the pace from outside, went up to duel into the turn, cleared FUN COUPONS around the bend and angled to the rail, led clear into
the final sixteenth and could not fend off the winner. FUN COUPONS set the pace under pressure then dueled with HONOR AMONG MEN into the turn,
could not match strides around the bend, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and held the show. SOMETIMES ALWAYS tracked six deep early, four
deep on the turn, stayed outside a rival and four wide into the stretch and missed the show. CHASING FAME chased along the fence then two wide into the
lane, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. HAWK HILL off a bit slow to begin, trailed to the turn, angled in and saved ground around the bend and
was not a factor. THE ROAN RANGER forwardly placed between foes early, chased outside a rival around the turn, three wide into the lane and weakened.
TEST DRIVE stumbled a bit at the start, chased three deep up the backstretch, steadied briefly behind rival at the quarter pole and had little left for the
drive. PEDRO PEREZ chased five then four deep early, dropped back around the bend, came three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
I'LL STAND TALLER stalked the pacesetters in the two path, angled in and bumped rival in upper stretch, rallied inside the runner-up and proved best late.
RIDING WITH DINO well placed behind the top pair early, bid three deep on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch but was overtaken by the winner late.
JOHNNY PODRES tracked off the inside then between runners, took the turn three wide, tipped outside the leader in the drive and lacked the needed late
punch. MISCHIEVOUS PATH chased off the inside then angled in, saved ground around the turn, waited in upper stretch, then tipped out and finished well
to earn a minor share. EL DIABLO ROJO settled off the pace outside a rival, navigated the turn three wide, angled out in the lane and finished willingly.
CLEM LABINE lacked early speed, went three to four wide around the turn, steered out in the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. FOOTHILL
dropped back early, took the turn four wide, angled out past the eighth pole and improved position. SINGLE ME OUT angled to the inside early, saved
ground around the turn and failed to menace. SURPLUS displayed early quickness, lugged in then got bumped by rival early, continued inside that rival to
duel for command, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn, then gave way in the lane. AUSTIN'S BOY showed early speed, lugged in bumped rival early,
dueled for the lead from outside, vied between around the turn, got bumped from outside in upper stretch and tired. BOUND TO BET chased three deep,
four wide around the turn, floated out by rival at the eighth pole and weakened. SEATTLE BREAKOUT jumped the track crossing surfaces early, raced off
the pace, two wide through the turn and never made an impact.
