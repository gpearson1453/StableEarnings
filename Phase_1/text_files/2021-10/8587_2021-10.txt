Footnotes
SHIO was allowed to settle early, went five wide into the turn, angled out, was gaining late and was up in time. SILENT ZENON pressed the early pace,
went three wide into the turn, took control in early stretch, opened up, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. CHAMPITO was void of any
early speed, angled out to the nine path through the drive and finished mildly. WAR WOUNDS raced in mid pack early, went eight wide into the turn and
offered no late rally. MR MOO stalked the early pace from the inside and faded. LEADING PROSPECT was off slow, was outrun early and never recovered.
PACK 'N GOLD set a pressured four wide pace and was finished early.
