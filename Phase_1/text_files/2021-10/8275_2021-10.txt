WEST BURKE broke sharp, chased leader to the half, took over and ran away while ridden out to the wire. GENERAL GINNY rated off top pair to far turn
but proved no match and bested the rest for the place spot. PIPA PAN well placed with a bid into far turn but flattened out for show. ETELKA no speed to far
turn, rallied outside past quarter pole, improved. DIXIE MOLL raced evenly lacking a late response when needed. COMPETITIVE FIRE never menace.
WEST COAST TEMPLE never threatened. TENAKEE flashed speed to the half, gave way readily thereafter.

WHISKEY SIS cleared trouble at the start sent to the lead, set all pace under good handling and outlasted a late challenge to the wire. TRICKIZAR never far
back three wide to stretch, rallied in the final furlong and coming on too late. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT stumbled extremely bad at the start, regrouped with
a gallant effort. SHIMMERING DREAM well placed while never far back, throughout with no late bid from inside. MY DARK SECRET was bothered at the
start, dropped back with a dull effort thereafter.
