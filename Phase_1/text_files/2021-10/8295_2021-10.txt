LIBERTY RUNNER lagged at the back of the pack, angled wide rallying then bid clear in the final sixteenth. MUSK pursued the loose pacesetter inside,
angled out in the stretch and finished gamely. WE BE THERE was put it tight by loose horse on the backstretch, angled inside and tired.
TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT prompted the pace outside, faded briefly on the turn then came again. WISEMAN'S SECRET broke alertly but stopped abruptly
losing contact with his field. WILLIE MAYS HAYS stumbled badly at the start unseating his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the
race.

PETTIGO GIRL rated wide behind the dueling leaders, bid in the stretch and edged off under steady urging. BLUE PAYNT vied between rivals then inside,
bid clear on the final turn then continued willingly while unable to hold off the winner. B B'S ROCKET prompted the pace three then two wide and came up
empty late. THRILLING BABY dropped back early outside and lacked a solid rally. TALE OF KITTEN lacked speed inside and was never a factor. SOUR
MASH hustled to clear lead early, dueled then was finished by the far turn. SHARON'S LAW saved ground and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
SUMMERY stalked the dueling leaders inside, angled out at the quarter, rallied and drew away in the final furlong. SOUTHERN RUNNER was put to urging
early, chased wide and finished well too late. DON GIUSEPPE dueled outside under a rating hold, led at the quarter pole, drifted in through the stretch. MR
SANDMAN vied along the inside alternating for the lead then proved empty in the late stages. ALLEVARE eased back in traffic early then rallied well
through the stretch. CUNEO lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. DANGNABBIT saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily.
MAGICAL KNIGHT lacked speed inside and gave way readily. JOKEMEISTER and THAT'S RIGHT were both injured in the starting gate and ordered
scratched by the stewards on the advice of the track veterinarian.

Footnotes
STREET TAIL quickly clear inside, widened on the turn and stayed safe driving. AMERICAN TALENT pursued the winner inside and made a gradual late
gain. GEEBERT dropped well back then advanced inside through the stretch. FOX RED prompted the pace outside and began tiring on the turn.
SNEAKINESS bid four wide near the quarter pole then flattened out. GENGHIS lacked speed along the rail and lacked a rally. FIVE MORE MINUTES
lagged far back, was never a factor then was vanned off afterward. STRONG BREEZE chased outside, drifted wide on the turn and gave way.
