pole but flattened out in the drive while being clearly second best. SNIPER SIS pressed the pace three wide and tired while saving the show award. MIJA
BELLA was settled early towards the inside, swung out five wide for the drive and offered no rally while just missing the show spot. PER RULING #21259PN

Footnotes
NINETYPERCENTBRYNN was rated along two wide, then was boxed leaving the quarter, eased out and then swung out six wide for racing room and
closed well on the outside to draw clear in the final sixteenth under a drive. SWAN POINT was bumped at the start, then settled four wide down the
backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn to gain a short advantage leaving the turn, but could not match strides with the winner late while holding on
to the place gamely. GLOWING STAR was rated along three wide, made a three wide bid between horses by the quarter pole, but flattened out while being
outfinished for the place award. STEPH'S PRINCESS set the pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
FAVORITE DOLL prompted the pace and made a bid between horses to vie for command by the quarter pole but weakened. MITTENSANDMUKLUKS
lacked a rally while on the inside. BROAD JUMPER had no response while five wide.

Footnotes
SHE'S ACHANCE TOO was rated early on the inside, eased out leaving the five eighths three wide, made a three wide move on the turn and drew clear
leaving the turn, then remained clear to prove best under a drive. COURTING JENNY was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn and came four wide
into the drive, finished willingly but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. FAIRY DUST pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid on
the turn to duel for command but faded in the drive, held show award. MARIE FROM PARIE was reluctant to load, stalked the pace three wide and faded.
MISS PINK was well placed on the inside, swung out seven wide for the drive and had no rally. BRYCE'S PHILLY set a pressured pace on the inside and
gave way. NEARLY MISSED was allowed to settle while four wide and had no rally. COLOR FORCE lacked a rally.
