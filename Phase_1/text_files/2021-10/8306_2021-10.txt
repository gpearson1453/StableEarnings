Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD broke in bumping PATRICK'S LASS, sped clear slightly off the inside, settled into the stretch still well in command, and was all out to
get the decision. MY DESTINY chased outside the winner throughout, narrowed the gap through the final furlong and outfinished a rival for second.
PATRICK'S LASS got bumped by WORLD GONE WILD at the break, chased inside to the turn, moved out four wide approaching the top of the stretch, and
finished one-paced outside the top two. BEYOND HEAVENLY was outsprinted two wide for three-eighths of a mile, and could not gain through the stretch
inside. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT was no factor three to four wide. HENNI PENNY showed little trailing from the outset.

CHECK TWICE raced off the pace three wide, moved closer outside down the backstretch, remained in range around the far turn, was not gaining while
under a drive nearing the lane, switched leads near the eighth pole, surged late and was up in the final strides. SHE'S SO SERIOUS set a clear pace along
the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane, held clear to deep stretch but was nailed. TOURING EGYPT saved ground in midpack, went two wide around
the far turn then had a mild rally. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY saved ground well back, angled out near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. SYLLABUS
raced off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. FABIOLA PRINCESS stalked the pace two wide
in the clear and tired in the drive. LADY PAYNTER chased the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn. C'EST PARTI was in range inside and was
after a half.

Footnotes
PALMACH quickly established command, rated along clear through an even and controlled pace, and widened through the stretch under a mild drive.
BEECHNUT TROPHY was outrun for six furlongs, swung four wide leaving the far turn, and wore down FIVE PRIZES for the runner-up spot. FIVE PRIZES
advanced to contention with a four-wide run after six furlongs, then flattened out through the lane. MAGNOLIA ROAD raced three wide on the turns, and
faded in upper stretch. SANDPIPER MEMORIES prompted the pace outside PALMACH for six furlongs, and had nothing left. HA' PENNY broke slowly, and
tired inside after a half-mile. PRESENCIA broke slowly, moved up inside through the middle stages, then faltered.

FAMOUS GENT stalked outside the early leaders, took over three wide after six furlongs and edged away, lost the advantage to OCEAN RIDE after
straightening away for the drive, stayed on task and took a narrow decision outside that rival. OCEAN RIDE saved ground covered up behind the leaders to
the far turn, shifted to the two-path rallying just inside FAMOUS GENT turning for home, reached a short lead through the furlong grounds, but was
outdueled to the finish. EXPONENTIAL was outrun early, came three wide rallying off the far turn, idled through midstretch, shifted out a bit and was gaining
outside the top two belatedly. LORD DARNLEY was never far back, had aim four wide at the top of the stretch, and was outfinished. AL HILAL saved
ground to the far turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain appreciably. PALEMMA moved inside around the first turn at the
back, improved position after six furlongs but could not sustain the bid. ETHOS raced three to four wide throughout, and made no impact. BLACK LIMO was
outrun through a four-wide journey. BOCA GUY pressed UNIMPEACHED from outside early, and faltered through the lane inside. UNIMPEACHED set a
pressured pace inside to the far turn, and folded up.

PICKING UP PENNIES set a clear pace in the two path and widened while drifting out a bit under moderate stretch urging. THINKABOUTIT stalked the
winner two and three wide, could not match strides with that foe in the lane but won the place duel. KANTSTAROS chased the pace inside, lacked the
needed rally and was narrowly outfinished for the place. HERO TIGER chased the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. STAR
WEAVER played no factor while racing two wide. GUMP trailed outside.

Footnotes
SWEDEN bobbled a stride from the gate, took the first turn five wide, advanced still well out in the course entering the far turn, took over outside
RIVERCREST ROAD after six furlongs and edged clear, drifted out under pressure through midstretch bothering SOUPER ALL STAR, then prevailed
narrowly while brushing with that rival near the finish. SOUPER ALL STAR raced in striking range three wide around the turns, got floated out by SWEDEN
entering the final furlong, stayed on with good courage and just missed while brushing with that one late. LOVE MY JOB bumped with STARSHIP NUGGET
soon after the start, stayed close in and around the two-path for six furlongs, moved inside through the late stages and finished up evenly. FLASHY TOO
raced four wide throughout, and lacked the needed closing bid. STARSHIP NUGGET bumped with LOVE MY JOB after the start, lagged well back for six
furlongs, swung four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. FORBIDDEN DREAM saved ground well back to the far turn, came three
wide into the stretch and improved late without factoring. CHICA BOOM stumbled at the start and was slowest away, put in a five-wide run around the far
turn, then gave way in the stretch. RIVERCREST ROAD pressed the pace for six furlongs, and weakened. THE RAIN IS COMING went along behind and
between horses around the first turn, and lacked a response when clear. OUTKICKTHECOVERAGE raced three wide early in the second flight, moved
inside to the far turn, and tired. BONNY BELL set a pressured early pace inside, and gave way under pressure on the far turn. FOLLOWING AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SOUPER ALL STAR AGAINST SWEDEN, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND PLACED
SECOND FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
