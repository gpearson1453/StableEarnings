Footnotes
ISABELLA'S MAGIC Well placed along the rail, gained inside to take on the leaders at the top of the lane, quickly took command and drew off as much the
best. MR. MIMS Broke slow, unhurried, saved ground on the turn, eased out, between a furlong out and finished well. THERESA'S BOY In hand along the
two path into the turn, three path out of it and finished well. D S ADVANTAGE Contested the lead along the three path, three across into the lane, chased
and weakened. SMITE Vied for the lead from the outset, two path between into the lane and tired. WILSON'S HOLIDAY Four wide on the turn and tired.
STRINGTOWN Saved ground on the turn, was outrun.
