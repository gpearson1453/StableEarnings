Footnotes
B DETERMINED , four wide well off the pace around the first turn, advanced five deep leaving the far turn, closed steadily and took the lead late. MINT
GAME lacked speed, raced in the three path on the far turn, altered course to the six path in mid stretch and closed outside the winner. DREAMIN OF
SEVILLE , under urging near the three eighths pole, moved up four deep leaving the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and continued gamely.
ELEMENTARY , in the two path between horses around the far turn, had a mild rally inside horses. SEVILLE ROW chased the pace, challenged for the lead
in the two path between horses mid way on the fr turn then gave way. THREETHEHARDWAY advanced in the three path on the far turn then weakened
through the stretch. LUDICROUS MODE hugged the inner rail on the far turn and was not a factor. LIFESPAN set the pace along the inner rail and tired in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST advanced inside rivals early on then emerged in a duel to the inside of LITTLEBITALILY leaving the five eighths marker, alternated for
the lead with that one around the turn, got away a bit past mid stretch then was fully extended under left handed asking to prevail. LITTLEBITALILY sped to
an early lead then was joined from her inside nearing the five furlong pole, would not let the winner shake clear past the eighth pole and battled back gamely
to just miss. LEAKY CAULDRON dropped in early in and rated off the leaders, edged up into the turn, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths, angled out
into the lane and kept on willingly to slowly bridge the gap. CONGRESS HALL , in range early while off the rail, angled in around the turn, moved back out
for the drive and closed steadily. FUDGE CAKE bobbled at the break, recovered and was sent up between foes to chase, shifted four wide in upper stretch
and continued with interest. FAIRY WISH , soundly bumped at the break, raced off the pace, came three wide for the drive and rallied mildly. SARAH'S
TREASURE lagged inside, swung very wide into the lane and had belated action. SHAKE D MOON rated inside past the three eighths, eased out into the
lane, altered back in, moved up some in mid stretch then flattened out. MAVILUS gave hard chase three wide early on, continued under pressure mid turn,
shifted five wide and gave way. LADY FOX , sluggish from the gate, was ridden four wide outside rivals leaving the three eighths, angled wider into the lane
but failed to generate a solid run. NOTION INTERRUPTUS drifted in at the break and bumped FAIRY WISH, raced off the pace and between foes mid turn
and lacked a bid. GRACE ISABELLA broke outward, raced four deep with early pursuit, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and faltered. PETES PRIDE
, three wide between rivals mid turn, faltered.

Footnotes
BUFF MY BOOTS sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch, was challenged by SPARKLE SPRINKLE in mid
stretch and determinedly battled back late. MY THOUGHTS raced in mid pack down the backstretch, was along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the
two path approaching the stretch, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. SPARKLE SPRINKLE showed early
speed near the rail, rated back leaving the backstretch, raced two wide on the far turn, engaged the winner in mid stretch and weakened late. LUNA BELLE
lacked speed, moved over to the inner rail turning for home, steadied in close quarters behind MY THOUGHTS in upper stretch then had a late move
between horses. WATERWORKS lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, floated five deep leaving the turn and was not a factor. MOON BOSS , three wide
chasing the early pace, weakened through the stretch. DOWSER raced along the inner rail while outrun. SWEET GRACIE showed speed outside the winner
and weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
EPIC IDEA rated kindly in a forward position towards the rail, sat patiently leaving the far turn, eased out advancing into the lane, surged between rivals to
take command near the furlong grounds, spurted clear soon after, kept on under strong handling past the sixteenth pole and held firm. MALDIVES MODEL
settled off the pace in about the two wide, moved up between runners around the final turn, found a seam to advance leaving the eighth pole, shifted in and
finished gamely to gain. JUDI BLUE EYES rated off the pace, edged up between rivals while three to four wide past the five sixteenths, angled a bit wider
into the lane, straightened and closed steadily. AMPLIO ESQUEMA dropped in early and settled off the pace, rated behind foes leaving the three eighths,
raced two wide into the lane, advanced between horses near mid stretch, angled out and closed. FOOL YOURSELF was taken wide into the backstretch
and rated off the pace, raced four wide leaving the far turn, angled seven wide into the lane and had a belated run. BRUSHING , off a bit slow when
breaking outward, corrected and moved up outside rivals to gain a three wide stalking spot, bid to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole, vied to mid
stretch then faded. ARTFUL SPLATTER forced the pace outside the leader, was under pressure trying to keep pace, stayed on with effort past mid stretch
then faded. MISTY'S BANSHEE , bumped at the break, lost ground three to four wide outside foes through the backstretch, chased six wide into the lane
and came up empty. TIPSY CHATTER sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted near the quarter pole, battled to mid stretch
then gave way in the final seventy yards. BREVIARY saved ground and faded. SALLY'S MUSTANG came in at the break and bumped with a rival, pulled
her way forward between runners early, stalked and tired after seven furlongs.

Footnotes
GRATEFUL BRED broke on top then went clear without much asking heading to the half mile marker, dropped in and set the pace under a light hold,
responded when set down two wide soon into the lane, kicked away under a drive in mid stretch then held firm late while kept alert. SKY'S NOT FALLING
edged up between rivals early on, steadied then took up sharply nearing the three eighths, regrouped then swung extremely wide for the drive, straightened
away, closed gamely outside rivals through the final furlong and gained the place in the final jumps. LOVE YOU MUCH was lightly steadied between rivals
nearing the half mile marker, rated in the clear three wide mid turn, angled four to five wide into the lane, advanced between runners past mid stretch and
kept on willingly. ROCK THE BOAT broke slowly, was taken wide and moved up outside rivals heading to the turn, was attempting to get out around the
turn, corrected to be about six wide in upper stretch, closed in past the eighth pole then wasn't quite good enough late. GODLOVESASINNER saved ground
under rating, eased back a bit nearing the turn, angled out and closed between rivals. SO STREET rated forwardly to the inside of a rival, raced three wide
into the lane, emerged as the closest pursuer past mid stretch, failed to kick on late and faded. JOSEPH , off the pace while saving ground, eased out for
the drive and offered a mild kick. SUE LOVES BARBADOS broke slowly, was taken to rate off the pace and off the inside, came three wide for the drive but
lacked a serious run. SHOWTIME CAT was nudged up inside to reach a stalking spot, steadied entering the turn, made a mild comeback along the rail past
the three sixteenths then faded in the final seventy yards. GRAND SKYLARK made a four wide run outside rivals heading to the turn, stalked outside SO
STREET around the turn, gave willing chase to mid stretch then weakened.

HELLO BEAUTIFUL sprinted clear about a furlong after the break, set the pace near the inner rail, drew out and was under urging in the stretch. MALIBU
BEAUTY , three deep on the turn, chased the winner in a game effort. STREET LUTE saved ground around the turn, chased the winner through the stretch
and finished gamely. COCONUT CAKE raced along the inner rail around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and lacked a serious rally. WHISPERING
PINES lacked speed, was under urging along the inner rail mid way on the turn and failed to be a factor. FILLE D'ESPRIT circled the turn three wide, floated
to the four path entering the stretch and gave way.

BUFF HELLO was sent up inside rivals in the opening sixteenth and joined the pace fray, dueled inside a pair of foes while under coaxing around the turn,
emerged in a battle with LOCAL MOTIVE past the three sixteenths, kicked clear under a stout drive near the sixteenth pole then edged away. COASTAL
MISSION chased the dueling leaders in about the two path, angled four wide into the lane, churned on willingly and out kicked LOCAL MOTIVE in the final
yards to gain the place. LOCAL MOTIVE was hard sent from the gate, dueled between runners around the turn, sparred outside the winner from the three
sixteenths past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. SHADY MUNNI , bumped at the break, was hustled along three to four wide mid turn, angled six wide
into the lane and kept on with some effort. MR. MOX , away alertly and had speed four wide outside rivals, dropped in a path and dueled three deep around
the turn, failed to keep pace past the three sixteenths then faded in the final seventy yards. CYNERGY'S STAR chased the duelers while well off the rail,
came five wide into the stretch, altered to the rail in the drive but failed to kick on. ALL FOR LOVE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out into the
lane and had a mild kick. VANCE SCHOLARS gave early chase inside, drifted out a bit leaving the far turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a bid.
GALLANT GOLD , bumped at the break, saved ground and lacked a rally. UNDER THE RADAR failed to menace. FREE SAILIN, unruly in the gate, raced
three to five wide while under a ride around the turn and failed to be a factor. BET ON BITZ broke slowly, raced well back while saving ground, angled out
into the lane, shifted back in but failed to menace. AL LOVES JOSIE was outrun. GOOD IDEA dropped back early, was pulled up leaving the three eighths
and walked off.

take aim on the leader soon after, bid to engage three sixteenths out, wrested command with a furlong to go then kicked clear under a drive. DOUBLE
CROWN bobbled at the break, recovered and rated off the inside, came under pressure past the three eighths, angled five wide into the lane and closed
willingly to nab the place. VALUED NOTION bobbled outward and bumped with a rival, was sent up between runners and vied briefly went clear with a half
mile to go, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when collared in upper stretch, battled past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. WHISKEY AND YOU ,
bumped at the break, showed speed and vied briefly, stalked the pace into the turn, chased outside the winner mid turn, shifted in and faded in the final
yards. KENNY HAD A NOTION , brushed at the break, raced between runners near the half mile marker, circled the turn four wide but came up empty.
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON , bumped at the break, gave early chase between rivals, dropped back leaving the far turn, angled out to be three wide into the
lane, moved up slightly between horses past the three sixteenths but lacked a further response. KARAN'S NOTION , four wide pursuing early on, dropped
back a bit on the turn, shifted in and faded. BAND ON TOUR lacked speed and lost ground four to five wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths
and gave way.

Footnotes
PRENDIMI sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and dug in tenaciously to hold sway. TAPPIN CAT ,
four deep entering the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, bid for the lead outside the winner in upper stretch
and finished gamely. THE POSER lacked speed while in the three path on the first turn, circled the far turn three wide and rallied outside horses. TORCH
OF TRUTH , in the two path on the first turn, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, reached a striking position in upper stretch, remained along the rail
and flattened out. DREAM BIG DREAMS lacked speed, was four deep on the far turn and failed to rally. CROUCHELLI was no factor. DASHING LOU gave
way leaving the backstretch. AIN'T DA BEER COLD bobbled leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside the winner, faltered leaving the far turn
and was eased late.

Footnotes
MILLIE CHILD relaxed kindly three wide while tracking the leader, responded when asked nearing the lane, moved to the attack past the three sixteenths,
wrested command inside the eighth pole then steadily drew clear under a drive. CLAIRE'S DARLING cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside,
came under pressure two wide into the lane, dug in when confronted in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. AWARD WANTED stalked inside, edged up
nearing mid stretch to loom but failed to seriously kick on. RAPIDASHQUEEN , four wide early, moved up three wide nearing the half mile marker, chased
the leaders into the lane but went evenly late. JUMPSTARTMYHEART settled off the pace, was ridden along behind rivals leaving the three eighths, angled
out for the drive and had a belated response. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR angled in early and settled, moved up along the rail nearing the far turn, chased inside
into the lane then failed to sustain. BETTER YET rated two to three wide, moved up some past the three eighths, angled four wide under a ride into the lane
but came up empty. FRISKY FEELING , between foes early, raced wide from the five eighths and gave way.
