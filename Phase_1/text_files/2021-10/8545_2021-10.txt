Footnotes
SPECIAL MEISTER led the way around the first turn then came under pressure from HILLBILLY, set a pressured pace to the far turn, shook clear still
unasked late on the far turn, saved ground into the lane, roused for more, responded willingly and pulled away. SETTE STELLE was unhurried out of the
gate saved ground around the first turn, settled not too far back through the backstretch, then angled out two to three wide near the three eighths pole,
commenced a steady bid around the far turn, stayed on four to three wide through the lane and gathered place. NEVERENOUGHCOCO raced four wide
around the first turn then settled into tracking position, was ridden along three wide upon entering the far turn, dropped closer to the inside turning for home
then sustained a steady two wide bid for a share. HILLBILLY applied pace pressure to SPECIAL MEISTER through the backstretch, launched a two wide
bid for the lead midway around the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner then flattened in the lane. BILLY BONES was headstrong and tugged
way into the first turn then stalked inside to the far turn, given cue along the rail near the quarter pole, came out a path wider for the drive and failed to move
on. OVERSTATED settled not too far back three to four wide then had no response when called upon in the far turn. MY COMPUTER raced in the back,
saved ground around the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SHES A GIFT took over the lead after opening stages a set the pace by a comfortable margin through the backstretch, remained clear still unasked late on
the turn, saved ground into the lane, responded under pressure, pulled away to a commanding lead and kept to task. TITANIC ROSE raced in range near
the inside through early stages, headed in pursuit three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured second best. LA
CUMPARSITA rated between foes not too far back going by the half mile marker, launched a bid entering the turn then dropped inside at the quarter pole,
remained inside through the lane and churned on for a share. MUDSHAFT stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch and remained forwardly placed
around the turn, given cue two wide at the head of the lane, failed to respond and steadily weakened. ISLAND WINTER tracked the pace through early
stages, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and steadily faded. VERONICUS held a slim lead out of the chute then conceded position and
dropped back to race off the second flight, was ridden along four wide around the turn but had no response. MILA was unhurried, came three wide into the
lane and failed to move into contention. OODLES ON FIRE was reserved in the last flight, went four wide into the lane and never menaced.

MI NEGRITA raced just off the leader while a bit headstrong out of the chute, let out a notch and took over the lead near the five-eighths pole, held a slim
lead over PERFECT PROVISION around the turn then shook free turning for home, cleared on top at the head of the lane, steadily drifted out wider and
remained well clear. AMANI'S IMAGE tracked the pace three deep through the backstretch, launched a bid for the top pair around the turn, dropped inside
past the quarter pole and sustained a steady inside bid to finish second best. PRETTY PROVOCATIVE was reserved racing in the back then picked up the
pace late on the turn, came three wide into the lane then angled inside and churned on for a share. WANDERING raced inside rivals in the second flight,
was ridden three wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. PERFECT PROVISION led the way out of the chute then conceded position to the
eventual winner, remained forwardly placed and raced in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then came up tired in the drive. LONGING TO FLY raced
between foes off the top flight through the backstretch then weakened around the turn. A WORD FROM ARTIE raced off the pace, saved ground around the
turn and had no response. BELLAVALENCIA was unhurried through early stages, went four wide into the lane and never menaced.

FREAK was allowed to settle in early stages while never far back, given cue midway around the turn, roused forward and vied five wide for the lead at the

battled back past the furlong marker then failed to kick on for the win. THE GREAT KATH vied out of the gate then edged back into tracking position,
tracked the three way duel then launched a bid late on the turn, stayed on three wide through the lane and prevailed for a share. FOLLOW ME MOM raced
off the early pace, saved ground around the turn then launched a rail bid at the head of the lane and improved. WORLD GONE WILD was off slow at the
start, raced five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. TRUE ATKA steadied entering the turn and gave way. MACKENZIE'S GIRL dueled inside of a
duo for the early lead, battled back into the lane then came up empty in late stages. BAHAMIAN MOON dueled between rivals and through early stages and
around the turn then faded.

Footnotes
SIMPLIFICATION let out a notch and moved up the inside to take over the lead past the half mile marker, widened advantage still unasked around the turn,
saved ground into the lane, roused for more in the upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away to a commanding lead, stayed sharp and finished ridden
out in the final sixteenth. STORMY PATTERN raced in range and chased three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and got up
late to take place. HEY HOMBRE led the way out of the gate then conceded position to the winner past the half mile marker, remained forwardly placed
around the turn, stayed on two to three wide and got edged late for place. THE MAR raced off the pace, cut the corner entering the lane and improved
position along the rail. POSEIDON'S SON chased the early pace, came out four wide leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. SHEA D CAPTURE raced in
the last flight, moved into the stretch four wide and failed to threaten. AWESOME CRUSADER broke on top then weakened off the early lead, raced four to
five wide into the lane and never menaced. I'LL FINISH showed response in opening stages then retreated. CHARLEMAGNERETURNS steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL was forwardly placed tracking the top pair through early stages, prompted out of the turn and edged up to challenge for the lead at
the head of the lane, dueled three deep into the final furlong, dug in determinedly, held a slim lead and stayed on gamely. SEA ART dueled inside of DIVINE
CONNECTION for the early lead, battled on around the turn then took on the added challenge of SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL turning for home, battled back
gamely from the inside in deep stretch but could not get by the winner. DEMURELY bumped with HARPER BE GOOD at the start and raced in contention
around the turn, came four wide into the lane, stayed on under steady pressure then closed with response and gained on the top pair. QUEEN CAMILLA
raced in the back, was ridden along five wide into the lane and steadily edged up closer. DIVINE CONNECTION vied for the early lead racing outside of
SEA ART, battled back into the final furlong then faded late. VIOLENT ZAP chased in range up the inside around the turn then flattened out in the lane.
HARPER BE GOOD chased two wide in contention around the turn then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
GIROLAMO'S ATTACK was briefly fractious and unseated the rider in the gate then came away in good order, stalked the top pair through the backstretch,
edged up three wide to challenge for the lead mid-way around the turn, gained the advantage then roused for more turning for home, dug in on top four
wide, came out wider in the final furlong, dug in gamely with GLORY OF FLORIDA looming a threat in final stages, turned back bid and held firm. GLORY
OF FLORIDA settled through early stages and raced five wide leaving the backstretch, edged up closer four wide late on the turn then given cue at the head
of the lane, raced in striking distance outside of the winner in deep stretch but could not get by. PRO QUALITY rated through the backstretch near the
inside, angled out around the turn, swung six wide into the lane, sustained a steady outside bid and got up for show. KING GUILLERMO vied outside of
QUENAME through the backstretch, battled on into the turn then failed to match with the winner past the quarter pole, stayed on in the upper stretch then
gave way. QUENANE dueled inside of KING GUILLERMO through the backstretch, could not maintain equal terms late on the turn then weakened in the
lane. SHIVAREE tracked the pace along the inside, was ridden along three wide into the stretch run and failed to kick on. EYE OF A JEDI was not far back
through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn then gave way. NOBLE DRAMA raced in the back, came out seven wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
RIVETING SPIRIT secured inside position around the first turn and settled through early stages, tipped out and picked up the pace leaving the backstretch,
was ridden along four wide out of the second bend then set down five wide for the drive, dug in under steady pressure and kicked clear. A THING OF
BEAUTY was forwardly placed and steadied inside around the first turn, tracked the second flight through the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the
lead at the quarter pole, vied into the stretch run then failed to kick on with the winner in the final sixteenth. QUIET STRENGTH stalked the pacesetter while
positioned inside a rival through the backstretch, waited patiently for a clear path around the far turn, tipped out three wide for the drive and churned on for a
share. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS gained a clear advantage around the first turn and set the pace through the backstretch, came under attack from outside
duo nearing the quarter pole, fought back past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. ANONYMOUS SOURCE settled through early stages while never
too far back, hustled up around the turn, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY stalked the
pacesetter through the backstretch, vied between rivals at the quarter pole then tired in the drive.
