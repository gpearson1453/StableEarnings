Footnotes
HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY , lightly bumped after breaking last, raced inside horses on the turn, was in the two path in the stretch, swept to command
outside I'M A LIL BOSSY approaching the eighth pole and drew away under confident handling. KEEN MACHINE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn,
eased off the rail to the two path in upper stretch and rallied. I'M A LIL BOSSY came out at the break, moved up two wide leaving the backstretch, sprinted
clear and was taken to the inner rail leaving the turn and weakened the final furlong. MAGIC IN ME lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn
and failed to rally. MIZ THE BEST raced six deep entering the stretch. KOBE'S GIRL , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. CARIBBEAN
FLOW sprinted to the early lead, angled in and hugged the inner rail leaving the backstretch and on the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home and
gave way. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY chased the pace in the two path around the turn and faltered. SUMMER MUSIC , three deep chasing the pace around the
turn, faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LOST MY VOWCHER rated close up while saving ground past the five eighths, eased out near the far turn then sat patiently past the three eighths, angled
out and gathered momentum four wide approaching the stretch, leveled off under left handed asking and moved to command outside rivals leaving the
eighth pole, kicked away nicely and was kept alert to the line. BLUE SKY PAINTER , three wide early, stalked behind rivals past the five eighths, eased out
then moved up three wide into the stretch, had his rider lose the stick soon after, shifted in to threaten near mid stretch, kept on with good energy but was
second best. JAMMIN STILL prompted the pace in hand and to the outside ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN, took over with five eighths to go, cleared nearing the
far turn, opened up mid way on the final turn, came under a ride in upper stretch, wandered outward from left handed asking nearing the eighth pole and
faded. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN bobbled at the break, recovered and sped to the front, took outside pressure then ceded the lead with about five furlongs
to go, remained a presence while saving ground and pursuing into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. WHERE'S THE BEN'S , sluggish from the
gate, was outrun. GALLINIPPER stalked the pace off the rail, moved up a bit to loom into the far turn, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and
retreated.

Footnotes
ELLIE BE DANCING bobbled slightly at the break, recovered and accelerated to a clear early advantage, set a rated pace just off the inside, remained
under confident handling into the lane while two wide, responded when put to firm asking in mid stretch then held sway. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , between
rivals leaving the far turn, shifted out five wide into the lane, straightened and closed willingly to gain and nab the place. MY WAY OR ELSE , taken to rate
early on, saved some ground past the five sixteenths, raced two wide into the lane and rallied between runners. CORAL SUMMER saved ground chasing
the pace, edged up past the furlong pole and kept on with interest. ADABEL stalked three wide, raced four wide into the lane, gave hard chase past mid
stretch but came up empty in the final yards. FEARLESS LASSIE steadied twice behind rivals nearing the turn, angled out, circled six wide into the lane and
rallied mildly. DIAL EMMA REILLY broke outward, lagged back early on, angled out leaving the three sixteenths but failed muster up a solid finish. MCLUCY
, four wide outside foes and chasing the pace, drifted out nearing the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
DETERMINED STAR , well positioned down the backstretch, eased out to the four path leaving the far turn, closed outside and was up late. CECILITA ,
three wide both turns, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch and just missed. ETHERIC , rated to the stretch, lacked room behind a wall
of horses near the eighth pole, angled out, split foes near the sixteenth pole and closed late. CLOUDS OF WHITE , four wide turning for home, offered a
mild rally. GOLDEN BELIEF had mild advance inside horses to the eighth pole and failed to sustain the bid. DAWN raced inside horses throughout and
finished willingly. PRINCESS PALMER set the pace near the rail, weakened in upper stretch, altered course to the outside of CECILITA and retreated. TIME
GOES FAST chased the pace two wide and gave way. KEEP IT CLASSIC worked between horses in the stretch and checked in tight quarters approaching
the finish. AMUNET , a forward factor along the inner rail throughout, gave way. TEN TWENTY ONE , shuffled back soon after the break, was no factor.
SOFIA'S SECRET , wide the far turn, was not a factor. An objection by the rider of PRINCESS PALMER against CECILITA for alleged interference in the
stretch was not allowed.

HUNTER JOE , brushed at the break, was urged inside rivals and moved to command nearing the five eighths, went clear after a quarter mile, set the pace
towards the rail, opened up under a solid drive in mid stretch and held firm while kept to task. TREASURE TRADITION , four wide outside rivals and a
forward presence past the half mile marker, tracked three wide from mid turn, failed to kick on with the winner soon into the lane but stayed on with good
energy to be well clear of the rest. CANOODLE broke slowly, settled back while saving ground, cut the corner and was put to a drive near the three
sixteenths, leveled off inside the furlong pole and finished nicely. PEDERSON'S COURAGE , fractious at the gate, raced forwardly while three wide between
runners early on, chased two wide around the turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. BAKENEKO , brushed at the break, saved ground chasing
the pace, swung five wide into the lane but lacked a solid run. LIBERTY STAR was sent up soon after the break and pressed two wide, dropped in around
the turn, was under a drive past the quarter pole, angled out and gave way. DA MONEY pursued behind rivals nearing the turn, came wide for the drive and
weakened. ARTIE CHILLER , sluggish from the gate, was ridden along while removed from the rail and came up empty. CARSON AND I was outrun.

Footnotes
FOGGY DREAMS sprinted clear soon after the break, was taken to the inner rail on the first turn, set the pace near the rail and was kept to her business in
the drive. GIULIA AMMANNATI , two wide chasing the winner, finished gamely to hold the place. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE stalked the pace racing along the
inner rail, angled out in upper stretch and rallied on her left lead. WITTY BANTER lacked speed, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, split foes and
closed. ONE LAST TRIAL offered a mild move along the inner rail in mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid. FED UP FIRED UP trailed to upper stretch,
floated to seven path in mid stretch, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , four wide entering the stretch, weakened.
BREVIARY was not a factor. SOMETHING MAGICAL , close up outside horses, gave way through the stretch. ALL ABOUT KATHERN , five wide turning
for home, floated to the six path in mid stretch and faltered.

encouragement to the sixteenth pole then cruised home from there. SO GRACIOUS stalked the winner three wide, took closer order past the five sixteenths,
was under pressure chasing into the lane then kept on willingly. PHANTOM SHOT broke alertly then tracked towards the rail, failed to kick on past the three

stretch, drifted in and lasted under urging. SILK WAR stalked the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn and rallied between horses. THE HAPPY
GIANT lacked speed, moved up five deep turning for home and rallied outside rivals. INFLUENTIAL , studdish during the post parade, lacked speed, was
four deep leaving the far turn and soundly bumped GREY GIANT when bearing in under right hand whipping approaching the eighth pole. GREY GIANT
raced in the three path between horses entering the stretch and was soundly bumped approaching the eighth pole. NARMER saved ground around the far
turn and failed to rally. HANFORD , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, was done in upper stretch. RUSH DELIVERY
