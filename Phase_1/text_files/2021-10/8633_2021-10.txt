pressured pace while three to four wide, was overtaken in the far turn and weakened late. GENTLE KISS sat in striking distance outside and faded steadily.

Footnotes
IT'S ALEXUS stalked the pacesetters outside, began bid nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead into the stretch and drove clear. DIXIE MO rated the pace
inside, was roused from the rail after passing the quarter pole, shifted out late stretch and dug in to take second. WHISKARITA trailed the field, rallied
belatedly outside to earn show honors. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE fractious in gate, vied inside of TEMPLE OF ZOOM, disposed of rival into the final turn, and
weakened along the rail into the stretch. PIPER ROSE settled outside and offered a late mild bid. EXACTLY sat in range and lacked a closing response.
TEMPLE OF ZOOM contested the early pace while three to four wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and gave way.

LIVING SKY vied hard inside of LILBITSPICY, continued to match strides the disposed of the for mentioned rival and held under a late drive. FRAN FROM
PERU brushed gate leaving, chased wide leaving the backstretch, moved up into striking position nearing the quarter pole, moved up alongside LIVING
SKY but was unable to get by. STEAMIN DEMON rallied belatedly and was along in time for third. BRADYDABOSS bumped inside rival leaving, chased
through the final turn, angled down to the rail and was edged out late. WIDE EYED WILEY passed tiring rivals. LILBITSPICY vied hard while four wide,
dueled outside of LIVING SKY, reached the three sixteenth marker and wilted. SECRET TRAILS chased throughout. SWIFT SWALLOW bumped away from
the gate and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WICKED FORTITUDE sped quickly inside under a snug hold, gained a short lead then saved ground into the final turn, stayed clear under intermittent
encouragements. FROBISHER BAY drove five wide into the lane, rallied mid stretch and was gaining late. PRESS GANG was brushed in the backstretch
from along the rail, gained closer order then rallied between and inched up for show. DENSE FOG contended the pace while four wide, fanned three wide,
raced evenly in stretch and weakened in the late stages. FINALLY GOTTCHA tracked outside, chased the leader into the final turn and finished evenly.
SLEWMACH was not a factor. DRIZZY contested the early pace inside of DENSE FOG, was unable to sustain the bid that was required and gave way.
BURNING LOVE was outrun and was reported by the official veterinarian as having bled.

DEVILS COMMAND tracked four to five wide leaving the backstretch, was set down for a drive into the stretch and got by. EL DORADO STORM hustled out
then angled towards the rail quickly, set the pace from just off the rail and was caught late. MY LUCKY MARK shifted out to the three path to stalked the
leader, prompted action after the three eighths marker, and flattened out in the stretch. BOLSANO lagged early and passed tiring rival late. BIG ROCKET
MAN chased outside and faded steadily in the lane. LONG TIME DON lacked a bid. POSTMAN was never involved. BLAZING CHANNING hurried away,
raced four to five wide into the far turn and failed to menace. REGAL RASCAL raced wide, trailed, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC reserved off the pacesetters, took closer order in the final turn, drove four wide gaining the lead and held under a late drive by TRADER
LYNN. TRADER LYNN unhurried early, shifted out to the four path approaching the stretch waiting for running room, surged late and missed. MAKE GOOD
CHOICES attended the pace outside, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, drifted in with a furlong remaining, and just held for show. BAKKEN
OVERDRIVE raced five wide in second flight, closed gradually outside and missed out. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER pressed the pace from between rivals,
dueled outside of FOOT SOLDIER, and weakened inside through stretch. BUCK WEST raced wide through the backstretch, lodged a bid at the three
sixteenth pole and failed to threaten in the drive. MIDNIGHT SALUTE raced wide and lacked a bid. FOOT SOLDIER showed the way leaving the chute,
contended pace inside and yielded in the final furlong.

IMPOSING CAT set the pace from the rail, responded to threat from REDNECK REMARK at the quarter pole and held safely. PROOF IT circled into the
lane, closed steadily outside and got up just in time for second. REDNECK REMARK sent for speed, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole but was
unable to stall the winner and was caught late. FLAT OUT LEADER rallied belatedly. EVER TRUE hustled outside, fanned four wide leaving the
backstretch, dropped back in the final turn, came under urging into the stretch and finished evenly. CABIN JOHN lacked the rally needed in drive.
WEEKEND WIZARD chased four wide, shifted outside approaching the stretch and came up empty for drive. LET THE BOY SING pressed three wide, was
unable to move on with rivals and gave way in the final sixteenth. THIS TIME LUCKY dismounted rider in gate, hurried away and faded steadily inside.
