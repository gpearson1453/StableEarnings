Footnotes
BABE'S GOT APPEAL was away well and set quick fractions while saving ground, extended the lead leaving the turn and was kept to task through the lane
to draw clear in the end. RUN LIKE KONA tracked the early pace from a two wide position, lost ground on the turn and while no match for the winner bested
the rest. MIA SOLINA had no early speed in the early going, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. PLUM WILD chased the pace
from a five wide position on the turn and weakened in the drive. SASSY EINSTEIN was outrun in the early stages, saved ground on the turn and did not
offer a late rally. KEEPINMYPROMISE bobbled at the start, was hustled to track the early pace and faded in the late going. CUTETIP stalked the early
pace, lost ground while four wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch drive.

besting the rest. ACE AND KINGS stalked the pace while saving ground and finished evenly in the stretch drive. GOLDENEYED was away well, showed

FULL OF LUCK (CHI) stalked the pace of MANY ROSES through the second turn, closed the gap on that foe nearing the top of the stretch, battled inside of
the final sixteenth, drifted in slightly in the final strides and dug in to prevail. MANY ROSES was away alertly and set the pace while being prompted by
FULL OF LUCK, battled the winner leaving the second turn and could not hold him off in the final sixteenth, while besting the rest. UPO tracked the early
pace, was four wide on the second turn, gained ground in the stretch but was outfinished by the top pair. ARCH PRINCE settled in the second flight while
saving ground and finished evenly in the stretch. CANYON CREST had no early speed, saved ground on the second turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SKY ON ICE was away best of the field and set slow fractions while being pressured by BELLIZE, thwarted that foes bid leaving the second turn and held
sway to win in a drive. BELLIZE pressed the slow fractions by SKY ON ICE while saving ground throughout, mounted a bid heading into the stretch but was
turned away by the winner and was outkicked in the late going, while besting the rest. ELA CALIMERA MOU settled in the midflight, was three wide on the
second turn, angled in for the stretch run but was outfinished by the top pair. KOKO'S MOM stalked the pace from a ground saving position, lost ground on
the second turn and weakened in the late going. KIND BUT SHE LIES settled near the rear of the field while saving ground and faded in the stretch run.
LIFE IN PARADISE was rank and hard to place in the early going, saved ground throughout and was not a factor. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS
1:16:51.

drive. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT settled off of the early pace, saved ground from the two path on the second turn, was outkicked in the stretch but was a clear
second over the rest. STORMING WARRIOR had no speed in the early going, mounted a bid while three wide on the second turn and closed well in the
stretch to claim the show, but was not challenging the top two. DESERT DUDE stalked the early pace, was still forwardly placed on the second turn while
four wide but lacked a late rally. HYDROGEN attended to the pace of BRONZE WARRIOR, was three wide on the second turn and gave way in the late
going. CONQUEST COBRA stalked the pace from the second flight, saved ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. SECOND BOLD hopped

VAPING ANGEL settled near the rear of the field, saved ground throughout, improved position nearing the top of the stretch, tipped out to challenge SEN
SEN, put that foe away and kicked clear in the end. JESSEBEAR tracked the early pace from the second flight, mounted a bid from the three path on the
second turn and rallied well in the stretch to claim second. CODE RIBBON stalked the early fractions from a ground saving position and was closing in the
stretch but was outfinished by the top pair. SEN SEN was away well and set comfortable fractions from the inside, had a clear lead heading into the lane but
was collared and passed by the winner and tired in the stretch run. WISHING ON A STAR bobbled at the start and was rank in the run into the first turn, was
two wide between foes on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. IRISH WAHINE had no early speed, trailed in the run along the backstretch, was
eased along the second turn and walked off under her own power.

TIP TOP GAL was away well and showed speed while saving ground, had a clear lead into the lane and won in a drive. WHEAL GRACE settled in the
second flight, saved ground on the turn, swung out for the drive and closed to win the nod for second. PIZZAZZ drifted out a bit leaving the half-mile marker
and bumped DRAW ME, was two wide while pressuring the winner on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, losing the head nod for second. DRAW
ME was bumped by PIZZAZZ leaving the half-mile marker, was three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. FAIRY TALE BLISS had no early
speed, was four wide on the turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
REIWA was unhurried in the early stages, was asked for run on the second turn and mounted a bid while five to six wide, continued that run into the stretch
and had a late surge to prevail. CLEARLY GONE settled near the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn, rallied leaving the turn and closed well
in the stretch, missing for the win but winning the nod for second. LA VIKINA was away well and set moderate fractions from a ground saving position, had a
clear lead into the last sixteenth but was caught by the winner and edged out for the place. BUYBACK settled in the midflight, improved position along the
second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. SCHERZO (GB) tracked the pace from the second flight, gained ground leaving the turn but was
outkicked in the stretch run. MISTY CAT tracked the early leaders from a ground saving position, was still forwardly placed on the second turn but was
outfinished in the stretch drive. NAVY QUEEN stalked the early pace, lost a bit of ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. TEN THE SMART
WAY prompted the pace from LA VIKINA from a two wide position and faded in the stretch run. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT hopped at the start and was unhurried in
the early going, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

away in the end. ARICKAREE was a bit slow into stride and settled at the rear of the field, rallied leaving the turn and while no match for the winner bested
the rest. HEAT N REHEAT settled in the midflight while three wide and finished evenly in the stretch run. TALISKER BAY had no early speed, saved ground
on the turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. UNION BLISS pressed the pace from ALEXANDER'S DREAM while in the two path on the turn and
weakened in the stretch run. SAL MAGLIE was forwardly placed in the early going while traveling in the four path and tired in the stretch. PAY TAVASCO
