EXPRESS BANKING stalked the early leader, took command on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. FLECK
settled off the pace, closed the gap on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. MARTINI SUE was away alertly and had
a mild gain on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CANADIAN MAGIC was hustled early and set the pace but was headed
on the far turn and had nothing left. VANA GRAND was up close early but trailed on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

LAXMI showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. ABOVE THE LINE tracked from the inside, was a factor on the
turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. ENHANCED FINANCE was off the pace, moved up on the turn and finished evenly. SWEET
FINALE settled off the pace, was roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. STEPITUPSTEPHANIE was in touch
and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. PLAY IT SMART showed no speed, raced evenly on the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. ELITE SONG was in range but chased on the turn and had no impact. REAL CHOPPER was
well back, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor.

the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. READY AT DAWN settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn
but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. DIAMONDBACK tracked from the inside but chased on the turn and had nothing left.

CEEBETT'S BOW set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. GIGI'S GIFT stalked the
early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path through the stretch held place. MADAME BOVERY was unhurried early, gained ground on
the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. NATURAL HABITAT was in touch and had a mild gain on the far turn but from
the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. DOODLE DANDY was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. QUIET ASCOT was away alertly and raced evenly on the far turn but flattened out through the stretch. STELLA UNREAL had no speed
and saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention. WICKEN CENTS was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
