Footnotes
SIMILAR TASTE broke inward but led early, set a pressured pace, quickened on the far turn then held under a drive. WHEN WE CONNECT broke outward
then settled in striking range, closed angling from two to four-wide on the far turn, was trying to reach the front but was lugging in the stretch and failed to
draw even. PERFECT PLAY settled off the pace, was hustled on the far turn, moved back to the rail in the final furlong and finished gamely. PATIO PARTY,
pinched back at the start then rated in mid pack, began his chase two and three-wide from the back of the pack from early on the far turn and was all out
through the stretch. SANTIAGO SALSA forced the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn but leveled out in mid stretch. MY REDEMPTION raced in mid
pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. ANSELMO pressed the pace, stalked on the backstretch, chased along the rail
on the far turn but evened out i the stretch. HAYROLL, off a step slowly, chased four-wide on the first turn, got up to press the pace on the backstretch,
chased three-wid eon the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
GEORGIAN DANCER sat along the rail in midpack, advanced up the inside in behind the pace survivor midway on the turn, angled out and headed that one
as the field turned for home, clearing off by the eighth pole and opening up, kept to her task under vigorous handling. BEARTHESTORM was allowed to
settle outside rivals in midpack, circled three to five wide on the turn and loomed up in the six path turning for home, into second in early stretch and while
no match for the winner, held the place over a stubborn foe in the later stages. D'S SOUL in the mix for the early lead, dropped back to midpack before
rallying three to four wide in tandem with the eventual place finisher, outgamed for second by that foe down the lane. MUSKOKA LADY off the pace early,
came rail to four wide on the turn before dropping in to the two path in upper stretch, then came out again at the eighth pole and had to steady slightly when
a tiring rival got in her path, closing well when outside and clear to best the balance. BABY DRIVER rushed up inside the two leaders to make it three in a
line down the backside, put away those pace challengers by midturn but the winner was immediately on her outside and took over and she backed up in the
final furlong. MACHISIMA broke out at the start, stalked and pressed the front while three wide throughout, still in the game for the place spot to midstretch
but tired and started shifting about. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA was between rivals early and continued to chase the front outside the winner on the turn but
could only put in a mild rally when asked, that move over and done with by the final furlong. I AM I SAID led early, was between rivals dueling down the
backside, began to drop back early on the turn and did not respond when asked. RASPBERRY WILD hit the gate and the start and trailed throughout when
off the rail.

Footnotes
SWOT ANALYSIS was always prominent, battled three and four-wide on the turn. lost ground at the top of the stretch, swept to the lead and held sway
under a drive. NASHTRICK stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and earned the place award. LAKE SHORE
DRIVE was herded inward at the start, stalked two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied between rivals. DECIMATOR settled off the pace,
was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SACRED OATH raced from off the pace, trailed to the stretch, angled
out and closed willingly outside. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR had speed and the rail, dueled, gained a short lead on the turn, dueled into the stretch, was
passed upper stretch and chased. ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN forced the pace, dueled into the stretch, was passed and yielded ground grudgingly. DANI'S VICTORY was off slowly and settled in
mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. TAKE A CHANCE stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn but evened
out with a furlong to run. MIRACLE SILVER stalked the pace ,was under strong restraint late backstretch while being a little rank, was hustled from the rail
on the turn but tired in mid stretch. AL HEYBAY raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LIARS CLUB sat along the rail in midpack, got in behind the leader late on the turn and got inside that one turning for home, outfinishing a rival to his
outside in the final seventy yards. HULLABALOO sat behind dueling leaders, came three wide midway on the turn and got a brief lead after passing the
pace survivor in upper stretch, but the winner got the dream rail trip and outkicked him to the wire. MORE CHANCES broke out and bumped a rival at the
start, settled off the pace, came between runners two to three wide on the turn and tipped out into the five path turning for home, continuing to close outside
down the lane and garner the show spot. TENPENNY NAIL off the pace early, came two to three wide with a rally on the turn, angled out into the stretch but
went back to the rail at the eighth pole, a visibly pleasing close ensuing in the final seventy yards. MAD DOG N JOE led quickly, was stalked and pressed by
a rival until putting that one away by midturn, collared by the top pair to his inside and out as they turned for home, retreating down the lane. SUN
FORESTER had to tap on the brakes on the turn when in behind rivals, steadied hard turning for home when coming up quickly behind foes, closing well
when clear space resulted in the final furlong. AWESOMECREST had a clear trip behind the top trio down the backside, came two to four wide into range at
the quarter marker but could not continue to rally when lugging in severely down the lane. ZEPHYRTIZER three wide in midpack early, came three to four
wide and floated out into the six path turning for home, his rally flattening in the final furlong. O'HARA LANE was bumped at the start and trailed the field out
in the two to four path on the turn, only able to pass two stragglers late in the stretch. MILWAUKEE FIBOLT along the rail and off the pace, was asked for
run on the turn but did not respond. ARQUEBUS stalked and pressed the leader until midway on the turn, retreating from that point. THERE WAS A
STEWARD'S INQUIRY INVOLVING AN INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH REGARDING THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER HULLABALOO AND THE FIFTH
PLACE FINISHER MAD DOG N JOE. AFTER REVIEW THE RESULT REMAINED UNCHANGED.

NOT SO QUIET forced the pace, dueled early turn, gained a short lead, shook clear into the stretch and widened under a drive. TOLD IT ALL settled at the
back of the pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. WAVE BABY settled in mid pack, closed late on the far
turn, drifted out losing ground and chased to the end. DERZKII held a short early lead, dueled briefly then forced the pace late turn and chased gamely
through the stretch. DUN DRUM was steadied just out, stalked the pace, launched a determined stretch drive but leveled out late. THERE'S NO JOE
stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final furlong. VICTOR'S DYNASTY settled in mid pack
early, chased three then two-wide late turn but flattened out in the stretch. FORESTER'S FORTUNE pressed the pace, chased four then three-wide on the
turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
COCOTARA stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, rallied gamely and was up on the wire. FOREST VIXEN held the early lead, set a
pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch but was caught in the final yards. KNEW AS A BREEZE was off slowly and settled well off the pace, rode the rail
on the turn then closed through the stretch. VIRACOCHA bumped with GOSPEL HILL leaving the gate, forced the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch
but her rally stalled with a 16th to run. GOSPEL HILL was bumped by RALEIGH at the start and bumped VIRACOCHA carrying on the momentum, stalked
the pace, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. VICTORIAVILLE settled off the pace, came four and five-wide on the
turn then posted a mild rally from the outside. NO MORE FENCES hopped at the break, closed to mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn,
tipped out at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. SILVER HEIGHTS was bumped by FOREST VIXEN at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. RALEIGH broke inward and bumped GOSPEL HILL, stalked the pace, dropped back a bit on the turn
and lacked a rally. STREET TOPPER, rated off the pace, raced two to four-wide through the turn but lacked a rally.
