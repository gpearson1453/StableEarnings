Footnotes
ROOKIE SALSA broke out to make contact with Auburn Mill then stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, challenged past the five
sixteenths, took the lead two deep into the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. GAMING JACK saved early ground, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close in the three and four paths of the far turn and finished evenly to be second best. POOL BOY CHARLIE rated a slim lead inside,
was met at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled clear toward the five sixteenths, but was caught into the far turn, dropped back approaching the top of the lane
then flattened. COZZE CAT became a bit anxious in the gate and settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn still in the three path and passed rivals in the lane. GOLDEN ANSWER stalked the earlier pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. AUBURN MILL was bumped lightly leaving the gate then angled in to stay with the
early pace two deep, drew to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY KAZA stalked two deep through the front stretch and took over into the first turn, drew clear from the half, came under pressure toward the five
sixteenths, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on well. SAILING ROCK settled back from early contention two deep,
started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. PUT POSITION rated
close toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths then outfinished in the stretch
duel for second. SHE GIVES ME FITS exchanged contact with Dah Philly leaving the gate and raced in the three and four paths of the opening turn, angled
to the rail approaching the head of the lane and threatened at the eighth pole, though, flattened the final sixteenth. ADIOS HILLARY saved ground on the
first turn, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, eased outward into the lane and finished evenly. DAH
PHILLY exchanged contact with She Gives Me Fits leaving the gate then rated off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole but
showed little response and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths. LIVIN A DREAM showed little response. CATHERINES WARRIOR angled in
through the front stretch while showing the way to the first turn, was caught past the five eighths pole, dropped back from the half mile pole, gave chase
from that point then faded at the rail on the far turn.

picked up the chase, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. SMELLSLIKEMONEY took over at the half mile pole and set the early
pace, was caught toward the five sixteenths pole, dropped back leaving the pole then weakened approaching the head of the lane. CLASSIC TUXEDO
hesitated at the break and was not a factor. FOREVER YOURS broke clear of the field but was quickly caught and faded through the backstretch.

BRILLIANT IDEAS saved early ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took aim two deep approaching the top of the stretch, drifted outward
leaving the turn but dug in when straightened away to take over later yards. HARD BEING ME settled off the pace in the three path, eased out into the
backstretch and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close four wide toward the top of the stretch and dug in to take second the final jump. LUCKY
PENGUIN took the lead into the first turn and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the
rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole then nipped from second the final stride.
MINDYOURPSANDQS saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, then ran evenly to late stretch before
flattening stride. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran
evenly down the lane. KITE SURFER stalked three wide then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced a close factor three wide nearing the
top of the stretch but was shut off at the heels of Brilliant Ideas at the eighth pole and gave way. RAVIN' MAVEN settled back off the rail the opening turn,
showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the four path. MASTER YOO showed little response. MR. SNAP stalked the
early pace two deep but dropped back midway on the first turn then faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
CATFISH closed to the lead past the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and recovered
the edge at the three eighths, drew clear at the rail on the far turn then further extended his lead under steady handling. HOT FUDGE SONDE rounded the
opening turn about the five path and settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, improved position in the four path of
the far turn then dueled for second in the upper stretch. JACKSON MAN stalked inside, drew to even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole but was
quickly overcome and gave chase at the three eighths, raced close off the rail to the mid point of the far turn, dropped back nearing the head of the lane and
flattened inside the eighth pole, though, held on for third. CHAMPSTER settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the later duel for third. CRISTIANO BOY saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. ACASHA'S INTUITION settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but faded through the backstretch. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS saved ground and showed little response through the
backstretch. GHOST MINE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUSPIROS saved ground just off the pace, took aim two deep leaving the three eighths pole and had the lead past the five sixteenths, drew clear into the
far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MALIBU CIRCLE broke in to exchange contact with Back Charge and bobbled at that point, dropped well
off the pace to save ground into the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, steadily gained to take second in the three path leaving the eighth
pole but couldn't gain significantly on the winner. ADIOS SEE YA rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and gave up
the lead past the five sixteenths, then ceded second while flattening stride inside the eighth pole. BACK CHARGE broke awkwardly to exchange contact
with Malibu Circle and rounded the opening turn about the seven path, raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
ran six wide on the far turn then flattened in the lane. LUNAR IMAGE raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the quarter pole,
ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. THE KING AQUILES settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. HONEY SAVER raced in the six path the first turn and settled off the pace leaving
the turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened. FLASH LIGHTENING stalked the early
pace off the rail, gave chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. MALETTA stalked the pace about the three path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but gave way abruptly leaving the five sixteenths. GET LIT entered the first turn about the five path then saved ground from
the mid point of the turn.
