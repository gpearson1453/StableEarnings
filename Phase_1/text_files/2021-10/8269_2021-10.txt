but did not have enough in the late stages. SISTER JUSTICE broke in at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up
in the stretch run. HERKINDOFJUSTICE stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. LANTANA
JUSTICE was never a threat. SKIPPINJUSTICE was bumped at the start, raced in the seven path into the lane. TAPPINTOTHEBEAT bobbled at the start,
set the pace early, came out and bumped foe into the lane and faded late in the stretch. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE was never a factor. MYGIRLJUSTICE
showed little. RED ROSEBUSH was bothered at the start and trailed the field throughout.
