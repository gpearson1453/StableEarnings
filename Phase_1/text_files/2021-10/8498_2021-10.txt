Footnotes
EASY SILENCE stalked the two rival pace through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane from the four path, gained a lead while straightening in
the lane, cleared with an eighth to go then slowly widened to the wire. NINJA KITTEN pressed the pace two wide through the turn, repelled challenger into
the lane, was joined by the winner in upper lane, could not keep up with that one but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. GUEST IN MY HEART
chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, could not gain on the top two while saving the show spot. WILD
TAPIT trailed for half while in the three path, swung into the lane from the six path and moved up belatedly. MS TEMPTATION was never a factor while in
the two path. DEEP DISH set the pace under pressure through the turn then gave way entering the lane.

straightening into the stretch, dueled outside the eighth pole then grudgingly gave ground grudgingly. SIR MICHAEL vied early while two wide, cleared in
late turn, continued between rivals inside the eighth pole then weakened late. ARTEGON was steadied near the half-mile pole, raced in the three or four
path through the turn and into the lane, drifted in late and never was a threat. LONGLIVEJUSTICE was never a factor while in the two or three path.
DENVER SKY trailed throughout while near the inside.

the three-eighths pole, took back on the turn and angled three wide by the quarter pole, bid late but faltered. ZANESVILLE pressed the pace in the three
path, bid at the three-eighths pole, went to the rail nearing the quarter pole and then gave way in the stretch. DIRECT APPROACH raced four wide and had

Footnotes
LOOKIN ROYAL stalked in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, bore out six wide at the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch under mild urging.
SPRING WAGER raced four wide, bid at the quarter pole but was no match in the drive. JUJU BUG raced inside, then had a mild late bid for the show.
ROYAL TO BE dueled outside of TIZWAY FOREVER and then both gave way in the stretch.
