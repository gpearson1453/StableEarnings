Footnotes
CHAKRA chased the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the leader near the eighth pole then drove
clear. VARTON set the pace from the outset while clearing very early, continued on a clear advantage through the turn, was caught by the winner near the
eighth pole then no match for that one while keeping on to be well clear of the show finisher. QUEEN BRIDGET was in the two path through the turn when
near the back, bid into the lane from the three path and gained the show spot while never a threat. STYLISH RAGS chased the pace from the three path
through the turn then lacked a closing response while losing the show spot. CELESTIAL SPIN was well back while saving ground.

along the inside through the turn, dueled with the winner through late turn, continued with a short lead when joined by the top two then yielded. BOONE'S
SPIRIT tracked the pace from the two path through the far turn then lacked a response. VISERION ICE broke outward and bumped foe, then was outrun

TUFFER THAN TUFF rated on the lead while in the two path, was asked while straightening in the lane, cleared with an eighth to go then geared down late.
HIGHEST PRAISE was in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the six path, continued widest inside the eighth pole
then surged late. JENNSTONE saved ground while along the inside through the turn, came into the lane with a clear run with aim on the leader, could not
reel that one in but kept on to save the show spot. SENT FOR HIS GLORY raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane, moved off the rail and into
the two path and was closing in too late. TRUCKIN' ON pressed the winner from the three path through the turn and into the lane, was in the five path late
as a contender then weakened. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE saved ground throughout and offered a belated gain. WYMAN steadied near the half mile pole,
settled back into the turn and never was a threat. MELTDOWN never a factor while in the four path through the turn.

OCELIA raced in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then took command in the stretch under mild urging while gearing down approaching the wire.
WHATS UP SWEETS stalked the pace inside, bid on the far turn but was no match for the winner. KHOSEA led inside early, then stalked the pace but had
no late bid. CROSSED THE LINE pressed the early pace in the five path, bid for the lead, then couldn't hold off the closers. BIA BOLT RUNNER was not a
factor. OXBOWINDY pressed the early pace between rivals, then gave way.

Footnotes
DIAMOND SOLITAIRE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then drew off and held sway, winning handily. ELUSIVE JUSTICE
dueled outside of the leader, bid at the quarter but was no match for the winner. NOBLE PRIZE was off awkwardly, then raced evenly. CECIL'S ANGEL
dueled inside of a foe, then gave way the stretch. BACKHAND stalked inside before fading.
