Footnotes
UNION BROTHER tracked in behind the leaders just outside that pair, went three to four wide on the turn commencing a bid, lugged in a bit once in upper
stretch but in control, drew clear and was geared down late. PLEASE THE COURT lacked early speed, moved out five wide heading into the turn, angled in
once past a rival at the quarter pole, came back out in upper stretch, ran on evenly to secure the place. NICE WORK was forwardly-placed inside on or just
off the rail, dueled inside a foe through the turn, weakened in the stretch. CANDY WOMPUS pursued the leaders going five wide on the turn, failed to rally.
STRYDER raced outside rivals, went six wide on the turn, passed tired foes in the stretch. LEATHERNECK saved ground on or just off the rail through the
turn, appeared to be getting in a bit in the stretch, failed to make a bid. DISCREET TIGER was forwardly-positioned, dueled outside a foe two to three wide
on the turn, came up empty. INDIAN DRAGON had very brief speed but was dropping back within the opening sixteenth, continued to move backward four
wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GEMSTONE GAL stalked from outside, moved to challenge three wide on the turn, faced a challenger from outside in NOVA STAR leaving the turn, drifted
six wide into upper stretch, turned back that foe and edged clear late under steady handling. NOVA STAR switched out heading up the backstretch to stalk
in behind the leaders three wide, moved out four wide on the turn to commence a mild bid, came into upper stretch seven deep, was outkicked.
SELECTION PARK settled at the rear, advanced past rivals four then five wide on the turn, continued evenly in the stretch to improve position. NEW
YEARS GIRL was forwardly-placed to vie for the lead inside through the turn, weakened thereafter. SARA'S MEMORIES went two to three wide on the turn,
improved position. RANGER MOLLY vied between runners, began to drop back two wide leaving the turn and came up empty. EBB AND FLOW was ridden
along but devoid of speed, raced in the four path on the turn and was not a threat. QUICK TO FUSS showed brief speed among the leaders, steadily
dropped back two wide leaving the backstretch, was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
DESERTROSE OFTEXAS set the early pace in the clear racing off the fence, was challenged late on the turn racing in the two path, headed in the stretch
but dug in gamely to regain command nearing the wire. STREAMING TIGER steadied on heels soon after the start, switched out and advanced three wide
on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch but was outfinished. VANNA settled off the leaders mid-pack, went two then three wide on the turn,
captured show honors while no real threat to the top pair. CLOSING TIME CUTIE was quite reluctant to load, shifted in early, tracked from inside,
weakened. WILLSHERWONTSHE saved ground on then just off the rail on the turn, came out in the stretch and was not a threat. SPEED SEAL was just a
bit restless in the gate, stumbled at the start, raced mostly three to four wide and was not a threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
STREAMING TIGER AGAINST DESERTROSE OFTEXAS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

I AM ALLTHATYOUARE tracked the early leader then moved up inside but just off the fence to engage on the turn, dueled in upper stretch, edged clear.
BRAZILIAN SUMMER set the early tempo from off the rail, went two to three wide on the turn, dueled into mid-stretch and was outkicked. TESTING THE
WATERS was mid-pack early, moved up from off the inside two to three wide on the turn, drifted a bit in the lane but kept on. TOX angled in leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch and gained mildly. GRANDPA A. C. raced off the early leaders, moved in from four to three
wide on the turn then came in further once in upper stretch, ran on mildly. TALKIN MALICE bumped and steadied at the start, switched out well off the
inside, went five wide on the turn and ran on evenly. FULL SUN bumped and checked at the start spotting the field many lengths, raced on or just off the
inside and was not a threat. IMPUTED chased the leader briefly in the early going, dropped back four wide on the turn and came up empty. KICK IT chased
briefly from outside, went five wide on the turn drifting eight deep into upper stretch and came up empty. REAL MASTER (FR) lacked early speed, went six

SOUTHERN SUMMER attended the pace from outside, moved in from four to three wide on the turn to duel, edged away in late stretch under steady
handling. SMOOTH BLUES was urged at the break, dueled inside the winner, settled for second best. NOW PLAYING settled off the leaders while shifting
in, saved ground on the turn, came out in late stretch and got up for show honors. WESTERN SMOKE stalked the top pair going three to four wide, ran
evenly and lost third. LINCOLN COUNTY KID raced outside mid-pack, went four wide on the turn and carried on evenly. RIO CUTIE shifted in early, saved
ground chasing inside on then just off the rail through the turn, came up empty. TIZ A SLAYER was off slowly, switched well off the inside going in the four
to five path on the turn. VEIW FROM THE BAY chased mid-pack, went two to three wide on the turn, faded. FARMER FRED R F was well-distanced, eased
through the lane, walked off.
