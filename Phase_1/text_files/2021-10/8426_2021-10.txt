Footnotes
SAVING ARGUMENT went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. GIANT INFLUENCE pressed the pace, saved ground, proved
no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ANTIETAM ROAD was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a late kick and was a clear
third at the wire. HERO OF THE HOUR raced within striking distance, came around the second turn three wide, put forth an even effort and lacked a rally.
ICE CRUSH raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was no factor. MR. UNUSUAL void of early speed and showed little. LIAM SKYE lacked early
speed, had an outside trip and was never a threat.

SHE IS A BLING unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the second turn, racing three wide, rallied down the lane and drove clear
before the wire. BE A BANDIT raced within striking distance, made a bid around the final turn, took the lead, but couldn't match strides with the winner deep
in the stretch. LEA'S PRINCESS brushed at the start, vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a late kick. SHOP
AROUND raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. ALL IN BRONSON broke in, brushed rival and was never close. CAVATICA dueled for the
early lead, saved ground and dropped back.
