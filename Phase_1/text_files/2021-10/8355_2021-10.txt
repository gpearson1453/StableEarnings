Footnotes
BUSTIN PIETRE came away in good order, showed good speed, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch and drew off while kept to the task. RAW COURAGE chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner in
the stretch and was clearly second best. VISION BOARD hit the inside of the gate at the start, raced well back while ridden along on the outside, went four
wide on the turn and just got up for the show. WORKINGMAN'S DUDE was a bit reluctant to load, chased the pace on the inside, bumped soundly with
HEADS OR TAILS outside the sevens-sixteenths then checked, saved ground into the stretch and came up empty. SILVER SAMURAI chased the pace
down the backstretch, raced between foes entering the turn, went three then four wide on that bend and tired. HOT STEPPER was urged along while well
back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. HEADS OR TAILS raced just off the pace, departed the backstretch between horses, bumped
with WORKINGMAN'S DUDE outside the seven-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail shortly thereafter and capitulated. ILLUMINATO broke a
step slow, was urged along off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CREA'S BKLYN LAW chased inside briefly before tipping two to three wide at the rear of the field, went four wide through the far turn under light coaxing
from the half mile pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid to close in on the embattled top pair to strike the front
in the final strides to the finish. SUMMER BOURBON coaxed from the gate, chased briefly three wide before tucking to the two path settling in closest aim of
the leader, advanced through the turn placed to coaxing from the three-eighths latching on the leader to engage that rival in a duel nearing the quarter pole,
spun just off the inside for home leaning on his main foe before straightening away, dug in head to head under a right side crop and was nudged outwards
by ARISTOCRATIC before coming inwards to place that rival briefly in tight near the sixteenth pole, emerged with the lead inside that station and was
caught in the final jumps to the finish. ARISTOCRATIC coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under pressure midway on
the turn from the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got leaned on by that rival and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug
in under threat under a left hand crop and came out slightly nudging his main danger nearing the eighth pole, had that rival come inwards and was placed
briefly in tight near the sixteenth marker and headed for command, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. WIN WITH PRIDE
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made mild gain on the embattled front to the finish.
CONFECTIONER bobbled at the break under coaxing, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and
faltered.

COLD HARD CASH became keen while taken under a snug hold early, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead
into upper stretch, jostled with ABAAN at the three-sixteenths, battled outside into the final furlong, bumped with ABAAN outside the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under strong urging. ABAAN went to the front, showed the way near the hedge, was asked inside the three-eighths, lost the advantage into upper
stretch, jostled with COLD HARD CASH at the three-sixteenths, battled inside that foe into the final furlong, bumped with COLD HARD CASH outside the
sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while clear for the place. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) became keen when taken under a tight hold early, was
reserved under snug restraint on the inside, came out some leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path on the final turn, was roused
at the five-sixteenths, pursued the top two in the stretch and finished with good courage for the show. QUID went around the first turn in the two path, settled
towards the rear, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. SHORE MAGIC went three
wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, traveled two to three wide on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. DUST
DEVIL was taken in hand early, went three wide under restraint around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide on the final
turn and failed to respond. MR. FIDGET tugged hard at the bit under a tight hold early then was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn,
shifted three wide into the stretch and had nothing left. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS dropped behind early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back,
went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
SLIPSTREAM got bumped between BIZ BIZ BUZZ and KAVOD after the start and was jostled between them growing rank under restraint as READY TO
MARCH tucked safely in front, had BIZ BIZ BUZZ tip out from the inside and rated unkindly off that rival's heels being forced to steady near the five-eighths
marker, chased briefly three wide settling better at the tail of the field before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
briefly paused slipping inside of MIDNIGHT WORKER, cut the corner into upper stretch roused, rallied tipping to the two path near the eighth pole as RUN
CURTIS RUN came inside to the rail, offered up a good kick to collar that rival inside the final sixteenth edging away to the finish in the final jumps. RUN
CURTIS RUN coaxed from the gate, dueled to the inside of READY TO MARCH from the get go, began to shake off that rival placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive drifting in to the rail a furlong out, dug in under threat and was caught in the final
strides to the wire in a good effort. BIZ BIZ BUZZ had the left side stall door ricochet back and was struck by it at the start, raced briefly inside bumping and
jostling with SLIPSTREAM just after the start before tipping to the two path just safely in front forcing that rival to steady five furlongs from home, settled in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MIDNIGHT WORKER
chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share.
POPPY FLOWER four then three wide in pursuit, began to advance placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths and bid into contention swinging three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. CHI TOWN LADY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three
wide down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. KAVOD bumped and
jostled with SLIPSTREAM just after the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
READY TO MARCH dueled three then two wide with RUN CURTIS RUN to his inside, got shaken off under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, went three
wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HOBOKEN JACK got brushed between foes at the start who each broke his way, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command narrowly swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and
held safe to prevail. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES broke in at the start brushing the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. EL VEINTICUATRO bumped at the start by
EMPIRE STATION, who broke outwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the get go, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild bid. EMPIRE STATION broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned rival, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. JUST JEREMY hustled from the gate intent on the lead, showed the way coaxed along in
the two path, tucked inside through the turn coming under increasing threat to the outside, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then
weakened in the final furlong. KONG LOVES A FIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide for home and offered no response. PHOEBE'S FROSTY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home and tired. LIGHT WORK stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. RED ROCK BAY broke out at
the start brushing HOBOKEN JACK, chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
SACRED LIFE (FR) was reserved towards the rear while traveling in mostly the two path, remained well back through the final turn, was roused at the
quarter-pole, rallied in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up at the wire. FIELD PASS was hustled to the lead, showed the way on the inside
through solid fractions, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, turned back TEMPLE into the final sixteenth, led
determinedly to the final jump but was denied while clear for the place. TEMPLE was asked some early then taken in hand, raced in third position while
rated on the inside, ranged up when let out on the far turn then moved to the two path, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, fought outside the runner-up under
a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. CORELLI broke a step slow, saved ground under restraint on the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and improved position but missed the trifecta. NO
WORD moved in early, settled on the outside while two to three wide, shifted five wide outside the five-sixteenths and gained late but failed to impact.
BREAKING THE RULES was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick. L'IMPERATOR (FR) tossed his head while keen under restraint on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the
field, saved ground on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch and failed to rally. EN WYE CEE was urged some
early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, dropped back while three then four wide on the final turn and had nothing left. EPIC
BROMANCE tracked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked on the final turn, chased four wide into the stretch and capitulated.
