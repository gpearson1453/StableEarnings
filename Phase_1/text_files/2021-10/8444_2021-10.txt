NO HARBOR IN SIGHT stalked the pacesetters, began bid nearing the quarter pole, rallied four wide into the stretch and prevailed under a drive. SIR
BRONX fanned three wide leaving the opening turn, prompted the pace through the backstretch, gained a slim advantage into the lane and was out
finished. WHERE'S THE GOLD fractious in gate, raced at the back of the pack and closed gradually. EZEKIEL contended the early pace, dueled into the
final turn and faded into the stretch. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE tracked outside and tired.

DANCE SHOES prompted the early pace under a snug hold, obtain the lead willingly at the three eighths pole, drew clear and was kept to task under
intermittent encouragement. SANGRIA set a pressure pace from just off the rail, was overtaken into the far turn, continued on determinedly but could not
reach the eventual winner. BABS DELIGHT tracked the pacesetters from rail and chased through stretch in vain. IT'S ALEXUS raced in second flight and
was unable to improve position in drive. FLY AWAY fractious in gate, hit gate leaving, raced a back of the pack then tired early and was eased, walked off.

sixteenth pole and got up in the final yards. EL DORADO STORM dueled for the early lead, led the field leaving the backstretch, saw margins diminish
quickly nearing the stretch, drifted out bumping into WICKED FORTITUDE and was bested late. BOLSANO trailed the field, rallied belatedly earning show
honors. MY LUCKY MARK stalked the pacesetters from the three path and flattened. RISING REVOLUTION showed good inside speed then opted to sit
just of the pace from off the rail and was caught late. STAPLETON lacked bid. *TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to a timer

REGAL MAX took quick control of the pace, saved ground while showing the way through the far turn, responded to looming threat from GO AWAY and
held safely. GO AWAY tracked five wide, drove three to four wide into the lane, drifted inward under left handed encouragement, was all out through the
stretch but could not reach the winner. SLEW'S BAK brushed inside rival leaving, tracked the pacesetters from the four path, drove three wide into the final
turn, steadied at the three sixteenth pole and gave way. CHA CHING saved ground from rail, lodged a rail bid and weakened. SOLARITY brushed leaving,
sat in striking distance, went in pursuit of the leader into the far turn and wilted into the lane. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of
SLEW'S BAK against the rider of GO AWAY alleging interference near the three sixteenth pole, was not allowed.

Footnotes
SET TO SHINE stalked the pace, picked up the chased near the quarter pole, rallied determinedly while four wide into the stretch and drove clear deep
stretch. DRILLER tracked outside through the backstretch, hustled four wide in the final turn, rallied outside and got up just in time for place. SOLO RING
engaged in a close chase through the backstretch, gained a slim advantage into the lane and weakened late stretch. HARD TO COME HOME dueled
outside of EL NOBLE for the early lead, took pressure inside of SOLO RING through the final turn and gave way inside in stretch. TAP MASTER reared
leaving, chased from rail through the backstretch and closed late. EL NOBLE contested the early pace inside, was unable to move on with rivals nearing the
quarter pole and faded steadily. WAR GIANT never reached contention.

MACHINE gained closer order quickly leaving the backstretch, drove between rivals at the head of the stretch then dug in late and won the nod.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER tracked four wide under snug hold, overtook the lead at the three eighths pole, drew clear into the lane and was nipped at the
wire. PADDYSDAYCHARM hustled leaving the chute, lacked running room in the backstretch, swung out at the quarter pole, bid four wide into the stretch
and evened out late. DOC COPE chased into the backstretch and bid steadily outside late. FOOT SOLDIER sat just off the pace while three wide, dropped
back in the last turn and gave way. BUCK WEST lacked a serious bid. WEDGE POND led the field through the backstretch, was overtaken and retreated
along the rail. BURNING LOVE last away and never reached contention. MARIA'S SONG sat in range from the three path and lacked a response when
called upon.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK settled inside, angled out to the two path in the far turn, bid steadily through the stretch, drove between rivals in the final sixteenth and
prevailed under a drive. THESHACK sat in striking position, went in pursuit of TORIADOR nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch and
was second best in the dash to the finish. TORIADOR sped to the front under a strong hold then led the field throughout the backstretch, saw advantage
dwindle nearing the stretch and was collared late stretch. AT ATTENTION raced wide entering the backstretch, bid steadily outside into the stretch, was
gaining on rivals late but missed. DUNE D'ORO chased the pacesetters four wide and was unable to threaten in the drive. ASTRONOMICAL never far back
early and faded steadily inside. MY COLLEGE FUND offered little. BANG ON chased four wide and yielded into stretch. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of ASTRONOMICAL against the rider of GREEK GEEK alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
J. CRUZ sped clear leaving the chute, showed the way through the final turn, responded to looming threat at the head of the stretch and held safely.
BONANZA CREEK chased through the far turn, bid steadily through traffic at the head of the stretch and held on for place honors. OUR MONEY CAT saved
inside leaving the backstretch, drove four wide then stayed on with game effort and missed for runner up. DARE TO GO raced in closest pursuit early,
rallied three wide into the lane and flattened in stretch. TINY TYCOON checked, hustled through the final turn, swung out and bid evenly through stretch.
BEAR BRIAN raced in close quarters inside then checked, angled outside leaving the backstretch and offered a late mild bid. MOON FEVER chased
outside early, went in pursuit of the leader from the three eighths and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. SILVER PRAIRIE clipped heels in traffic,
trailed the field and retreated. FLAT OUT LEADER reserved off the pace, raced four wide into the far turn, bid outside turning for home and yielded.
BLAZING CHANNING chased outside leaving the backstretch and faded steadily. CODE OF THE WEST brushed BEAR BRIAN into the backstretch and
was outrun. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but made no change.
