Footnotes
DURKIN'S CALL broke in and brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths then moved
to the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead while still traveling on his inside lead coming to the furlong marker, swapped to the proper
lead at that point, kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and widened under steady urging. SICILIA MIKE was hustled from the start then urged along off
the pace, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid near the three-sixteenths, vied outside into
the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. I LOVE JAXSON was ridden along at the rear, went four then three wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, dropped in under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. BINKSTER
bumped with a rival at the start, moved out under urging while falling behind the leading duo, raced in the two path for most of the turn, shifted four wide at
the five-sixteenths, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner before the furlong marker and tired. DARK MONEY disputed
the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. DREAM BIGGER bumped with a foe at the
start while brushing with another, contested the pace towards the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
VIVIDLY (GB) tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped to the two path half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong with good energy to knock heads with SINGLE SOUL
through the final sixteenth and was just up on the wire. SINGLE SOUL (GB) tracked the pace along the inside, got set down angled three wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat knocking heads to the finish and was nailed on the line. BASELINE DRIVE
three then two wide through the first turn, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive very briefly pausing for one stride near the sixteenth marker as SINGLE SOUL came
out safely in front and ran on to secure the show honors. DOUBLE BLESSED three then two wide through the opening bend, tracked two to three wide
down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major
share. TRAFFIC SONG a bit rank under restraint four wide into the first turn, tucked three then two wide through that bend settling in closest aim of the
leader, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking over narrow
command, dug in between foes nearing the eighth pole and was displaced just inside that station, then weakened in the late stages. FEDERALIST PAPERS
tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped two then three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG BAD DIVA established the front and showed the way in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge for the initial time, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded the front
straightened away, dug in fighting on to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of BASELINE DRIVE
alleging interference in the stretch against SINGLE SOUL which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared
official. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

around the quarter-pole, moved closer to the rail in upper stretch and finished willingly while second best. TWIST JUST RIGHT set the pace under pressure

wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive getting geared down and taken in hand inside the final sixteenth to the finish. SWEETER broke in hitting
the near side stall and was away slow, chased three then two wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. HEY IT'S TATI stumbled at the start and was bumped by BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL, who broke
outwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and tired while along for the show
honors. CAUSE TO DREAM three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

SWEET FRANNY LU established a forward position in the four path around the opening turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, ranged up in the three
path on the far turn, took the lead coming to the five-sixteenths then dropped to the two path while moving clear, responded well when set down into upper
stretch, came under a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and was fully extended to
last under strong handling. COMMAND POINT dropped to the three path on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three then four wide on the far
turn, moved closer late on that bend, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while able to get
the place. CLADDAGH'S RUN was reserved on the outside while three to four wide, moved closer passing the five-sixteenths, was roused into the stretch,
rallied in the final furlong and closed well but missed while able to get the show. OCEAN AIR settled off the pace, saved ground while moving closer early on
the far turn, shifted to the two path in front of foes at the five-sixteenths, came between horses outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch
and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta. EXOTIC WEST was reserved in the two to three path, moved closer on the far turn, had her path taken by
OCEAN AIR at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in while gaining coming to the sixteenth-pole, steadied while lacking
room at that point then altered to the outside and finished well but lost her best chance. SWEET MISSION angled to the rail on the first turn, settled on the
inside, was roused while moving closer on the far turn, came out into the stretch and failed to respond. LINNY KATE went four wide around the opening
bend, settled off the pace, was asked while two to three wide on the far turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. MAGNETIQUE
went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead nearing the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail while falling back
near the quarter-pole and faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF EXOTIC WEST CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST OCEAN AIR ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. MILE FRACTION
WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to the two path at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, got roused with
three-sixteenths to go and overthrew the front near the eighth pole, quickly drew clear under hand urging and was geared down through the final sixteenth to
the finish. STOLEN HOLIDAY got bumped at the start by JADES GELLY and in turn bumped MAGISTERIUM, attended the leader to the outside in the two
path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, proved no match for the top one while running on to just prevail in the
battle for the place honors. RIVENDELL just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. SCREAMIN' BY broke out at the start, saved
ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing tipped two then three wide at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to the finish. HARPER'S IN CHARGE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down taking the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in and was displaced from the front nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. THRILL chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened. JADES GELLY broke in at the start bumping STOLEN
HOLIDAY into MAGISTERIUM, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped three wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. SPARKLING SKY four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) got bumped at the start by STOLEN HOLIDAY due to pressure from JADES GELLY, who broke inwards,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. HALF-MILE TIME ADDED AFTER VIDEO

Footnotes
NEWBOMB displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch, jostled with that while fighting gamely in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. COST BASIS
tracked the pace on the outside, moved up three then two wide on the turn to make a bid, was asked near the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in
the stretch, jostled with that foe in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. T LOVES A FIGHT settled off the pace, was taken in hand while
off heels and paused near the seven-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail before the five-sixteenths and finished willingly against the rail to just
get the show. ANSWER IN settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch
and also finished willingly but just missed the show. DRAFTED angled in while settling off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three
wide into the stretch, moved further out while lacking room at that point, continued to lack room until outside the sixteenth-pole, steadied in the process then
altered to the outside and gained to just miss the superfecta. MR PHIL settled off the pace, was taken up some outside the nine-sixteenths then dropped
back, went four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) was rated just
off the heels of the leader on the inside, saved ground on the turn and tired. ALWAYS SUNSHINE broke a bit slow then was taken up, moved up on the
outside under urging, chased four then three wide on the turn and came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
MYHARTBLONGSTODADY forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn, showed the way narrowly under rating early on before being
displaced by CARA'S DREAMER into the backstretch, tucked inside and tracked that leader in closest aim, tipped to the two path half a mile from home and
advanced on the front coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from
home, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish to prevail. ICE PRINCESS broke out at the start and was bumped by CARA'S DREAMER coming
inwards and was briefly in tight between foes under a hold before being off heels off a pair of rivals and clipped the back of CARA'S DREAMER, raced just
off the inside through the first turn at the tail of the field, went three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on with late energy to secure the place honors. CARA'S DREAMER got clipped
behind after the start by the aforementioned foe, went two then three wide through the first turn advancing quickly to sweep past the leaders seizing
command with six and a half furlongs to go, tucked to the inside five furlongs from home slipping away briefly, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut
the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was displaced a furlong out, then kept on to preserve the show honors. TWO CENT TOOTSIE two to
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced to the finish. PECATONICA
forwardly placed along the inside, raced under rating heads apart for command along the inside, then stayed one paced as MYHARTBLONGSTODADY
quickened a bit as CARA'S DREAMER made a three wide run to the lead, tracked along the inside before briefly tipping to the two path five furlongs from
home, tucked back inside through the far turn coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no kick.
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS got brushed just after the start, grew a bit rank under rating along the inside into the first turn before tracking two to three wide
down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no headway.

and prevailed under strong urging. YARROW bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, waited passing the

place. CITIZEN K was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, settled near the back, went three wide on the turn, swung six
wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy to just miss the place while clear for the show. ATHENRY was reserved on the

bend, was driven six wide into the stretch and improved position. WAR SMOKE tracked the pace down the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn,
made a bid near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive while between foes into the final furlong and weakened. B C GLORY DAYS was sent hard from the
start then well placed just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
tired. ZAP MAN broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
HERONEANDONLY disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn and capitulated. REMEMBERMOM broke in and bumped

response. SUIT OF ARMOR was brushed in the hindquarters after the start, settled on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into
