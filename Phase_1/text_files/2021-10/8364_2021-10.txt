MY MAE DAY fired on the turn wresting the lead in the two path upper stretch edging away on the inside. BIG CHICKEN MAN hustled out made the lead
edging clear on the turn, engaged from the inside in upper stretch proved no match holding on to salvage place. MACHINIST raced evenly saving ground to
upper stretch outbidding the others from the rail. TAURUS C a step slow through the turn raced four wide down the lane. TALE OF KANTHAROS pressed
then chased on the turn weakening in upper stretch. CONQUEST HARLANDAY slow early tired to upper stretch.
