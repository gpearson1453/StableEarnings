inched closer three wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was outfinished. ROGALLO failed to respond. KULP trailed, stopped in

through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch, the rider lost his whip nearing the furlong marker then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
GIO SAMMY broke in front, set the pace to the top of the stretch along the inside then was outfinished. DON'T MATTER had speed from the start, moved
closer three wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. EKATI CHAMPAGNE close up, failed to respond. BATTLE RAGS had speed into the turn then
