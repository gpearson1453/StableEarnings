MADELEINE MUST (FR) brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on willingly to cut into the winner's margin to the finish while clear for the place honors. HONEY CAKE
(IRE) showed the way under rating three then two wide patiently handled until set down spinning along the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SOSUA three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. TOO MUCH TIP lunged at the
break getting away last and conceding two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased briefly inside and then two to three wide, got placed
to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NOW YUS CANT LEAVE was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then shifted five wide,
rallied into upper stretch, chased the runner-up determinedly into the final sixteenth and got up gamely late to prevail under strong handling.
SYNONYMOUS was reserved on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead in the three path
into the stretch, responded well under threat from several foes, led until the final strides but was denied while just able to get the place.
PEACEBETHEJOURNEY was reserved in the back half of the field, moved closer while shifting from the four to six path on the far turn, rallied into upper
stretch, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and finished willingly but missed while narrowly able to get the show. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS was
taken under stout restraint early then reserved near the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into
the final furlong and finished with good energy but just missed the trifecta. BALINESE was rated off the pace, was let out three wide on the far turn, made a
bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished. SALINO
was rated just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, came under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. EXOTIC
CAT dropped back at the start, was reserved at the rear of the field, traveled around the far turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to rally. DEAREST KITTEN was rated just off the
pace, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rail into the stretch and tired. LITTLE NUTTER rushed up to take the lead, set the pace
while in hand, was let out along the rail on the far turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
FENWAY coaxed from the gate, showed the way just off the inside in hand, shook away through the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch,
went clear to the eighth pole under his own power, saw his margin cut into while comfortably coasting home in hand through to the finish. SCHERZANDO
veered out at the start brushing FORTY COMETS and was corrected sharply, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while making some gain late on that in
hand rival while under a full drive. FORTY COMETS brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe veering outwards, chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and kept on to secure
the show honors. STONECOLDWARRIOR broke in at the start taking over the lane of THE GREAT GAZOO, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. THE GREAT GAZOO got briefly steadied at the start when STONECOLDWARRIOR
took over his lane, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. KADEN coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from midway on the
turn, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

ANNAPOLIS tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch on even terms with the runner-up, dueled gamely with that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong
handling. PORTFOLIO COMPANY went to the front, showed the way on the inside through moderate fractions, was asked while on even terms with
ANNAPOLIS at the quarter-pole, dueled gamely inside that foe in the stretch and just missed while well clear for second. LIMITED LIABILITY bumped with a
rival at the start, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, moved off the rail under the crop in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. DOCTOR JEFF bumped with an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, was asked while two then three wide
on the turn and came up empty.

between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive dueling through the final furlong taking command
steps from the finish but was nailed on the wire. WICKED FAST three then two wide in aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in under threat dueling through the final eighth getting headed in the final strides when fighting on to the
end inside a pair of rivals. GREAT BRITAIN three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
stayed on one paced to the finish. EXCLUSIVE ORDER just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing tucked inside at the five-sixteenths,
spun two to three wide for home and offered no response. BLUE DEJA VU showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, came under urging at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. INDIA TIGER chased three then
four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, shied out under a near side stick forcing REGAL EMPIRE to alter out a
furlong out, then weakened to the finish. REGAL EMPIRE chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide into
upper stretch, altered out a furlong from home as INDIA TIGER shied out, then tired to the finish. LOOKING TO HEAVEN chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. FLATBUSH tracked the pace along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. REGHITTO veered in at the start growing rank and detached at the tail of the field when sluggish,

Footnotes
PRINCESS FAWZIA tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just
inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held on to prevail. GIGGLE FACTORY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued three wide for home, closed well and missed at the wire. GAMBLING CAT three wide in pursuit in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, lugged in straightened away bumping ALBA'S STAR into NO DOWN DAYS taking over command narrowly,
then got corrected forcing MIRABELL MEI to steady off her heels just as she was displaced from the front, righted herself and kept on to secure the show
honors. MORE GOOD TIMES chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered up a mild
kick. MIRABELL MEI chased along the insdie from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, steadied off the
heels of GAMBLING CAT at the eighth pole, and altered over the heels of that rival but was unable to recover to the finish. LADY FATIMA chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered no response. KITTEN'S ROMANCE two to three wide near the rear
of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no rally. ALBA'S STAR just off the inside in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home, got bumped by GAMBLING CAT and in turn bumped NO DOWN
DAYS with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the late stages. COWORTH PARK chased along the inside from the rear of the field, tipped out four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide for home and made no impact. NO DOWN DAYS showed the way rated along the inside, cut the
corner roused, yielded the front and was bumped by ALBA'S STAR due to pressure from GAMBLING CAT lugging in, then weakened. POSITIVE SKEW
saved ground near the rear of the field under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and never got involved.

Footnotes
MY SISTER NAT (FR) went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, moved closer while asked three wide on the far turn, rallied to the
lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong and powered home under steady handling. ORGLANDES (FR) was last to commence, jostled
the hindquarters of SISTER OTOOLE after the start then was taken up, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused while moving from the
two path to the four path on the final turn and finished willingly for the place. ALWAYS SHOPPING went to the front, set the pace on the inside through slow
fractions, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead in upper stretch, droppped back into the final furlong and was outfinished then just lost the place
but earned the show. SISTER OTOOLE was jostled in the hindquarters after the start and paused, became a bit keen early, saved ground while reserved of
the pace, was roused on the final turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BEAUTIFUL LOVER was reserved in the middle
of the field in the two path, came under urging on the far turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. CALL
ME LOVE (GB) stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up
empty. LOVELY LUCKY was keen under restraint early then rated just off the pace on the inside, continued to save ground on the far turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths and also came up empty. THE MILE FRACTION AND THE MILE AND A QUARTER FRACTION WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMING

ECHO ZULU established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under some pressure into the turn, made her
way to the inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to
just inside the sixteenth marker, then finished in hand to the wire. GERRYMANDER prompted the pace from the outside four then three wide, tucked to the
two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the
top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. A MO REAY bobbled at the break, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, then got forced to steady inside the three-eighths as FROSTY BREW tucked inwards, came under coaxing once more and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. MAGIC CIRCLE four then three wide in pursuit from just off the
pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SAUCY LADY T veered out at the
start bumping HOT FUDGE, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. JESTER
CALLS NOJOY bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide being taken in hand when pulling with six and a half furlongs to go, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. HOT FUDGE bumped at the start by SAUCY LADY T, who veered out, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. JUMEIRAH chased three then four wide
under a ride from three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. FROSTY BREW lunged at the start, chased along the inside, tipped to the
two path into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tucked inwards and forced A MO REAY to steady just inside the three-eighths pole,
swung three to four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
JUDGE N JURY was rated just off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide near the three-eighths, gained into upper stretch, took the
lead outside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady urging. BRONX BOMBER hit the outside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe,
settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner.
RIVER DOG settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, brushed with a foe in upper stretch and improved position to just miss the place but
earned the show. MARKET ALERT was bumped soundly at the start, settled on the outside, was urged four wide early on the turn then carried six wide
around the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. STEAM ENGINE stumbled at the start but came out in
front, showed the way on a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked turning into the stretch, lost the lead to the winner before the
furlong marker and weakened. POWER UP PAYNTER broke a step slow, saved ground at the rear of the field and failed to threaten. SARATOGA PAL
raced towards the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. JUST RIGHT broke in and bumped soundly
with a foe, settled on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. GANDY DANCING bumped with a foe at
the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor. BLUE GATOR tracked the pace down the backstretch,
chased three wide early on the turn then floated five wide around the three-eighths, dropped back into upper stretch, clipped heels while put in tight around
the three-sixteenths and faltered.
