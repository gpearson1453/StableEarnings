Footnotes
TESUQUE was settled while inside on the backstretch, was moving up and saving ground into the far turn behind a wall of horses, waited for a clearing in
upper stretch and slipped through the inside to be in a strong drive and proved best in a perfect ride. THE ONE FOR FUN was allowed to settled then rallied
on the far turn while five wide, made a strong bid to late stretch and was a game second in the end. TAYLOR'S VISION set a pressured pace while inside,
was in a long drive and dug in gamely but weakened in late stretch. IMA SKYWALKER stalked the pace while four wide on the backstretch, made a bid on
the far turn to mid stretch then flattened out in the drive. RIVER LIBERTY was well placed while three wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn making
a bid then faltered in the stretch drive. LOVELY LOLITA pressed the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn and was in a long drive
but faltered in the stretch. MATTEA was unhurried early and outrun.
