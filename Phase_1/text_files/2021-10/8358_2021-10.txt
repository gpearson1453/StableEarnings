Footnotes
HIGH YIELD KITTEN dueled two wide throughout the race and narrowly prevailed. AWESOME FAMILY dueled inside of HIGH YIELD KITTEN throughout
and just missed in a game try. ATTENTI MANDATORY was in range two wide, could not gain on the top two while frequently swishing his tale through the
final quarter-mile and bested the rest. SHIPWRECK failed to menace while racing three wide. GILDED ASSET steadied midway down the backstretch,
saved ground and never threatened. CARROTS OR CARATS was off slow, made good progress inside down the backstretch, appeared to try to jump
something entering the turn, was eased from there and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE
TURN AND CONCLUDED THAT CARROTS OR CARATS CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE.

Footnotes
BRIGHT AND SHINY pressed MAMA LONGLEGS from outside to the turn, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, and prevailed after a long, hard drive.
BORDEAUX LEGACY stayed close early, slipped through on the rail to reach contention turning for home, battled through the stretch on her left lead and
just missed. DRIVING WIND bumped with MARIAHS CHRISTMAS at the start, steadied along behind a wall of horses early, got taken to the far outside
midway up the backstretch, gained rapidly entering the turn, came five wide looming outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, and weakened late. MAMA
LONGLEGS set a pressured pace slightly off the inside, and was overtaken from both sides in deep stretch. BELLA SOFI pursued the front flight four wide
around the turn, and had no closing bid. BET ON DRAMA was no factor inside. AWESOME WINNA was skittish coming on the track and again during the
loading process, and never reached contention. MARIAHS CHRISTMAS bumped with DRIVING WIND at the start, and was always far back. SHE
DOESN'T KNOW spotted the field two to three lengths at the break, and showed little. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW was finished early toward the inside.

PEARLESCENT settled in range inside, moved up two wide between foes around the far turn, seized command turning for home and drew off under a drive.
GENERIC MARK prompted the pace under a hold in the three path around the first turn, vied two wide down the backstretch, briefly cleared near the
five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner but held clear for the place. NOBLE INTENTIONS tracked the pace two and three wide between foes and
lacked the needed rally. CODRINGTON chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. RAIN set a firmly rated pace inside and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
EXAMINER grabbed the early lead, put daylight on UNMATCHABLE soon after completing a quarter-mile, widened around the turn inside, dug in through
the stretch on his left lead and had enough to stay clear. GRAN CASIQUE broke a step slow, put in a good run along the rail through the latter part of the
turn, shifted to the two-path with aim outside EXAMINER into the stretch, stayed on his left lead and did not have enough while much best of the others.
HONOLULU EXPRESS chased three to four wide around the turn, and faded through the stretch. WHYRUAWESOME saved ground to the turn, moved out
three wide approaching the stretch, and had no rally. SHAKEM N BREAKEM broke slowly and was outrun early inside, came four wide off the turn and had
nothing. UNMATCHABLE briefly pressed EXAMINER from outside, stopped on the turn, and jogged in.

Footnotes
BALLYHOOLY raced four and five wide in midpack, moved to the front near the eighth pole and dug in to repel multiple late challenges. I SAID HEY chased
the pace four wide, tipped further out in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed. DALI'S HEART was bumped at the start, raced far back in the three
path, swung nine wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and closed with a rush. CURRENT CAUSE was off slow, saved ground off the
pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) was in range four wide, bid between foes in midstretch then flattened out late.
QUEEN CUPID failed to menace while racing two wide. MISS BLUEBIRD set the pace along the rail, settled back inside as CHECK THE GRADE cleared
midway around the turn, re-bid two wide in upper stretch, briefly led nearing the eighth pole then weakened through the final furlong. LINN PIER was outrun
inside. PRINCESS PUP was bumped at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. VELOCISSIMA had brief speed two wide and was vanned off.
CHECK THE GRADE had speed four wide, cleared leaving the three-eighths pole, angled in nearing the lane, stopped nearing the eighth pole, bled, was

Footnotes
KOZY DREAMS tracked the early pace from close range, ranged up outside DISTINCTLY BLUE to take over with five-sixteenths remaining, kicked clear
into the lane three or four paths off the rail and widened under a drive. GRACE'S DRAMA was outrun early, cut the corner finding her best stride turning for
home, moved off the rail past the eighth-pole and finished well. DISTINCTLY BLUE showed the way in the two-path going to the turn, moved to the rail
getting collared by the winner five-sixteenths out, could not match strides into the lane and gave way. TALE OF V K saved ground early, stayed in range
near the two-path coming off the turn, but lacked the needed closing response. FIERY PRINCESS chased outside DISTINCTLY BLUE early, and faded
before completing a half-mile. MISS MIAMI broke slowly, was taken off the inside up the backstretch, and made no impact. SALSA RITA raced three to four
wide, and retired after a half. MIGHTY ELECTRICA was finished early two wide.

ENDLESS FRONT settled off the pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid two wide into the far turn, reached even terms near the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside of VIVA LA RED from there to the wire, stayed on the left lead in the lane and prevailed. VIVA LA RED set the pace
along the rail, was headed leaving the five-sixteenths pole, dug in gamely inside, fought to the wire and just missed. VENTRILOQUIST was unhurried while
racing two wide early, advanced two wide around the far turn, loomed outside of the top two in the lane but was one-paced through the stretch. MAGNA
COLORS trailed inside, angled three wide nearing the lane and passed tiring rivals. LUCKY EMILIA was reluctant to load, was up close inside and faded
around the far turn. STARSHIP UNICA prompted the pace while rank and racing two wide, chased inside around the far turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
SOSOSUBTLE brushed with TIGER for several strides away from the gate, tracked the early leaders in the clear up the backstretch, advanced readily
around the turn closing the gap, drew alongside TIGER to challenge for command a quarter-mile out, brushed with that foe battling shoulder to shoulder
through the furlong grounds and took a hard-fought decision. TIGER brushed repeatedly with SOSOSUBTLE in the run away from the gate, vied early inside
THE RED MAN while attempting to get out, disposed of that one after a half-mile and cleared off around the turn, renewed acquaintances with
SOSOSUBTLE while getting out to the three-path at the top of the stretch, brushed with his nemesis near the eighth-pole, stayed on stubbornly inside foes
and saved the place. AMPERSAND was unhurried early, advanced through the middle stages three then four wide, moved to the far outside for the drive
and was closing in on the top two at the finish. NACHO PAPA gained mildly outside around the turn, came five wide into the lane and made no further
progress. DARK AGES was outrun for six furlongs near the inside, and passed only tired horses. KHOZY MY BOY moved out five wide past the
quarter-pole, and made no impact. THE RED MAN vied outside TIGER for a half, and retreated.

Footnotes
VICMAR pressed the pace three wide, took the lead three deep between foes near the quarter pole, dueled inside of CAN'T BE BROKEN from there to the
wire and prevailed. CAN'T BE BROKEN stalked the pace four wide, reached even terms outside of the winner near the quarter pole, dueled through the
lane and just missed. ROYAL BIZ was in tight at the start, raced in range three wide between foes, shifted further out in upper stretch, lugged in under
right-handed urging nearing the eighth pole, pushing FORTY FLASH into MINDSHIP Q's path, straightened out soon after and stayed on for the show.
FORTY FLASH bumped twice with SUPER TRIPLE at the start, was in range two wide, was forced inward in midstretch and weakened. NONA RAC failed
to menace while racing five wide. MINDSHIP Q raced off the pace four wide for three furlongs, angled to the two path near the quarter pole, was shut off
and forced to check near the eighth pole and had no further bids. SUPER TRIPLE bumped twice at the start with FORTY FLASH, steadied not long after,
raced three wide and never threatened. FULL SEND set a pressured pace two wide between foes and gave way near the quarter pole. FAKE I D disputed
the pace from the rail and tired nearing the lane. ASYMPTOMATIC (IRE) was outrun inside. CHIEFICIA steadied early, saved ground and made little
impact. THE RIDER OF FORTY FLASH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MINDSHIP Q FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE AND THE
RIDER OF MINDSHIP Q CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST ROYAL BIZ FOR THE SAME INCIDENT. THE STEWARDS DISMISSED THE FORMER CLAIM AND
UPHELD THE LATTER CLAIM, DISQUALIFYING ROYAL BIZ FROM THIRD AND PLACING HIM SIXTH FOR INTERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE.
