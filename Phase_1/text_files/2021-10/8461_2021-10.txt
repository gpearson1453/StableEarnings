Footnotes
COURAGEOUS GIRL was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path while asked around the
three-eighths, advanced forward to issue a challenge at the five-sixteenths, took over coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop in
upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole after being switched to a left-handed crop and widened under steady urging. FROST ME settled at the rear
of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, gained three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and was second best.
CARTWHEEL was hustled from the start, moved up to set the pace, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked under threat near the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner approaching the quarter-pole and tired while clear for the show. VALLARAND came outward at the break, showed early speed then
prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back under strong urging while two then three wide on the turn and retreated. PAY GRADE was urged early
then settled on the outside, dropped back three then four wide while ridden along on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH hustled from the gate, dueled briefly from the three path with HERALD ANGEL before conceding the front to that rival to track in
closest aim, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away
taking over command, edged clear under a drive to prevail. KHALI MAGIC chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch, rallied up the inside with a mild kick to secure the place honors. APPRECIATE coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in
pursuit just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. EMMA
AND I coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. HERALD ANGEL coaxed from the gate, dueled briefly with HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH to her outside before taking over sole possession of the front,
tucked inside through the turn coming under increasing pressure from that rival, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened
away and weakened in the final furlong. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide at
the head of the stretch and offered no response. SHINING COLORS chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn getting
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. LUCKY SITKA four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
FORCED RANKING was reluctant to load, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the turn, took a slim
advantage into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up to the sixteenth-pole then edged clear under good handling. FENWICK was well placed just
off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid at the three-sixteenths, fought inside of the winner to
the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while well clear for the place. DRAKON was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the
two path on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back between foes inside the three-sixteenths and
tired but held the show. CITIZEN MACK lacked speed under urging, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
DEBATE made contact with the inside of the gate at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and capitulated. CARPE'S
DREAM broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
COOL LAOBAN angled in while settling off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed
strongly to get up late. BUCKORTWO was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, pursued the
leader into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. SANDRONE settled just off the pace on
the outside, went three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, gained four wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, inched
away into the final furlong, led determinedly into the final strides but was denied while clear for the show. RED FORTRESS was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the last
spot in the superfecta. DEVIL OR ANGEL broke in at the start, was urged early then settled in the front half of the field, rounded the turn in the two path,
shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY LAST MISSION broke out and bumped with a foe, moved up under urging to be well
placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, came out into upper stretch and weakened. LORD BROWNIE was bumped on both sides at the start,
raced well off the pace under urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. CHIEF ENGINEER was
reluctant to load then went in with the use of a blindfold, broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, drew even in the two path on the turn, took a
short lead at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage in upper stretch and tired. HEZASTONECOLDFOX bobbled at the start and bumped with a foe, went
to the front, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed at the quarter-pole and faded. KHALI'S DREAM lost his
footing at the start then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths and was no factor. DEPTFORD DANCER was off slow, raced well back in the
spread-out field, came three wide into the stretch and showed little. JOEY THE CARPENTER was reluctant to load then off slow and never reached
contention.

Footnotes
CHULAINN bobbled awkwardly at the start nearly tossing the rider from the saddle and getting away near the rear of the field, saved ground tracking just off
the inside, tucked inside into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied coming inwards near the
eighth pole and traded a bump with CATCH THAT PARTY at that station, dug in knocking heads to the finish taking narrow command a sixteenth out and
edged away gamely in the last jumps to the wire. CATCH THAT PARTY two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, came inwards straightened away, then came out and traded a bump with the aforementioned foe a
furlong out, knocked heads with that rival to the finish fighting on to the wire while along for the place honors. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR two to three wide
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was brushed a furlong from
home by AGENT CREED attempting to tip out from in behind rivals, denied the move before tipping out himself and surged late to secure the show honors.
COTTON just off the pace three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, seized command
straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a host of rivals, got collared a sixteenth from home battling on inside a quartet
but was outfinished in the late stages. AGENT CREED tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, tipped three wide through the far turn
getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied attempting to tip out from in behind rivals heading for a gap between
foes to the outside of COTTON and was denied the move by GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR to his outside trading a brush with that rival a furlong out, had the
seam close up and was steadied off the heels of a wall of foes inside that station, came under urging near the sixteenth marker and missed for the last
major share. FATIMA'S BLESSING pulled early on three wide in pursuit under restraint, settled midway down the backstretch and tucked to the two path
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. MR. KRINGLE coaxed
from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cornered just off
the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. MISSIONATTHESPA showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. REGALITY forwardly placed just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, began to back track nearing the far turn and retreated to the rear of the field loosely handled, went five wide into upper stretch and
was eased home to the finish. WORK OUT keen early on chasing just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

threaten. GANDY DANCING settled on the outside, went four wide while asked on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WOW settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out into the final furlong and closed
strongly to get up late. LILAC GIRL settled just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, chased the leader into
the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth then took a short lead but was denied while able to get the place. MISS BONNIE T was well placed just
off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final
sixteenth but was caught while clear for the show. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the
rail on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.
RHOMBIQUE settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. VINTAGE STYLE was hustled from
the start then taken in hand and reserved off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. GAILHORSEWIND moved out at the rear, went two
then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. LADY VALENTINE tracked the pace on the outside, chased two then three
wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and capitulated. THESIS BREAK settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from
the four path to the rail on the turn and failed to respond. INTENSE HONOR was crowded a bit at the start, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on
the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and had nothing left. INGRESS settled off the pace while three to four wide, was asked on the turn and also failed
to respond. R GIRL FAITH was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and faltered.
