Footnotes
PITCHING FAST, in range, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, led in the final furlong and held under a drive. GLORIOUS
TRIBUTE stalked the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, bid a furlong out, was outkicked but held place. AMMUNITION pressed the pace, gained
command late turn, had a clear lead at the top of the stretch, was passed and chased to the end. LIARS CLUB settled in mid pack, closed three to five-wide
late turn then gained through the stretch. HIGHLAND SOCIETY raced in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but his rally stalled mid stretch.
ANTE UP ALEX settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, gained, but was never contentious. CANADIAN
PHAROAH, bumped at the start, was hustled from the rail to two-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. BEYOND MY DREAMS, in range, chased
four-wide on the far turn but leveled out in deep stretch. MIA AT MIDNIGHT set a pressured pace, bid midway of the far turn, dueled briefly and faded.
COPINSAY settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. PARMIGIANO, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, closed
on the backstretch, dropped back on the turn but lacked a rally.

prevailed under a drive. LANGSTAFF ROAD broke inward, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, fought valiantly to the wire but was out nodded.
HALL OF DREAMS SETTLED settled off the pace, closed late turn, was steadied and veered out approaching the stretch and rallied gamely. MIDNIGHT
ARKLE was off slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled late turn then closed mildly through the stretch. JACK SLYE got away slowly, stalked the pace,
was hustled along the rail on the turn but failed to menace. UNCLE SPIDER, away slowly and off the pace, closed five then four-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch and evened out. BROADWAY SKY raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, was pinched back late turn and was not a threat.
UNDER SURVEILLANCE stalked early, dropped back on the far turn, veered out at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. NGABE settled off the pace,
dropped back near the far turn, trailed, then passed a straggler. CANELITO raced from off the pace, was checked near the top of the stretch and backed

three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. EXIT STAGE RIGHT stalked the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn and chased to

BEAT THE SYSTEM pressed the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn, wore down the leader, led in the final furlong and drove clear.
PLEDGE, in range, chased hard three and four-wide on the turn, lugged in mid stretch but finished gamely. IN MY OPINION settled off the pace, came two
to four-wide on the turn then rallied widest through the stretch. SARATOGA VISION, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, chased late turn and posted a
good late effort. SILVER DAHLIA settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn then closed fast along the rail in the stretch. ROAD TO ROMANCE,
bumped at the start, set a reserved pace, was under pressure on the turn, was headed in the final furlong and chased to the end. ANTIGONE settled off the
pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail, was blocked in the final furlong then rallied late. BELIEVING was away slowly, settled off the pace, closed fast
three to five-wide on the turn but finished evenly. SHE'S GOT MOVES settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly.
FAIRYWREN, in range, chased two to four-wide late turn then evened out mid stretch. MISS MARIE settled in mid pack, was hustled three and and
four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. FIVE DAYS IN MAY was taken off the pace at the start, moved to the rail, saved ground but lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
FLORIDA WON was three wide and off the pace through the first turn, commenced a gradual three wide move to loom outside the leaders into the second
turn, seemed to stall and drop in behind the duelers in midstretch but responded to the rider switching to left handed encouragement in the final sixteenth to
grind by in the shadow of the wire. SELF INFLICTED chased the leaders three wide on the first turn, was in behind the duelers between rivals at the quarter
pole, got a nice seam to run through at the sixteenth pole and got a very brief lead seventy yards out but was outgamed on the wire by the winner.
BLOCKBUSTER stalked and pressed the early leader throughout, went head and head with that foe from midway on the far turn to the eighth pole, finally
put that one away to win the battle but lost the war when two rivals went by in the final seventy yards. A I INITIATIVE broke well and was inside in good
position early, dropped back to midpack on the backstretch, angled out midway on the far turn and out into the five path in the stretch, coming best of all late
outside the top trio but ran out of real estate. STREET LEGAL chased between rivals early before falling back along the inside into the far turn, still behind
the leaders turning for home but couldn't match their energy, levelling off in the final sixteenth when still in range. GIANT MINE was five wide off the pace
into the first turn, followed the winner's path around the far turn but couldn't keep up with that one's closing kick, stalling in the final furlong. LEONARD'S
BAY led early, was stalked and pressed by a rival throughout, stayed head and head to the eighth pole but retreated from there. WORLD OF PROSPECTS
trailed throughout and was off the rail on the far turn, able to pass a few stragglers in the run down the lane. ICE CHALLENGE left the gate with the rider
high up and steadying, three to two wide off the pace around the first turn, made a run on the far turn and out into the five path at the top of the stretch but
was on his wrong lead and tired. FOUR KNIGHTS sat on the rail behind the leaders, began to leak oil late on the backstretch and retreated from there.
SPRING EDITION steadied between rivals on the first turn, always near the rear and never in contention.

Footnotes
UNDEFILED pressed the pace, took command at the top of the stretch and drew off under a drive. SUIGU STAR, steadied at the start, settled off the pace,
closed four to six-wide on the far turn then rallied outside. NORTHERN CONQUEST settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide late on the far turn and
finished under a determined drive. DOMINANT FACTOR raced in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the far turn but even out in the stretch. SON OF
MY FATHER led quickly, set a reserved pace, was headed at the top of the stretch, gave chase but evened out in mid stretch. DR. JEWEL bumped with
MILWAUKEE FIBOLT leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was roused two and three-wide on the far turn, moved to the rail mid stretch and finished
gamely. CORRELATE stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then flattened out with a 16th to run. DOC FISHMAN was away slowly
and settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. ONE WAY TO WIN stalked the pace, rode the rail on the
turns but lacked a closing response. MILWAUKEE FIBOLT, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally.
O'HARA LANE broke in the air and was immediately pinched back, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn but lacked a closing
response.
