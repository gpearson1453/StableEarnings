Footnotes
SUPER FINE stalked the pace from the rail, got through in upper stretch, took over leaving the eighth pole, was bumped by WILDCAT STAR soon after and
drove clear. WILDCAT STAR set the pace about a half path off the rail, drifted out turning for home, led to the eighth pole, came in and bumped the winner
soon after and was no match from there while well clear of the rest. LADY YOUNES pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch, continued on the left lead
in the lane, weakened and held third. LLUVIA chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a rally. WITHOUT A VIEW failed to menace while racing two
wide. ONLY TIME bobbled at the break, raced four wide and never threatened. NOBLE PRESENT played no factor while racing two wide. POLITICAL
ASTRAY trailed inside.

Footnotes
WANDERING WEST pressed BOLDNESS from outside for a half-mile, took over approaching the quarter-pole and drove well clear. BOLDNESS set the
pace inside, could not cope with WANDERING WEST late on the turn, got passed by UNO TIGER in midstretch, then fought back inside the latter to regain
second. UNO TIGER stayed in range early, shifted out to the four-path with aim at the leaders turning for home, moved into second through the furlong
grounds, then relinquished that position late. GODS PROMISE moved out to the five-path nearing the top of the stretch, and could not gain. FRANKIE Z
saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved off the inside and made no progress. METEORITO was finished early two to three wide.

Footnotes
COSMO PAUL settled in midpack inside, angled four wide at the top of the stretch, kicked in immediately, swept to the front near the eighth pole and drew
off under a drive. CREATIVE KID tracked the early pace three wide, bid three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, led to the eighth
pole, was no match for the winner from there but stayed on well to save the place. BELOVED WARRIOR trailed inside early, circled four wide around the far
turn, was pushed into the five path by the winner in upper stretch, could not match strides with that foe but was along for the show. MERLIN set the pace
two wide, cleared late on the first turn, set the pace along the rail from there past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened through the lane. GRANNY MAKES
CENTS tracked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and tired in the drive. GRAND SIR played no factor while racing two and three
wide. WILDCAT ECHO had early speed inside, stalked two wide down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
RUBYSA hustled up on the rail to join MISS YAYA and G T'S BLUE SQUALL in a scrimmage for the early lead, went clear after a half-mile while shifting to
the three-path, moved further out roused mildly to widen the advantage in upper stretch, and was in hand leaving the furlong grounds. SADE PURSE was
slowest to begin, advanced around the turn three then four wide, rallied into second through upper stretch but was no threat to the winner. J D'S VISTA hit
the left side of the gate and was slow into stride, found her best stride in the two-path coming off the turn, and rallied inside to go clear of the remainder.
PRINCESS TERESKA went along in the middle of the field throughout, making no impact. G T'S BLUE SQUALL vied early outside RUBYSEA and MISS
YAYA early, and faded after straightening away for the drive. PARTY SWAGGER was uninvolved three to four wide. MAVI was sent early inside but beaten
to a forward position by RUBYSA and paused briefly, moved out four wide approaching the stretch and faded steadily. MA COCO was never a factor. MISS
YAYA battled up front between horses early, and was finished before going a half-mile.

Footnotes
LONG BEACH KID was unhurried two wide to the far turn, rallied between horses to take over from a spent NITRO TIME after six furlongs, drifted out while
clear through midstretch and remained in control. CUY bobbled at the start, alternated between the rail and two-path beginning to get in gear around the far
turn, cut the corner rallying into the lane, could not get to the winner but was clearly second best. DILIGENT was unhurried early inside, swung four wide
approaching the stretch, and offered a mild response to pick up the show. CHURCHILLS VICTORY tracked the breakaway leader early, lodged a bid three
wide on the far turn, and tired steadily through the stretch. MR. AXEL was strung out four wide on the first turn, took closer order three wide on the far turn
as the field bunched up, moved inside for the drive and gave way. NITRO TIME sped off early inside, got inhaled after six furlongs and stopped.

CAPTAIN CAJUN set the pace along the rail, was headed nearing the quarter pole, dug in inside of SMOKIN BOW, dueled inside of that foe from there,
exchanged several light brushes, stuck on the left lead through the lane and prevailed. SMOKIN BOW advanced two wide around the turn, put a head in
front of the winner nearing the quarter pole, vied outside of that foe from there, exchanged light brushes and just missed. NEOPHYTE stalked the pace
three wide and weakened in the lane. PORK CHOP saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. SKIPPERINI failed to menace while racing two
wide. MR MAC QUHAE lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. KNIGHTS BIRD had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
ALL QUALITY tracked outside MEET THE BEAUTY to the far turn, took over after six furlongs and went clear, then had enough to hold on late.
ISADORABLE AIDA settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied steadily outside ALL QUALITY and just missed.
FREE DATA raced in midpack to the far turn, was in some traffic two wide at the top of the stretch, shifted out for room in upper stretch and had the rider
drop the crop, and finished willingly outside the top two. PASSION PLUS raced two to three wide on the turns, moved inside for the drive and was not fully
clear through the late stages behind the leaders. SNOW SHOWER (GB) was outrun for six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn and went past tired
horses. INDICIA saved ground outrun to the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. MEET THE BEAUTY set the pace inside to midway on the far
turn, and gave way. LADY DOMINANCE raced forwardly inside to the far turn, and tired. WONDER BLONDY was rank away from the gate spotting the field
several lengths, and never recovered.

Footnotes
CHUCKY stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, drew clear approaching the five-sixteenths pole and widened while
ridden out. BILLY YANK chased the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide near the quarter pole and churned on to gain the place late.
CONGRATS AGAIN stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the lane and was outfinished late for the place. SANDY
DUDE was in range inside, tipped two wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. NONA RAC set the pace along the rail, yielded
near the seven-sixteenth pole and faded inside. MR. EINSTEIN failed to menace while racing three wide. ZIGGY veered in at the start, raced off the pace
four wide and never threatened. LINGUIST was outrun inside. SUPER SNIPER had brief speed three wide.
