weakened. UNCUT forced the pace three wide, drifted wider on the turn and faded. MORISSETTE lagged far behind inside then passed a fading rival.

on the turn. BUCKS ARE MOVING lagged far behind and was never in contention. WICKED REBEL broke slowly then dropped back steadily.

MONTE NE broke alertly and pursued the loose pacesetter, collared that one in the final furlong and edged away late. FRAN'S WORRIER took control
inside, remained clear to the stretch and finished gamely. LOAN ME YOUR EAR saved ground early, moved wide in the stretch and closed well. OUT OF
LINE eased back into the far turn, split rivals and finished well. WILD HAVEN trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. ROCKIN COWBOY
prompted the pace three wide to the turn and gave way. ASK CHUCK settled close up inside briefly then faded. PHARAOH'S CITY raced wide on the turn
well back and was no factor. THE ITALIAN prompted the leaders four wide, drifted wider and stopped. FARA'S KID dropped well behind and gave way
readily. PER RULING #22053PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, MONTE NE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED

trailed for five furlongs then passed tiring rivals. NICKYS NOTION lacked speed inside and was always outrun. NYSSA prompted the pace three wide and
stopped on the turn. DISCO DAISY forced the pace along the rail and proved empty in the stretch.

CONTENT trailed early, raced wide throughout, advanced on the turn then surged clear late. BILLIEANNE split rivals rallying on the turn, engaged the
leader and continued gamely to the wire. EXCITABLE LADY dropped back early, rallied inside on the turn then angled out in the stretch. MUNDLE OF JOY
vied outside, took over before half a mile, was collared again weakened late. VINO Y QUESO well placed inside the dueling pacesetters then came up
empty in the stretch. PINK SHOELACES rushed up along the inside then faded on the turn. KIRTAN lacked usual speed and raced far back throughout.
PRETTY SPECTACULAR chased wide off the leaders and gave way readily. IMPERIAL MOON dueled along the inside to the three eighths pole and

Footnotes
SKILLFUL stalked the dueling leaders, engaged the pacesetter on the final turn, bumped with that rival at the head of the stretch and was up in time. CALL
ME G Q vied outside, moved clear inside, dueled, bumped with the winner and continued willingly. ENANO dropped far behind inside, advanced on the turn
but was no match for the top pair. FACTUM LOVE STYLE chased far behind wide and passed rivals without menacing. RICKIE'S MELODY unruly during
gate load, saved ground and weakened. HE RUNS THE LINE saved ground within range then lacked a bid. CRUISE CONTROL broke in a complete tangle
losing all chance. LA PANZANELLA led inside for half a mile then stopped. JOE THE BOSS was taken up between rivals on the first turn then gave way.
HODLER stumbled at the break, raced close up outside and faded. The stewards posted an inquiry into the start of the race. An objection by the rider of
CALL ME G Q against the winner for interference in the stretch was denied.
