APRILINTHEPINES showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail and drew clear to win handily. RIVER DEPUTY came in the two path to
chase the winner home while never a serious threat. DIVA'S DIVA was three wide throughout and made a mild bid for third. T. P. RIGHT LANE raced along
the inside on the turn angled out for the drive and could not make up the needed ground. BRIANA JEAN raced mid pack throughout and had no rally.
INTOXICATING KISS raced wide on the trun and could not make up ground. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY came four wide entering the stretch and faded through
the stretch run. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY was always well back and not a serious factor. EREBUNI raced mid pack while four wide and had nothing in the
stretch.

YODELERS WAY was in tight quarters along the rail on the inside on the turn came through when the hole opened up and steadily drew clear for the win.
DANCE DOCTOR showed good speed on the inside but could not fend off the winner through the stretch. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN came three wide to
make a late bid for third while never a threat to the top two. THETRAILERGUY made a run four wide at the head of the stretch but came up empty late.
MATRICULATE showed good speed in the two path but had nothing left in the stretch. ARCHRIVAL was always in the back of the pack and was never a
serious threat.
