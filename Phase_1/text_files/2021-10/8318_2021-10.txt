WHEELSUPINTHIRTY quickly took command, responded gamely to challenge from I TRICKED MY RIDE and drew clear. MARYAM rated off the pace, bid
gradually inside and held place. CROSS LADY trailed the field, lodged a rail bid and improved late. I TRICKED MY RIDE stalked the pacesetters from the
three path, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but was no match for the winner and gave way late stretch. WITT NINE chased in the final turn and
offered a late mild bid. SASK LADY failed to threaten. CHICKALETTY vied inside leaving the chute and faded gradually leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
BARE BACK JACK contested the pace from the rail, dueled through the far turn, was met at the head of the stretch, drifted outward under left handed
encouragement bumping into DEVILS COMMAND repeatedly, and prevailed. DEVILS COMMAND stalked the dueling pacesetters, moved up alongside
BARE BACK JACK at the head of the stretch to challenge the lead, was bumped repeatedly late stretch and weakened. LANNY MAC bid four wide into the
stretch and was gaining late. AWESOME KNIGHT raced at the back of pack and passed tiring. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY dueled outside early, was unable to
move on with rival near the quarter pole and left nothing in reserve. DOMENICO showed little interest. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND chased four wide and tired.
STEWARDS INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of DEVILS COMMAND against the rider of BARE BACK JACK alleging
interference in the final sixteenth was upheld after review of the Board of Stewards. BARE BACK JACK was disqualified and placed second for interference
to DEVILS COMMAND. As a result of the disqualification DEVILS COMMAND was placed first.

INTERESTING TIMES prompted the early pace from the four path, challenged the lead near the three eighths marker, edged away at the head of the lane
and held under a late drive. IT'S ALEXUS angled three wide into the opening turn, gained steadily outside through stretch and missed. MI REYNA set the
early pace from just off the rail, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, battled inside and held bravely for show honors. STEVIE'S SONG sat just off the
pace from the three path, angled out into the final turn, rallied through stretch but was unable to improve after a determined effort. NO COLLUSION saved
from rail and failed to threaten in drive. IRISH LUNA lacked early speed and lacked a bid. EDGE OF OKOTOKS chased wide leaving the backstretch and
had no response when called upon. OUT FRONT never reached contention. BELLS AND WHISTLES rated off the pace from the five path, chased in the
final turn and tired soon after.

Footnotes
PIPER ROSE chased inside, swung out in the final turn bumping into DAZZLING CHIC knocking herself off stride, rallied determinedly between foes
through stretch and narrowly prevailed after a multi-horse dash to the wire. WHISKARITA raced wide leaving the chute, went three wide through the far turn,
drifted in at the head of the lane, was bumped in the stretch, continued to drift in under handling and was out finished. TWO STEPS FASTER sat just off the
pace while three wide, prompted action nearing the quarter pole, kept on gradually outside, drifted out into WHISKARITA, battled on between rivals and was
in tight before the wire. LIA'S ON TUNE led the field through the backstretch, was under attack at the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly inside.
BLUES ROAR allowed to settle off the pace, bid inside into the stretch and flattened. SKY DESTINY trailed, waited for running room at the quarter pole and
lacked a kick. DAZZLING CHIC sat in range from the four path, took closer order leaving the backstretch then was bumped while fading. MISSION REALITY
was not a factor.

Footnotes
CATCH THE GAL advanced outside quickly through the final turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, match strides outside of SMILE MARY and won the nod.
SMILE MARY raced five wide in second flight, was set down for a drive at the three sixteenth pole, bid gradually through stretch, was joined late and was
out nodded. SANDY BEACH hustled to the front, contended the pace outside of AMBER RIDGE, disposed of rival leaving the backstretch, was showing
signs of tiring at the head of the stretch and faltered. NOT YOUR BIZINESS stalked three wide, chased into the stretch and lacked the closing response
needed. YUKON MIST chased outside in second flight and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. OMEGA GAL hurried leaving the chute and failed to
produce a bid. SMOKEDYA unhurried early and showed little. I'MAMUDDERTOO tracked inside early and gave way inside. A FLEETING FEATHER was
never involved. AMBER RIDGE pressed the pace inside and was done early.
