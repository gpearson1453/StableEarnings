Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE assumed command of the early fractions and set all of the pace through the second turn, was asked for more run leaving the second
turn and extended the lead in the end to win in a drive. DANIELA BELLA sat just off of the early pace, mounted a bid from four wide on the second turn,
chased the winner into the lane and was outkicked in the stretch while holding for second. RULER OF ANGELS pulled on the jockey along the first turn then
settled just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, improved position leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, just missing for
third. EAGLE IN THE SKY tracked the early pace, lost ground on the second turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. MUCHO MACHISMO
stalked the early pace from the second flight and faded in the stretch run. MAX SMART had no early speed, trailed along the backstretch run, stopped along
the turn, was eased and walked off under his own power.

CRYSTAL PROOF was away well and set quick fractions from a ground saving trip, extended the lead leaving the turn and felt mild pressure in the final
sixteenth but dug in to hold for the win. ZAFFERANA prompted the pace from a two wide position, chased the winner off of the turn and was making up
ground at the end but could not reel in that foe while besting the rest. ACCORDING TO JUDY settled off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn and
was outkicked in the stretch drive. HALF HOPING tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and was outfinished in the stretch. BIG BRAND
bumped MISTICAL SURPRISE at the start, settled in the second flight, and weakened in the stretch run. TENDERONI pulled on the jockey on the run into
the turn, saved ground while two wide on the turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch. MISTICAL SURPRISE was bumped by BIG BRAND at the start,

REV REE settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn, was deftly ridden to find a seam along the rail heading into the top of the stretch,
struck the front inside of the final furlong and drew clear in the end. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) sat off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn,
improved position off of the turn but was outkicked by the winner in the stretch while clear of the rest for the place. IMPERIAL CREED attended to the early
pace, was two wide between foes on the second turn and tired in the late going. AMERICAN BOURBON set all of the pace while being mildly pressured,
saved ground on the second turn, was confronted off of the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. MYBLUEBELL (FR) stalked the early pace, was
still in contention on the second turn while in the three path and faded in the late going.

SHORT RIB sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, swung out for the drive and had a late surge in the final sixteenth to prevail. MR
BOTANICALS had no early speed, saved ground on the turn, rallied leaving the bend while on the left lead and briefly dueled the winner in the final
sixteenth but could not hold him off for the win while besting the rest. BETTER TOMORROW was away well and set quick fractions through the turn, had a
clear lead into the stretch but was outfinished in the late going. BIG DISCOUNT was away slowly and chased the field from the rear, was four wide on the
turn and finished willingly in the stretch drive. WINNING MAGIC tracked the pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch drive. HELLO HANDSOME
settled in the second flight, saved ground on the turn, improved position off of the turn but lacked a late response in the stretch. MR. ARTISTIC settled off of
the early pace from a five wide position and was not a factor. BUHM'S CANDY BOY chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn and gave way in the
stretch.

Footnotes
WINE AND WHISKY was forwardly placed in the early going, saved ground on the second turn, mounted a bid to vie for the lead leaving the second turn,
dug in in the final strides and held the oncoming runner-up at bay. EXPLOSIVE settled just off of the early pace, saved ground while two wide on the second
turn, found his best running late to pressure the winner and got the nod for second. DESCARTES prompted the pace from a ground saving position, took
the lead heading into the stretch and was outkicked in the late going, missing for second but holding for third. OF GOOD REPORT tracked the early leaders
from the inside, closed well leaving the turn and just missed for the minor awards. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled near the rear of the field, was a bit rank on
pulled on the jockey on the backstretch, was five wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch drive. GALLANT WARREN was unhurried in
the early stages, was six wide on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch, but was not pressuring the leaders. DUB TOWN was pinched at
the start and settled near the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and made a late gain in the stretch, but was not challenging the leaders.
CLAIM OF PASSION settled in the second flight, gained ground on the second turn and flattened out in the late stages. ROBBER BARON set the pace from
a ground saving trip, was confronted nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch. RIVER ROSE was forwardly placed in the early going,
continued be close up on the second turn while three wide and faded in the stretch run. POUR ON THE COLE chased the early pace from the midflight, was
four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LYING GHOST tracked the early leader, mounted a bid while three wide on the turn, put away WILL IS CHILL nearing the furlong marker and pulled away in
the late going. KLIMTOGLORY was pinched at the start and away slowly, gained ground on the turn while six wide and continued on with that run to claim
second, while not challenging the winner. WILL IS CHILL was away well and set the fractions while two wide, was confronted nearing the head of the lane
and tired in the stretch but held for third. FANTASTIC DREAM stalked the early pace from the four path and did not have a late kick in the stretch drive.
NIGHT MISCHIEF settled in the second flight, was five wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. BOB'S REIGN chased the pace while saving
ground and faded in the stretch drive. HANDS OFF chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn while losing position and had no response in the late
going. QUIRKY CHAOS tracked the early leaders, saved ground on the turn while still in contention, was quickly outrun on the turn, stopped, was eased and
walked off under his own power.
