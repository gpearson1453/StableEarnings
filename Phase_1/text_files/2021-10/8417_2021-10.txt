Footnotes
TALENTED DR. B showed speed, was taken to the inner rail approaching the turn, remained along the rail, was bumped by SWING WEST near the
sixteenth pole, exchanged a few bumps with that one thereafter and determinedly prevailed. SWING WEST , swung outside soon after the break, circled
horses four deep around the turn, loomed in upper stretch, bumped the winner when lugging in near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. CONFUSION
BABY BOY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. CLASSY SOLUTION , checked in tight quarters entering the turn, swung
to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally. PHANTOM RO , along the inner rail down the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the turn and failed
to be a factor. SMART STEP , outrun, angled to the six path in upper stretch. VICTORY GIVEN disputed the early pace outside the winner and faltered in
upper stretch. An objection by the rider of SWING WEST against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed. PER RULING FROM
THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, SMART STEP WAS DISQUALIFIED DUE TO INELIGIBILITY. PER RULING 22-025 FROM THE MARYLAND
RACING COMMISSION SWING WEST WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , off last after breaking outward, regrouped and settled off the inside, was in the clear and put to asking leaving the far turn, moved
up between rivals leaving mid stretch, shifted in a bit to continue progress between runners inside the sixteenth pole, forged to command late and was
edging away under a drive. HOT CHOICE leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, stalked three wide, moved up a bit wider past the three
sixteenths, drew on near even terms leaving the sixteenth pole and continued gamely while saving the place. ENGLISH CHARMER bobbled after being
bumped at the break, recovered and was taken in hand three wide outside horses, came under asking leaving the far turn and started a run, circled four
wide into the stretch, angled out advancing past mid stretch and churned on to just miss the place. MS BOOMBASTIC rated forwardly towards the inside,
eased out under urging into the lane, dropped back in and moved up to challenge along the rail with a sixteenth to go then flattened out. ENTHRONED went
clear early, set the pace towards the rail, repelled a threat past the five sixteenths, moved away a bit while two wide into the lane, drifted out some while
clinging to the lead past mid stretch, was surrounded by both sides then gave way grudgingly. PEPPER POT settled off the pace and off the inside, edged
up between rivals leaving the three eighths, steadied entering the lane, altered out and had a bit of late life. BLESS AND HONOR lacked speed while
outside a rival, failed to seriously respond. WOLVERETTE saved ground under some rating, moved up after a half mile, waited briefly approaching the
quarter pole, stayed inside into the lane and faded. RUNNING ON ENTRY , bumped and shuffled back soon after the break, dropped in to save ground but
lacked a rally. FEARLESS IDEAS , bumped at the break, rushed up between foes soon after and tracked the leader, bid to threaten past the three eighths,
gave hard chase into the lane then weakened.

Footnotes
SWEET TALIA drifted out at the break, corrected and rated forwardly while four wide, dropped in a path and advanced leaving the five sixteenths,
responded to left handed asking and wrested command from MAMA G'S WISH in mid stretch, spurted clear a sixteenth out then was fully extended to
prevail. SHEMADEMELUCKY settled off the inside, commenced a run after being put to coaxing past the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane,
leveled off to her best stride leaving the furlong grounds and was quickly getting to the winner in the final yards. MAMA G'S WISH prompted the pace two
wide outside a rival, took over leaving the far turn then kicked clear, shifted in a bit leading the way into the lane, could not contain the winner leaving the
furlong grounds and faded late. DERBY JULEP broke a bit slow then was used inside rivals to reach contention leaving the chute, angled out and bid three
deep, pressed into the turn, gave hard chase past the quarter pole then weakened in the final eighth. FEMINISTA , off the pace, dropped further back
around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch but made no impact. INSANE SISTER lacked speed, was under a ride three wide into the lane but failed to
respond. HELIACAL RISING gained a slim advantage early, set a pressured pace inside, ceded command around the far turn, stayed on with some chase
to the five sixteenths then faltered.

LITTLE BIT OF THAT leaned in and brushed with a rival at the break, corrected and took over, dropped in and set a pressured pace while under rating,
moved clear heading towards the quarter pole, eagerly opened up after being asked in upper stretch, was given a couple of cues with the left stick in mid
stretch then cruised home late. MISTY'S LASS was brushed inward leaving the gate, rated close between foes nearing the half mile marker, saw the
leaders get away mid turn, shifted four wide with pursuit into the lane and kept on willingly to save the place. ISABELLA'S GLORY , sluggish early, saved
ground around the turn, moved up along the rail in upper stretch and finished with good energy. DRY WELL bobbled outward at the break and was in a bit
close, lacked some room between rivals around the turn, came three wide for the drive and churned on. MISS CASEY pressed the pace outside the winner,
failed to keep up into the lane, stayed on as the closest pursuer past mid stretch then gave way. UNRESOLVED ISSUES , off slowly when pinched back,
was ridden widen making an advance into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, altered in then out and kept on with some interest. SAFE REEZAN rated
in range while saving ground, stayed inside while under coaxing in upper stretch then faded. SULLIVAN STREET drafted back off the pace while saving
ground, swung six approaching the stretch, was laying in past the eighth pole and failed to get untracked. RUBI DE LEON moved up four wide into the turn,
chased wide past the quarter pole and gave way. INSTPARTY bobbled at the break, stalked three deep into the turn, was under pressure three to four wide
nearing the lane then retreated.

HE'S A SHOOTER showed speed in the two path, opened up leaving the turn and steadily increased his advantage while kept to his business.
BENANDJOE , under vigorous urging soon after the break, made the lead approaching the five eighths pole, hugged the inner rail, was no match for the
winner and faded through the stretch. SEA GHOST lacked speed two wide around the turn, raced between horses in the drive, ran on his left lead and
passed tired foes. GOING TO THE LEAD , in the two path on the turn chasing the pace, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. DREAMING OF
GERRY , along the inner rail on the turn, failed to rally. GUILLAUME , three deep mid way on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and was not a
factor. BOSS LOGIC , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN bobbled at the break, corrected and took command soon after, secured the inside and set a pressured pace while under some
rating, moved clear mid turn, opened up under steady hand encouragement in upper stretch then was geared down through the final seventy yards. TAM
CHAR , bumped and in tight at the break, regrouped and settled in the clear into the turn, saved ground past the five sixteenths while gathering some
momentum, eased out two wide into the lane, split rivals with a run past mid stretch and kept on willingly to be clearly second best. UNREQUITED LOVE
pressed the pace outside the winner, raced three wide while pursuing into the lane then gave way grudgingly. AWARD WANTED stalked outside a rival,
was under asking mid turn, shifted four wide into the lane but came up empty. COMBAT QUEEN came out at the break and bumped with TAM CHAR,
corrected and stalked inside, was urged along to hold a forward spot past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. BETCHA
BY GOLLY stumbled and was in tight at the break and never recovered.

CLOSERTOTHEHEART stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch and was kept to her business in the drive.
FIRST LADY DI DA , three wide the first turn, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, angled out and rallied. LOOKS DON'T LIE bore in leaving the
starting gate, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faded late. OSA lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn and passed tired
horses. MARY JANE CHROME , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole and gave way.
LIKEHAIL checked to avoid LEIA ORGANA leaving the far turn, failed to recover. ICY HARBOR , steadied in tight quarters behind LOOKS DON'T LIE soon
after the break, was four deep entering the first turn, checked and was carried wide by RHYTHM AND POWER near the five sixteenths pole and failed to be
a late factor. SAINT RITA raced along the inner rail, faltered in upper stretch and was eased late. RHYTHM AND POWER , steadied in close quarters soon
after the break, was checked and bore out to avoid LEIA ORGANA near the five sixteenths pole then was eased. LEIA ORGANA chased the pace down the
backstretch, was along the inner rail on the far turn and bore out when taken up in tight quarters near the five sixteenths pole then was eased. An objection
by the rider of LEIA ORGANA against MARY JANE CHROME for alleged interference on the far turn was not allowed.
