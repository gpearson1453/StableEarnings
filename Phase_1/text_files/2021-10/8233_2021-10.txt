command swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the show honors.
HANGAR ONE bumped at the start by PROFUSION, who broke outwards, then got bumped by MUCHO SUNSHINE coming in under hustling, chased just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths and took over the front inside that station, spun just off the inside for
home and was displaced from command, then weakened in the late stages. INDOCTRINATE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. MAGNIFICENT

three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. EUCHARIST chased three to four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, swung six wide
into upper stretch and tired. MUCHO SUNSHINE hustled from the gate lightly bumping HANGAR ONE, crossed to show the way lightly coaxed along in the
two path, tucked inside through the turn and came under increased pressure yielding the front just inside the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and tired. HALSTAAT bobbled at the break, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under a ride
from three furlongs out, went five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
CAIRONI settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, went past the faltering pacesetter around the
three-sixteenths, dueled outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. ROSEBUG settled in second position while behind
a clear leader, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, made a bid inside of the winner
at the three-sixteenths, dueled with that foe to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. RADIANT GEM broke a half-step slow, was placed under a
vigorous hold early, dropped back under even stronger restraint just inside the three-quarter pole while lugging out some then drifted outward, dropped in
some leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths then angled out, gained while swinging five wide
into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and flattened out but finished willingly for the show. HERINGTON ROCKET settled on the inside, was asked
at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. DREAM STREAK settled off the pace, saved ground while
roused on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. REDZILLA settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, dropped
to the two path into the stretch and failed to threaten. DANCE FOR GOLD came away in good order then quickly sped clear, opened up a sizable
advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, shortened stride into the stretch, was swallowed up at the three-sixteenths and faded.

SAIL BY was taken in hand early then rated comfortably in second position, ranged up in the two path on the final turn, was given her cue coming to the
quarter-pole, rallied to the lead under a right-handed crop while three wide into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while shaking clear into the final
furlong, began to drift out shortly thereafter, was switched back to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. KINCHEN
(IRE) broke out and bumped with a rival then was carried out early, angled in behind a drifting foe then dropped to the rail later on the opening bend, was
reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch, rallied in the final
furlong and closed well to get the place. MCKULICK (GB) was forced out early then dropped to the three path, settled towards the back on the outside, went
three wide on the final turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just
miss the place while clear for the show. PHILLY EAGLES (IRE) was bumped at the start and forced out early then checked between horses while put in
tight, angled in towards the rear, was unhurried at the back while saving ground, turned into the stretch in the two path while roused and lacked the needed
response. HAIL TO drifted out badly shortly after the start and bothered some foes then dropped in, settled on the outside, went three wide on the far turn,
was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. CHARLEE O broke out at the start, went to the front while
three then two wide around the opening bend, showed the way on a clear advantage, raced inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost
the lead into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMING ISSUE

final jumps and prevail. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON brushed at the start by FIRST CONSTITUTION, who broke inwards a step, chased inside briefly before
tipping to the two path down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under challenge from flanking threats to the finish and was nailed in the final strides. FIRST
CONSTITUTION (CHI) broke in a step at the start brushing BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON, chased just off the inside briefly before tucking to the rail midway
down the backstretch, advanced inside the leader latching on with five furlongs to go, then got forced to check at the nine-sixteenths when impeded as
LETMENO tucked directly in front to the rail, lost two to three lengths of position as a result and tipped to the two path placed to coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final eighth showing good courage to be along for the show
honors. LIMONITE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tipped out to
the four or five path with three-sixteenths to go, then kicked on belatedly for the last major share. VINDICTIVE coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed
three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from midway, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LETMENO established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under some
pressure five furlongs from home, tucked to the rail sawing off FIRST CONSTITUTION at the nine-sixteenths forcing that rival to check sharply, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to the front, got collared a furlong from home and weakened in the late going.

MISCHIEVOUS KISS pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, took a slim advantage at the quarter-pole, responded
well when set down in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. MISSY GREER broke a step slow,
settled on the outside, moved up with five furlongs to run, ranged up four wide on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, chased to the wire and
was outfinished while narrowly able to get the place. FULL COUNT FELICIA broke in at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on
the turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled with the winner to the furlong marker
and was out-kicked then just missed the place but was clear for the show. LONGRIDGE FELL (IRE) showed speed then was eased back just off the pace,
was asked in the two path midway through the turn, came under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PUGLIA broke out and bumped
hard with a foe, settled on the outside towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. HYPE HOUSE was
bumped hard at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, traveled three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond.
BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage nearing the
quarter-pole and gave way. MAGIC LIGHT ducked in sharply at the start, settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, came three wide into
the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. NO LABELS settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOLINO saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, dug in under threat and held gamely to prevail. HILLIARD chased along the inside from just off the pace, tipped to the two path through
the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied willingly to threaten through to the finish but was ultimately staved
off. HIGH TIDE broke out at the start bumping SCOTTY, chased three wide, got set down spinning five then four wide into upper stretch, closed well to
secure the show honors. LORD FLINTSHIRE three wide in pursuit in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for
home, kept on for the last major share. ALBIE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide for home taking over
command, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. FINGAL chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LANDBISCUIT chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping
three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway. LIFE ON TOP
chased along the inside from near the rear of the field, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and offered no kick. SCOTTY bumped at the start by HIGH
TIDE, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. HOOPLA
established the front after the start and crossed to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat, spun just
off the inside for home yielding the front straightened away and tired. PLEASE NOTE THE MILE SPLIT HAS BEEN OMITTED PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
JACK CHRISTOPHER was asked some leaving the gate then taken back under a strong hold early, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two to
three path on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, moved clear while roused into upper stretch, widened under a strong drive into the final
furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. COMMANDPERFORMANCE brushed with a foe at the start while off a half-step slow, settled
off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. WIT was last to commence,
settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, was caught behind foes from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole, came under urging outside the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MY PRANKSTER moved out early then settled off the pace, was urged three to four
wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and came up empty. GUNITE brushed with a foe at the start, went to the front, showed the way with a
clear advantage, was asked under threat at the three-eighths, lost the lead to the winner passing the five-sixteenths and faded. KAVOD settled off the pace,
was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

ARREST ME RED established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from from flanking rivals
early on, cleared the inside rival and tucked to the rail half a mile from home, coming under increasing pressure from GUILDSMAN to the outside, got set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. PULSATE four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home willingly to secure the place
honors. CHEWING GUM three paths off the inside near the rear of the field down the backstretch, tipped four then five wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in belatedly for the show honors.
BACKTOHISROOTS forwardly placed along the inside prompting the leader early on, chased along the inside through the turn, got let out spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. THERAPIST broke out at the start and lost position to BUY LAND AND SEE taking over his
lane, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide
into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. GUILDSMAN (FR) prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, went three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late going. BUY LAND AND SEE broke out at the start taking over
THERAPIST'S lane, chased just off the inside until tipped three then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered four
wide at the top of the stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
ART COLLECTOR went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, inched clear along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun
into the two path entering the stretch, responded well under the crop into the final furlong and held under strong urging. MAXFIELD was rated just off the
pace on the inside, came under urging with three furlongs to run, moved to the two path late on the turn then was roused three wide into the stretch, chased
the winner in the drive and finished willingly for the place. DR POST broke in at the start, moved out early then settled on the outside, was roused while four
wide midway through the turn then came under the crop, chased five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed
kick while clear for the show. CODE OF HONOR was last to commence, moved up then was reserved in the two path, raced in a pocket behind foes in the
two path early on the turn, was asked while shifting three wide inside the three-eighths, dropped back to the two path later on the bend, moved to the rail
under strong urging into upper stretch and failed to rally. FORZA DI ORO was rated just off the pace on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused
inside the three-eighths, chased four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. MO GOTCHA prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along in the
two path on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and stopped.

pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out a furlong from home and closed well outside to threaten to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the wire.

the late stages. HOT DOCTOR broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide
