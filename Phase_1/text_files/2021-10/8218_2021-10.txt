STARE IF YOU MUST unhurried to the half, mild bid far turn to be along for the show spot. DIAL ME MAYBE loped along three wide to far turn, gained a
short lead into the stretch but emptied out in the drive. WIZ VILLAGE KAREN dueled to the half, gave way readily thereafter. FUR BIZ lunged at the start,
trailed to the stretch and passed one in the final furlong. THREE POINT KUZ inside speed, dueled to the half, dropped far back from there.
