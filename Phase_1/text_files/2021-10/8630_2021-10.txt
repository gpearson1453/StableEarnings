hustled along the rail on the far turn then chased gamely through the stretch. MOON POOL broke outward, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the
far turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. FLASHY GET EVEN raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but tired a

Footnotes
HAVE A SOUPER DAY stalked the pace, bid along the rail at the top of the stretch, shook clear quickly and drew away, widened when asked and held sway
under a brisk hand ride. KAWACATOOSE broke outward, pressed the pace, bid four-wide mid turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased to the
end. DANCERS GHOST was away slowly and settled off the pace, was blocked along the rail late turn then got clear and finished under a determined drive.
PRINCE OF THIEVES raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn, rallied gamely but leveled out in deep stretch. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK
stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, finished gamely but did not menace. CANOLA WORLD dueled, rode the rail and two-wide on
the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and flattened out. EXCEED raced in mid pack early, was hustled three and four-wide from the rear on the turn
and was never in contention. FLYING CURLIN forced the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, dropped back approaching the stretch and lacked a rally. AL
HEYBAY dueled, came two and three-wide on the turn, backed away at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.

the outset, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, bid mid stretch but was outkicked. SPIGETINMTZABALLS set a pressured pace, led
into the turn and moved clear, was caught in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SKILLS TEST settled off the pace, closed four-wide on the turn then
rallied willingly. MIA AND ME, in range, was hustled two-wide late turn then finished evenly. SPIRIT SOUL BODY settled in mid pack, was hustled from the
rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. MORE HARDER, steadied at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the
turn then finished evenly. ICE DANCER, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide through the turn but offered no closing
response. WHERESTHEPASSION was away slowly and settled off the pace, closed to mid pack on the backstretch, gained striking position on the turn but

Footnotes
BRASS COMPASS broke sideways at the start and was off the pace, came three wide splitting rivals early on the turn and four wide into range at the
quarter pole under little urge, stayed widest down the lane and got by the leader at the seventy yard pole, holding that stubborn foe safe late. ELEKTRONIC
allowed a rival to his inside to set the pace after winning the break, stalked and pressed that one on the turn and took over entering the stretch while lugging
in, held until the seventy yard pole when the winner cruised by, fighting on gamely to the wire. ROBUSTO off the pace and along the rail early on the turn,
angled out at the quarter pole and in behind a wall in upper stretch waiting for the winner to clear to his outside, tipped out at the eighth pole and was closing
late without threatening the top pair. SUMERIAN BELL was far back early and still trailing into the stretch, angled out at the sixteenth pole and closed with
long powerful strides late to best the rest. ABBAA sat three wide between rivals in midpack, loomed three wide turning for home but a mild rally was all he
could muster down the stretch. NOW WE ARE NINE sat four wide in midpack early, dropped back three to four wide on the turn but to his credit he re-rallied
down the lane to finish respectably. PINK LEMONADE was two wide between foes in midpack down the backside and in behind the leaders turning for
home but running in place down the lane was the best he could do. THOR'S THUNDER between rivals for the early lead before dropping back to chase
along the inside, retreated gradually from midway on the bend to the wire. LADIES SIGNATURE broke in at the start but recovered quickly and rushed up
inside to get the front, was stalked and pressed by the eventual place finisher and succumbed to the pressure turning for home, dropping back down the
lane.

swept by in the late stages under a drive. GIANT ONE forced the pace. bid into the backstretch, dueled, shook clear into the far turn, set the pace but was
passed approaching the wire. REPEAT THE HEAT broke inward, closed two to four-wide through the far turn then rallied determinedly. LATE SURGE was
away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then rallied along the fence and gained steadily. SPRING
MOUNTAIN broke inward, settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly. DANIEL SUN was off slowly, raced in mid
pack, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then finished gamely between foes. THIS WAY OUT settled in mid pack, closed into the far turn, chased
hard three-wide but evened out in deep stretch. TRAGICALLY FUNNY showed speed, dueled on the backstretch, chased on the far turn then finished
gamely in vain. WILLIAM'S CAUSE settled in mid pack, chased hard along the rail through the far turn but never reached contention. LITHUANIAN KING

Footnotes
SUMMER SUNDAY shook off an early challenger to get a clear lead after a sixteenth of a mile, set a moderate pace and still had that advantage at the
seventy yard pole but it was quickly evaporating late, and the wire came just in the nick of time. ROYAL WEDDING trailed along the inside into the turn,
steadied when moving up the fence when a rival got in tight in front of her, moved off the rail but dove back to it in upper stretch and skimmed that rail down
the lane, flying late to make it close but ran out of real estate. NOVEMBER FOG sat in midpack along the rail, moved up in behind the rival chasing the
leader late on the turn and steadied hard when that one shifted in, came off the inside turning for home and angled out at the eighth pole, closing fastest of
all late but the top two were home. GOLDEN VISION trailed early, circled two to three wide on the turn and out widest in the five path turning for home, still
inching up late but the place and show finishers outkicked her despite their troubled trips. HELLO FRIENDS chased the leader two wide on the turn, had
second from the top of the lane to midstretch but was outfinished in the final furlong. SHE'S A DREAM went up inside the leader early, dropped back to
chase along the inside, asked for a bid at the quarter pole and shifted in nearing the stretch causing some confusion in behind her, then faded down the
lane. PREFERRED GUEST sat outside and in midpack, was in a bit tight nearing the turn for home and had no response when asked in the stretch.
