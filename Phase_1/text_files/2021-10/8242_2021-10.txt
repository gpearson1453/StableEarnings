Footnotes
FORE ON SEVEN set a pressured pace in the two path, opened a clear lead on the turn then drew off through the stretch under urging. ONE MOST
WANTED stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled horses four deep on the turn, had aim on the leader entering the stretch and flattened out. IRON
PEARLS , three wide prompting the pace to the stretch, weakened. ROYALIAN stalked the pace for a half mile racing near the inner rail, swung to the four
path leaving the turn and failed to rally. BARRISTER was no factor. TRIP TO CAIRO hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace to the stretch and gave way.
REBEL VICTORY , unhurried down the backstretch, was never a factor.

Footnotes
CHAMBO rated two wide and to the inside of a rival, edged up behind the embattled leaders after a half mile, awaited room as rivals were four across into
the lane, shifted out five wide, leveled off after being put to left handed encouragement, kept on determinedly and surged past JAMES'S MOONSHINE in
the final yards. JAMES'S MOONSHINE rated kindly in the clear and off of a contested pace, picked up momentum leaving the far turn, bid four deep and in
hand approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear under asking leaving the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but failed to contain the winner's charge.
TRADITION settled off the pace, angled five to six wide advancing in upper stretch, chased then flattened out. DESPITE ODDS bore out at the break,
corrected and stalked three wide outside the winner, got the jump on that one and bid three deep between foes nearing the lane, vied briefly then faded.
AMERICAN PIPER moved inside to a short lead leaving the chute, got into a heated battle with ALPHA QUEUE, stayed on to the head of the lane then
gave way past the three sixteenths. ALPHA QUEUE sparred outside AMERICAN PIPER for nearly five furlongs and gave way. TALES OF SARATOGA
bobbled slightly at the break, dropped back around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
TUNED (GB) , three wide into the first turn, edged up within herself into the far turn, bid four wide when given her cue past the five sixteenths, moved to
command soon into the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, switched to her correct lead inside the furlong grounds and kept on eagerly while
ridden out to the wire. OYSTER BOX rated between foes around the first turn, settled behind rivals leaving the far turn, angled out, followed the winner four
wide into the stretch and kept on willingly though no match. SWEET SAMI D prompted the pace outside the leader, bid to apply more pressure leaving the
far turn, gained a brief advantage near the quarter pole, ceded to the winner soon into the lane then gave way grudgingly. NICENO , urged inside stalking
the pace, eased out as the leaders got away in upper stretch but found some more run in the final furlong while just missing the show.
SCATRATTLEANDROLL cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was pressured around the far turn, battled to the head of the lane then gave way.
TAKE CHARGE TINA saved ground while in range the opening half mile, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

NATTY BEAU , two wide stalking the pace around the turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew off under encouragement. GATOR FIFTY TWO
bumped with MORE TWIRL leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace while three wide on the turn and rallied nicely. SING A VERSE hugged the inner rail
around the turn, angled to the two path in mid stretch and offered a slight rally. WARM SUNNY BREEZE , four wide on the turn, lugged in near the eighth
pole. INGREIDO raced along the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. DISTANT THUNDER sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail,
raced on his left lead in the stretch and tired. TALE OF DIXIE , four wide on the turn, lacked the needed rally. MORE TWIRL bumped with GATOR FIFTY
TWO at the start, raced in the three path between horses on the turn and was never a factor. MUCHACHO MACHO raced inside horses down the
backstretch and around the turn and weakened. CLEVER AND GREAT , very wide on the turn, was no factor. LITTLE BAY gave way and was eased late.
APERITIVO gave way leaving the turn and walked off after being pulled up near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
CONSUMER SPENDING , taken to rate off the pace, edged up between foes leaving the far turn, dropped in and was under some asking past the five
sixteenths, altered out in upper stretch, worked her way between rivals heading to the eighth pole, closed sharply under solid hand urging, forged to
command heading to the sixteenth pole, burst clear and was taken in hand for the final yards. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER drafted back off the early pace and
settled, angled out leaving the far turn and picked up momentum, shifted out and circled six wide advancing into the stretch, exchanged a brush with
SPARKLE BLUE soon after, straightened to gain outside the winner leaving the eighth pole, failed to match strides with that one but kept on well to be
second best. EVANGELINE ALLONS took over soon after the start, set the pace towards the inside, widened two wide into the lane, remained clear past the
furlong pole then faded late. SPARKLE BLUE was allowed to drop back soon after the start, settled off the pace, moved up three wide outside a rival near
the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the lane, steadied and brushed with SHE'S LIKE THUNDER when trying to work through a seam in upper stretch,
regrouped and came back on with interest. HEDY LAMARR , reluctant to load, prompted the pace two to three wide, was ridden chasing into the lane,
stayed willingly to about mid stretch then faded. PETITION PRAYER wandered out to about the six path when keyed up nearing the first turn, remained
wide and tough to settle through the backstretch, pursued four wide past the five sixteenths, drifted out a bit past the three sixteenths and came up empty.
DETERMINED CHARM , a bit keen early and pulled four wide heading to the first turn, settled better through the backstretch and stalked the pace, saved
ground chasing into the lane but lacked a solid response. LUNA ANTONIA bobbled at the break, quickly recovered and raced forward while saving ground
into the backstretch, remained a presence to about the far turn then retreated. An objection by the rider of SPARKLE BLUE against SHE'S LIKE THUNDER
alleging interference in upper stretch was not allowed. There was also a stewards' inquiry into the stretcn run. No action was taken.

Footnotes
XY SPEED , in the two path around the turn stalking the pace, gained command inside FRANCATELLI in upper stretch, opened a clear lead near the eighth
pole and lasted under brisk urging. BATTLE STATION bumped with CANNON'S ROAR leaving the starting gate, was well back on the turn, was taken to
the eight path in mid stretch and closed late outside foes. CANNON'S ROAR bumped with BATTLE STATION leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the
turn, was six wide turning for home, floated to seven path in mid stretch and rallied between the top pair. MATTA , rated back mid way down the
backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. GRATEFUL BRED , steadied mid way down the backstretch, circled the turn
three wide, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch, moved up to the eighth pole then flattened out. SO STREET saved ground on the turn, remained
inside horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. BOLDOR , three wide on the turn, angled to the six path in mid stretch and failed to rally.
FRANCATELLI set the pace off the rail and gave way in mid stretch. SMOOTH B showed speed along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. VALUED
NOTION , outside horses chasing the pace on the turn, faltered. FIBER AND EMILY trailed.

Footnotes
LIDSTROM settled off the pace, edged closer three wide mid way on the turn, angled out five wide into the lane, rolled up under left handed asking to loom
a major presence in mid stretch, struck the top with about a sixteenth remaining and drew away. CALL IT LOVE rated within range, saved some ground past
the three eighths, angled three wide with run into the stretch, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, failed to resist the winner heading to the
sixteenth marker, faded but managed to save the place. MOHAAFETH , reluctant to load, stalked the early pace while saving ground, drafted back to last
into the far turn, angled out for a clear run around the final turn, came well wide for the drive and closed steadily. ROULETTE forced the early issue outside
EPIC RUN, was rated back from between leaving the three quarter pole and stalked, was under pressure into the lane but lacked a serious response.
ALGONQUIN moved up and bid three deep to join the pace fray, took over past the three quarter pole, took outside pressure into the turn, shook clear
nearing the lane, failed to resist a challenge past the quarter pole and weakened. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT broke awkwardly and was away last, was used
four wide and advanced outside rivals leaving the five eighths marker, engaged the leader from his outside after a half mile, forced the pace to the five
sixteenths then weakened. EPIC RUN ducked in at the break, corrected and rushed up leaving the chute to take a short lead, vied past the five eighths and
faltered.

Footnotes
TIDE OF THE SEA failed to make the early lead despite being urged, stalked the pace through the stretch the first turn, eased out entering the second turn,
gained a two wide lead on the far turn and was kept to his business in the drive. HIERARCHY , rated inside horses, moved up in the two path on the final
turn and rallied near the inner rail. GUNNISON lacked speed, circled the final turn three wide and rallied outside horses. JOHNG lacked speed, swung wide
in upper stretch and had a slight rally. OCEANS MAP offered a mild three wide move on the final turn then weakened. A THREAD OF BLUE made the early
lead along the rail, relinquished the advantage after three furlongs, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path on the final turn then
weakened. REAL FACTOR , clear after three furlongs, angled to the inner rail approaching the second turn, showed speed to the far turn, faltered and was
eased late.

Footnotes
AWESOME JAZZ broke slowly then was brushed, regrouped and saved ground while well back into the turn, gained along the inside into the lane,
continued progress past mid stretch, eased out for room leaving the sixteenth pole, sustained under a steady hand ride and forged ahead in the final yards.
CASTILLEJA edged up inside rivals early, eased out and stalked two to three wide, bid to draw alongside with a furlong to go, took over near the sixteenth
pole and kept on gamely. VANQUISHER was steadied at the break, moved up four wide into the turn, circled advancing into the stretch, drifted in with
pursuit near mid stretch, corrected and kept on willingly between rivals. CRYSTALOLOGY , taken to rate while not far back, edged up between foes mid
turn, angled out into the lane, wandered inward near mid stretch, straightened to loom then hung late. MINNETONKA quickly went clear, set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure into the lane, stayed on past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. HOPE HAS A NAME dropped off the early pace,
came five wide for the drive and rallied mildly. OUR STRONG VOWS , inside rivals leaving the far turn, eased out a bit to pursue past the quarter pole,
dropped back in then finished evenly. PRACTICALLY DIZZY came in at the break and brushed with the winner, lagged off the pace, swung out in upper
stretch and had a belated gain. FLAVA'S DREAM chased the pace, raced three wide between rivals into the lane but lacked a rally. TAM CHAR saved
ground and advanced into the turn, quickly gained mid turn, eased out to loom a presence in upper stretch, chased to mid stretch then faded. HUFFLEPUFF
, bumped at the break, raced three to four wide and gave way. DIGITAL DREAM , bumped at the break, raced between rivals early, altered in near the three
sixteenths and faltered.
