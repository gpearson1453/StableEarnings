ROAD TO MEATH tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled out and came three wide into the lane, closed steadily outside, wore
down BEE MAJOR in deep stretch to prevail. BEE MAJOR pulled a bit early on, set the pace on the inside, then vied inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch drive and battled on to the end. BROWN ESSENCE raced off the pace on the inside, advanced two wide on the far turn and rallied
mildly on the rail in the stretch run. OHANA EMPIRE pressed the pace in the two path, bid entering the far turn, dueled with BEE MAJOR, dug in and
weakened in the final sixteenth. CARPENTER raced two wide off the pace, continued inside in the stretch and lacked a rally. DISCO'S BRIDGE had a three
wide trip racing off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired. BODIE CODY was fractious in the gate, broke in the air and was off slowly, then raced off the
pace and did not factor. QUICK ENOUGH raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DUBAI BOBBY was outrun.

Footnotes
SHE FLED THE SCENE raced off the pace, off the rail, made a four wide run midway on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside, dueled
with EMPIRES FIRST LADY in the final sixteenth and prevailed after a long drive. EMPIRES FIRST LADY raced two wide off the pace, moved up between
rivals, made a three wide run nearing the quarter pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained a short lead in midstretch, then dueled with the winner, dug
in gamely to the wire and got the nod for second. SCHATZI was outrun early, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out at the eighth pole, closed well late
on the far outside and just missed for second. LADY TEUFLESBERG pulled and was steadied on the first turn, raced off the pace inside, rallied between
rivals passing the furlong marker, then flattened out. KISS AND RUN tracked on the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a winning bid.
EMIRATES AFFAIR dueled two wide for the lead, dueled with BACK CHANNEL on the far turn, dug in to midstretch and then weakened. EMMA AND I
raced two wide off the pace, closed belatedly outside in the stretch and failed to threaten. CRYSTAL ORB raced off the pace, had an inside trip, continued
on the rail in the stretch and lacked a bid. BACK CHANNEL set the pace on the inside, dueled with EMIRATES AFFAIR on the far turn, dug in and then tired
in the final furlong. LET'S CELEBRATE raced three wide early, stalked outside and gave way.

outside of OUR DESTINY, put away that rival and edged away late for the win. OUR DESTINY dueled inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, dug in
gamely inside of the winner in midstretch, then yielded grudgingly. CABINET PIK raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, rallied three wide into the
stretch, flattened out and held on for third. RUNNING VIOLENCE raced off the pace, chased inside on the turn, angled out at the eighth pole and rallied
mildly. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn and gained mildly outside. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) dueled two
