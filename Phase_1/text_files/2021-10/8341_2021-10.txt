Footnotes
FISH MOONEY settled off the pace two wide, steadied entering the far turn, advanced two wide around that bend, angled out in upper stretch, surged past
the leader near the sixteenth pole and drew off. BLAME THE VETS was strung out four wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch,
cruised up two wide around the far turn, took over the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear soon after, angled to the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and was no
match for the winner from there. PAINTBRUSH bumped with BRODY'S CAUSEWAY at the start, was bumped by BARBARA soon after, steadied along
between rivals through the opening quarter, advanced three wide around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. BARBARA broke inwardly and
bumped PAINTBRUSH soon after the start, pressed the pace two wide, led down the backstretch, angled in nearing the far turn, led to the five-sixteenths,
continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. TIZ NENA saved ground early, went two wide around the far turn and failed to menace. BRODY'S
CAUSEWAY was bumped at the start and never threatened while racing two and three wide. MIA ROSA stalked the pace three wide, angled to the rail
entering the far turn and retreated. HAD A NICE WEEKEND dueled inside for a half and faltered.

Footnotes
LOOK UP TO HEAVEN was hemmed in a bit chasing inside BLACK SILK early, stayed in range under a drive on the turn, tipped outside the leader into the
stretch, reached the front coming to the sixteenth-pole, then held off ALA TURKA to the wire. ALA TURKA veered out sharply at the start, moved inside
outrun to the turn, shifted out three wide improving position after a half-mile, rallied between horses past the sixteenth marker and was closing in outside the
winner. MI. TALLAWAH pursued the pacesetter two then three wide around the turn, moved further out in the stretch and lacked a closing bid.
UNCAPTURED FAITH lost ground to the leaders four wide through the turn, lugged in greenly in upper stretch, altered course off the rail to get around
BLACK SILK in deep stretch and finished with some interest. BLACK SILK popped clear after the start, rated along in command to upper stretch, then
shortened stride abruptly past the eighth-pole inside. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY raced three then two wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch.

THE VIRGINIAN was clipped behind nearing the half-mile pole, raced off the early pace, advanced three wide around the turn, took the lead in upper
stretch, battled to midstretch then drew off under a drive. DISCREET TUNE stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes turning for home, battled inside of
the winner past the eighth pole then settled for second best. EARTH lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane and was along for the show. MALRAUX vied two wide, drew clear around the turn, was collared in upper stretch and tired. FROZEN FUNDS ran up
and clipped the winner's heels early, advanced four wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. BREAKTHROUGH chased the pace two wide and

Footnotes
LARA'S LADY sped to the front at once, shook off GOOD TROUBLE after three-eighths of a mile, was roused mildly to widen the advantage in upper
stretch, and was in hand through the last sixteenth. LADY WOOD chased after the leaders early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, could not
threaten the winner but overtook GOOD TROUBLE from outside for the place. GOOD TROUBLE pursued the winner from outside to the top of the stretch,
and weakened. AMOR COCO was outsprinted early, and faded steadily inside. GIOCONDA broke inward and steadied at the start, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
FARLEY settled in range inside, edged closer while boxed in two wide around the far turn, split rivals in upper stretch, closed between foes and was up in
the final strides. UHTRED saved ground in midpack early, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, rallied outside of the winner and was
narrowly outkicked. GRAN MALBEC tracked the pace two and three wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the
final strides. COUNTY COURT was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, swung widest turning for home
and rallied belatedly. TIL THE END was unhurried while racing two wide early, went four wide around the far turn and rallied through the lane. KRAMDEN
was bumped at the start, raced two wide around the turns and had a mild rally inside. CANDY CRUSHEM raced well back inside, went three wide around
the far turn and never threatened. RANGER UP played no factor while racing three wide. SOUPER JAGUAR was bumped at the start, raced three and four
wide in midpack and came up empty in the lane. SHARM EL SHEIKH tracked the pace two wide, led between foes near the five-sixteenths pole, battled to
midstretch then tired. POSITIVE PHIL sprinted clear in the three path and faltered after six furlongs. DOCTOR D J was off slow, saved ground well back, hit
the rail nearing the three-sixteenths marker and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
MAKE IT BIG hustled up inside to take over leaving the chute, was roused midway on the turn to discourage challenges from CAPTURE MI and
BIRDNOTE, came three wide into the stretch and widened under a steady drive while drifting farther out. BIRDNOTE bumped with RISK VS REWARD at
the start, ranged up outside to loom a threat after a half-mile, got shaken off turning for home, and ran on to secure second. K. C. CHIEF brushed with RISK
VS REWARD at the start, saved ground outsprinted early, shifted two wide advancing mildly after a half, angled back to the rail past the eighth-pole and
moved well clear of the remainder. RISK VS REWARD got brushed and bumped lightly between horses at the start, chased two to three wide early, and
tired before reaching the stretch. CAPTURE MI pursued MAKE IT BIG early, closed the gap through the early part of the turn, but faltered after completing
five furlongs. BEASTFROMTHEEAST made up some ground entering the turn three to four wide, then gave way readily. GREY CRUSADER spotted the
field three lengths or so at the break, and remained in arrears.

Footnotes
NAVAJO CREED advanced inside down the backstretch, took the lead at the rail near the five-sixteenths pole, spurted clear in upper stretch and held clear
under a drive. MACHO REAL raced off the early pace between foes, angled six wide nearing the three-eighths marker, quickly gained widest and finished
willingly to be clearly second best. EASTERN SYMPHONY disputed the pace three wide, turned for home on near even terms outside of the winner, could
not match strides from there but stayed on well enough to preserve the show. CAMP PENDLETON raced in midpack down the backstretch, went five wide
around the turn and lacked the needed rally. GODS BLESSING vied two wide for five furlongs and tired. MOUNTAIN KING was outrun inside. MALIBU
MANDATE chased the pace four wide and retreated nearing the lane. COTTON JIM was in range three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
KING OF DREAMS settled in the second flight unhurried for three-eighths of a mile, swung four wide at the top of the stretch, kicked in through the furlong
grounds on the far outside, and forged past the leaders in the closing yards. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) sped clear early slightly off the inside, moved to the
rail getting roused turning for home, dug in gamely and had enough to save the place. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE pursued WIND OF CHANGE from the
outset, had aim outside that rival through the furlong grounds, and was outfinished. YES I AM FREE got bumped by TRINNI SUMMER at the break, saved
ground covered up in easy striking range for three furlongs, lacked room through the stretch behind the leaders on the rail, and could not be fully set down.
ROMARIO chased the pace three wide to the stretch, and weakened. TRINNI SUMMER broke in bumping YES I AM FREE, raced near the inside
throughout and posed no threat. FULMINI trailed throughout, collapsed on the gallop out suffering an apparent catastrophic event, and was vanned off.

FREE FLAY set a pressured pace inside to upper stretch then drew off under a drive. PALADIO stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide nearing the
lane and ran on to be clearly second best. POSITIVELY AWESOME pressed the pace outside of the winner and weakened in the lane. NEW YORK STYLE
failed to menace while racing two wide. BLACK V. K. had his head turned at the start, saved ground and made little impact. THE ICE BEAST had some
early speed then steadily faded three wide. SWAGGY GEORGE hopped at the start, chased the pace four wide retreated through the lane.

EYE OF THE TEMPLE raced forwardly into the first turn, was content to follow along behind the leaders up the backstretch, waited for room on the far turn,
found a seam and split horses at the top of the stretch, rallied to the front through the furlong grounds and bested SUN VIKING to the finish. SUN VIKING
took closer order three wide after six furlongs, swung to the five-path turning for home, loomed outside EYE OF THE TEMPLE into the last eighth of a mile,
and came up second best. RAISING MOON was outrun for six furlongs, cut the corner into the lane and rallied with good energy. CADET CORPS saved
ground on the turns, moved out for the drive and finished one-paced. EUPHORIA STAR was strung out five wide into the first turn, moved in a couple paths
contesting the pace outside CLASSIC FILM up the backstretch, stayed on to upper stretch and weakened. MACHISTO was in a bit tight in the run to the first
turn inside CADET CORPS, went along well back for six furlongs, moved to the far outside in upper stretch and could not gain. CLASSIC FILM vied for
command inside for six furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. ONE MORE DAY was no factor three wide. ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE was hard to handle
and had to be taken out four wide midway on the first turn, stayed close to the top of the stretch, and retreated. TESTED METTLE raced four wide
throughout, and had nothing left into the stretch.
