WILDCARD PRADO pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, bid in late turn, cleared into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was under a
strong hand ride to the end. HOPPED UP chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path, could not gain on
the winner while settling for second best. COMFORT ME NOW raced in the two or three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four or five path
and moved up for the minor share while not a threat. EASY DOER saved ground throughout and never factored. DERBY EXPRESS set the pace along the
inside until past mid-turn then gave way once headed. FIRST QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SAG HARBOR was unhurried along the inside into the lane, moved up on the dueling leaders outside the eighth pole, angled in to the inside just past the
eighth pole when inside rival tired, continued with good momentum and was going away at the end. KOSHER COWBOY vied for the lead two wide through
the turn, repelled dueling challenger after straightening in the lane, was clear with an eighth to travel but was no match for the winner while staying on
gamely to save the place spot. TALKTOEACHOTHER chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, loomed
up with an eighth to go then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. FALLEN EMPIRE saved ground through the turn and into the lane, angled into the five
path when gaining momentum and was slowly gaining to the end. BINGE vied for the lead along the inside into the lane then gave way along the rail.
FREDERICKTOWN trailed throughout while along the inside.

GO RODNEY was unhurried while along the inside through late turn, guided to the four path entering the lane with momentum, continued on with steady
energy through the final eighth and edged up late. LITTLE JOHN COLONY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the
two path, was clear with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. A LITTLE ECCENTRIC set the pace while along the inside into late turn, was
no match for the runner-up straightening into the lane then yielded to the winner inside the sixteenth pole. SKY LIBERTY pressed the pace two wide through
the turn then could not keep up through the lane. SHINPURUNA was never a factor while in the three path. LITTLE RED SCOOTER was outrun while along
the inside. TUCKER'S STAR chased the pace early into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
APRIL'S NO FOOL set the pace on a clear lead while near the inside, continued clear into the turn, widened into the lane while near the inside and kept to
the task while never challenged to the end. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN chased the the winner from the three to the two path through the turn ,continued to
chase that one into the lane while being asked for more, could not gain on the top one but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot.
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was in the three path through the turns and lacked a closing bid. TO FAT TO FISH unhurried early while off the inside,bid from the
three or four path through the late turn, came into the lane from the five path, looked to be a threat once straightened but flattened late.
DONTYOUREMEMBER never a factor while along the inside. HENRYS GIRL chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then was done approaching
the five-sixteenths pole and was eventually eased to the wire from just inside the eighth pole and walked off. THE QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE
TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace on a clear lead while racing near the inside, continued clear into the lane and held while under a drive. TRUCULENT was
in the three path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, came into the lane from the four path and slowly gained on the top one then settled for second
best. CONTACT TRACING stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn then lacked the needed response through the final eighth. FINNICK THE
FIERCE raced near the rail into the lane and weakened. TRUMPS REVENGE was in the three path through the far turn when being asked for more and
never was a serious factor. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN lacked an impact while saving ground.

MALIBU CLASSIC stalked in the four path, bid on the turn, then drew off under mild urging. ROOKWOOD was off awkwardly, stalked in the three path, had
no late bid but nabbed the place. BOLD BIZNESS led inside, went clear on the turn, then couldn't hold off the closers. OFF TO THE RACES raced evenly in
the five path and finished on even terms with CAPTAIN HARVEY who was bumped at the start, raced five wide and bid late. COG raced in the three path,
bid inside in early stretch, then steadied slightly at the sixteenth pole. READY FOR MORE raced evenly while four wide. JUST PHIL pressed the early pace
between foes, then gave way on the turn. SOCKET and JACK D saved ground. GEORGE THE MAN was impeded at the start, then saved ground. TAP
TAP COMIN THRU was not a factor.
