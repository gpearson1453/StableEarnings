MAAKWA led quickly, set a reserved pace and widened through the stretch under a hand ride. LOADED SNIPER closed to striking range on the
backstretch, chased two and three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. KARAKONTIE PAT broke outward and bumped RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE, settled in
mid pack, was hustled angling in from two-wide to the rail on the turn, did not menace but showed some interest in the stretch. GREYSHOTT broke outward
and bumped MIGHTY PELE, stalked the pace, chased three then two-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. COUSIN BOB settled in mid pack,
was hustled two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. BEST AND FINAL settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch but failed to menace. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE was bumped by KARAKONTIE PAT at the break and settled off the pace, chased four-wide on the turn
but lacked a closing response. MIGHTY PELE bumped at the outset, was sent to gain contention, dropped back at the turn, was hustled along but lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
FACTOIRE raced prominently three-wide, dueled into the stretch, battled gamely and prevailed in the late stages. HIGH SOCIETY GIRL had speed, set a
pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, was determined but gave way grudgingly in the late stages. SIMPLE SOUVENIR raced in mid pack, came from the
second path and rail on the turn then finished gamely along the wood. LOADED QUESTION raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. CITIZEN'S ARREST forced the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but

Footnotes
MILANO was three to two wide outside a rival in midpack on the first turn, came two to four wide into range on the second turn and out into the seven path
turning for home, closing with long powerful strides outside the embattled leaders late, up and by in the final forty yards. MALIBU EDGE led inside two rivals
throughout, was headed at the quarter pole by both of them, regained the front in upper stretch and did keep his pace buddy at bay but the winner flew by
late. CAPE COD bumped by a rival to his outside at the start but recovered quickly to move up with that foe and stalk the leader, bid between and led at the
quarter pole but the leader was stubborn and went back in front in upper stretch, outgaming this one for the place. SPIKE trailed along the rail until early on
the far turn, came inside to four wide at the quarter pole and out in the six path turn for home, closing as well as the winner late but running out of real
estate. AZZURRO chased the three leaders outside two rivals throughout, still in range at the quarter pole but a mild rally down the lane was all he could
come up with. TALE OF MINESHAFT broke in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked and pressed the two leaders three wide throughout, bidding for the
front turning for home but out of gas in the final three sixteenths. SOLIS was five to three wide on the first turn, two wide near the rear on the far turn and
never in contention. DYNAMITE DUKE hopped at the start and was rank and unruly between rivals in the trio chasing the top trio, stayed in range until late
on the far turn when his antics caught up to him and he retreated. ABSOLUTIST midpack and three to two wide on the first turn, began to lose ground on
the far turn and did not respond. BODIE inside the trio of horses chasing the top trio throughout, still in range into the far turn but backed up from midway on
that bend.

hand ride. CITRUS BOY stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased through the stretch and was up late for place.
GATLING GUN, bumped at the start, forced the pace, ran just a head off the leader's nose on the turn, was cleared by that one at the top of the stretch and
evened out late. SPANISH PRINCE stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. QUEENS QUAY broke inward and bumped
GATLING GUN, settled in mid pack, was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn then finished gamely along the fence. DIXIE'S FLATTER rushed up
early to press the pace but dropped back, chased from off the pace on the turn then dropped back again, was hustled into the stretch but failed to menace.

Footnotes
TALLESTOFTHETALL sat in midpack between rivals chasing the front runners, came up inside the drifting foes at the top of the lane and surged in the
middle of runners at the seventy yard pole, getting a fortuitous head bob on the money. ANTIGONE was three wide stalking on the first turn, advanced to
outside the leader into the far turn, wrestled the front away from that stubborn foe at the eighth pole but was nailed by the winner on the wire to his outside.
EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked the early leader, tapped on the brakes when the eventual place finisher came up outside to go after the leader before the far
turn, came three wide to challenge on that far turn and was no match for the winner's kick,outside and game to the wire unable to catch the place finisher as
well. FIRST SPRING led under restraint, was pressed by the eventual place finisher on the turn and in upper stretch, giving way grudgingly in the final
furlong. MOON OVER MONTANA sat along the rail inside two rivals in midpack, had a dream run up the inside into the stretch but was outkicked in the final
furlong. GUITAR GEORGE off the pace and between foes early, was on hold waiting for his cue on the far turn but some traffic had to clear, his mild run
ineffective as he was left too much to do. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was three wide on both the turns and near the rear, tipped out into the eight path
turning for home and mildly closed down the lane while laying in a tad. SOLAR chased inside two rivals, came in behind the leaders late on the far turn but
no rally was forthcoming. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was three wide in midpack on the first turn, hustled three wide on the far turn and taken out in the seven path
turning for home, stalling down the lane. MIRIAM'S SKY trailed from early backstretch to the finish along the inside.

Footnotes
BRITISH ROYALTY raced on the inside in midpack, saved ground through to the far turn, began to launch his bid a half-mile out, split foes and angled
three-wide into the stretch, led in early stretch and shook clear late. RIPTIDE ROCK raced in midpack early but fell back, saved ground, began to rally on
the far turn where he followed the eventual winner, angled out turning for home, reached up to the leaders in early stretch and dueled but was second best.
COLLECTIVE FORCE advanced to press the leaders while racing three-wide on the opening turn, tracked the leader into the far turn, began his bid nearing
the 5/16ths pole, was promptly headed by the eventual winner and was quickly outkicked but was game to the wire. HARLAN ESTATE raced wide in the
early stages but dropped in for some cover on the backstretch, was asked for more midway around the far turn and responded entering the stretch in the
five-path then chased to the wire in vain. ARTIE'S STORM dropped to the rear early, began to rally midway around the far turn, swung to the six-path
entering the stretch and chased in vain. H C HOLIDAY raced at the back in the two-path, rallied up the inside and was not in bad position entering the
stretch but evened out. GO TAKE CHARGE raced near the back, was in the four-path entering the backstretch, remained unhurried, was three-wide while
trailing into the far turn then passed tiring foes in the stretch. SAFE CONDUCT showed speed and got out to set the pace, saved ground throughout, was
headed late on the turn and tired past the 1/4 pole. BREAKING ALONE raced in the pack in the early stages, was two-wide throughout and came up empty.
KEEP GRINDING tracked the leader while saving ground early, stalked intently into the far turn while remaining on the inside, was in contention turning for
home but weakened. HADDASSAH showed speed, stalked the leader while racing between foes early, angled out to the three-path down the backstretch,
remained three-wide on the far turn and emptied out. EXECUTIVE GIANT raced three-wide throughout and came up empty.

AMALFI COAST raced in mid pack, closed along the rail through the turn, bid inside IMA BEAST a furlong out and drove clear. SUMMER SUNDAY stalked
the pace, closed three-wide late turn, bid a furlong out but was outkicked. GOLDEN VISION settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn,
launched a determined drive and was gaining steadily. BETWIXTING raced in mid pack, avoided the rival coming back late fast and in distress, chased
five-wide into the stretch and rallied outside. IMA BEAST led late backstretch, shook clear into the turn, set the pace, was headed a furlong out and gave
way. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP led quickly and moved to the rail, was passed mid backstretch, moved to the second path entering the turn and was starting to
close, pulled up in distress past mid turn and was vanned off.
