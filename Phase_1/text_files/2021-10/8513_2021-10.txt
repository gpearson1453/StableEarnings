LOVE AND MONEY set the pace from the outset, widened on the field along the turn, was on the inside into the lane, remained well clear down the lane
and finished handily at the wire. STREET OF DREAMS raced back early on, was in the two path along the turn, on the inside into the lane and no match for
the winner in the stretch run. MUSED (GB) broke out and was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the
three path into the lane with a minor gain in the stretch drive. LUBNA (GB) broke a bit slow from the gate and trailed the field early on, raced in the three
path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch. AMERICAN GODDESS broke out at the start and was never a threat.
CRUZ BAY chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. MISS DOMINA was
a bit slow at the break then was steadied a bit early on along the inside, raced in the two path through the turn and was empty down the lane. MINER'S
QUEEN was bumped at the start, chased the leader early on, raced in the two path through the turn and was tired down the lane.

Footnotes
RISK MANAGER settled off of the pace three to four wide, picked up stride while advancing four to five wide around the far turn, bid outside of multiple
bidding rivals approaching midstretch, outkicked those foes leaving the furlong grounds, and drove clear in the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead.
GIRL DAD stalked comfortably from the inside, briefly awaited racing room behind a wall of bidding foes while shifting out in upper stretch, tipped six wide at
the furlong grounds for clear sailing as RISK MANAGER took control, then stayed on with a late kick to just reach place at the wire while gaining on the
leader. OPTIMUS KAT pressed the pace two wide early on, took back to stalk into the far turn after UNCAPPED made an early bid, tipped three wide
turning for home to range up outside of that rival entering the lane, bid in upper stretch simultaneously with a pair of outer foes, led briefly at the furlong
marker, but was outkicked leaving that station, fought on for place thereafter, but was nailed on the wire. HAWK OF WAR got rank between horses early on,
tucked to the two path while off of the pace, tugged against the rider to be between horses into the backstretch, remained unsettled until the five furlong
pole, then got floated seven wide in upper stretch, and produced a belated rally for a minor placing. EPIMYTHIUM tracked from midpack four to three wide
around the first turn, stalked intently while inching closer three to four wide around the far turn, rallied to bid for the lead between horses approaching
midstretch, but was outkicked by foes on each side passing the furlong grounds, and yielded. BLANKET OF ROSES settled at the rear two wide, shifted
four wide entering the lane, and improved. FIELDSTONE saved ground in midpack, then chased well between horses through the lane. GREENER
PASTURES set the pace, but was headed by a group of foes in upper stretch, and weakened on her left lead. UNCAPPED stalked three wide, tugged
forward entering the backstretch to vie at the five furlong pole, sustained two wide vying position around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer foes in
upper stretch, and weakened. HARPOON HARRY settled far back three wide, attempted a five to six wide rally around the far turn, but failed to factor.
ROYAL TRYST lied at the rear along the inside, and was outrun. PERFECT CUT tracked two wide and between horses, but lost position into the far turn,
and faded.

Footnotes
DENNIS' MOMENT stalked along the inside from the two path, loomed large behind the leading group while well in hand turning for home, tipped to the four
path for clear sailing entering the lane, rallied determinedly to range up to a clear SHOPLIFTED a sixteenth from home, and drove past that rival late.
SHOPLIFTED pressed the pace two wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole as FLAP JACK ranged up, dug in entering the lane to resist that
foe, shook clear approaching the furlong marker as DENNIS' MOMENT, but was bested by that surging rival in the final sixteenth. FLAP JACK tracked three
wide, then from between horses around the turn, ranged up outside of SHOPLIFTED turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, got outkicked for
place passing the furlong pole, and chased thereafter. BOURBON WAR trailed early on, took the turn in the three path, and stayed on, but failed to factor.
SOUNION set the pace along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. LAMARTINE (BRZ) lied off of the pace along
the inside, and never got involved. HOZIER settled off of the pace three wide, tracked four wide around the turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
SPICY MARG set the pace along the inside, scooted clear passing the quarter pole when let out a notch, drew off through midstretch while hanging on her
left lead, but tired in the final furlong, came under a drive a sixteenth from home to seal the deal, and lasted safely to the wire. AMUSING ANTICS settled far
off of the pace, tipped two wide turning for home before swinging five wide entering the lane, then rallied well to narrow the gap on the tiring leader late, but
did not have enough to threaten her. HEY KITTEN trailed, swung six wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. TOUCH OF CLASS bumped
with an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and tired. MADAME READY chased
three wide early on, pressed SPICY MARG around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, and gave way thereafter. SHOW
ME THE BEST bumped with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace, shifted four wide entering the lane, but never got involved. YES TO MISCHIEF lied
close up inside of SPICY MARG early on, but checked passing the five furlong pole when put to tight quarters by that foe crossing over, then stalked along
the inside around the turn, but faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SURF SPA prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, drew off in midstretch, and safely held sway from
a chasing BURROW DOWN through the final furlong. BURROW DOWN stalked along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane with SURF SPA to
catch, but only managed to chase that foe home to prove second best. PURITY set the pace, showed the way from a pair of rivals around the far turn, but
was headed at the quarter pole, and yielded, but saved show. SWAP SHOP stumbled at the start but was not significantly costed, tracked from midpack in
the three path, chased under a drive around the far turn, then kept on through the final furlong, but missed reaching show. SHE STOOD BY ME saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. PURRFECT MISTRESS stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, but drifted to the five path entering the lane,
and faltered. PARIS KENTUCKY hit the gate and was off slowly, trailed into the far turn, improved four wide around that bend, but failed to menace.
VICARIOUS LADY broke slowly, settled off of the pace two wide, chased in the four path into the far turn, but faded. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE broke a step
slow slowly, took the first turn in the three to five path, then failed to make an impact. MY GOOD FORTUNE never got involved. JOEZINE was outrun.
