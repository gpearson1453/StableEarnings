Footnotes
HICKORY HIGH set the pace from the outset while racing in the two path, widened through the turn and into the lane then was kept to the task to remain
clear at the end. HEZA MISCHIEF trailed early while off the inside, moved from the two to the four path through late turn, came into the lane from the six
path and rallied from mid-track to be well clear of the next rival. CARSON RULES was close up early then settled back through the turn when others made
bids, continued in the three path into the lane and kept on to split rivals late and gain the show spot. RED LIAISON saved ground through the turn and into
the lane and gained energy along the rail while not a serious threat. HART WELL stalked the pacesetter from the three path through the turn, was still a
serious contender with an eighth to go then faltered. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE saved ground through the turn and into the lane then tired after straightening in
the lane. PLAY UP chased the pace from the four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the seven path and faded.

minor share while not a threat to the top two. BIG FUDGE vied for the early lead while along the inside, gained a clear lead in late turn, was caught turning
into the lane then faded through the final eighth. HE'S A WARRIOR vied for the lead two wide through mid-turn then faded. SACRED SKY pressed the pace
four wide through mid-turn, began losing ground after mid-turn and was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
FLATOUTJUSTICE chased then pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, asked in mid-turn, cleared in late turn then drew off through the lane while
under a strong hand ride. DOWN HOME KITTEN chased the pace from the two path and between rivals through the far turn, roused into the lane then
battled with others for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. IT'S GAME TIME was in the four path through the first turn, continued off the inside
into the far turn, was three wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and lacked the needed response. NOD TO
PERSIA tracked the pacesetters while along the inside through the turn then lacked a closing bid. SHOBIZ STAR set the pace along the inside through
mid-turn then gave way. BAD BOY was always last while in the two or three path through the turn.

Footnotes
LAKE NAKURU was unhurried while near the inside into the far turn, guided from near the rail to the four path after mid-turn, bid four wide into the lane,
caught the leader outside the eighth pole, dueled with that one for the final eighth and just prevailed. NIP N TUCK set the pace on a clear lead into the far
turn, had his largest lead in late turn, was joined by the top one inside the three-sixteenths pole, dueled through the final eighth and grudgingly gave any
ground. SOUTHERN RAGS trailed into the far turn while near the inside, shifted out in late turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane from the five
path, moved closest to the dueling top ones, could not gain on them while finishing well clear for the show spot. RONITHELIMODRIVER saved ground
through the turn and into the lane and moved up while not a threat. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was in the three path through the turns and never was a factor.
CAPITAL CALL raced in the four to the three path through the turns, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths pole, came into the lane from the four path
and was empty. BRIDGEKEEPER was in the five path through the first turn, chased the pace into the far turn, was asked for more approaching the quarter
pole and faded once turning into the lane. CLEMSON TIGER chased the pace from the two path through mid-turn then retreated turning into the lane.
