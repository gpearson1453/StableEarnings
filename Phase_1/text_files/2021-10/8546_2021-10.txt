Footnotes
SCARLETT LACE broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, moved to press the issue
leaving the midway point of the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and kicked away under firm encouragement. KYLEIGH'S CANDY, held up
avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out entering upper
stretch to split rivals nearing the furlong marker and continued with a steady late bid to prove best of the others. MORRIE'S JOY, reserved along the inside
racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling while shifting out nearing the lane, made some contact with LEMON'S MEDAGLIA in upper
stretch, then split foes in the closing stages to gain position while earning a share. MULSANNE (IRE) was settled last a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, raced four wide into the far turn, was fanned six wide entering the stretch, shifted inwards under pressure and continued with a mild bid. LEFT
OF CENTER was prompted to a forward placing inside foes, stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the far turn and came up empty racing
into upper stretch. EKATI EMPRESS exchanged bumps at the start, was quickly righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and
faded while shifting inside racing into upper stretch. LEMON'S MEDAGLIA exchanged bumps at the start, was collected to track off the second flight
between foes racing to the far turn, lost some position nearing the lane, was bumped in upper stretch, then passed some tiring foes late. SAINT J J, urged to
the lead along the inside, dictated the pace racing to the far turn and gave out in the drive. TWELVE RED ROSES tracked the leaders three wide in second
flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch.

PRETTY SWEET bumped with BABY BEE MERRY in the opening strides, was sent for pace inside, took pressure from NICE AND TRUE early, cleared into
the turn, set the pace in the two path around the bend, cleared further when driven near the three sixteenths, and held safe to the finish. KIANA'S LOVE
chased five wide early, continued midfield in the six path on the turn and five wide into the lane, rallied from upper stretch under a drive and gained to the
finish. BABY BEE MERRY bumped with PRETTY SWEET in the opening strides, chased inside foes early, continued midpack two wide around the turn and
into the lane, was taken to the inside under a drive in upper stretch, ran on willingly but was outfinished for the place. BIT MONEY was bumped soundly
between horses in the opening strides, took back, raced at the inside of the rear flight early, improved position inside on the turn, went to a drive past the
three eighths, continued to run on while drifting out in the lane and proved best of the rest. KENAI COOL chased between horses early, settled back into the
turn, was driven between horses in the four path on the turn, continued into the lane three wide under a drive, and passed tiring horses. DREAMING OF
PARIS came out and bumped BIT MONEY in the opening strides, chased three deep between horses early, settled back into the turn, was driven in the six
path while racing with the rear flight, came six wide into the lane, passed tiring horses but ultimately proved no threat. NICE AND TRUE attended the pace
outside of PRETTY SWEET early, tracked the leader in the four path on the turn after she edged clear, proved no match into the lane and emptied out.
HIDDEN FIGURE came in and bumped BIT MONEY in the opening strides, chased four deep early, tracked the leading pair in the five path around the turn
while hard urged, and came up empty four wide in the lane.

COWBOYS DREAM broke inwards bumping CITALI carrying that rival inwards slightly, was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter
under light reserve racing to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with that foe racing through the far turn to challenge for command between foes
nearing upper stretch, then went clear through the final three sixteenths under firm encouragement. CITALI, bumped, then carried in a bit at the start, was
collected to track the leaders from just out of striking distance racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn to challenge
for command nearing upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while proving best of the others. MEMORY BANK, caught in close quarters at the start,
tracked the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, moved to gain contention saving ground on the far turn but lacked the needed late bid while edging
rivals for a share. IRISH MAJOR settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn and continued evenly between foes into
the lane. ANGELINO was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. PLEASANT MOON ducked out at the start crossing the path
of MEMORY BANK, was hustled clear along the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn but gave out abruptly
once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE QUEEN chased inside, took closer order approaching the far turn, rallied inside around the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane to sustain her
rally, bore down on the leader, reeled her in with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and cleared. KATIE M'LADY was reluctant to load, soon cleared, set the
pace, continued clear in the two path on the far turn, was driven past the three sixteenths, dug in when challenged midstretch, was caught with a sixteenth
of a mile remaining, and chased on with interest to the finish. EMBARRASSING settled near the rear, began an inside rally into the far turn, sustained her
inside improvement under a drive in the lane and proved best of the rest. SUMMER DAY settled near the rear inside of BEYOND PROPER, continued two
to three wide into the far turn, was urged and began to quicken near the five sixteenths, swung five wide under a drive into the lane, rallied into upper
stretch, and chased on willingly late without reeling in the leading trio. LAUNCH AWAY settled at the rear, continued patiently in the two to three path around
the far turn swung out seven wide into upper stretch, and offered a mild rally. BEYOND PROPER settled near the rear, continued toward the rear in the four
path on the far turn, was taken five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. CAT ATTACK tracked the leader outside of NORTHERN ALLIANCE,
continued in range in the three path around the far turn, proved no match for KATIE M'LADY into the lane, and weakened. W W FITZY chased the leading
trio into the clubhouse turn, continued well behind the leading trio into the back straight, was urged near the half but began to flatten out, floated five wide
into the lane and had no more. NORTHERN ALLIANCE tracked inside of CAT ATTACK, was keen into the backstretch, continued to track the leader into
the far turn, started to weaken between horses near the three eighths and had no more for the drive. WHITE LIES was restless in the gate, chased outside
of BRAMBLE QUEEN, early, continued midfield down the back straight, and stopped near the three eighths.

Footnotes
CHARLO broke inwards bumping SHE'S A BIG STAR, moved to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival racing into the bend, pressed the issue
between foes racing through the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, then edged forward under steady pressure along the inside in the stretch to
just hold LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS safe in a prolonged drive. The came through close quarters at the break, shifted inwards nearing the turn to track the
leaders between foes, altered course abruptly racing past the quarter mile marker avoiding SHE'S A BIG STAR to race in the five path entering the lane
carrying out I LOVE TO RACE but continued willingly between foes to the end to narrowly prevail for the place honors while just failing to edge the winner. I
LOVE TO RACE, caught in close quarters at the start, then held up in the opening stages, switched out three wide racing into the turn to gain some position,
was forced wide racing into upper stretch but continued willingly to close the gap on the wire while just outkicked for second. SHE'S A BIG STAR, reluctant
to load, was bumped at the start, then came through close quarters to race just off the leaders, angled to the rail nearing the turn, swerved out abruptly
avoiding traffic leaving the quarter mile marker but lacked the needed final bid. HOODWINK broke outwards bumping COOKIN ROSES, was switched out
three deep after the opening furlong while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders, lodged a brief bid in that path on the turn but emptied out racing past
midstretch. COOKIN ROSES, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, angled to the inside, was steadied nearing the turn while switching off the inside and
never menaced thereafter. SOUTHERN ATTACK was settled outside foes in early stages and proved no threat. BOSSY SNOW PEA was hustled up the rail
disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shied racing past the quarter mile marker, was taken up abruptly nearing upper stretch, then quickly gave
out. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MOHS settled at the rear early, raced at the inside of the rear flight into the first turn when joined by BATTLE SCARS, continued at the inside of the rear
flight down the back straight and into the far turn, waited at the rear of a compact field around the far turn, was asked to rally when he got room inside into
the lane, responded, split horses past the three sixteenths, reeled in TEMPER TANTRUM near the sixteenth pole and held sway. GREY STREAK tracked
the leading pair inside, continued at the inside of the tracking flight in the two path on the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and chased under a
drive, found his best in the final furlong and gained late. TEMPER TANTRUM set the early pace inside of ROYAL PRINCE, was headed by that foe past the
three quarters and pressed inside that foe, dueled inside of ROYAL PRINCE while saving ground around the far turn, drove to a defined lead inside in upper
stretch, was headed by MOHS near the sixteenth and lost place late. ROYAL PRINCE prompted the pace outside of TEMPER TANTRUM down the stretch
for the first time and through the first turn, was keen to a narrow lead past the three quarters, set the pace down the backstretch while taking pressure
dueled inside of TEMPER TANTRUM around the far turn, proved no match for that one into the lane, and flattened out three wide. BATTLE SCARS tracked
the leading flight between early, settled back outside MOHS in the rear flight into the first turn, continued at the outside of the rear flight until tipping out for a
bid near the five sixteenths, swung six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) tracked the pace three wide early, raced
two wide with the tracking flight into the clubhouse turn as BATTLE SCARS settled back, tracked the leading pair outside of GREY STREAK, continued in
the three to four path around the far turn in range, swung four wide into the lane, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
DARLIN ROSIE was prompted to contend along the rail in the opening stages, was eased back avoiding traffic nearing the turn, shifted off the inside while
being prompted to split foes racing through the bend, then produced a sustained response to reel in the pacesetter racing through the stretch and went clear
late under firm handling. SHOWIT, reserved between foes after the opening furlong avoiding traffic, was prompted to advance between foes regaining
position on the turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors between foes nearing the
wire. HER GOLD MINE, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, lost some ground to the pacesetter racing into the bend, switched out four
wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest while missing for second. FLYING BUSINESS, urged to dispute the pace three deep between foes
in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn while angling to the inside, held sway past midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. DRAMA
RUN made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide racing into the turn and emptied out entering upper stretch. CONSTANCIA proved no factor. BOBBIE TOO
TOO, delayed proceedings when dislodging her rider in the gate before the start, broke readily, was hustled inside foes briefly disputing the pace, steadied
out tight quarters when losing her path nearing the turn and quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
JOLINA set the pace down the backstretch while prompted by SISTER RULER, cleared into the turn while saving ground, was reengaged by SISTER
RULER to her outside near the five sixteenths, maintained a narrow lead into the lane, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, drifted out slightly
midstretch and cleared past the furlong mark. SISTER RULER prompted the pace outside of JOLINA down the back straight, stalked her two wide around
the turn, reengaged outside of her near the five sixteenth and loomed almost even near the quarter pole, chased on under a drive from just behind JOLINA
in upper stretch, was no match past the furlong mark but kept on willingly to hold the place. STOPSHOPPINGAMY tracked the leading pair inside, was
driven two wide in upper stretch, proved no match for the top two, but chased on best of the rest. CATANIA tracked the leading pair three wide, chased in
the four path around the turn, came five wide into the lane, brushed with I LUV THIS BAR, in upper stretch, and kept on mildly. COWGIRL KIMMIE settled at
the rear, raced in second last in the three path around the bend, swung out six wide into upper stretch and passed tiring horses. I LUV THIS BAR tracked
the leading pair between horses, continued in the three path in range on the turn, raced into the lane four wide between horses, brushed with CATANIA in
upper stretch, and weakened. GHAALEB'S APPEAL settled in second last, was relegated to the rear into the lane, saved ground around the bend, was
driven up the rail in upper stretch and offered a brief rally, but emptied out in the final furlong.

CONTRACTION broke readily, dictated the pace three deep through the backstretch on a narrow advantage, shook clear racing into the turn and
maintained a safe advantage while being kept to steady pressure. COME ON DOVER tracked off the first flight four wide on the backstretch, was prompted
to make a steady advance on the leader three deep on the turn, couldn't close the gap on that foe but edged rivals for the place honors. TRE LEE DIVINE,
forwardly placed between foes attending the pace racing to the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner on the bend while continuing with interest and was
just outkicked for second. PRESIDENT ELECT tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out five wide nearing upper stretch
and was prompted to gain some position late while missing for a share. BEL BIMBO settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide into upper
stretch and continued evenly. BORA BORA settled into stride while angling to the inside on the turn but lacked a closing response. TIMINGISEVERYTHING
hit the gate while breaking awkwardly dropping well off the field at the start and failed to menace therefter. YOUNG CORBETT was urged inside foes
prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. RICHIESONARAMPAGE tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in the
opening stages but retreated early.
