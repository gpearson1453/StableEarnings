wide, took the lead three wide into the second turn and dueled from the three eighths pole, but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and faded into
the far turn. OULOG set the early pace inside, was caught approaching the second turn then faded through the turn. PRINCE OF FREEDOM stalked off the

Footnotes
ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY became a bit edgy in the gate then took quick control of the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced
at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. SAILING ROCK stalked two deep then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and dueled Posh Princess for second, while POSH PRINCESS rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled outside into
the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then flattened in the stretch duel for second. SARAH BELLUM
ran in the five path the opening turn then saved some ground on the second turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far
turn. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled back saving ground and showed little response through the backstretch. EASY'S FINAL ROSE stalked the early pace
inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened into the far turn.

SENECA ROCKS broke inward to make contact with Sooey's Princess then accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured
pace, drew clear at the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled in the lane. ICE CRUSHER chased, rounded the turn off the
rail and proved no match in the lane, though, dug in late to hold off LOVETHEONEYOUGOT, while that one chased the pace inside and raced near the rail
on the turn, angled to the three path into the stretch and finished evenly at the outside withers of Ice Crusher. SOOEY'S PRINCESS was bumped at the
break then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, checked off the heels of Lovetheoneyougot leaving the turn but
came again to pass rivals in the lane. EXCUSES EXCUSES chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened. WAGER
WORTHY was reluctant to load, gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little further.

Footnotes
TICKLING SPRINGS engaged in close chase through the backstretch and loomed a factor in the four path of the turn, dueled to the front mid-stretch and
edged clear later yards. PRINCE JACOB chased from the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to the lead two deep midway on the turn, held the advantage
through the upper stretch but was met a sixteenth away and reluctantly ceded later yards. MINI BOLT chased toward the inside, came along for third later
yards and was gaining on the runner-up. LASHER closed to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set the pace inside, came under pressure
into the turn but was caught at the rail midway through the turn and flattened the final furlong. CRYPTOBLUE gave chase inside and ran evenly through the
lane. MAKANA came away a bit awkwardly then steadied on the chute, picked up the chase through the backstretch but drifted toward the top of the lane
and showed little further. STRIDE ON BY saved ground.

Footnotes
DISTORTED SPLENDOR had the early lead inside then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and inched clear the final yards. BAHAMA BREEZE was bumped at the break and settled off the pace in the three
and four paths the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, had aim in the three path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to take second
the final strides. GANDARI stalked the early pace inside then rated the pace past the five eighths pole, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths,
rounded the turn near the rail, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught a sixteenth away and flattened later yards. UNEXPECTEDLY broke
outward steadying then saved ground racing well back the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in
the four path of the far turn and ran well outside down the lane. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground racing well off the pace, bid mildly through the backstretch,
raced off the rail on the far turn then weakened. FASHION ICON veered sharply outward to make contact with Bahama Breeze leaving the gate, saved
ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LUNAR PRAYER raced off the pace inside then faded past the five
sixteenths pole.
