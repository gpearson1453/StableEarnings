Footnotes
BLUE BOY WHO set a pressured pace in the two path, edged clear turning for home, just lasted under steady handling. AZTEC EMPEROR brushed the
inner rival just after the start, went three to four wide on the first turn racing in the back group, was encouraged along a bit leaving the backstretch, went four
to five wide on the far turn, took a while to get into gear but was surging fast although too late. RISKY REVENGE contended three wide and between
runners early, was still in contention coming past the quarter pole three deep but had no extra in the lane. TOX saved ground inside through both turns
taking closer order into the far bend, continued to gain steadily but slowly in the stretch. AWESOME K P was forwardly-placed to press from outside four
wide, weakened. MR. WILD ROCKETE raced outside rivals at the back going four to five wide, failed to rally. JEN'S BIG O was brushed lightly after the
break, raced two wide on the turns and was never near enough to threaten.

AFFAIRS UNLIMITED settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung seven deep turning for home, rallied strongly to get up late. SHAME ON BEA
stalked while well off the inside early, went three wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, led late but was caught. BLAME IT ON BREW bobbled
ever so slightly at the start, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn, was gaining late inside. LAURA BELLE
went four wide on the turn, got within range nearing the furlong grounds but could not sustain the effort. NOBLE MISS shifted in, went in the two path on the
turn moving up inside foes, inherited the lead briefly near the quarter pole, faltered and faded in the stretch. WHO'S ASKING sped clear early, bore out
badly on the turn.

Footnotes
BRAZILIAN SUMMER moved forward inside to set the pace, raced on or just off the rail through the turn, edged clear while drifting out in upper stretch,
determinedly ran on to hold a rival. RINESHAFT pressed the winner three wide, kept on gamely but couldn't get by. ARCH CITY was bumped at the break
then bumped into a foe early after clearing the gap, altered inside a rival at that juncture, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, ran on to get up for
show honors. BESITOS CRIMINALES was bumped in the early going, chased the leaders from outside a rival two wide into the turn, came out seven wide
in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TALKIN MALICE bumped a rival at the start then again early, saved ground on the turn, came out in
mid-stretch. WINDBREAK raced outside well back, went four to five wide on the turn, failed to menace. ATTILA'S LEGEND was ridden along but lacking
speed, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn. FULL SUN was restless in the gate, chased the pace from outside four wide, asked to keep up past
the five-sixteenths but came up empty. The race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MORO APPEAL dueled inside a rival throughout racing in about the two path, fought on gamely to edge clear late. JIM EDD WHO dueled outside the
winner three wide through the turn, yielded grudgingly late. E BAR GOLD advanced outside four wide on the turn, gained some to get show honors.
THIRSTY JUNIOR pursued the leading pair three to four wide and outside a rival, failed to rally. DECK HUMOR chased in behind the leaders inside a rival
going two to three wide through the turn, weakened. EL CHUMELITO was fractious in the gate, bobbled outwardly at the break, angled in content to race
well back, came out through the turn to be four to five wide nearing the quarter pole and seven then eight wide in upper stretch, gained late. INQUISITEUR
shifted in, went three wide on the turn, was never a threat. COLORFUL COLORADO chased briefly then dropped back steadily while two wide. WILLY TELL
HIM was in a bit tight along the inside on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. STARSHIP CHEWY was outside going five wide on the turn and
never a factor.

Footnotes
MAX A MILLION RSS settled mid-pack inside, altered outside a rival in the vicinity of the seven-sixteenths, moved out further from two to five wide on the
turn coming past the quarter pole, lugged in a bit in mid-stretch, struck the lead just past the furlong marker and drove past. ZIVA DA'VID was bumped out
into a rival at the start and in a bit tight, switched out and advanced outside four wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, drifted in a bit and was
outkicked. MS HIGHSPEED settled off the pace, went five wide on the turn, gained late. STORM N GOLD broke outwardly bumping a rival, was
well-positioned two to three wide just off the leaders into the turn, came out in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. TEE SHOT DOLLY exchanged
a bump at the start, dueled inside a rival but off the fence, weakened in the stretch. WONTONTOMATO exchanged some bumps at the start, chased while
shifting in, ran on then just off the rail through the turn then weakened. ALL STEAMED UP was in a bit tight at the start after breaking a half-step slow, went
three wide on the turn and was never a threat. CORA BELLE shifted in early, was two wide on the turn and failed to menace. MY INSTIGATOR dueled
outside three wide, faded.

Footnotes
RUN LIKE KATE broke outwardly, forced the pace from outside three wide into the turn, edged clear on that bend, drifted about in the stretch but drew off
regardless. DIXIE JEN shifted in heading up the backstretch, entered the turn two wide, came out four wide later on that bend, secured the place. HOT LIL
MESS bobbled slightly at the break, moved forward outside, went five to six wide on the turn, kept on. NOW PLAYING saved ground inside just off the
leaders, came out in the stretch and ran on. APPEARTOTRUST broke out just a bit, went four wide on the turn racing mid-pack, was in a bit tight near the
wire. ITSGOODTOBEKING raced in the back half of the field, went two deep on the turn, improved position in the stretch. LEMON ICE chased the leaders
inside a rival but off the fence, went four to five wide on the turn, came up empty. NIGHT N RED SATIN was forced out at the break, shifted in to go two to
three wide on the turn, failed to threaten. CONNIE'S LINDA failed to threaten after going five to seven wide on the turn. TERAS SILENCE pressed inside the
winner but off the rail, faded. CAROLS BOUTIQUE saved ground but was not a factor. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
