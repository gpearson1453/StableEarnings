Footnotes
FIVE B C was well off the pace on the inside angled out for the drive came from between rivals in deep stretch and was just up. SNICKEL TE was three to
four wide throughout made a big run on the outside in the stretch but could not hold off the winner. MONEY INTHE STARRS stalked the pace took the lead
inside the final sixteenth but could not hold. KAIN'S LADY showed good speed on the inside but tired at the top of the stretch. MISS REVEILLE had the
perfect trip along the rail and was in strking position when the hole opened up but could not make up ground. IZE DISCREET ROSE showed good early
speed along the inside took the lead into the stretch but gave way. BLUEBIRD DAY was towards the back on the outside entering the stretch and had to
steady briefly. SHE'S THE BOSS was away in good order but began a steady retreat almost from the outset.
