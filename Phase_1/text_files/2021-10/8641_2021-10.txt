Footnotes
ROTARY DIAL chased the leader through the turn from the three path, continued to gain into the lane from the four path, moved to the leader approaching
the sixteenth pole and edged up late. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE set the pace on a clear lead through the turn while in the two path, continued clear into the
lane, was joined by the winner inside the eighth pole and could not hold that one safe while finishing well clear for the place spot. SINGER MCGEE saved
ground through the turn while chasing the top two, could not gain on those while just holding the place spot. BROKEN JUSTICE raced in the four path
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. INDIANA RED was never a factor while in the two path through the turn and
into the lane.

Footnotes
BLUEMOON JUSTICE was unhurried while in the two path into the far turn, gained momentum through mid-turn, split rivals into the lane, was in the five
path when straightening in the lane, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole then held late while drifting out late. FEVER TEMPLE was unhurried while in
the two path into the far turn, waited behind a wall of three near the quarter pole, edged to the six path into the lane, raced between rivals near the eighth
pole and could not manage the needed response through the final sixteenth while finishing second best. SEMINOLE JUSTICE was in the five to the four
path through the first turn, moved to press the pace two wide, led into the far turn while still in the four path, continued a serious threat when losing the lead
into the lane then weakened late. PURPLE SHIRT was along the inside throughout and offered a mild gain late. CLEARING WAIVERS was in the four path
through the far turn, moved up into the lane and never was a serious threat. IDEA MAN set the pace early, vied for the lead in late turn, continued a
contender after straightening in the lane while along the inside then faltered late. TROUBLED JUSTICE raced in the back into the far turn, came off the rail
and into the four path entering the lane then lacked a response. FOREVER A CHAMP chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, began losing
ground in late turn then tired.

UNBRIDLED VICTORY vied for the early lead two wide, shook clear through mid-turn, widened into the lane while in the four path then was kept to the drive
to the wire to hold the diminishing lead. EVERYTHING'S ROSY settled early to chased the pace into the turn, angled off the inside to the four path through
late turn when gaining momentum, continued on willingly into the lane from the five path and was gaining to the end in a good effort. NO TRUST raced
between rivals into the turn, moved closer to the inside into the lane and offered a steady gain near the inside. HOLY JUSTICE was in the three or four path
into the turn, chased the others through late turn, swung into the lane from the six path and passed a couple while never a serious threat. NO MORE FAKE
NEWS was bothered at the start, raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a menace while moving up. SKYS IMAGE chased
the pace from the three path, was well spotted into the lane then weakened. FLIRTY DANCER was in the two path into the turn and was done early.
COMPRESSED ENERGY vied for the lead along the inside into the turn then faded.

CASH LOGISTICS pressed the pace two wide through mid-turn, gained the lead before the quarter pole, cleared into the lane and drew away. UPHOLD in
the three to the two path through the far turn, came into the lane from the two or three path with aim on the winner, could not catch that one but stayed on
well to finish well clear for the place spot. MAX EXPRESS was in tight at the start and settled back into the turn, advanced along the inside through the
backstretch, was shuffled a bit when others bid wide, came off the rail in the lane and kept on to regain the show spot. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER set the
pace into the backstretch, remained on the lead while under pressure from the winner, was passed for the lead in late turn then lost the show spot late.
REDSKIESATNIGHT was in the five path through the first turn, advanced four wide through mid-turn then was never a threat while in the seven path in the
lane. EXPRESSED never a factor while saving ground. STOP HAMMERTIME unhurried while off the inside, bid five wide through the turn when moving
closer, swung into the lane from the seven or eighth path and tired. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL was not a factor while in the two or three path through the
turns. ROYAL ICING was in the four path through the first turn, chased the pace from the four path down the backstretch and was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
FIREBALL BABY was reserved inside, found an opening along the rail at the quarter pole, rallied strongly and was kept to steady urging. DIAMOND
SOLITAIRE raced inside, swung five wide at the quarter pole and rallied well, while no threat. EXPECT INDY dueled early outside of a rival, bid to be clear
on the backstretch, then couldn't last in the stretch. HITTHEFLOORRUNNING and HUNGARIAN PRINCESS stalked the pace outside but had no closing
bids. PRETTY ASSETS found her best stride late outside. AMAZING GAL dueled early inside, pressed the leader, then gave way in the stretch. ELUSIVE
JUSTICE stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. SLEEPY DREAM and QUICK AND EASY faded. STARLET EXPRESS stalked the
pace in the four path, then faded.
