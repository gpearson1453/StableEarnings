WHITE ABARRIO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off when ask in the stretch and was kept to the task.
STRIKE HARD well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that
one, while clearly best of the rest. GOD IS LOVE never far back outside, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lost ground
while holding the show. VANCOUVER D'ORO well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and faded in the stretch.
JUST SO YA KNOW hopped at the start, was never involved.

Footnotes
THE GLADIATOR (CHI) allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead
and held under steady pressure. EMICRACK (CHI) mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady
gain and lacked the needed late kick. JUST RIGHT MIKE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch,
then drifted in and closed well for the show. OUR STUIE allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, angled out in the stretch, flattened and
gained a share. FRANKIE Z allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and improved position.
FACTORINO tracked the pace, angled out to bid outside of that one into the lane, gained a short lead, then weakened the final furlong. MR TINGLES
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded the final furlong. BIG TREASURE showed little, inside. GUNMAN well placed and outside, faded
through the turn.

TRULY allowed to settle, saved ground mid way of the turn, angled out three wide, was blocked, then angled out further in the stretch, made a steady gain
and drove clear. RAISON THE GLASS mid pack and outside, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, gained a
short lead, then was no match late and held the place. CACTUS KITTEN broke a step slowly from the gate, circled the field through the turn, came widest
into the stretch and closed for the show. LA RUSIA well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch
gaining a short lead, drifted to the rail and weakened the final furlong. BELLE'S KINGDOM rated inside, looped angled out and moved up through the
second turn, bid four wide into the lane, drifted in and weakened late. QUEEN STREET tracked the pace, angled out around a tiring rival, steadied in traffic
between horses approaching the stretch and faded. HARDLY SOCIAL stalked the pace on the outside, inherited a short lead through the second turn, then

HENRY'S WORLD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then lasted under steady pressure. GRAINGER COUNTY tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. ROMARIO chased
the pace inside, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, lugged in slightly brushing a rival and had a mild gain. ROYAL
SQUEEZE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and closed willingly to gain a share. EARTH stalked
outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, was brushed by a rival and weakened late. GUMWRAPPER was
never involved.

Footnotes
GREATEST GLORY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
LA BOKAINA well placed and outside, held position four wide through the turn, then drifted in in the stretch and held the place. UNCAPTURED FAITH well
placed and between, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and held the show. OVERTHEBLUESKY allowed
to settle, angled three and four wide into the stretch and closed for a share. STARE IF YOU MUST allowed to settle, angled four and five wide through the
turn, and flattened out in the stretch. HANNITA'S EMPIRE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and
weakened. LLUVIA well placed and inside, lost some ground inside through the turn, then angled out in the stretch and had no rally. PURE AMBITION
allowed to settle, looped six wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. MI. TALLAWAH broke out, bumping a rival at the start,
moved up quickly to be well placed and three wide, then faded through the turn. RUSTON DRILL was never involved. BOLD MAGIC broke in, bumping a
rival at the start and was no factor.
