ALTERED stalked then chased the pacesetter into the far turn, bid near mid-turn while in the three path, gained the lead in late turn then drew away through
the lane while under a drive. SHA KON O HEY was bothered at the start when another came over into his path, settled near the back into the backstretch,
moved closer through the far turn, went after the leader into the lane while in the two or three path, could not gain on the one while moving up for the place
spot while drifting out a bid late. CONSIDER trailed along the inside into the turn, continued along the rail into the lane and moved up to gain the show spot
while not a threat. INDY REBEL raced in the two or three path through the turns, bid in late far turn to get nearest the winner then weakened late. BROKEN
JUSTICE raced in the three path into the lane, was in the five path late when under a drive, bothered very late and was never a threat. STUDENT PRINCE
set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
IMTHEPRINCE hopped at the start and spotted the field some three lengths, trailed into the far turn while saving ground, came off the inside in late turn,
angled four or five wide into the lane with momentum, gained the lead straightening in the lane then drew away while being kept to the task. HARD NIGHT
chased the pace from the two path through the turns, bid into the lane from the two path, was passed by the winner soon after then stayed on well to finish
clear for the place spot. FIFTYFIVE STRONG broke outward and bumped outside rival, raced in the three path through the turns and into the lane and
moved up for the show spot while not a threat to the top ones. EL BOHEMIO stumbled and was bumped at the start, vied for the lead two wide, led into the
far turn, continued to duel on the lead into late turn, dropped to the inside entering the lane then weakened late. CHROME FINISH vied for the lead while
near the rail through late turn, was giving ground to the dueling challenger when entering the lane, checked sharply when straightening in the lane then was
done. BEAUMONT BEAUX was never a factor while along the inside. DREAMS OF YVONNE was near the rail while steadily losing ground. AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF #4CHROME FINISH AGAINST THE RIDER OF #7EL BOHEMIO ALLEDGING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF
THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
KING SOCIAL raced well off the rail through the first turn, chased the pace from the four path through the backstretch, was in the three path while moving
closer through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the leader, steadily gained on that one inside the eighth pole and was up in time
and cleared. FLYING SAMURAI chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, moved to the leader with minimal urging, quickly cleared into the lane
then could not hold the winner safe while second best. PURPLE SHIRT was in the four path through the far turn when not far back, came into the lane from
the four path and could not gain on the top two while well clear for the show spot. HAZEL RAH set the pace into mid-turn then gave way once challenged in
late turn. BOOK OF ROMEO raced in the two path through the turns and never was a threat. NATES HEARTTHROB saved ground through the turns,
angled into the lane from the, was in the eight path with an eighth to go and never was a factor. ROCKIN JUSTICE never was a factor while in the four to
the three path through the turns. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY was outrun while near the inside. MOONSHINE JUSTICE chased the pace from the inside into
the far turn, began losing ground after mid-turn and was empty turning into the lane. RAPA NUI trailed throughout while in the two or three path.

SACRED KIKI BIRD was away alertly, led in the two path, turned back a foe in the stretch and won under steady urging. SEMINOLE JUSTICE pressed in
the three path, bid but couldn't get to the winner. HE'S A WARRIOR raced evenly in the four path. PEGASUS ON THE GO stalked the pace between foes,
then had no late bid. CUSTERS LAST STAND raced evenly between foes. JUSTICE IN VEGAS was not a factor. SHADOW OF JUSTICE saved ground,
bled, then was vanned home.

Footnotes
ROCKET DOCKET stumbled to his knees at the break, moved up four wide to rejoin the field, rallied at the top of the stretch and was clear late under
steady urging. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE dueled inside, had a short lead at the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner. ROTARY DIAL was bumped at
the start, saved ground around the turn, then bid at the eighth pole and lacked running room late. AMAZING JUSTICE raced four wide and rallied belatedly.
HENRY RULES dueled outside of a foe, then gave way in the stretch. GO EARLY STAY LATE stalked the early pace before fading. GOODTIMEJUSTICE
was not a factor.
