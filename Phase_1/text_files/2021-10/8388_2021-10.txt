Footnotes
EDDIE'S CHARGE moved clear inside, was collared on the final turn, was passed but came again and edged off again. LAW OF THE LAND stalked the
pace outside, engaged the leader, led in the stretch but was outdueled. LT. COLUMBO settled off the pace and closed well but was no match for the top
pair. SOPHOS angled inside early and lacked a rally. EXPENSIVE prompted the pace then gradually weakened. PETER G. FOX trailed briefly outside and
was never in contention. NIANGUA lacked speed and gave way readily. DUQUESNE stumbled at the start then was never a factor.

HOLLYWOOD JET quickly took control then widened throughout while kept to drive in a dominating effort. IRISH RIVIERA lacked speed, angled out
advancing on the turn but proved no match. SCREEN SAVER dropped well behind then closed well without menacing. ALFATEI moved very wide on the
turn then flattened out in the stretch. TIO WIL raced wide off the leaders, moved closer on the turn then faded. LUCKY HERO lagged far behind then passed
fading rivals. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE was urged just off the leaders and gave way. THE WANT OF A NAIL flashed speed inside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY RAID rated outside the dueling leaders, advanced on the final turn then edged clear in the stretch. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE settled inside,
moved with the winner into the stretch but was outfinished. BARN QUEEN dropped well behind then offered some late energy. OUI MADAME trailed early
then passed rivals wide on the final turn. ALLEGRETTO lagged far back, moved extremely wide into stretch advancing. SHES EUPHORIC trailed early,
moved very wide on the final turn. RAGAZZA CARINA lacked speed then passed fading rivals. YOURINDENIAL was taken up sharply at the three eighths
pole, was taken up again at the quarter pole. BETTER BEGIN chased in midpack and never menaced. ALMOST EVIL forced the pace outside then gave
way. PASATIME prompted the pace outside and stopped on the final turn. OUR WEST INDY set the pace along inside and was finished after half a mile.
ROO LA LA raced within range briefly then gave way readily.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH JOHNNIE close up between rivals, faded into the far turn then came again wide and moved clear. MR. WALSH dropped back early then moved
wide in the stretch rallying. NO FLY ZONE was urged close up inside and continued willingly to the finish. WILL TOO SHY hustled up to duel inside, moved
clear in the stretch then tired. RACK GIN dropped back inside then offered some late energy. TWIXY CAT saved ground and flattened out through the
stretch. CONQUISTADOR SHOW lacked speed and was never a factor. NOBLE ENDEAVOR earned a narrow lead outside then stopped abruptly. DON'T
RECALL dropped back at the start and was always outrun. MOUNTAIN TREE lacked speed and was always far behind. TOP BOSS prompted the leaders
wide down the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
MISS STAR LO vied in the two path, drew clear on the turn and remained safe driving. TERPEYE advanced very wide into the stretch and closed well too
late. YOUR PAL prompted the winner inside and continued willingly. KNOCK OUT KID was taken up inside midway on the turn and finished well.
MIDNIGHT MIRACLE angled inside in the stretch and lacked a solid rally. MAD MARY was bothered just after the start then closed gap late. I'AM A
UNICORN forced the pace for half a mile and gave way. CREEDIBILITY trailed early then passed fading rivals. KARABESSA dropped back outside and
was never a factor. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR lagged near the back of the field and was always outrun. WOMAN FLYER raced close up in the two path and
gave way readily. CHECOTAH stumbled at the start, raced wide and proved in the empty stretch. HARBOUR WAY raced outside and weakened steadily.
SALLY O'PRADO chased in midpack and began fading on the turn.

down the backstretch and flattened out in stretch. OVER SENSUAL trailed racing wide then passed tiring opponents. FORE HARP forced the pace outside
in hand then proved empty in the stretch. DR. DOYLE saved ground close up and weakened on the turn. CRAZY DAISY was urged three wide for a quarter
mile and stopped.

Footnotes
ROCK ON LUKE broke alertly and angled inside, controlled the pace and widened under moderate pressure. GALERIO pursued the winner throughout, was
no match for the winner but was easily second best. INFORMATIVE chased outside off the leaders and continued well while no threat. PRINCE OF RAIN
lacked speed, saved ground throughout and closed well. I AM REDEEMED chased off the pace, moved wide in the stretch with a mild bid. SENIOR
INVESTMENT saved ground off the pace and proved empty in the stretch. PHAT MAN broke slowest and raced far back throughout with no response.
SOMEDAY JONES trailed chasing wide and was never in contention. LORD WINSALOT pursued the winner for half a mile and gave way. EMPTY TOMB
lagged far behind then faltered.

Footnotes
HONORABLE SERVICE settled four wide off the pace, bid into the stretch, offered a late rally and was up late. BIG CITY RALPH prompted the pace three
wide, edged clear on the turn but was nailed. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS forced the pace outside, loomed a stretch threat and continued gamely to the wire.
BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE dropped well behind inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. BORSA VENTO led narrowly inside then began tiring on the
turn. SUPERHIGHWAY lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. MY AMANJENA angled inside on the backstretch and lacked a rally.
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM raced very wide throughout and had no impact. CHAMPERS raced within range in the two path and weakened. KADENS COURAGE
dropped back early three wide and faltered. JUMP SHOT prompted the pace between rivals to the turn and gave way. MONTELEONE sluggish early,
lacked a response. ECLIPSED MOON lacked speed very wide and was always outrun. MY TRAIN broke slowly, rushed up inside then stopped.
