Footnotes
P T RANGER was quick to begin to set the early pace down the backstretch while racing just off the inside, built a clear lead through the upper lane, veered
in near the sixteenth pole to race a bit erratic and held a clear advantage to the wire under a strong hand ride. MUCHTOMYSURPRISE pressed the early
leader from the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. HANNAH IN A HURRY was hustled along early, raced five deep near the three
sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. LA RAMONA chased the top pair down the backstretch, raced three to four deep through the stretch run and
had no late gain. STAY BACK was hustled early, raced four wide near the eighth pole and had no response. SEENEVA THE CAT dropped to the back of
the pack early on, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

PERSISTENCE was quick to begin to set the early pace, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed under all out pressure. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF
pressed the early leader, raced two to three wide in the stretch run and closed in late on the winner to finish gamely to the wire. SOUL PRODIGY chased
the top pair in the early stages, raced in the three path through the drive and had not enough for the top pair. LAZARUS COME FORTH dropped back early,
raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. WHATSITTOYA sprinted clear in the early stages and was empty in the drive. RUNAWAY KRISTIN dropped
back early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

GRAZEN DEB pressed the pace, raced four wide in the stretch fun and finished well to get up under strong handling. MISS GLORIOUS showed good early
speed to set the early pace, was challenged through the far turn and weakened a bit in the final stages. ALL MY HOPE stalked the top pair, raced five wide
into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BIG CHICK stumbled soon after the break, raced along the inside through the upper stretch, moved
up between rivals deep stretch and closed too late.

DESERT DUDE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and just got up under all out pressure. SECOND BOLD
showed good early speed, dug in gamely deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. SUNNY SPOT staked the early pace, raced towards the inside and
had not enough in the drive for the top pair. SIX POINT RACK stalked the early going, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning
bid. UBER STAR was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. TYPHOON HARRY dropped back early, raced
towards the inside and failed to respond. KENZOU'S RHYTHM was slow early, raced six wide into the lane and never was a factor. UNPOSSIBLE
experienced a wide trip and never was a factor. The first quarter split was 25.22.

PERSEVERANCE was allowed to settle in the early stages, made a steady advance around the far turn, angled six to seven wide into the upper stretch and
closed well late to just get up. AMITY HARBOR stalked the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. HELLO
HANDSOME stalked the early pace, experienced traffic near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and finished willingly to the wire. PHILIPIE FAST dueled for
the early lead and weakened a bit through the drive. SIROCCO dueled for the early lead from the inside and gave way in the stretch run. BRON AND THE
BROW dropped back early on, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. CASTLE DONOVAN LAD was slow early and never
threatened. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT dropped back early, raced near the inside and never was a factor.
