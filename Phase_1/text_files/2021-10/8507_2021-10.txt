made a menacing outside move on the turn then flattened out. HIGH FRONTIER chased within range and began fading into the far turn. CHALK HILL raced
wide and failed to menace. MISSPOKEN trailed early, raced wide on the turn and always outrun. CATHERINES CONNECT dueled to the turn then stopped

Footnotes
LEFTY CANNON quickly took control, widened on the turn, repelled rivals at the head of the stretch and remained safe driving. PRINCESS KAIRA lacked
speed, moved inside, angled wide in the stretch and rallied. HIT A HOMER HONEY pursued the winner throughout, moved briefly closer in the stretch then
tired. BALBOA'S SMILE reluctant loading, bid wide on the turn then flattened out. PRINCESS EMMA JO dropped back early, moved very wide into the
stretch. MAGIC MIKAELA flashed speed inside then proved empty in the stretch. ME ME'S GALAXY dropped back very wide and was always outrun.
DON'TMAKEAZEEN lacked speed and weakened steadily. ANNIELINO chased wide and gave way readily. POURMEAROSE broke very slowly and was
always far back.
