SECRET OATH stalked three wide while perched outside of the pace setters, loomed large while ranging up in hand around the far turn, bid entering the
lane, took over when let out at the three sixteenths pole, drew off under driving pressure while shifting inwards in midstretch, then was wrapped up through
the final sixteenth. BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE was bounced around between horses soon after the start before getting pinched back to trail the field, gained
four wide into the far turn while tracking SECRET OATH's bid turning for home, but leveled off after a slight lead change delay in upper stretch, and stayed
on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. LATE NIGHT LADY prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader and outer bidders turning
for home, then regained stride in midstretch, and kept on late to reach show approaching the wire. CAMARADERIE set the pace, dug in to resist SECRET
OATH's bid entering the lane, but proved no match for that foe at the three sixteenths pole, then lost place at the sixteenth pole, and faltered late. CUPID'S
STRIKE bumped an outer foe early on, was help up inside of foes while in midpack along the rail around the first turn, shifted to the three path while off of
the pace into the far turn, swung to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. PRINCESS PAULINE stalked along the inside, but faded passing the three
furlong pole. DUNVEGAN DOLL took a bump to her hind quarters from an inner foe early on, and got outrun. DREAMWORKER lied off of the pace three
wide, chased from between horses around the far turn, then weakened through the lane.

B SUDD stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home to bid for the lead outside of UNPREDICATBLE BAY entering the lane, forged an advantage from
that foe at the three sixteenths pole, dug in as his inner counterpart fought on gamely, dueled through the final furlong, but flopped back his left lead inside
the final sixteenth, and held firmly. UNPREDICTABLE BAY set the pace, inched clear into the turn, met B SUDD's menacing bid entering the lane, got
headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, but fought on stubbornly, sustained a stretch long battle, but was denied re-reaching level terms. WOLFE
COUNTY pressed the pace two wide, chased the clear leader around the turn, got outmoved for place turning for home, then held show through the lane.
SOUTHERN SENSE tracked from midpack three wide, but failed to progress through the lane. CYCLONE tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, but faded in midstretch. GENERAL STRIKE bobbled a bit at the start, stalked along the inside around the turn, but only managed to chase through
upper stretch before fading. ETHEREAL ROAD failed to factor. BICKELL was done early. KINISON was pinched between horses at the thirteen sixteenths
pole, rushed inside of foes to track the pace from along the rail, but weakened through the lane. A C'S ANALYZER was outrun. MIDNIGHT RAID showed
little.

Footnotes
PENNY SAVER established a clear advantage early on, managed that loose lead while well in hand around the turn, drew off readily when roused with mild
hand urging in upper stretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. FEELING HAPPY lied off of the pace four wide, tracked the loose leader three
wide around the turn, inched closer turning for home to gain place entering the lane, but swiftly proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, and stayed
on to prove second best. RING ME DARLING chased two wide and between horses into the turn, cut the corner and attempted a bid for place inside of
ZING turning for home, but was bumped by that foe entering the lane, got outkicked for place in upper stretch, and yielded. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR lied
forwardly placed two wide, tucked to the rail into the turn, but was outmoved by a pair of rivals at the three furlong pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch,
then kept on but failed to factor. ZING stalked three to two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, and bumped an inner rival
approaching the furlong pole while weakening between horses. RAIN CHECK tracked along the inside, but was through after a half. TAYLOR'S SECRET
broke a beat slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
TEXAS RED HOT gained from well off of the pace three wide into and around the turn to be in striking range turning for home, tipped outside of the leading
trio entering the lane, bid passing the three sixteenths pole, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear. LEGENDARY LORE chased from
midpack in the two to three path around the turn, tipped five wide and outside of the leading group in midstretch, then rallied well to reach place late and
chase the leader home. MR. BOUMA vied three to two wide, then from between horses turning for home, dueled among rivals through upper stretch, but
was outkicked by an outer foe passing the furlong grounds, then lost place to a rallying rival late. PLAY ACTION PASS was void of early speed, advanced
along the inside into the turn, slipped inside of foes to a stalking position from the pocket approaching the three furlong pole, but lacked racing room turning
for home, was blocked a stymied behind the early pace setter from upper stretch to the furlong pole, slipped inside of that foe passing that marker, then kept
on to attempt a bid for a minor placing. BONUS APPRECIATION prompted the pace four to three wide, came under a drive between horses into the turn,
then managed to stay on between horses through the final furlong. BLUE KENTUCKY tracked five wide, ranged up four wide around the turn to bid for the
lead at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out and tired in upper stretch. DR. PERRY set the pace feeling stern pressure from multiple outer foes around
the turn, then weakened at the furlong pole. SILENT POWER lied off of the pace four wide and failed to factor. HOIST THE GOLD vied for the lead two wide
and between horses, but weakened at the half mile pole. BEST OF CUPID showed little.

Footnotes
HOWLING TIME tracked three wide, loomed large into the far turn, bid turning for home, grabbed an advantage from RED DANGER in upper stretch, and
drew off through the final furlong. RED DANGER stalked two wide, bid at the seven sixteenths pole, vied around the far turn as HOWLING TIME menaced
outside, led turning for home, but was headed by that rival in upper stretch, yielded at the furlong grounds, and was second best. RED KNOBS lied off of the
pace three wide, gained mildly four wide turning for home as LUNI SIMA attempted an outer rally, tracked the leading pair entering the lane, but failed to
keep pace with them in upper stretch, chased thereafter, and secured show. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with
outer foes while shifting two wide turning for home, then chased through the lane without progressing. GUNTOWN settled off of the pace along the inside,
trailed around the far turn before swinging six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. SPORT PEPPER cleared into the first turn, showed the way from a
pair of bidding foes into the far turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane. LUNI SIMA hopped at the start and was off
slowly, trailed the field two wide, gained mildly five wide and outside of foes at the five sixteenths pole, but faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARISSA'S LADY chased from midpack, rallied four wide turning for home to spark a duel outside of PROMISES TO DANCE in upper stretch, determinedly
battled with that foe while ding-donging through the final furlong, and won the photo via a head bob. PROMISES TO DANCE set the pace, dug in from a
bidding MARISSA'S LADY in upper stretch, gamely sparred inside of that foe through the final furlong, but lost the nod on the wire. LISCOLVIN tracked
three wide, got outkicked by the eventual winner entering the lane, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show approaching the wire.
AQUILA MOON stalked two wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, chased the dueling pair thereafter, but lost show in the very late
stages. AIN'T BROKE brushed the gate before being bumped by an outer foe at the start, tracked the pace two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and
moved up. BIRD EMPRESS brushed the gate and was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace, gained two to three wide around the turn, fanned six wide
entering the lane, but failed to sustain a bid. ELLE OF THE BALL got caught five wide around the turn while in midpack, then faded in upper stretch.
BEAUTIFUL EMPIRE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TURN UP DA JUKEBOX never got involved. LA NEBLINA was outrun. OLD PHO
stalked along the inside, but weakened through the lane.
