Footnotes
THE MINKSTER broke inward and bumped with THIS WAY OUT, gained a short lead on the backstretch, forced the pace from the rail on the turn, led at the
top of the stretch and widened under a strong drive and was taken in hand near the wire. UNDER SURVEILLANCE had speed, forced the pace, took a short
lead on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased in vain. THIS WAY OUT, involved in some bumping with the four inside horses at the start,
stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, launched an all out stretch drive but lost his path briefly then finished gamely. NGABE, in
range, closed three and four-wide late turn, launched a determined drive but failed to menace. LANGSTAFF ROAD broke outward and settled at the rear,
was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MIDNIGHT ARKLE, bumped at the start, briefly pressed the pace then settled at
the back of the tightly knit pack, closed four-wide late turn but lacked a late response. MUSIC HOUR drifted out at the start and bumped with MIDNIGHT
ARKLE, pressed the pace, stalked on the turn then flattened out upper stretch.

OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE, rated in range early, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied, bid upper stretch and drew away under a hand ride.
FOREST DRIFT led early, set a reserved pace, was headed upper stretch but held the place prize. IN MY OPINION closed to mid pack early, was hustled
two and three-wide on the turn then closed belatedly. OL' BLONDIE, in range, closed four-wide late turn but finished evenly. FEDALIA settled in mid pack,
closed two to four-wide late turn then chased through the stretch to no avail. SYSTEMIC RISK moved up to press the pace into the turn, closed into the
stretch but gave way grudgingly and gradually to the end. TWIRLING FAITH broke outward and was rated off the pace, closed two to four-wide late turn but
had no closing response. SCATTER THE CLOUDS was steadied at the start, raced in mid pack along the rail, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally.

STREET LEGAL broke outward, led early on the main track, set a reserved pace then held sway under light handling. D'S BEN showed brief speed,
pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. R U WATCHINGBUD settled in mid pack, was hustled from
the rail on the turn then finished gamely along the fence. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL settled off the pace, chased four-wide late turn but finished evenly. NOW
WE ARE NINE stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. BUTTERFLY STRIKE
stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, was unable to threaten but did show interest. SPRING EDITION raced off the pace, was patient
two-wide on the turn, was bumped lightly at the top of the stretch then finished gamely in vain. GATOR SPY, away slowly, settled off the pace, checked
along the rail and bumped SPRING EDITION while in tight at the top of the stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
ABOVE ALL NAMES off the pace and taken back early, got a smooth trip along the inside to move into contention late on the turn, angled out at the three
sixteenths and collared the winner at the seventy yard pole after ducking in a tad at the sixteenth. SPARKLE SAMMY led the proceedings under no ask into
the stretch, set down at the sixteenth pole but could not match the winner's late surge, a clear second best. CLOSE IMAGE trailed along the inside on the
turn, came from the rail out to the seven path turning for home, shut off when losing her path at the three sixteenths, regrouped to put in a solid run widest,
particularly eye-catching in the final sixteenth. QUEEN'S SPEED had one beat on the turn, shifted out to the eight path into the stretch and closed into the
show spot inside the sixteenth pole but caught for that position in the last jump by a deep closing rival. WEST PAW chased between rivals before dropping
back to midpack before the turn, came two to three wide into range into the stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. GRATEFUL PRAISE settled three
to four wide in midpack down the backside and through the turn, inching up down the lane without threatening. STOKES sat a nice trip chasing the leader
along the inside, angled out with dead aim at the top of the lane but faded in the final furlong. SILENT RESPECT hit the side of the gate at the start and was
off the pace, advanced into midpack by the stretch but her rally levelled off in the final sixteenth. MISS SAVVY stalked the leader bore out late on the turn
while three to four wide and retreated down the lane. MIZZONA chased the leader between runners, loomed dangerously late on the turn but retreated from
midstretch to the wire. ANITA GRIGIO chased the leader three to four wide throughout, drifted out late on the turn and clipped heels when tiring and
dropping back at the three sixteenths marker.

turn, rallied along the rail, but missed. ROMY settled off the pace, closed late backstretch, rode the rail on the turn then rallied willingly, but late. ENGLISH
SHIRL had a brief lead then forced the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn and chased through the stretch. USING COCONUTS had brief speed then
settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. VIVID VIXEN raced in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn but leveled out in deep stretch. BUTTERED TOAST settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide on the turn, was steadied a 16th
out behind traffic and leveled off. CANDY GARDEN broke inward, forced the pace, led mid backstretch and moved clear but was passed in the final 16th
and faded. SUGAR SURGE drifted inward, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail late turn but tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MUNNYFOR RO chased between rivals in the three path around the first turn and down the backstretch, was allowed to drop back midway on the far turn
and tipped out into the eight path turning for home, closed relentlessly in the middle of the course to the lead by the sixteenth pole and widened to the wire.
MISS MARIE won the break but was taken back in the first turn to chase the leaders along the rail, got a flyer up the inside turning for home when the
leaders drifted out, opened a clear advantage but was passed by the winner at the sixteenth pole, second best with a good trip today. CIELO D'ORO
bumped with a rival at the start, chased three to four wide on the first turn, loomed three to four wide on the far turn and carried out by the drifting leader into
the six path turning for home, continuing on gamely down the lane but no match for the top pair after a very wide journey. BEQUIA off the pace early, came
three wide on the far turn and followed the winner into the stretch but her kick was not as effective, settling for a minor award while wide. YOUENS bumped
a rival at the start, pushed three wide into the first turn to the lead, was stalked and pressed by two rivals on the far turn and drifted out, carrying that pair out
turning for home, tiring down the lane. IL MALOCCHIO hard held and between rivals in back of the leaders down the backside, stayed in range around the
far turn but had no response when the running began at the top of the stretch. PEMBERLEY trailed in the two path throughout, came up behind runners
turning for home looking for a seam but could only run on evenly when room appeared. TRANQUIL SKY along the rail and off the pace, followed the
eventual place finisher with a nice trip up the fence turning for home but was out of run at the furlong pole. EMMELINE three to two wide stalking on the first
turn, bid two to three wide on the far turn and carried out by the drifting leader into the stretch, calling it a day at that point and retreating.
