Footnotes
D T'S DREAM vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took command down the stretch, was all out and held on well for the win. DRIFTER
raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid and finished willingly. EXCELLENCY pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn, raced close throughout and was outfinished. SMART ANALYSIS lacked early speed, made a steady gain, finished wide and was no real
threat. MATTS FIRE N ICE dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and weakened. SON CARLOS stumbled at the start, racing in the rear,
moved up on the outside around the turn, pressed the pace and faded. DREAMER'S DELIGHT broke a step slow and was never close. DR. BENNY broke
slow and was always near the back. ALLO ENRY lacked early speed and showed little.

BE A BANDIT went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. A WISH FOR MADELYN vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn and was
outfinished for second. TWO WITH A TEN lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SALESGIRL raced in the middle of the field, weakened
and was no threat. PARTY WITH KASSIDY void of early speed and was never close. MY REBEL GIRL lacked early speed, saved ground around the final
turn and showed little.

VALTESSE unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the turn, split horses down the lane and finished strong. FLASHY MEG vied for the
early lead, drove clear around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for place. ORDER UP ANOTHER raced near the front in the early
part, eased back and made a late wide bid after turning for home. TWO PUNCH FIST lacked early speed, made a late wide bid, but was no factor. DESERT
GLOW challenged for the early advantage and weakened. COME ON BIRDIE had an awkward start, racing in the rear and was never a threat. ASTRO
FLASH pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. CUSTOM GUITAR dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and
dropped back.

MIDNIGHT SPIRIT pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, rallied down the lane, took command and drove clear before the wire. FAZIO raced
within contention, came around the turn five wide, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ANDIAMO GIACOMO unhurried in the beginning,
raced four wide around the turn, made a wide bid and missed the place position. ROCKIN ROG vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and
weakened. HOLY SUNRISE lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. JONATHAN WHO hesitated at the start, raced in the rear and was
never close. FELLER broke in the air, always raced near the back and showed little. BALKY dueled on the front end, saved ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
AREYOUINABAND challenged for the early lead, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. ITSNOTMYJOB dueled for the early
advantage, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MAGGIE'S RETURN
lacked early speed, made a late gain and got up for show. ROSE CROWN raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid
and was outfinished for third. JENNIFER'S ARCH raced in the back of the pack, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid, moved up, but was
no factor. HARRIET'S DREAM vied for the early lead, came around the turn three wide and faded. D'WILD MUFFIN raced evenly near the back, came
around the turn wide and was never a threat. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS raced near the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH
raced within striking distance and dropped back.

throughout and was outfinished for the win. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE went to the front, took command, saved ground, outfinished, while putting forth a game
effort. BIG BOY DAVE REX lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn, made a late gain, but was no rear threat. MINNESOTA MIRACLE raced
within contention and weakened. DREAM HALO lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. FREDONIAN raced in
the back of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide and was never a threat. ST. LOUIE GUY raced in the middle of

Footnotes
AKHNAS unhurried in the beginning, had an outside trip, moved up around the final turn, pulled away down the stretch and proved the best. WHEREVER
HE IS raced within contention, moved up between rivals around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FAR BEYOND
lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but was best of others. SMOKY TOPAZ vied for
the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and faded. FRANK LEROY pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly near the back.
PLUTONIUM void of early speed and showed little. LONE STAR EXPRESS dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back.
