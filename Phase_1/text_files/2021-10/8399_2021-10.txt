Footnotes
BLUE N GOLD rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, dueled clear of Sugar Lips midway on the far turn and was
steadily encouraged through the lane. MOVED BY JUBA became a bit anxious in the gate and settled off the pace about the three path on the first turn,
started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three and four paths then dueled through later yards to take second the final
strides. SPECTACULO stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then outfinished for
second the final strides. SUGAR LIPS stalked from the two and three paths and challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back in the three path
midway on the far turn then ceded third the final strides. JUBA'S MONEY HONEY saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and finished evenly outside.

GOLDEN G chased well off the rail through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and dug in from the top of the stretch to take third the final
strides. CHURCH OF MANY eased out to give chase, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled to the lead past the eighth pole, dug in under steady
stretch handling but was nipped in the final stride. TANELEER was shuffled back at the start and angled to the outside to give chase, saved ground on the
turn and dug in to take third mid-stretch. VICTORIOUS BEAR contested the pace at mostly even terms through the backstretch, drew clear midway on the
turn, gave up the lead past the eighth pole and weakened in the lane. GRANDPA MUNSTER contested the pace two deep at mostly even terms through the
backstretch but was fatally injured midway on the turn and had to be euthanized on the track.

JUNGLE BEAST settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, closed to the lead at the three eighths pole and drew clear toward the quarter,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was mostly hand urged through the lane. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground racing well off the pace, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second mid-stretch. PENGUIN PARADE settled off the
pace toward the inside, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. STORMIN ROCKET raced at even
terms into the first turn and took the nod past the nine sixteenths pole, ran briefly clear but was caught at the three eighths pole, continued in close chase
from that point, dropped back past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. LEG UP had a slim brief early lead inside,
was caught past the nine sixteenths pole and faded past the seven sixteenths.

GRAND FIBER set a pressured early pace inside, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole and briefly ceded the edge to Gunter, recovered the lead at
the rail leaving the turn, raced clear past the eighth pole and held on with steady handling. MOSBY'S RANGER chased through the backstretch and
contested the turn at a close disadvantage, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT chased toward the
inside, rounded the turn near the rail and finished evenly to take third later yards. GUNTER pressured the pace two deep and took a slim lead at the five
sixteenths pole, kept the edge over Grand Fiber off the rail through most of the turn, but was caught entering the stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth
pole. DEO FORTE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened the final furlong.

KINKY FROLIC angled to the three path into the first turn and stalked the pace, took aim approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod at the five
sixteenths, dueled clear nearing the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. OUT OF ROMANCE stalked the early pace off the rail then took the
edge between horses nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the nod at the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail toward the quarter pole and had to
settle for second best. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL moved to the inside and rated the pace, was caught nearing the three eighths pole but gave chase from that
point, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. MISS BEE HIVING settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths then eased
outward into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn, left the turn outside and showed little further.

AWESOME BUZZ stalked the early pace then moved to even terms into the backstretch, took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole, came under
pressure into the far turn and was steadily handled through the stretch. FAST LOADED drew clear at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate
the pace, was met into the backstretch and yielded the edge toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn off the rail
and dug in through the stretch to hold second. NEW FRONTIER saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn in the four path and finished evenly at the outside flank of Fast Loaded. SAVATIANO raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground
well off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly to pass rivals. BOP MARLEY
settled back off the rail the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and
showed little further. HAPPY CHAMP settled just off the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase at the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail and weakened. HELLO CARLO rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded approaching the
far turn.

SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR settled just off the early pace, closed to the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear at the three eighths and came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, then dug in under steady stretch handling to hold on well. KADESH took the lead into the first turn and rated
the pace inside, was caught leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back at the three eighths and gave chase from that point, raced near the rail on the
far turn but ultimately, settled for second. CHARITABLE VISIT rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths
pole, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths, raced close in the three path into the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. TIZEZZY rounded the
opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the front stretch, ran outside into the backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened the final furlong. THE IRON BANK rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole but showed little response through the backstretch. OWL RUN became fractious in the gate then stumbled to his nose and lost the rider at the
break.
