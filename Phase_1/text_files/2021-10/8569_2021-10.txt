Footnotes
BROADWAY LADY stalked the pace, took command upper stretch and drew off and widened under a hand ride. PEACE SEEKER settled off the pace,
chased two to four-wide on the turn then rallied outside rivals. NANTUCKET RED moved up to a clear lead on the backstretch, set a reserved pace, was
passed upper stretch and finished evenly. PERSEVERANCIA settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn but leveled out in mid stretch.
MUSICAL RIDE was rank early and was taken back to mid pack, came through the turn along the second path and then the rail, chased into the stretch but
failed to menace. CHART broke outward, showed brief speed then stalked the pacesetter two and three-wide, backed away late turn and lacked a rally.
MARAIS, in mid pack early, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out.

Footnotes
PRINCE SUSSEX dueled with two rivals, was headed at the turn, pressed the pace three and four-wide, gained a short lead mid turn, drifted out and lost
some advantage at the top of the stretch, quickly regained her margin upper stretch and held sway under light handling. VIRREINATO broke outward,
settled in mid pack three-wide, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. MURCIELAGO dueled, gained a short lead entering the turn,
was headed mid turn, remained prominent along the rail into the stretch, jumped a shadow a furlong out then chased gamely to the end. CHAIRMAN FOX
broke inward, quickly gained striking range, stalked on the turn then finished determinedly. MAGIC MOUNTAIN broke inward, settled in mid pack, rode the
rail on the turn, her path was in use through the stretch and she finished gamely in vain. LAST SENSATION settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide
on the turn then rallied outside. WASAGA hopped out of the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, was forced out a bit at the
top of the stretch then evened out mid stretch. SHISHKA raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn but evened out in the final furlong.
LOCCHE dueled to the turn, forced the pace two-wide, chased into the stretch and tired.

THAT QUALITY went to the front quickly and was stalked down the backside and through the turn by a rival, cleared off by an open length turning for home
and maintained that margin until late, needing the wire as the advantage diminished in the final forty yards. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN chased the top pair
along the inside, rode the rail in behind the leader turning for home, came off the inside at the sixteenth pole and was inching up late but ran out of real
estate. DOWNLOAD off the pace early, came two to three wide on the turn and rallied in the three path down the stretch, closing the gap between him and
the top pair in the final sixteenth. STOP THE HUMBUG off the pace and along the inside, came with a nice rally on the turn and angled out three wide late
on the bend, tipped out into the five path to get a seam turning for home and accelerated well outside to best the balance. GRAZELY chased the leaders
outside the eventual place finisher while three wide on the turn, looked dangerous turning for home but his rally levelled off at the sixteenth pole. ENGLISH
CLASSIC off the pace and along the inside early, was in a bit of traffic in upper stretch when putting in a rally but could only mildly close when clear. AHMAS
off the pace early and trailed along the fence at one point on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and gained ground in the final furlong. U S ARMY CORPS
broke well and came over into the two path to stalk the early leader who was the eventual winner, styed game into the stretch but faded out in the final
furlong. MAVERICK MAN three wide off the pace early, styed near the rear while three to four wide on the turn and had no rally in the stretch. COPINSAY
sat three wide in midpack early, got in along the fence on the turn but could not sustain a rally down the stretch. DRONE SWARM four wide and in midpack
early, was three to four wide on the turn and never a threat. ADELAIDE COURT broke out at the start and was five to six wide in midpack on the backside,
four to five wide on the turn but a mild run ended out in the eight path turning for home. WENJACK sat in midpack and two to three wide until late on the
turn, floated out into the seven path turning for home and the rider was up in the saddle when hopelessly out of it in midstretch and walked off.

PURE ELEGANCE broke outward, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, rallied gamely through the stretch and was up late under a
drive. ESSENTIAL BELLA had early speed and moved clear, set a reserved pace, was caught in deep stretch. GAV'S DREAM GIRL raced in mid pack, was
hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn and finished under a determined drive. COURTINGCOURTNEY settled off the pace, was hustled five-wide on
the turn then closed through the stretch. BIZYMALINE, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide on the turn but finished evenly. MIZZ
GEMMA raced from off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide hustled on the turn then rallied belatedly. DREAMS AND SCHEMES pressed the pace,
dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. MISS NAHA TE settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn but failed to menace. PINK
CARNATION had brief speed and settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but lacked a closing response. INFINITE PASSION raced off the pace,
chased three to five-wide on the turn then evened out upper stretch. SURFEIT settled off the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. VERMONT HOLIDAY raced off the pace, came three to five-wide through the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
AVOMAN stalked the pace, closed two-wide on the far turn, bid four-wide upper stretch, gained the lead at the 1/8 pole and held under a drive. JELGO was
off slowly, was carried out to the outside fence entering the first turn, chased after rivals closing steadily then launched a determined rally and was was up
for place. MEYER led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, turned back HYPERFOCUS upper stretch but was passed a furlong
out and chased to the end. HYPERFOCUS forced the issue, bid late turn, dueled, yielded upper stretch and also gave chase. ARGENTIUM broke inward
and settled off the pace, trailed the leaders on the backstretch, was hustled along the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. DERZKII broke
equipment (rein) entering the first turn and bore out badly, was pulled up and walked off. GIANT CRITIC reared at the start and unseated his rider, did not
participate and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START CONCERNING GIANT CRITIC SAW THAT THE SAID HORSE RECEIVED A FAIR
START. A SECOND INQUIRY CONCERNING DERZKII AND JELGO MAKE THEIR RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN. DERZKII HAD BROKEN A REIN
MOVING INTO THE TURN CAUSING HIM TO BEAR OUT AND THE RESULTS WERE LEFT AS POSTED.

FUNICULI broke out and bumped with a rival at the start, settled in midpack along the rail, came off the fence turning for home but couldn't find a seam,
dove back to the inside midstretch and got the front at the sixteenth marker, holding safe late. BEYOND BORDERS broke out at the start and was off the
pace, moved up two to four wide on the turn and was on the flank of the winner turning for home out in the four path, came into the six path in midstretch
and closed into second at the seventy yard pole, the winner's inside trip too much for him to overcome. JACK, devoid of early speed, had one rival beat
midway on the turn while on the rail, came off the fence to the four path in upper stretch but went back to the rail at the sixteenth pole and followed the
winner's path to a third place finish with a solid late run. MONEY PRINTER sat three wide stalking the leaders while looking comfortable, loomed four wide
late turn, bid in upper stretch while widest and lugged in on his wrong lead, finally changing to his proper lead late but the top trio was gone. GRANDSON off
the pace, two to three wide trailing on the turn, came into the stretch while laying in, inching up widest when straightening out in the final sixteenth.
GHOSTLINER was four wide early, moved up to stalk and press the leader late backstretch and through the turn, had his head in front turning for home but
was collared immediately and battled on to the furlong pole, swallowed up at that point. AZZURRO was bumped by a rival at the start, chased between foes
around the turn, bid outside top pair turning for home but was out of gas by the sixteenth pole and faded from there. CAPE COD chased the two leaders
along the rail while under restraint, no bid forthcoming when room appeared in upper stretch. STRIBLING led quickly, was stalked and pressed by rivals late
on the turn and headed in upper stretch, retreating from that point.

Footnotes
HITTERS PARK settled off the pace but advanced quickly to mid pack, closed rail-2w turn, launched a determined drive and was up in the late stages under
a drive. FOREST SURVIVOR showed speed, set a pressured pace, shook clear late turn, was put under an all out drive but was caught in deep stretch.
CRAFTY CONQUEST broke outward and bumped OUR ZUMA, stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, moved back to the fence
and closed gamely but was outkicked. SILENT FLASH settled in stalking distance, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely.
SOUPER SUCCESS stalked the pace, closed three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out in the late stages. OUR ZUMA bumped at the
start, settled off the pace, closed late turn but finished evenly along the rail. EXECUTIVE SIGHT raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide through the
turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. ALACRITOUS forced the pace, dropped back at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.
