DIVINE MARTHA set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. ROLLING SLOAN was hustled
from the inside, a factor on the turn and had a bid from the six path in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. CLASSY VISION was off the pace,
trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MARTINI SUE was in touch, raced evenly on the turn, angled out
through the stretch and finished well. SOMEONE ELSE was in range and moved up on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch faded.

Footnotes
FLAXEN stalked the leaders from the outside, took command on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MARVEL
was in mid pack, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. SMARTY ILLUSION was off the pace and had a
mild gain on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. KNEW AS A BREEZE was unhurried early and roused on the far
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. GIGI'S GIFT was up close early and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor.
SEAQUELLE showed speed from the inside but chased on the far turn and was empty.

slim lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held place. OVERSTATE was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path
at the top of the stretch finished well. I AM I SAID settled off the pace, was hustled along on the turn and from the nine path at the top of the stretch closed
inside. STRIKING RED was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch needed more. SAVOIA was in
touch and saved ground on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. TARA EMPIRE was away alertly and had a good position
on the turn but flattened out.

CALL ME WALLY was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up in time. LOQUACIOUS was off
the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch just missed. BE THE CHANGE was in touch and had a slim lead on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. SEAL TEAM TWO forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. TALE OF VIENNA had no speed and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat.
BALA FALLS was up close and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left. AMNESTY set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and was empty.
DYNA'S GAMBLE was hustled early but dropped back on the turn and pulled up in mid stretch.

Footnotes
SPACE GENERAL settled off the pace, was roused on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. ROSA'S SOUL tracked the
early leaders, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path in mid stretch but was caught late. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ set a pressured
pace and had the lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch. SELFLESS DEVOTION was off slow, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share.
STREET TOPPER was in mid pack and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened out. KATZ ME A MONSTER
was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but was never a threat. KECAMEIFYOUCAN was hustled early but chased on the turn and from the four path
at the top of the stretch weakened. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

HESATHRILLER was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. SUMMER RETREAT tracked the leaders from the
outside, forced the pace on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. FREE SPEECH set the pace and had the lead on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. BIG TIME LOUIE was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the three path at
the top of the stretch finished well. SENT FROM HEAVEN was away alertly and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
had no late kick. DE ONLY SOLUTION stalked the early leader and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

WILEY O'RIELLY was away alertly and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. KEEP GOING
tracked from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SOFIA'S SLUGGER
stalked the leader from the inside, had a good position on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. A GERSHWIN TUNE was
unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. NO EXIT was in touch and saved ground on the turn
but was not a factor. KING OF AWESOME had no speed and showed little in a dull effort. CHARLIE'S GAME was off the pace and hustled along on the turn
but failed to fire.

Footnotes
EASY WEEKEND was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch fought gamely for the win. LETTING LOOSE tracked the
leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but was outfinished. CANADIAN SECRET was off the
pace, saved ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. GOLD VENTURE was hustled early and had a slim lead on the
turn but had nothing left. UNO CHAMP was in mid pack and was roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat.
GRAZARION set a pressured pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

TEAM WIN was well back, closed the gap on the turn, rallied late and was up in time. HOLD THE APPLAUSE tracked the leader, was a factor on the turn
and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was caught late. VALLEY GIRL was in mid pack, roused on the turn and had a bid in upper
stretch but evened out. FEATURE CREATURE was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened out.
SEA LILY set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed from the five path at the top of the stretch and gave way. LEON AZUL was off the
pace and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no kick. SHANGHAI KIMMY showed speed from the outside but lost
ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

ANOTHER BREEZE was hustled early, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. BORN TO BE KING was in range,
moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. HALF LIT was in touch, saved ground on the turn and from the three path
at the top of the stretch was up for show. DEALMAKER was away alertly and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way.
TIME TO DANCE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat. ABSTEMIOUS tracked
the early leaders but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. SAVVY'S SISTER was off the pace, showed little and
from the eight path at the top of the stretch was outrun.
