PALATIAL TIMES was off slowly, dropped back early on, moved up wide around the far turn, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and finished
well to just get up under strong handling. TATE was slow early, moved up three to four wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire.
CRISTIANO'S DREAM pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened a bit in the final stages. JIMMY THE KID showed good early speed to set
the early pace along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY lunged at the break, stalked the early going and tired in
the drive. DAGGERBOARD failed to sustain a bid while racing near the inside.

OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was reluctant to load, stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up five wide at the quarter pole and finished well to get up
under strong handling. TUA pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command around the far turn and gave way grudgingly late to finish
willingly to the wire. MISS JASSER settled off the early going, made a steady advance towards the far turn, raced five deep into the upper stretch and was
no match for the top pair. MONKEY ON MY BACK was quick to begin to set all the pace and gave way in the drive. DORA JONES failed to sustain a bid.
MYSTICAL CHARGE dropped back in the early stages and was pulled up in the stretch to be eased. Mystical Charge was vanned off the track.

TRIPLE TIARA was off slow, settled to the middle of the pack early on, moved up three to four wide through the upper stretch and finished well to get up
under strong encouragement. BALI BELLE was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up in the two path through the stretch run while racing
between rivals and finished second best. PRINCESS TERUKO was unhurried in the early stages, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the
upper stretch, angled five wide and made a good late bid. SIGN AND SEAL showed good early speed to lead down the backstretch while being rated down
and weakened in the drive while racing from the inside. WHEREDIDYOUGO was slow early, raced three deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS stalked the early pace from the outside, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. AVIGNON dropped back
early, raced four deep into the lane and never menaced. LIKING IT TWISTED failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
PEARLINTHEROUGH showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and drew off in the stretch to be well clear under steady handling. MI
CASIMIRA chased the early leader while racing up close, raced four wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. HIT A HOMER HONEY
stalked the pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. HELENS
SPIRIT settled off the early going, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had no late rally. CLAIRENSAM settled off the early pace and failed to
respond. ANNIELINO was hustled from the inside and tired. CATHERINES CONNECT was off slowly, raced four wide near the quarter pole and never was
a factor. PEACHTORIAL was slow early and never threatened.
