Footnotes
FORT RIDGE settled in second last, was pushed along in the two to three path on the turn and began to improve, came two wide into upper stretch, split
horses near the three sixteenths, drove clear approaching the furlong pole and drew off while kept to the task. TALE OF THE NILE stumbled at the start,
settled at the rear, gained closer order from near the three eighths while racing in the three path on the turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch,
rallied, and got up for the place inside the final forty yards. FLEETWAY was bumped in the opening strides by POWER CRY, bumped into HIGH HERO as a
result, chased the leading trio between horses early, continued to chase in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on willingly
while no match for the winner, but lost the place late. DEANO attended the pace inside of POWER CRY in the opening furlong, settled back to track the
leading trio approaching the turn, chased while saving ground around the bend, swung four wide into upper stretch and failed to find the needed kick in the
stretch. CROCE D'ORO chased the leading trio outside of FLEETWAY early, settled toward the rear into the turn, was hard urged in the three to four path
past the three eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, was forced further out by TALE OF THE NILE, and lacked the needed rally. HIGH HERO was
bumped by FLEETWAY in the opening strides, pressed the pace outside of POWER CRY, engaged to duel two wide from the seven sixteenths, led two
wide near the five sixteenths, came three wide into the lane and was driven from upper stretch, proved no match for FORT RIDGE approaching the furlong
mark and weakened. POWER CRY broke out and bumped FLEETWAY in the opening strides, was sent for speed, set the early pace while pressured,
dueled inside of HIGH HERO from the seven sixteenths until being headed for good near five sixteenths, chased in range under a drive in upper stretch and
emptied out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES was settled out of striking distance while angling nearer to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes
nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage midstretch and went clear under vigorous hand urging after her rider lost her whip on the far turn. BE
AUTHENTIC angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight to the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being
urged to challenge for command entering the stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. LITTLE CHICK, bumped, then squeezed back at
the start, settled last to the far turn and made an effort to gain position inside foes racing through the stretch. THE MORE I BURN tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, swung five wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression. HOOSIER GOLD CASE, urged along in the
opening stages pursuing the pacesetter to the backstretch, couldn't gain even terms with that foe and gave way racing through the far turn. WILDWOOD
MAGGIE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, continued outside foes to the second turn and faded early. VEGAN
GOES BEST was urged clear of the field shifting well off the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway into the far turn and emptied out abruptly entering
upper stretch.

Footnotes
DARE GOES DA DEVIL chased midpack down the backstretch and into the bend, bid four wide from near the three eighths, floated six wide into the lane,
sustained his rally under a drive, and reeled in the leader in the final forty yards. HOUR CAT broke sharply, took some early pressure from CHEEKERS,
cleared in the two path on the turn, continued clear under a drive in the lane, but was caught late by the winner. TRIPLE CHROME tracked the leading pair
early, saved ground in the tracking flight on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, chased on willingly but proved no match for
the leading pair in the final furlong. MEATABALL broke slowly, settled at the rear early, raced in second last from the nine sixteenths, was urged in the three
path on the turn from the rear of the main group, was driven inside into upper stretch and made mild improvement in upper stretch. WEBCAM grazed the
gate and broke a bit slowly, advanced to track the leading pair outside TRIPLE CHROME, lost position into the turn, chased five wide while urged around
the bend, floated seven wide into upper stretch and had no rally. CHEEKERS hit the gate, was sent to prompt outside HOUR CAT early, settled back to
track three wide on the turn, dropped to the inside in upper stretch and weakened. JACKS SPRING BREAK came inward in the opening strides, chased
midfield through the opening furlong, dropped back to trail approaching the nine sixteenths, lagged in the two path on the turn and had no bid in the lane.

Footnotes
GAGOOTS, reserved dropping off the second flight while shifting well off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance with an early move
three deep nearing the far turn, continued with a steady bid in that path through the second bend to upper stretch and went clear through late stages under
energetic handling. CONI'S COUP moved readily to terms with the pacesetter attending the pace on his own courage racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to press the issue between foes striking the front midway through the far turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive but proved best of the others.
CHARLIECANDO settled last racing to the backstretch while angling inside a rival after the opening quarter, switched outside foes racing into the far turn
while being prompted to advance, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, and continued with interest to improve position in late stages. RETAIN, roused to
gain contention from the outset, tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, saved ground to the lane but had no rally. LAST SPRING
sped to the lead while angling inwards, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the far turn and gave way. KILLER BEE tracked off
the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch but retreated between foes after a half.

Footnotes
JIMMIE T tracked the pace inside of HATCHET CREEK, bid in the two path in tandem with that foe from near the five sixteenths, led narrowly into the lane,
vied with HATCHET CREEK to midstretch, and edged away late under a drive. HATCHET CREEK tracked the leader outside of JIMMIE T, tracked in the
four path on the turn, bid in tandem with JIMMIE T from near the five sixteenths, vied outside of that foe through upper stretch, kept on willingly in the final
furlong but proved only second best. LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased outside of MINISTRY OF ART down the back straight and while driven in the four path
on the turn, came four wide into the lane, chased on and gained late under a drive. MINISTRY OF ART chased inside of LASTFORTINOFAMILY, saved
ground around the turn, swung out and was driven three to four wide in upper stretch, proved no match for LASTFORTINOFAMILY midstretch but chased
on well enough to hold a minor award. LEE LA DEW raced inside of STRATUS STORM in the rear pair, saved ground in the rear path around the turn,
swung out five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally while drifting out late. STRATUS STORM raced two wide in the rear pair, continued in
the three path outside of LEE LA DEW in the rear pair on the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch, and had no rally. BOLD ATTACK was fractious in the
gate, sent to a clear early lead, was clear while saving ground around the turn, faltered into the lane and was not persevered with late.

VALIANT VINNY broke readily to gain a clear advantage racing a bit off the rail, was urged along dictating the pace on a comfortable margin through the
turn and held sway to the end under firm handling. CODETOWIN tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, advanced three deep between foes
racing into the turn to gain striking position but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others. MKAR THE FAST tracked the leaders six
wide on the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide into the turn and continued with interest outside foes to prevail for a share late. HUEY ATTACK
was urged between foes to gain a contending position racing just off the pacesetter in early stages, was shuffled a bit avoiding tight quarters nearing the
turn, but continued evenly between foes into the lane while missing for a share. ARCHIEMYBOY, urged to a forward placing along the rail prompting the
pacesetter,

RICHIESGOTSWAGGER tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, exchanged some contact with ONE PUTT RICHIE nearing the
turn, then continued three deep between foes into the stretch while lacking a rally. ONE PUTT RICHIE off slowly, was held up off rivals in early stages,
exchanged some contact nearing the turn, angled out six wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. LAKE MILLS, urged three deep between rivals
prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch. Z U SOON broke sharply, was caught five wide between rivals in the
opening stages and soon retreated.

Footnotes
GRADE ONE set the early pace while prompted by W W COOKIE MONSTER to his inside, cleared in the two to three path on the turn, raced four wide into
the lane while still clear, kept on under a drive, drifted out late but ultimately held sway. W W COOKIE MONSTER prompted the pace inside of GRADE ONE
early, switched out to chased that foe in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on resolutely, gained late under a drive and
missed. MARKET ANALYSIS tracked the leading pair outside of W W HOTSHOT early, continued to track in the four path on the turn and three wide in
upper stretch, proved no match for the leading pair but kept on best of the rest. DEVILEYE settled well behind the main group, saved ground around the
turn, rallied well in upper stretch while driven two to three wide, but leveled out late. WILE E PEYOTE chased behind the tracking flight, was pushed along
while chasing two wide on the turn, raced three wide in the lane under a drive, and flattened in the final furlong. W W HOTSHOT was fractious in the gate,
tracked the leading pair inside of MARKET ANALYSIS early, settled back past the nine sixteenths, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in
upper stretch and emptied out at the furlong mark. GET HAMMERED broke with the field but gradually settled back with DEVILEYE well behind the rest of
the field, trailed in the three to four path on the turn and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
TRAPPE VALLEY, caught five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing through the backstretch tracking the pacesetter three deep in second
flight, was prompted to advance in that path on the turn to challenge the leader racing into upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked
clear late under firm encouragement. MINE MY TIME tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing into the turn, tipped out in
upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to prevail for the place honors late. YOU SPLIT TENS came through close quarters at the start, shifted
inwards while being prompted to a position tracking just off the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn and continued three deep between foes in late
stages prevailing for a share while missing for second. JETTIN OUT sprinted to the lead along the inside racing into the turn, resisted when challenged by
the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but yielded in late stages. MIAS MOONBEAM, off slowly, was settled last racing to the turn, shifted out four
wide in the stretch but had no rally. TALIS PARK GRAD, a step slow into stride, dropped off the second flight on the backstretch, raced four wide through
the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch but had no closing bid. THE GRAY BLUR ducked out at the start, was collected while dropping off the second
flight and angling inwards early, continued inside foes to the lane but had no closing response.

Footnotes
JUSTENUFFTUFF stumbled at the start, dropped to the inside approaching the first turn, chased inside around the bend, continued at the middle of a strung
out field while angling out doing the backstretch, improved five wide around the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, sustained his rally outside,
drifted in late but nonetheless took over in the final fifty yards. SUPER SILVER tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, tracked three wide down
the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, took the lead three wide at the three eighths, was reengaged by ALLEGIANCE to his inside in upper stretch,
vied outside that foe down the lane, could not hold off JUSTENUFFTUFF late but had enough to secure the place between horses. ALLEGIANCE dueled
inside of CHAPEL BARN through the clubhouse turn, down the back straight, and into the far turn, led inside past the seven sixteenths as CHAPEL BARN
began to weaken, was headed by SUPER SILVER near the three eighths, remained in close range after being passed, reengaged inside of SUPER SILVER
in upper stretch, could not hold off JUSTENUFFTUFF late, and just missed the place in a game attempt. DRIVER DAN chased behind the tracking flight
outside of TAPSOLUTE around the first turn, inched forward down the backstretch to join the tracking flight between horses, tracked the leading trio three
wide around the far turn, kept on in close range three wide in the lane, tried gamely but ultimately missed the place. MAJESTIC DAY settled at the rear, took
gradually closer order while still trailing down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the far turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch while rallying,
and continued to gain well to the wire. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled near the rear, began to take closer order approaching the far turn, rallied strongly two to
three wide around the far turn, continued to improve when driven three wide into the lane, but leveled out late. BEHIND ENEMY LINES settled toward the
rear, took closer order in the four path around the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, swung seven wide into the lane and offered a mild rally in
the lane. TAP THE MOJO chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, continued midfield down the backstretch, offered a five wide rally around the
far turn, and kept on in range to midstretch before flattening out. TAPSOLUTE chased behind the tracking flight inside of DRIVER DAN through the
clubhouse turn, inched forward down the backstretch to join the tracking flight inside, chased along the rail around the far turn, continued to chase on inside
to midstretch and emptied out late. DOLLAR BLUE chased with the middle of a strung out field three wide around the first turn, continued midfield down the
backstretch, took closer order four wide on the far turn and into the lane, but emptied out late. CHAPEL BARN dueled outside of ALLEGIANCE, began to
flatten between between horses near the seven sixteenths, and had no more for the drive.
