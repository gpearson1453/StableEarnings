JESTFUL , checked in tight quarters along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch,
closed outside RIPPOLINO and drove clear late. RIPPOLINO stalked the pace, circled the far turn three deep, took the lead in upper stretch and weakened
late. LEFT BLANK , in hand between horses waiting for room on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. ONE MOST WANTED ,
outrun early, raced very wide around the far turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. TRANSFER THE FUNDS bumped with
LEAVE 'EM LOADED leaving the starting gate, angled to the eight path in upper stretch and finished willingly. LEAVE 'EM LOADED bumped with
TRANSFER THE FUNDS leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside TYLER TIME and weakened. GANDOLFO stalked the pace racing slightly off
the rail and gave way. SUPER SCOOBY , between horses much of the raced, was not a factor. MERKABA gave way. TYLER TIME set the pace along the
inner rail and gave way. CUP MATCH gave way. LET US MAKE GOLD was not a factor.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT UP GUY settled in the clear, gathered momentum off the inside after being asked past the three eighths, moved up four wide entering the lane,
sustained under left handed asking and collared STRIKING IT LUCKY near the sixteenth pole, kept on doggedly and forged ahead in the final yards.
STRIKING IT LUCKY stumbled at the break, quickly recovered and edged up towards the first turn, rated off the inside and the leader opened up past the
five eighths, commenced a run leaving the far turn, bid three deep with a quarter to go, battled on a short lead past the furlong grounds, drifted out a bit
inside the sixteenth pole then stayed on gamely. CRYING FOR MORE , in closest pursuit early on, picked up the chase past the three eighths, bid between
foes nearing the quarter pole, vied to about the sixteenth pole then faded. ROCKIN RON lagged well back, saved ground past the five sixteenths, eased out
with some run past the three sixteenths and kept on with some interest. TINY TIN lacked speed, was ridden along leaving the far turn, came two wide for the
drive and found his best too late. TALES OF SARATOGA opened up early, dropped in and was taken to rate a bit, saw his lead diminish after six furlongs,
met bids with a quarter mile remaining, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened. STAND MY GROUND , unhurried early, circled four wide into the
stretch but failed to respond.

the lead near the eighth pole and finished gamely. ANTIPOISON , two wide the first turn, opened a clear lead on the backstretch, angled in, saved ground
around the far turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and finished willingly. SUPER E raced along the inner rail most of the trip and lacked the needed rally.
LIGHTNING ROD , along the inner rail the first turn, stalked down the backstretch, moved up in the two path between horses on the far turn and gave way in
the drive. POINT OF GRACE , no factor, lost ground on the turns. TWO PRINCES was outrun.

Footnotes
CAIRO BOOGIE had speed then was rated back off the leaders and saved ground to stalk, eased out and was put to solid asking leaving the three eighths
marker, moved up three wide with his sights set on the leader into the lane, wrested command in mid stretch and drew clear under steady handling. MONEY
CODE , in hand prompting outside the leader, moved to engage with about five eighths remaining, sparred from the half mile pole, was roused clear into the
lane, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths then faded while clearly second best. JUMP FREE angled three wide near the seven eighths and
stalked the pace, lodged a mild bid leaving the three quarter pole, failed to kick on with the dueling leaders past the three eighths and faded. NO MONEY
DOWN cleared early, set the pace while a bit keen towards the inside, dueled from the half mile marker, came under a solid ride past the five sixteenths
while holding position then gave in through the final furlong. ARLO BELLO bobbled outward at the break, corrected and moved up four wide into the first
turn, continued well wide into the far turn, had no response past the three eighths and gave way. RIVERLAND , between rivals while in range heading to the
half mile marker, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and dropped back.

upper stretch and had a mild gain between horses. UNORTHODOX , along the inner rail the far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and had a mild
gain. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT set the pace along the inner rail and weakened. TIDDLY WINK , kept wide, was not a factor. CRITICIZE , two wide chasing
the pace, gave way turning for home. CIOPPINO broke sluggishly, was kept behind horses through the stretch and showed late interest. GAMBLING MAN ,

CORN OFF THE COB stalked the dueling leaders while off the inside, was under a hearty ride past the five sixteenths, came three to four wide into the lane,
closed steadily under right handed asking, took command outside CALYPSO GHOST in deep stretch and went clear at the wire. JOYFUL NOISE , off the
contested pace while about two wide, edged up to the inside of the winner into the lane, worked through a narrow opening between foes inside the sixteenth
marker and kept on with good energy to nab the place. CALYPSO GHOST prompted the pace outside MS HEADLEY, moved alongside then took a short
lead leaving the far turn, dueled past mid stretch, braced for outside challenges then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. MS HEADLEY sped clear early
and secured the inside, got involved in a battled past the half mile marker, fought on past mid stretch then faded. SKI BUNNY , off the pace while saving
ground, swung out for the drive but lacked a solid run. GRACE ISABELLA lost ground four wide around the turn, shifted in near the three sixteenths came

Footnotes
NORDIC RHYTHM , rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, began his rally along the rail entering the far turn, swung to the four path leaving the
bend, closed outside horses and took the lead near the sixteenth pole before driving clear. JERRY'S TURN chased the pace two wide for six furlongs,
bumped with VICTORY ANTHEM and finished gamely inside foes. VICTORY ANTHEM , reluctant to load into the starting gate, stalked the pace, moved up
in the three path turning for home, bumped with JERRY'S TURN in upper stretch and flattened out. PREMIERE CHOICE set the pace along the inner rail
and weakened the final furlong. EMPHASIZE lacked speed, raced three deep leaving the far turn and failed to menace. NTH POWER was not a factor.
DOCTOR DOOM was outrun. FAX gave way. An objection by the rider of VICTORY ANTHEM against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was
not allowed.

but failed to threaten. GREYLOVER was lightly steadied when trying to make a run nearing the five eighths, regrouped and gave way. NOTION TO TAPIT ,

Footnotes
ARRIO set the pace along the inner rail, opened a bit on the far turn and prevailed under steady handling. TAPWOOD hugged the inner rail stalking the
pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and rallied. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide, angled to the six path in
upper stretch and rallied. NEOTROPIC trailed to the far turn, swung to the seven path turning for home and rallied outside. BELTWAY BOB , in the four path
turning for home, raced between horses and failed to sustain the needed move. GREAT IDEA worked between horses in the stretch and lacked a rally.
WILLING TO SPEED , three wide both turns, chased the pace to the eighth pole and tired. MAKES MO CENTS saved ground on the far turn, remained
along the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. TAKE PROFIT , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide, was well placed in upper stretch and
faltered. SAINT MARCO chased the pace outside the winner and faltered.

Footnotes
MET IN MIAMI eased back from between rivals near the three quarter pole, dropped in and advanced mid turn, came back out to take aim on the dueling
leaders in upper stretch, made a grinding run under solid handling and moved past GHOST MAIDEN in the final yards. GHOST MAIDEN prompted the pace
inside, eased out into the turn, bid two wide outside SUGAR SNAP leaving the far turn, got into a duel with that one soon after, sparred on a short lead past
mid stretch then just could not withstand the winner's run. SUGAR SNAP cleared early and set the pace two wide, secured the inside around the turn, dug in
when confronted past the three eighths, fought on to the sixteenth pole then faded late. UNION TATTERS , unhurried early, saved some ground while well
back mid turn and failed to respond. BELLSWILLBERINGING stalked the pace three wide, took closer order into the far turn, failed to kick on mid turn and
retreated. PORT EVE stumbled at the break and dropped far back.
