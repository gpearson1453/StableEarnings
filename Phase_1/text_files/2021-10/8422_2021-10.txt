Footnotes
CLEVER LIL SIS showed good speed and had the rail opened a clear lead up the backstretch and held the margin through the lane. BONES AND ROSES
came through along the inside to move into second was trying to cut into the margin but ran out of distance. FLY DONNA FLY was well back early made a
three path move on the turn and in the stretch for third while never a threat to the top two. SEIZE IT showed early speed but was caught three wide and
dropped back. TRULY CLASSIC showed some early speed in the two path but tired. OOGA OOGA MOOSKA raced four wide for much of the race and was
never a serious factor. OMAHASETGEAUX was up close for the first half and then began a steady fade. OUR LADY BLING raced mid pack then was eased
at the top of the stretch and walked off.

JUST REMEMBER was away very quickly and was able to get to the rail steadily increased the margin through the stretch. SEATTLE TWIST sat just off the
pace and was able to get to the inside came through along the rail and was up for second. SMACKFIRE came five wide entering the stretch but could not
hold second. SWEET CAPRI came four wide on the turn and was outfinished late. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER raced mid pack for much of the race and
offered no rally. HEAVENLY ARCH was off a step slow raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. NON DISCLOSURE raced three wide on the turn
and could not make up ground. WHAT NOW MY LOVE was off a bit slow and trailed throughout and was not asked down the stretch.

Footnotes
MY FIRST PEARL raced three wide throughout dropped back just a bit in the stretch but came on again to catch the leader in the final jump. SHE'S SMART
ENOUGH showed good speed on the inside as part of a four horse speed duel took a short lead in the stretch but was caught in the final jump. CELEE'S
LAST TE was caught four wide in the speed duel and could not go with the top two in the late stages. PRANKED was behind the four horse speed duel and
could not make up the ground when asked. A BUNCH FOR LUNCH chased the pace well behind the frontrunners and could not make up ground. ALWAYS
A TIZ was the quickest in the early stages and had the rail but gave way quickly on the turn. BONNIE AND trailed from the outset and was not a serious
factor.
