Footnotes
MISS JIMMY Away well, showed the way along the three path into the turn, dropped down a path into the lane, responded when roused, widened some and
was ridden out. HANNAH DANCES Tracked along the three path, lodged a bid outside, gained some and finished clearly best of the rest.
LETMETAKETHISCALL Tracked early, saved ground on the turn and weakened inside. WILLOW GROVE Lagged back four wide on the turn and finished
wide while never in it. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING Reared badly at the start spotting the field three lengths, two path on the turn and tired.
TREATHERLIKESTAR Three path on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
DR. FLASH Away on top, showed the way along the rail, responded when asked and outran TRISAETUM to the wire. TRISAETUM Well placed in hand,
took the rail into the last turn, tracked into the lane, eased out and finished well while bumped by the winner. ANOTHER SHOT Broke slow, unhurried along
the three path, saved ground on the last turn and then was no match for top pair. COSMIC COWBOY Lagged back along the rail, four wide into the last turn,
three path out of it and finished wide. HURRICANE ALPHA Unhurried four wide on the turns and tired. STARSHIP GOTHAM Tracked along the two path,
dropped back three from the rail on the last turn and tired. MAGIC GRITS Broke slow, four wide into the first turn, three path into the last one and tired.
RUSTY DE Three path on the first turn and was done early. FIELD PATROL Refused to break. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the start, resulted
in no change.
