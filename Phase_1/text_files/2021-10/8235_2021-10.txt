Footnotes
OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND broke well then sat just off the pace, gained steadily under urging and was along in time. FLAT OUT LEADER broke alertly then
quickly angled in to secure a rail position and was worn down late stretch. BONANZA CREEK hustled away, swung out into the lane and improve late under
steady encouragement. BEAR BRIAN chased the pacesetters from the five path, went in pursuit of the leaders nearing the quarter pole and was outkicked
for show. OUR MONEY CAT lacked early foot, tracked four wide and failed to threaten in drive. DITES MOI failed to produce a bid. COMMISSION MAN
chased four to five wide and gave way. POOR RUBEN outrun throughout. DIVALDO was quickly gapped then was pulled up in the far turn, did not finish
and walked off.

Footnotes
SARAHS ELEGANCE allowed to settle inside early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE at the quarter
pole, battled determinedly outside and prevailed. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE cleared rivals racing into the opening turn, held good margins throughout the
backstretch, responded gamely to challenge from SARAHS ELEGANCE then reluctantly ceded in the final yards. CAPA BELLA raced in closest pursuit,
raced three wide into the far turn, chased through the stretch but was no match for the top two finishers and just held for show. PIPER ROSE trailed the
field, gained closer contention into the final turn, was all out through stretch and missed. SMART FIX raced mid pack from the four path and lacked a closing
response. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY fanned three wide into the opening turn and tired early.

but emerged the leader racing into the backstretch, led the field to the far turn, was joined by DANCE SHOES but had no response in the drive and finished
best of the others. AWESOME GIGI took a hold shortly after leaving the gate, stalked the pace while three wide and was done early. ZELDA'S WISDOM
drifted out into the opening turn, tracked inside and failed to produce a bid. CUVEE TEE never reached contention. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI tracked three to

ONEOFTHEMGIRLS broke in bumping into TAKE ME TO BATTLE, drew clear quickly taking command, widened through the final turn, bore out at the head
of the stretch and finished under a confident hand ride. FOREVER LADY rated off the pace along the rail, chased the leader into the stretch, was gaining
late but was no match for winner. DRAGON WING chased along rail, angled out and improved mid stretch. SASSY BUT CLASSY raced wide avoiding
inside rival, raced three wide into the far turn, began bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened in stretch. STEVIE WONDER GIRL lacked a bid. LIL'MISS
INTAGLIO offered little. RED ECHO never reached contention. PHANTOM POWER hustled outside then chased wide through the backstretch and tired.
TAKE ME TO BATTLE bumped leaving, lugged out throughout and.

Footnotes
BOSS MAN CAN rated a short lead angling towards the rail gradually, saved ground through the final turn, responded to looming threat by FLASHFORDANI
and won going away. FLASHFORDANI sat just off the pace inside, steadied entering the far turn, loomed boldly near the quarter pole but was no match for
the winner. WILDCAT WILLY chased the pacesetters from the two path, lodged a rail bid and finished evenly. ABOVE AND BEYOND tracked outside,
fanned four wide into the far turn and came up empty for the drive. FIRST BASE failed to produce a bid. UPTOME stalked four wide early and faded
steadily. ZURI RISASI was not a factor. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH outrun throughout. YNOTGIVEITAGO steadied away from the gate and never reached
contention. SPOT ON DUDE tracked inside, steadied in the far turn and gave way. JOCKEY OBJECTION - An objection lodged by the rider of
FLASHFORDANI against the rider of BOSS MAN CAN alleging interference into the far turn was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
THESHACK sat in striking distance while three wide, asked to quicken leaving the backstretch, spun three to four wide into the lane, matched strides
outside of SMART PLAY, dug in in the final strides and narrowly prevailed. SMART PLAY contested the early pace from just off the rail, dueled through the
far turn inside of PAPICHULO, was met with a challenge at the quarter pole, battled determinedly inside and got denied by the nose. NEVVARE raced four
wide into the opening turn, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, circled field, gained outside and dueled for show. COMMON KNOWLEDGE
reserved off the pacesetters, rallied through drive under urging and was bested late. BUCK WEST steadied inside approaching the first turn, trailed the field,
drifted in through the drive and lacked the kick required. MARIA'S SONG stalked the pacesetters, cut the corner in the last turn and gave way inside through
stretch. SPORTSCARR lacked early speed and passed tiring. PERDITION never far back early and faded steadily with two furlongs remaining.
PAPICHULO pressed the pace four wide into the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival and stopped. BANG ON tracked the pacesetters while four
wide, advanced outside in the final turn and wilted abruptly.
