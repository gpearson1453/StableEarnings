Footnotes
MATOULA bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, took the advantage with a half-mile to run, controlled the action in
the two path on the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well when set down at the three-sixteenths, was put to a left-handed crop
coming to the furlong marker, remained under the crop until near the sixteenth-pole then was hand ridden to the wire while much the best. STRONG POINT
was bumped at the start and forced into another foe then pinched back, settled towards the rear on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, went
four then five wide on the turn, was roused in good striking range at the quarter-pole and safely secured the place while unable to reach the winner. MALIBU
ANTHEM broke in and bumped with an opponent, settled off the pace, was asked while three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response
while clear for the show. BONANA FANNA FOE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased three wide into the stretch
and came up empty. ELEGANT LAOBAN was crowded against the rail early, settled off the pace, was asked while moving from the inside to the two path on
the turn and failed to respond. DECREED was well placed just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail while roused outside the
five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch and had nothing left. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON broke very awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front several
lengths, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the crop and was no factor. ANGELOVERTHEPULPIT lost her footing behind a
bit at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead with a half-mile to run and stopped then was distanced in
the stretch.

quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. TOP GUN TOMMY was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and finished with good courage to get the
place. BLU GROTTO broke out then was corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, climbed some while inside early on the turn, angled four wide near the
three-eighths then moved to five wide around the five-sixteenths, chased outside into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and was
out-kicked then lost the place while clear for the show. GIOCARE was urged from the gate then settled at the rear, departed the backstretch in the two path
then shifted three wide, moved to the five path before the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. F F ROCKET broke out at the start, settled on
the outside, went three wide early on the turn, shifted four wide coming to the five-sixteenths then was asked, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.
MR. BRIGGS prompted the pace on the outside under a snug hold, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and had nothing left.

three-eighths pole then shifted three wide, was asked four wide at the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong then drifted in and prevailed under steady urging. SERVE THE KING (GB) settled on the

the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the place. GUFO bumped with a rival at the start then was in a bit tight, was reserved on the inside at the rear,
moved off the hedge with six furlongs to run, made an early four wide rally on the final turn, closed fast to get the lead at the five-sixteenths, came out to the
four path turning into upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner around the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the
show. CHANNEL MAKER went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead with three furlongs to run,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. ARKLOW pulled under tight restraint on the opening straightaway, shifted to the two path on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the nine-sixteenths pole, took the lead in the two path with three furlongs to run, was headed passing the

rounded the opening bend in the two path, was reserved on the outside, advanced three wide in tandem with GUFO to his outside on the final turn, waited
briefly behind a foe at the three-eighths then was roused, came four wide into the stretch then had his path taken briefly and failed to respond. CROSS

Footnotes
PHANTOM SMOKE three then two wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
tipped out a path straightened away and rallied to engage the top pair nearing the sixteenth marker, took over seventy yards from home and inched away to
the finish to prevail. SHERIFF BIANCO vied briefly from the four path with a pair before easing off to press the leader three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch engaging the leader in head to head combat, dug in under a
drive dueling through to the finish getting by SAMAY inside the final seventy yards to procure the place honors. NEURO broke out at the start and was
corrected, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. SAMAY hustled from the gate, vied briefly with a pair from the two path before having sole
possession of the front, came under increasing pressure from SHERIFF BIANCO to the outside through the turn and was placed to coaxing three furlongs
from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging stubbornly to command until collared seventy yards from home, then got
outfinished in the very last jump to the wire in a good effort. MORE LIKE IT five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. UNCLE GEORGE coaxed
from the gate, raced four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path five furlongs from home, tucked inside through the turn, cornered two to three wide
into upper stretch and made late headway to the finish. VOLKERT chased along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MASKED MARAUDER a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. OUR TROUBADOUR five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide into the turn and was taken hold of near the three-eighths tucking briefly to the two path, got let out angled six wide into upper stretch and
offered no rally. BROCKMONINOFF broke out at the start and was corrected, vied briefly outside a pair five paths off the inside before easing off to chase
four then three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch under a drive and weakened in the stretch. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION
THE FIVE EIGHTHS TIME WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
VILLAINOUS was last to commence, settled towards the rear, moved from the inside to the three path while getting closer on the turn, was roused outside
the five-sixteenths then rallied at the quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead in upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and
prevailed under good handling. DADDY KNOWS went to the front, set the clear pace while racing with his head cocked a bit to the inside, showed the way
while well off the inside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail at the three-eighths, lost the lead to the winner in upper
stretch, kept on well in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. HEAVY ROLLER was rated on the outside while forwardly placed, went three
then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened but just held the show. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS settled in the back half of the field on the outside, bumped with CANTRELL HILL outside the
