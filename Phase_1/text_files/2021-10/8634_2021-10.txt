Footnotes
CAJUN INVASION chased close up wide, led at the five sixteenths pole and edged ahead while drifting in slightly through stretch. WHIZWIT saved ground
throughout, steadied along near midstretch then angled out while outfinished. YO NESSROUNDONKERN raced off the pace and offered some late energy.
STREET FACTS dropped back outside then closed gap too late. LIFE ON THE NILE raced just behind the pacesetters, swung wide in the stretch but came
up empty. IMPERIAL BIRD moved clear in the opening quarter, dueled on the turn and faded. LYING JEFF lacked speed and was never in contention.
NEGLIGENCE broke slowest and was always outrun. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

leaders, rallied clear on the final turn and just missed in a very game effort. DR. FERBER trailed early, moved wide in the stretch but was no match for the
top pair. KRATOS set a pressured pace inside to the final turn and faltered. UNIDENTIFIED MAN angled inside on the first turn then lacked a rally. MAID
THE JOURNEY pressed the pace outside then gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MUTAKAAMIL rated off the pace, awaited room on the turn, moved to the front at the head of the stretch and drew away driving. PANNA MINE broke a step
slowly, angled inside then was up for the place late. JAIME JAMEL hustled to the front inside to the stretch then weakened. MAGIC OF LOVE prompted the
leader to the stretch and faltered. CONFUSION chased wide within range down the backstretch then stopped on the turn.
