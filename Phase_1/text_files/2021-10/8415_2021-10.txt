Footnotes
SARAH'S WARRIOR settled back off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch,
dug in to take over inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards. BAYS CASTLE rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the
pace leaving the turn, dueled at even terms with MOIRAINE nearing the seven sixteenths pole and put that one away while outfinished most of the final
sixteenth, while the latter rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid with Bays Castle leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, though, relented in the duel for second. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS drew off to a long
early lead, was caught at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and faded through the far turn. IHEARTRAINACOMN saved ground off the pace, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, showed little response and was not encouraged the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
STYLISH PAINT chased the pace through the backstretch and improved at the rail on the turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was steadily
handled to hold off.LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT, who pressured the pace two deep and contested at a close disadvantage through the turn, was forced
outward toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady stretch handling to finish well while gaining on the winner. UNCANNY set a pressured pace
inside, contested the advantage at the rail on the turn, drifted out nearing the head of the lane, gave up the lead past the eighth pole then ceded second
inside the sixteenth. FIGHTRESS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and five paths then flattened stride later yards. COME AND
GET IT gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. STOP TALKING steadied at the start then angled to the outside to give chase,
but proved to be no factor.

LONG GRAY LINE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn
and was only mildly urged to draw off. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM saved ground then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and dug in to take second later yards. CARTER'S RUN rounded the opening turn in the four path
and rated close past the seven eighths pole, took the lead past the nine sixteenths, was met nearing the seven sixteenths, dueled with the edge from that
point but was caught midway on the far turn and weakened. ENVISION SUCCESS rounded the first turn in the four path then closed toward contention
three wide on the second turn, moved to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths, gave chase through the backstretch then flattened leaving the far
turn. WHAT A STORY dropped well back from contention while saving ground and could only improve his position at the rail. CRAZY IDEA saved early
ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path then weakened. CASTLE BOUND
rated a short lead inside, was met nearing the three quarter pole and recovered the edge into the second turn, but gave up the lead past the nine sixteenths

clear into the stretch and was steadily handled. C R'S MANDATE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure when met by Strong Lil Kokoro at the seven
sixteenths pole, put that one away into the far turn but was met by the winner midway on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and had to settle for second
best. MODERN DAY ROMANCE rounded the first turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole

MANAROLA angled to the outside to give chase, drew close three wide nearing the top of the stretch, took over past the eighth pole, ran clear mid-stretch
and widened later yards. FEAR THE DIVA was hustled along to set a pressured pace, angled in past the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge
nearest the rail on the turn, but was caught inside the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. TALENT EXPECTED became fractious in the gate then
pressured the pace inside, lost momentum off the heels of Fear The Diva approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail, angled four wide into the
stretch and finished evenly. GOT YOUR NUMBER pressured the pace inside, checked off the heels of Fear The Diva leaving the five sixteenths pole, ran in
the three path of the turn, angled to the five path into the lane and finished evenly. MOSLER'S TOUCH chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn
about the four path and showed little further. PROSPECTIVE CANDY engaged in close chase through the backstretch, dueled a close factor two deep on
the turn but gave way leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
WHO'S YOUR DADDY set the pace off the rail, drew away on the turn and was kept alert through the stretch. EVA'S GIRL GRACE broke a bit rank then
gave chase leaving the chute, improved in the five and six paths of the turn, entered the stretch outside and closed for second mid-stretch. MS. GUCCI
GIRL chased, rounded the turn off the rail then dueled through the final sixteenth for third. JANIESSWEETMELISSA pressured the pace two deep while
between horses but dropped back past the quarter pole and was outfinished for third the final sixteenth. RED LIL SHIPMENT chased inside, rounded the
turn near the rail and showed little further. PLAY CHARADES chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and passed rivals in the lane.
SUPER EIGHTY EIGHT was not a factor. BRONX PRINCESS pressured the pace, raced in the four path of the turn then weakened. MABEL'S FABLE gave
chase outside then faded in the five path of the turn. GOING STRAPLESS was not a factor.
