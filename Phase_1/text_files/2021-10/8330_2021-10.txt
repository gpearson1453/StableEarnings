Footnotes
ALOHA KITTEN stumbled badly at the start, settled on the inside then went between rivals on the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane, battled with
the runner-up in deep stretch and proved best. PISTACHIO PRINCESS sped to the front from inside, showed the way to the far turn, held a short lead
through the second bend, cleared in upper stretch, fought with ALOHA KITTEN through the final sixteenth, could not fend off that rival but kept on gamely to
the finish. FRAZZLED got shuffled between rivals at the start, swung five wide into the lane, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and closed well for third. GO
GRETA (GB) was closest in pursuit from the two path or outside the leader, bid alongside around the far turn, lost contact in upper stretch and flattened to a
minor award. ST HELENA stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and lacked a late bid. STARSHIP SKY became rank
and altered around GOLDEN VOICE on the first turn, raced near the back of the pack, exited the far turn two wide, was in tight between runners in upper
stretch and could not rally after gaining a clear path. HIGHTAILING was off a bit slow to begin, was hard to ride then angled three wide on the first turn,
raced close up outside the top pair in the middle stages, came four wide into the drive, shifted out in upper stretch and weakened. GOLDEN VOICE was
rank and drifted out on the first turn, came back to the three path then got floated out four wide still on the clubhouse turn.

C FALLS sped to the front and angled to the inside, shook free around the far turn, urged right-handed in the lane and held well in the closing moments.
MIDNIGHT JOSTAR off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the beginning, went four deep on the backstretch, three wide into the far turn, exited the bend four
wide and closed well to earn the place. NERVES OF STEEL stalked the pace from inside, shifted to the two path leaving the second bend, chased the
winner through the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BEST CHANCE traveled two wide then between rivals, came out on the far turn and exited the
bend five wide, drifted inward in the lane and showed a mild rally. LIAR LIAR (IRE) stumbled in the beginning, saved ground through the turns, pressed
upon leaving the second bend, urged right-handed in the drive and needed to find more. EAST RAND off a bit slow to begin, settled off the rail, went three
deep at the midway point, traveled between leaving the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. BEE CATCHER tracked between

two wide into the lane and flattened out. OPERATIC tucked inside early, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled three wide around the far
turn, steered out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. LADY O'PRADO traveled three wide around the first turn, moved out wider on the backstretch,

Footnotes
SHIZAAM (IRE) showed early speed to take command, controlled the pace up the backstretch, padded the lead around the far turn, maintained a
comfortable advantage into the final sixteenth and held the runner-up at bay. VIAZAR raced off the pace early on, angled three wide around the far turn,
rallied three deep with a furlong to go and was gaining to the wire. BASILIA tracked outside a rival in mid-pack, driven two wide into the stretch, chased
between foes at the eighth pole, showed late interest but was not enough to get by the top pair. AGREETODISAGREE off a bit slow from inside, unhurried
at the back early on, moved to the two path around the second bend and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) was
closest in pursuit in the two path or along the inside, saved ground to the stretch then moved off the rail a bit stretch and flattened out. BESTRELLA (IRE)
raced outside a rival off the pace, went three then four wide around the far turn and failed to menace. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) stalked inside then pulled a
bit early on the backstretch, remained inside to the stretch and lacked a rally.

I KNOW CASH FLOW dueled inside SAULS CALL early, cleared at the half-mile pole, challenged again by that rival on the turn, fought back from inside to
the lane, battled down the stretch and held gamely. SAULS CALL dueled for command early from outside, lost contact past the half-mile pole, re-bid around
the turn, battled down the stretch and could not summon the needed late punch in deep stretch. BARSABAS chased the top pair along the inside through
the turn, hugged the rail into the stretch, tipped off the inside and kept on for a clear third. SHORTMAN off slow from outside, trailed three then two wide
around the turn, improved position in the stretch run but never threatened. PRINCE HUSSAR off slow to begin, entered the turn four wide, moved down to
the three path and weakened. FINGLAS LAD tracked off the inside, went three then four wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GIDGETTA chased near the back early on, angled three wide around the turn, steered out further in the stretch, flew late and got up three deep on the line.
A G INDY dueled for the lead from outside, held a narrow advantage around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and got nailed at the wire. BRUJA
ESCARLATA stalked the pace from inside, waited for room around the turn, tipped out and went between rivals in upper stretch, rallied outside the leader
and between rivals near the wire to finish a game third. BEAUTIFUL BALLAD stalked the pace outside a rival, chased three deep in upper stretch and
lacked the needed bid. FIRST STAR sat at the back outside a rival, went two wide around the turn and failed to menace. FIVE PICS PLEASE got crowded
between rivals leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside into and around the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. ROAD RAGER chased in
the two path from off the pace into the turn, traveled a bit off the rail through the turn and could not rally.

Footnotes
AQUA JULIA dropped back early, lagged behind through the turn, came out into the stretch, steered widest in the lane, unleashed a strong rally and inhaled
the runner-up. I GOT A GAL stalked the pace from outside, bid three deep on the turn, gained command in upper stretch, led clear with a sixteenth
remaining and got run down late. BUTTERFLY BARB raced off the pace, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and held the
show. A PAYCHEQUE SMILE tossed his head and came away slow, went four wide through the turn, summoned a mild rally but failed to get up for the
show. MUY CHISTOSA pressed the pace from outside, vied between on the turn, gained command leaving the turn, overtaken in upper stretch and
flattened inside in the final sixteenth. SO IT WOULD SEEM stumbled leaving the gate, chased along the rail then two wide into the stretch and never
responded to the left-hand. SHE'S SO SHINY set the pace with pressure alongside, vied with a pair of foes around the turn, relinquished control leaving the
bend and weakened in the stretch run. BROCADE tracked off the rail, four wide into the turn, angled in a few paths and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
QUINEVERE (GER) raced between rivals or two wide on the first turn, traveled in range in the middle stages, driven two wide into the lane, angled out in
upper stretch, drew alongside the runner-up inside the sixteenth pole and overhauled that foe to prove best. FLORAL ESSENCE stalked the pacesetter from
inside, steadied off heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted out for a clear path but was in tight early on the turn, bid between at the quarter pole, bumped
with rival while taking over into the stretch, led into deep stretch and could not fend off the winner. JUDY WITH GRACE stumbled at the start, tracked three
then two wide around the first turn, moved out in the stretch and gained the show. SKY ON ICE was off a bit slow to begin, raced five wide up the
backstretch then angled back into the three path for the second bend, moved out in upper stretch and got outfinished for the show honors. CHANTAL broke
out and brushed rival, came back in and bumped RENEGADE PRINCESS repeatedly, bid three deep at the quarter pole, bumped with rival into the stretch
and flattened in the final furlong. GOLDEN JOURNEY stalked the pace outside a rival, took over into the far turn, challenged by a pair of rivals at the quarter
pole, lost the lead into the lane and weakened. RENEGADE PRINCESS got bumped repeatedly from outside and checked soon after the start, trailed three
wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. BADGER KITTEN bobbled leaving the gate, pulled a bit into the first turn, remained in hand while moving off the
rail, angled out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and could not rally. SUGAR PLUM sped clear from outside, angled to the two path around the
clubhouse turn, moved the inside and showed the way up the backstretch, overtaken into the far turn, chased along the fence to the lane and faded.
