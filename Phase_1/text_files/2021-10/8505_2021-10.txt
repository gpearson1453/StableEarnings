Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, waited while poised to strike from the five-sixteenths to the
three-sixteenths, was asked at that point then moved out for room, accelerated to the front inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging.
REGAL QUALITY settled on the inside of a foe, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the seven-sixteenths, stalked outside from that point,
was asked near the quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and proved no match while
clear for the place. DIRECT ORDER settled well back on the outside, was urged in the three path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed response while up for the show. BLEWITT bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way with some
company to his outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive into upper stretch and tired. PLAYWRIGHT bumped
with a foe at the start, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside early on the turn, moved to the two path just inside the three-eighths, was driven four
wide into the stretch, moved further out around the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SUPREME AURA prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the
three path under urging on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and had nothing left. GRIT AND GLORY settled
comfortably on the outside, dropped back fast while four then five wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SHUTTERS three wide in pursuit in the clear, remained patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, inched away under a drive before coming under late threat and held on kept to task to prevail. MR. CONNECTICUT just off the inside tracking
from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to close in the late stages but was
ultimately rebuffed to the finish. UMBRIA just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over
command straightened away, dug in and was collared a furlong from home, kept on clear of the rest for the show honors. BERNARDINO rated on the pace
along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened.
MIGHTY MEISTER just off the inside at the tail of the field, grew detached from the main body of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before
angling six to seven wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW broke out a bit while away in front, contested the pace on the inside of three foes, vied along the rail on the turn, moved to a length
lead passing the five-sixteenths, was asked under threat at the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the runner-up while rubbing saddles some in the stretch and
gamely prevailed under strong handling. MAHAAMEL was urged along behind a four-way pace dispute, moved closer in the two path on the turn, gained to
make a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner while rubbing saddles some in the stretch and was denied but well clear for the place. RISK
PROFILE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start and unseated the rider but was held onto well by the assistant starter, was brought back
around and reloaded, came away at the rear of the field, was urged along at the back, saved ground on the turn, moved closer with five-sixteenths to run,
swung three wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while far clear for the show. PERFECT MUNNINGS was hustled from the start, disputed the
pace between horses, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and tired. SCOCCIATORE attended the pace on the
outside while in hand, was let out in the four path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. SOUTH AFRICA contested the pace between
horses, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths, dropped back three wide into the stretch and retreated.

BLUE ATLAS four then three wide rated at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path half a mile from home before briefly going inside, tipped back to the
two path three furlongs out, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final
furlong taking command just inside the sixteenth pole, dug in to prevail at the wire. BEE BIT coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command spinning three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug
in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, fought on inside to the finish. FIVE ALARM ROBIN three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. FLASHING RED coaxed from the start, chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FOXTAIL chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, bid three to four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. AMOS established the front and

and tired. GOOD SKATE brushed with a foe after the start while hustled, showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, went three wide early on the
