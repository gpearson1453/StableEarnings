Footnotes
PREDESTINED prompted the early pace inside of KICKEN WEST G., inherited the lead leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, drew
clear and kept to task. SMALL TOWN DUDE rated well off the pace, took closer order into the far turn, swung out to the four path, chased through the
stretch but was no match for the winner and finished clearly second best. SILVER PRAIRIE tracked the pacesetters while three to four wide, went in pursuit
of leader nearing the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive but finished best than the others. GRADY'S SONG fanned three wide into the opening
turn, settled in the four path through the backstretch and tired early. KICKEN WEST G. vied outside into the opening turn, set a pressured pace, was unable
to move on with rival and faded steadily. SMILEY lacked running room along the rail leaving the opening turn, shifted outside leaving the backstretch and
was done early. PIPPA dwelt at the start, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race
but made no change. After review, PIPPA was deemed to have had a fair start and dwelt on the break.

Footnotes
EDDYSHAK prompted the pace inside from just off the rail, gained an advantage under a snug hold, turned back challenge from ZICATELA at the head of
the lane and held safely. ZICATELA vied outside for the early lead, attended the pace while four wide, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole, was no
match for the winner and gained late but was no real threat. MR. DAZZLE sat in range while five wide, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, went five wide
off the turn, rallied late and narrowly held for show. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE was jostled leaving the chute, chased inside in the far turn, improved steadily
inside and missed out for show. BACKSTREET BOBBY bumped repeatedly entering the backstretch, drove four wide near the quarter pole and was unable
to improve position through drive. MIDNIGHT SALUTE lagged early and showed little. MARK YE WELL tracked wide through the backstretch and was
outrun. DOUGS PAL raced up between foes under a snug hold and stopped with two furlongs remaining.

Footnotes
DENSE FOG raced five wide leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetters while four wide, moved up alongside FINALLY GOTTCHA near the quarter pole,
edged away into the stretch and drew clear late. FINALLY GOTTCHA pressed the pace while four wide, gained a slim lead in the final turn, was met by
DENSE FOG but lacked rally that was needed and just held for place. PRESS GANG lagged early, swung wide into the lane, bid steadily outside and
surged late to earn show honors. GEM ALTA raced five wide leaving the backstretch, gained gradually and was edged out late. SLEWMACH chased from
the back of the field and bid belatedly. BUCKYS PICK saved inside and failed to threaten. RUCK stalked inside and failed to produce a bid. CABIN JOHN
showed little. THISDEWARSFORYOU went four wide entering the backstretch to set the pace, was overtaken and gave way.

Footnotes
STRONG AND FREE unhurried early, sat in striking distance while three wide, went in pursuit of the leader in the far turn, gained steadily then collared
FAST EH in the final sixteenth and edged away late. FAST EH set the pace while four wide, moved clear leaving the backstretch, was collared mid stretch
and finished second best. JIMMY FLASH flashed early speed angling in to secure a inside position, chased the leaders through the stretch and held sway.
SPIRIT RACER sat mid pack and went evenly through stretch, missing out late for show. REMAIN CALM chased wide through the backstretch, lodged a rail
bid at the head of the stretch and was unable to improve position through drive. DRAYTON offered a late mild bid. HUNTERS PRIDE hustled inside away
and faded early stretch. ARCTIC REIGN showed little. ROUGIE BOY chased throughout to no avail. IT'S ALL OVER was outrun throughout.
