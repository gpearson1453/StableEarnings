inside, angled out in the stretch for the runner up spot. SARAH JANE no speed early, swept up outside into stretch for show spot. QUEEN AIR pressed
pace three wide to turn, stayed to deep stretch, faltered. LUCKY DOUBLE D'S raced midpack to the turn with no gain in the stretch. MILWAUKEE CAT
through early, never menaced thereafter. CHLOES ANGEL bit tardy, rushed to the lead, gave way readily in the stretch. EDGE never really factored.
LOVELY LADY LINDA rushed inside early, could not keep up and dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
HERE AND VOW pressed leader to the turn, took over past quarter pole, cleared. LONGDRINKOFWATER inside run to the turn, angled out for clear run,
no match. NAUGHTY NELLIE raced evenly outside with an outside run for the show spot. SWEET TASSA off slow, no speed to the turn, angled widest and
improved late. BRODY'S GIRL never a real menace. TWO MORE TIMES raced evenly from inside, never untracked in the stretch. MY ALIMONY inside
speed to quarter pole, faded in the stretch run. TOUCH BY FELICTY close up to turn, faded back steadily. KHOZYS CROWN never fired at any time.
