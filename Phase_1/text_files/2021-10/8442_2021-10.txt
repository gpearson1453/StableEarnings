Footnotes
MACH ONE broke out at the start, settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up four then three wide on the turn, took the lead into the stretch then
shook clear under a drive, drifted out twice while responding well under a right-handed crop and proved best under strong urging. RISKY WOODS bumped
with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide around the three-eighths, was driven five wide
into upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. WHERE'S JOEY bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch,
raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive, kept on to the wire and just missed the place while clear
for the show. MOTION TO STRIKE had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, was hustled to the lead and set the clear pace, raced inside on the turn, was
headed by the winner at the quarter-pole and weakened. BECKENBAUER bumped with a foe at the start then was sent hard, chased the pace, went three
then two wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. OCEAN DEEP made light contact with an opponent at the start then was
taken up, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. DOS VAQUEROS was urged along off the pace, dropped
back three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SHE'S A MIA away well and to the front, settled tracking from just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals and held gamely to the finish kept to task.
ROBYN AND ELI coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home, dug in under a drive fighting on inside the aforementioned foe to the wire but was ultimately denied. FONTANAFREDDA saved ground near the rear
until tipped out four wide through the turn, got placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied into contention a
furlong out, dug in unable to make late headway and was repelled to the finish. QUEENS DANCER established the front and crossed to show the way in
hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch roused, dug in under threat from a trio and was collared a
furlong out, weakened in the late stages. MY CARA MIA MINE three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish. ROOSKI coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped six wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SHE'S A NATURAL chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got bumped by THEFABUOLOUS MOOLAH as that rival came in straightened away and in
turn bumped CRICKET WEST into the rail, then offered no rally. CRICKET WEST three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, saw THEFABULOUS MOOLAH coming inwards and altered in to the two path for escape, then got bumped solidly by SHE'S A
NATURAL due to pressure from THEFABULOUS MOOLAH and struck the fence before weakening to the finish. LEMME GET IT forwardly placed three
then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch.

right handed crop and shied inwards straightened away bumping SHE'S A NATURAL into CRICKET WEST, then tired in the drive. BUFFALO DANCER

Footnotes
CLEAR VISION went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole and drew off under a strong drive. BOURBON IN MAY settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn, came off the rail in
upper stretch, angled out into the final furlong and got up for the place. SMILE BRYAN settled in the middle of the field, was asked in the two path on the far
turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. ARTEMUS BRIDGE settled on the outside, was asked
three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PARLOR was taken under a tight hold early then rated in third position
on the outside, went around the far turn in the four path, was roused outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SHARP PROSPECT bobbled some at

SPUN D'ETAT hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking to the inside through the turn, took the inside route into
upper stretch roused, drew off under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. BIG AL'S GAL brushed the off side stall at the start and came
under hustling, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. SHAKER SHACK broke out at the start and bumped WICKED AMBER into MEBS WEB, chased along the inside,
floated to the two path midway on the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on clear for the show honors. WICKED AMBER got bumped at the start by
SHAKER SHACK and in turn bumped MEBS WEB, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MEBS WEB bumped at the start by WICKED AMBER due to pressure from
SHAKER SHACK, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
AWESOMENEWYEAR just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped three to four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. HEART OF GOD three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

SHOW ME THE HONEY settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole, rallied on the outside,
closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. UNCLE'S GEM broke in at the start, tracked the pace on the
outside then three wide on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, gained under a drive to make a bid in the vicinity of the furlong marker, battled
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. HIGHWAY QUEEN settled towards the back, raced inside for most of the turn, shifted
two then three wide late on that bend, was put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. GET THE CANDY broke through the front of the
gate prior to the start, was brought back around and reloaded, came away in front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and was out-kicked then nailed for the
show. MASHNEE GIRL stalked the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and was also out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. HAPPY HILL LIL settled on the outside, tucked into the two path on the turn, swung
six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WRITE THIS DOWN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled near the back, went three then
two wide on the turn and was no factor. STIMULUS CHECK settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was asked with five-sixteenths to run then
driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. KREESA LA WROTE checked when put in tight against the rail early, settled at the back, saved
ground early on the turn, moved off the rail late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and also was no factor. GOLDEN OLDIE was hustled from the
start, established position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came up empty when asked around the five-sixteenths and dropped out.

wide, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong to get up in the last jumps to the finish between foes and score. RUNAWAY RUMOUR along the
inside early on through the first turn, tipped three wide settled near the rear of the field down the backstretch, advanced into the far turn latching on the top
pair inside three furlongs to run, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was nudged five wide into upper stretch as the aforementioned foe tipped
out from along her inside, dug in under a drive rallying with good energy through the final eighth but missed at the end. HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) established
the front and showed the way rated just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure to the
outside, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio and was caught in the final strides to the wire. OUR FLASH DRIVE
three then two wide forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, got set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages. PLUM ALI just off the inside just off
the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but
was outkicked. THIRD DRAFT saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper
stretch and offered no response. HARAJUKU (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit, tipped three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and had no kick.

Footnotes
HOOPLA was away alertly, set the pace under heavy pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch, dueled inside of the runner-up, had the rider lose his crop inside the furlong marker, drifted out while still tussling with the runner-up late and
prevailed. COUSIN ANDREW chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, made a five wide bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the
winner, was carried out by that foe late and missed but was well clear for the place. LITTERBOX settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn,
turned six into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. EXXTOP settled off the pace, was asked in the two path
on the turn, turned three wide into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. MATTY'S MARAUDER was urged along off the pace, chased inside on the
turn, was driven into upper stretch and tired. SCOTTY was in tight just after the start, showed no speed under urging, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and
capitulated.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. ADELE KAT bobbled at the break and was bumped by

Footnotes
HAPPY SOPHIA was away alertly, settled off the pace under some urging, was asked while inside to the two path on the turn, rallied three wide through a
clear opening at the quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. MOSIENKO was urged along
on the outside, went four wide on the turn, moved closer passing the five-sixteenths, gained five wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths and
proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was hustled from the start, settled in third position, went three wide
on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and also proved no match for the winner then missed the place
while clear for the show. ESOTICA pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead passing the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage under a drive just inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back while still on her inside lead into the final furlong and tired. STORMI CAT LADY
settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor. RAFFINITY bumped with a rival at
the start and was off a step slow then dropped back, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. MIA BEA STAR broke in and bumped with a foe, was
coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. QUANTITATIVBREEZIN was hustled to the
lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed at the quarter-pole and faded.

leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home taking command straightened away, inched away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, ran on to be along clear for the place honors. LOVE'S MISERY just off the pace three then
two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive offering a bid a furlong out, then kept on to just
preserve the show honors on the wire. PHENOMENAL WOMAN four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and kept on to just miss for the show honors. TAMI'S ORCHID four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to miss for the show honors. ESCAPEWITHFRIENDS broke in brushing the near side stall
at the start, then strode sluggish early when a bit cantankerous conceding six to seven lengths to the front, chased three wide detached at the tail of the
field, tucked inside through the turn coming under light coaxing midway, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals making some late
headway. BARREL OF BLISS chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened
in the late going. ROXEN broke out at the start trading a bump with NEW YORK BANKER who broke inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. INCONTROVERTIBLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and offered no response. FAVORITE IMPULSE chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide for home and weakened. ETHEL'S DOCTORATE established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths under pressure from a pair, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge, yielded the front straightened
away and tired. NEW YORK BANKER broke in at the start trading a bump with ROXEN who broke outwards, pressed the leader from the inside in the two
path and then along the rail through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, got shaken off a bit near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and faltered.
