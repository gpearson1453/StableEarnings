into the two path entering the lane, was under a long drive down the lane from between horses and inched away in the final stages. ANDY CANT raced in
the three path along the first turn, tracked the early pace down the backstretch, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane while
three wide, did not have enough for the winner late but prevailed for place. WALHALLA bobbled at the start, set the pace early, was on the inside into the
lane, under a long drive in the stretch from the inside, was outfinished late and lost place at the wire. TIGER MOON raced in the three path along the first
turn, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but flattened out late in the drive. FEDERAL HILL raced in the three path along the first
turn, chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. GOOCH GO BRAGH was through after a half.

Footnotes
LAUGHING BOY stalked two wide, prompted the pace setter around the far turn, sparked a duel entering the lane, forged an advantage approaching the
furlong grounds, and drew clear through the final sixteenth. MEISTER managed a clear margin down the backstretch, met the eventual winner's bid entering
the lane, got headed approaching the furlong pole, then yielded a sixteenth from home. FIRST LINE lied off of the pace two wide and between horses,
shifted three wide turning for home, then four wide in midstretch for clear sailing as CARILLO ranged up along side, then stayed on along with that foe, and
prevailed over that rival for show. CARILLO settled off of the pace three wide, took back from between horses to trail the field into the far turn, awaited
racing room turning for home before shifting six wide in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly outside of FIRST LINE, but failed to reach that foe for show.
GENTLE SOUL tracked two wide, came under urging three wide into the far turn to pick up stride, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair in upper
stretch, then faltered late. SONO GRATO saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CHEFFY tracked along the inside, but came under coaxing to keep
pace into the far turn, then faded through the lane. DECISION MAKER was slow into stride, trailed the field early on, advanced position four wide and
outside of foes into the far turn, but failed to sustain that bid, and faltered between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VIVAR stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path into the far turn while allowed BRITAIN'S KITTEN to slip inside of her passing the three furlong pole,
squeezed through a narrow gap between that foe an a tiring BRIT'S WIT turning for home to bid for the lead three wide entering the lane, forged a narrow
advantage approaching the final furlong as SPEAKING SCOUT ranged up along side, then inched away from those rivals late. SPEAKING SCOUT trailed in
the three path, swung six wide turning for home, produced a bid outside of a trio of foes in midstretch while hanging on her let lead, but was turned away by
VIVAR late, and prevailed over BRITAIN'S KITTEN for place. BRITAIN'S KITTEN saved ground off of the pace, slipped inside of rivals into the far turn to a
stalking position, smoothly tipped two wide to bid for the lead between horses in upper stretch, but yielded to an outer foe a sixteenth from home, then got
outfinished for place. XAVEY DAVE set the pace, met a trio of bids entering the lane, then yielded at the sixteenth pole. LUCKY BOSS lied off of the pace
two wide, was roused to pick up stride four wide into the far turn, gained while getting floated five wide turning for home, but flattened out entering the lane.
BRIT'S WIT stalked two wide, but faltered between horses passing the five sixteenths pole. CALL ME GUSTO tracked three wide, but weakened between
horses turning for home.

Footnotes
SWEET DANI GIRL took a pair of bumps from an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, tracked the dueling pair intently from the four path around the
turn, took aim on them entering the lane, and determinedly wore those rivals down in the final sixteenth. KANT BELIEVE IT dueled for the lead inside of
VERYLITTLECENTS while staying a path off of the rail around the turn, stubbornly resisted that rival through midstretch as SWEET DANI GIRL menaced,
but was bested by the latter rival late while tenaciously fending off her dueling counterpart. VERYLITTLECENTS broke outwardly, bumped and pushed a foe
into outer rivals at the start, dueled for the lead outside of KANT BELIEVE IT while kept in the three path by that foe around the bend, gamely sustained the
battle between horses in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer foe late and missed reaching her dueling counterpart via a head bob. CHI TOWN
LADY leaned out and brushed a foe while breaking half a step slowly, then was severely hampered when an inner foe shied outwards shortly after, got
pinched and lost her best chance, then rated in the two path at the back of the pack around the turn, awaited racing room in hand behind rivals in upper
stretch, shifted inwards at the furlong grounds, and improved well. JESTER CALLS NOJOY was void of early speed after breaking a bit flatfooted, swung to
the six path passing the three furlong pole, rallied turning for home, but leveled off while drifting inwards in upper stretch. JUMEIRAH stalked along the
inside, chased through upper stretch, then tired at the furlong grounds. TOWSER settled far off of the pace, swung seven wide turning for home, and
improved. MAJESTIC D'ORO took a bump from an inner foe into an outer rival's path at the start, tracked from midpack in three path, but lacked a kick
between horses in upper stretch, the steadied when JESTER CALLS NOJOY drifted into her path passing the furlong pole. SHE'S PURE SILVER stalked
two wide and from between horses, then tired in upper stretch. YOU LOOK COLD shied from an inner foe into an outer rival, took a bump to her hind
quarters in the process, then tracked from the four to five path, but faded.

Footnotes
NAVRATILOVA cleared around the first turn, set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the railing entering the lane, allowed TOBYS HEART to produce a
rail bid approaching midstretch in the process, but responded readily when asked at the furlong grounds, swiftly repelled that foe leaving that marker, drew
clear, and held sway. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL allowed NAVRATILOVA to clear around the first turn, stalked that foe from the outside, but only managed to
chase her through the lane, and prevailed for place between horses. ADVENTURING tracked from midpack two wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch,
rallied to bid for place outside of a pair of rivals, but was turned away by CRAZY BEAUTIFUL before nailing TOBYS HEART on the wire. TOBYS HEART
stalked along the inside, bid for the lead along the rail in midstretch, but was repelled passing the furlong pole, flattened out, and got nailed on the wire for
show. CORE VALUES saved ground far off of the pace, came into the lane two wide, tipped five wide in midstretch, but lacked a bid. BREAKER OF
CHAINS broke a step slowly, trailed early on, took the far turn in th three path before swinging six wide entering the lane, but only offered a mild kic.
OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT lied off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. SARANYA saved ground from midpack, chased through upper stretch, but faded.
QUEENSHIP (IRE) broke slowly, settled at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the three path before shifting five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally.
ARM CANDY stalked three wide, but faded in upper stretch. PRINCESS THEOREM lied off of the pace three to four wide, and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BROTHER BRAD pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, then drew off in midstretch, and widened under driving pressure. BIKO was
noticeably washed out pre-race, saved ground while tracking the pace, then improved inside of tiring foes for place. CONTRACTOR BILL set the pace while
feeling pressure from the eventual winner, but proved no match for that foe in midstretch, weakened, and saved show. KOLSCH stalked three wide, but
failed to keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, stayed on to attempt a bid for place, but got outkicked. BASSETT failed to factor. LA MOSCA showed
little and was eased through the lane.
