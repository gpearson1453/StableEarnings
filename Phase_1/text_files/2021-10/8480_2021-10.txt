GOLD INCLUDED stalked three wide, bid into the stretch and edged away late under steady handling. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE alternated for the lead outside,
led in the stretch and was outfinished. BOOMERANG MISS dueled along the inside throughout and continued willingly. SUPERLING trailed early, advanced
between, angled wide into the stretch with late energy. CURRENT SITUATION saved ground close up, was asked for run on the final turn and flattened out.
SIDEREAL chased inside and lacked a rally. NYMUE'S TREASURE was urged close up between rivals then weakened in the stretch. JANELLE DREAMS
lacked speed inside and was never in contention. ELUSIVE RYDER dropped far behind wide and was always outrun. JUSTIN TIME was fanned extremely
wide into the first turn and faded.

SNEAKINESS engaged in blistering duel outside then edged clear in the stretch and just lasted. MANOLETE dropped far behind, advanced inside, angled
out in stretch and closed with a rush too late. LONG MAY YOU RUN dueled along the inside and continued gamely to the finish. TOMATER GATOR saved
ground close up, moved out on the turn with a mild bid. MANAHAWKIN broke slowly, lagged far behind then offered some late energy. GEEBERT chased
just of the inside and lacked a rally. FEDERAL CASE raced wide off the dueling leaders and faltered.

Footnotes
DIA DE SOL stalked outside, vied from the far turn to the finish and held rival safe in a game score. GOLDEN ESSENCE stalked wide, dueled the winner
but could not get by in a good effort. ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK saved ground, awaited room on the final turn, angled out but came up empty. BIENVENUE
prompted the pace outside and faded after five furlongs. HUQOOQ dropped back early, made a brief bid in the two path then faltered. DECISIVE CAUSE
trailed long way then passed rivals extremely wide. SCHNUER WILL moved close up inside then weakened steadily. ONE WILD WOMAN very fractious
during the gate load, steadied into the backstretch and was no factor. MARTINI TWIST set a clear pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly. THROWING
STARS lacked speed and gave way readily.

Footnotes
GLORY DIA settled outside, bid on the turn then rallied and edged away through the final furlong. CALL ON MISCHIEF set a pressured pace inside and
continued gamely to the finish. PROMISED STORM dropped well behind, moved very wide in the stretch closing strongly. RATHER NOSY rated close up
inside then flattened out in the stretch. MADAM MEENA forced the pace outside and weakened slightly in the stretch. CHILLY SKY chased outside and was
never a factor. PORTAL CREEK saved ground, was asked for run on the turn and faltered. KAYLASAURUS was eased back in the opening quarter and
trailed throughout.

stretch rallying. TIZOFADEAL bothered from the inside early and was no factor. MISBEHAVING LADY was soundly bothered early and no factor. CASTING
