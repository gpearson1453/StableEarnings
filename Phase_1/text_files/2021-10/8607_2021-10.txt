SUZIE Q SONDE settled close toward the inside, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the top of the stretch,
raced clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. QUINCYS WAY rated close to the early pace in the two and three paths, started a
bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three and four paths and finished evenly while dueling for second mid-stretch.
CHARITABLE MISS settled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
dueled for third through later yards. MASTERDANCER saved ground off the pace on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid approaching
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and ran evenly through the lane. SISTER JOANN pulled herself to the lead with the
riders' feet firmly planted in the dashboard as the saddle slipped forward on her withers, was caught at the rail nearing the head of the lane and faded past
the eighth pole.

JAXJAXXORJACKS accelerated to the front nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, dueled clear midway on the turn and was kept
alert in the stretch. JUBA'S FANCY was difficult to load but came away sharply with a brief early lead, pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole
but dropped back midway on the turn and settled for second. MEGALODON'SREVENGE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five
path and got up for third later yards. BLACK SHADOW gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened past the sixteenth pole. IL MIO
REGALO chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. FAST RIDE saved ground.

BAYTOWN FROSTY took the lead past the half mile pole and rated a slim early lead, came under pressure nearing the quarter and widened at the rail
through the turn then steadily increased his lead with steady handling. GOLDEN HUGHES bobbled a stride from the gate then engaged in close early
chase, raced at the rail on the turn and had to settle for second best. WE B SHACKIN broke through prior the break then picked up the chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, lost some ground entering the stretch but dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole. READY TO MARCH
chased toward the outside, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. JUSTICEHASBEENDONE gave chase inside, raced at the
rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. AGENT STONE dropped well back early on. BAYTOWN WARRIOR gave chase outside then faded in the six

MINE TO HOLD rated close inside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dueled to the lead past the eighth pole and
edged clear later yards. FIT BUT FAT moved to the inside and rated the pace, was pressured into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, gave up
the nod past the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. CASTLE BOUND settled just off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in leaving the eighth pole and took the nod for third under the wire. TWOBITSARIDE stalked off
the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, faded off the rail on the far turn and was nipped from third at the wire. SHACKLED entered the first turn
in the five path then angled in midway through the turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BAY HILL entered the first turn in the six path
and was never a factor.
