AUTISM BLUE showed good early speed to set all the pace while being rated down in the early stages and raced well clear through the stretch run under
mild urging to be a handy winner. PRINCE CINDERELLA was hustled from the start, raced two to three wide in the lane and was no match for the winner.
DON'T LEAD ME ON was vigorously hustled from the inside down the backstretch and tired readily.

ROCKTILLYOUDROP stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up around the far turn, swung out into the upper stretch, raced five wide near the

stretch and closed in well late to be second best. ELUSIVE VIRTUE was quick to begin from the inside to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. EUSTACE was hustled along and faded in the stretch run.

REVEREND AL was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, challenged the leader while racing heads apart around the far turn, raced near the four path
through the lane and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. CANDY ZIP was quick to begin to set the pace from the inside and couldn't hold
off the winner in the drive to finish second best. HOT SEAN stalked the early going, raced two to three wide and had no final winning bid. EMERALD MAGIC
stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. SOUND JUDGMENT stalked the pace from the inside of rivals,
raced five deep into the stretch and never was a factor.

TAKE A LEAP was allowed to settle to the back of the pack early on, made a steady advance around the far turn, raced four to five wide into the upper
stretch and finished well to be well clear late under steady handling. MORNING ADDICTION set a fast contested early pace, raced off the inside and held
well in the drive to hold the place position. LA VIKINA stalked the pace, raced between rivals around the far turn, angled six to seven wide through the upper
stretch and had not enough in the drive. COVER VERSION settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no response. GALILETA forced a
fast contested pace from the inside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch. Galileta walked off the track under her own power.

SMILING TONY settled off the early pace, moved up five wide around the far turn, surged in the latter stages and got up under strong encouragement.
SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS dueled for the early lead while racing between rivals and kept on willingly to the wire. ROWDY OH dueled for the early lead from
the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. ARICKAREE dropped back early, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and closed in well late.
ELCONDOR was hustled along from the inside, took up near the three eighths pole and had no final winning bid. EL TENAMPA settled off the early pace,
raced towards the inside and had no late rally. LUCAS MCCAIN was hustled from the outside and weakened in the stretch run. SILVER KID stalked the
early pace and failed to respond. BARHOPSKY lunged at the break and unseated his rider. A stewards inquiry was lodged for the break and no action was
taken as Barhopsky had fair chance at the start.

CIRCULODEGANADORAS showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. LA CROIX broke awkwardly,
settled off the early pace, moved up three to four wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. THANKS was off slowly, raced along the inside around
the far turn through the stretch and had not enough in the drive. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked the pace, angled five wide through the lane and had no
response. COASTAL STARLITE dropped back early, swung out seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
