Footnotes
RB HASHTAG showed good early speed to set all the pace, built a clear lead through the stretch under mild urging to be a handy winner. DREAMM tracked
the early leader while racing just off the inside, raced four wide through the lane and was no match for the winner. NAUGHTY GREYLINDA stalked the pace
from the inside down the backstretch, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. AA POCKIT ROCKIT chased the
top trio early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly throughout. SWEET-WAN dropped back early, raced towards the inside around the
far turn through the upper lane and never was a factor. AA PADAWAN was off very slow and trailed throughout.

UPO stalked the top pair, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. AGENT ZERO raced up close
in the early stages, raced four to five wide in the stretch and finished second best. SECOND BOLD showed good early speed to set the early pace and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT settled off the early pace, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole and flattened out.
CANYON CREST dropped back early and failed to respond.

BRASTIKA showed good early speed to set the pace and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. LIBERTY LIBERTY broke in the air, quickly
recovered to stalk the early pace, moved up four to five wide and kept on to the wire. ANGELS RULE pressed the early leader and weakened a bit in the
final stages. LONSDALEITE dropped to the back of the pack early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. GIRL
CAN FLY raced towards the inside and never was a factor. LOOKING AT BO broke through the gate pre race, raced six deep into the upper stretch, angled
in and never threatened. MIZ CAPPADOCIA was hustled from the outside and failed to sustain a bid.
