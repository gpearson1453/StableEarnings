moved to even terms into the lane and dug in determinedly to take the nod in the final yards. TRAVEL GIRL rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge
of Grandma Schnur nearing the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge closest to the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and dueled gamely to the
finish, though, gave up the nod late yards. CHOSEN MISS saved ground racing well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. CHERISH YOUR DREAM raced well back about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. FORT ZANNA ran in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and finished evenly. SUPER EIGHTY EIGHT rounded the opening turn in the four path and

MY WAY OR ELSE stalked two deep then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms still two deep midway on the far turn, dug in for
the nod mid-stretch and inched further ahead nearing the wire. HARDSCRATCH tapered to the inside nearing the first turn and rated the pace, came under
pressure past the three eighths pole, was met at even terms at the rail midway on the far turn, gave up the nod mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded. WILD
CAPPUCINO rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, dug in
leaving the eighth pole and was gaining on the top two. WIN THEN GRIN steadied at the rail off the heels of Hardscratch into the first turn, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. JEAN GREY ran in the four path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside and
showed little response. ESTHER'S FORTUNE ducked to the inside rail leaving the gate, was immediately pulled up and walked off the track. The inquiry
light came on briefly before this race was declared official.

WARRIOR'S ESTATE came away awkwardly then gave chase inside, eased to the four path on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and dueled to the
lead in the final yards. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE contested the pace and dueled with the edge two deep on the turn, put CHARITABLY GIFTED away inside
the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in the final yards, while the latter contested the pace inside, dueled at a close disadvantage at the rail on the turn then
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SO COURAGEOUS contested the pace through the backstretch, but dropped back from between horses past the quarter
pole then flattened the final sixteenth. BRAYDEN'SWARRIOR contested the early pace two deep, steadied from between horses at the five sixteenths pole,
rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. THUNDERINREADYRICK stumbled at the break and dropped well off the pace outside. BEAR'S
ESTATE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little further.

Footnotes
MOMA TIGER rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
continued in the four path of the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and drew away approaching the wire. COMPLETE SURPRISE took the lead at the
three quarter pole and rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure at the three eighths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the
turn, was caught later yards, though, held on well for second. AZZURRA settled just off the pace in the two and three paths, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and loomed a factor through the upper stretch before flattening the final
sixteenth. TAKE ME HOME raced with the pace inside through the front stretch then stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened the final eighth. DAZZLE ME came through the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole and ran evenly in the lane. MARY'S JEWEL saved ground off the pace, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
entered the far turn in the four path then swung to the outside entering the stretch and showed little further. LADY MACHO settled off the pace about the
three path on the opening turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
YOUREASCOLDASICE saved ground through the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved
two deep on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took the nod at the wire. NEW SOUTH stalked two deep into the first turn, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the quarter and contested the edge still two deep on the far turn, dueled briefly clear mid-stretch but was
nipped under the wire. DUSKY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught toward the quarter, maintained a
close disadvantage at the rail on the far turn but dropped back mid-stretch and weakened later yards. SHAKEY settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. NOW I'M BROKE rounded the opening turn about the three path and rated
close into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole and continued in the three path of the far turn then weakened into the stretch.
DIRTY DIRTY became a bit anxious in the gate, rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response leaving the three eighths pole.
OULOG dropped well back early on.
