Footnotes
OFFICER APPEAL angled in to stalk the early pace two deep, challenged then took over past the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear at the five sixteenths,
widened at the rail on the far turn and steadily increased his margin with only mild urging. HENRY STANDINGBEAR rounded the opening turn in the three
path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then dueled for second the final sixteenth. THORN OF ROSE
HILL raced well back from early contention then eased outward into the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then
outfinished for second the final sixteenth. MASTER YOO saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn then flattened. SONDE ST BLUES rated a short early lead inside, came under pressure but gave up the nod past the seven sixteenths pole, gave
chase from that point, dropped back at teh five sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. RAVIN' MAVEN raced well back off the rail the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. LUCKY PENGUIN saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole but faded nearing the far turn. MELDON rounded the first turn in the five path, entered the backstretch outside and showed little
response after a half mile.

Footnotes
BIG BOY POTTS took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace while making repeated contact with GOODLUCKWITHTHAT at various points
throughout, dug in to inch briefly clear then held on under steady encouragement, while the latter pressured the pace while being bumped repeatedly by Big
Boy Potts at various points throughout the race and was outfinished while digging in gamely. CASH FLOWING gave chase, rounded the turn about the three
path then dueled through the stretch for third. SUPER JORDAN was difficult to load then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the six
path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GREAT BIG NOTION chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path then lugged in while flattening
stride in the lane. MARK DID IT hesitated at the break and raced well back. CLASSIC TUXEDO raced well back and rounded the turn in the three path.
SMELLSLIKEMONEY was bumped early while giving chase then faded at the rail on the turn. PALACE KING saved ground racing well back. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Big Boy Potts, lodged by the rider of Goodluckwiththat, and disqualified the former to second place for making
repeated contact with the latter at various points throughout.

FIRE DOWN BELOW settled off the earlier pace about the three path, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and moved to even terms two deep
midway on the far turn, then dug in determinedly to eke out a narrow margin through the lane. PROTA rated close inside, took the lead past the seven
sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the five sixteenths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and dug in gamely while reluctantly yielding. GAMING
JACK saved ground on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. HOBE
SOUND rounded the first turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the far turn
then flattened in the lane. TIZ AUCTION TIME raced off the pace inside and showed little response through the backstretch. SHAMCAT accelerated to a
clear early lead while angling to the inside, was caught past the seven sixteenths pole and readily gave way.

Footnotes
BACK CHARGE rated just off the pace about the three path, took aim three wide into the backstretch and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole,
took the nod past the five sixteenths, drew clear into the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. HIGH PRINT came away awkwardly and
entered the first turn about the five path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, closed in the six path on the far turn then dug in through the lane to
take second later yards. MALIBU CIRCLE settled off the early pace about the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn then ceded second later yards while dueling for third. ADIOS SEE YA angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms but yielded the nod past the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail past the quarter then flattened stride in the
lane. TOMMY PIES saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eigthths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, altered course
mid-stretch then flattened later yards. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground the opening turn, gave chase into the
backstretch, ran in the four path of the far turn, angled to the outside into the lane and finished evenly. THE KING AQUILES rounded the opening turn about
the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn. HACKER MAN saved ground. FUDGE stalked the pace two
deep and gave chase at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened six wide on the far turn.
