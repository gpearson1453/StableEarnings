Footnotes
SURREALIST tracked the quartet of leaders early on while close to the rail, was on the inside into the lane, came up the inside down the lane, was lugging
out a bit and cleared the field while ridden out to the wire. TEMPER TIME stalked the pace early on three wide, was in the four path into the lane, inched
ahead down the lane but was no match for the winner in the final stages. KIZZY B set the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in
the stretch run. UPANDCOMINGSTAR broke slowly at the break and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch
drive. CLOSET SHOPPER tracked the pace early four wide, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. SOLARRI pressed the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. QUEEN'S TABLE was done early. DALIDA was through after a half.

Footnotes
NO SHIRT NO SHOES stalked along the inside early on, chased under urging around the turn, then sustained a rail rally to bid inside of MR.
JAGERMEISTER at the sixteenth pole, surged clear, and held from an oncharging TOP SEED late. TOP SEED settled at the rear in the two path around the
turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, rallied to split foes in midstretch, then sustained his charge to take aim on a leading NO SHIRT NO SHOES
late, but missed reaching that foe on the wire. BON RAISON lied off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, then stayed on willingly outside of
foes through the final furlong, but was outkicked by inner foes. MR. JAGERMEISTER prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead in the four path outside
of MUCH BETTER at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear of that foe in upper stretch, but tired leaving the furlong grounds, got headed by a rail bidding rival
at the sixteenth pole, and was swallowed up late. PYRON tracked from midpack in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, grinded along
into midstretch, but flattened out between horses late. DERBY DATE broke a step slow before brushing an outer foe at the start, lied at the rear while in the
five path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to factor. FACT FINDING pressed the pace two wide and from between horses, but
gave way approaching the five sixteenths pole. MUCH BETTER set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, dug in from a bidding MR. JAGERMEISTER
while shifting to three path turning for home, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NAKATOMI broke a step slowly before brushing an outer foe, tracked from the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn before tipping to the five path
and outside of the leading trio entering the lane, rallied on his left lead to take aim on a clear MY PRANKSTER at the furlong grounds, switched leads inside
the final furlong, sustained his charge to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged away. MY PRANKSTER chased four wide, bid for the lead outside of foes at
the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage from a digging in CHATTALOT in upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong pole with NAKATOMI in pursuit, but
was worn down by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. CHATTALOT dueled for the lead inside of HOPE IN HIM, disposed of that foe and shifted out while
meeting a pair of bids at the five sixteenths pole, dug in entering the lane, but was headed by MY PRANKSTER passing the five sixteenths pole, yielded at
the furlong marker, and gave way. FREELANCER pressed the pace three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for
home, but failed to keep pace with those rivals in upper stretch. LUCKY SHOT broke a step slowly before being brushed between rivals at the start, lagged
behind the field around the turn, then passed tired foes without menacing. HUNGRY HENRY tracked from midpack in the four path into the turn, but faded
turning for home. HOPE IN HIM dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
CAMP HOPE stalked three to two wide, loomed large outside of DREAMER'S DISEASE around the far turn, led approaching the quarter pole, swiftly kicked
clear passing that marker, asserted his dominance in upper stretch, responded to a left handed crop passing the furlong marker as LIKE THE KING gave
chase, and safely held to the wire under hand urging thereafter. LIKE THE KING tracked from the two path, shifted four wide into the far turn, rallied five
wide in upper stretch to bid for place at the three sixteenths pole with many lengths to find on the leader, secured place from an inner rival at the sixteenth
pole, and chased the winner home well to narrow his margin. YES THIS TIME stalked two wide around the first turn before tucking to the rail at the six
furlong pole, shifted outside of the tiring early pace setter turning for home, tipped three wide and outside of CAMP HOPE in upper stretch as that foe
assumed command, failed to keep pace with that foe while vying inside of LIKE THE KING for place through midstretch, but yielded to that foe at the
sixteenth pole, and safely held show. CHARLES CHROME pulled into the first turn while not allowed to achieve forward early positioning, steadied along
inside of foes around the first turn, settled into stride into the backstretch, then took the far turn in the two path, and only managed to chase through the lane
without progressing. HUSH OF A STORM was void of early speed after a bit of a flatfooted start, settled at the rear along the inside, shifted to the four path
into the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, and moved up. POINT ME BY lied off of the pace in the two to three paths, tipped six wide in upper
stretch, but lacked a kick and failed to menace. SCARLETT SKY backed out from tight quarters between horses early on, lied at the rear two wide, drifted to
the ten path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. GALLANT GUY broke a step slowly, advanced to a stalking position while shifting four to three wide
around the first turn, but faded after being floated four wide in upper stretcch. DREAMER'S DISEASE stumbled at the start, but was no costed position
despite needing a few strides to regain balance, went on to clear into the first turn, met the eventual winner's bid around the far turn, but was headed
entering the lane, and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE HALL got a bit antsy waiting for the gates to open, set the pace, met CODE OF HONOR's bid around the far turn, but responded readily
to right handed pressure in upper stretch, swiftly repelled that rival, drew off under driving pressure through midstretch, and widened under mild hand urging
late. CODE OF HONOR prompted the pace setter two wide, inched closer to vie around the far turn, but was repelled in upper stretch, got left toiling in that
foe's wake approaching midstretch while tiring on his left lead, but found the wire before being caught for place. KING FURY broke a step slowly at the start,
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, chased outside of, and multiple lengths behind, the dueling leaders around the far turn, then stayed on
late to take aim on a tiring CODE OF HONOR for place, but ran out of ground to catch that foe. NIGHT OPS saved ground off of the pace, took the far turn
two wide, improved between horses turning for home, then passed tiring foes for a minor share without threatening. MILITARIST stalked along the inside,
but faded into the far turn, then passed stopping foes in the final furlong while tiring himself. MANHATTAN UP got fractious in the gate, trailed the field, took
the far turn three to five wide, and moved up. MAJOR FED tracked four to three wide, then four wide around the far turn, and tired in upper stretch. FORT
PECK lied off of the pace three wide, then took the far turn five to three wide while failing to keep pace with inner foes turning for home.

Footnotes
FAMED dueled for the lead inside of BUNDUKI, inherited a clear margin when that foe bolted at the five sixteenths pole, drew off while hanging on her left
lead through midstretch, changed over at the sixteenth pole, and was geared down while getting a head pat approaching wire. HONEYCOMB chased from
between horses, claimed place from HALO OF FIRE in midstretch, and lasted for that position. CATWINGS broke a step slowly and bumped an inner foe at
the start, saved ground far off of the pace, then rallied between horses late, but missed reaching place on the wire. HALO OF FIRE took a bump from an
inner foe into an outer rival at the start, stalked four wide, vied for place in upper stretch, but flattened out. MY FRIEND AMY lied off of the pace two wide,
drifted to the six path in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. HONEY RUN broke a step slowly before bumping with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace
four wide and between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. SPRING MAGIC got caught five to six wide around the turn, and faded. GORGEOUS
CARINA stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch. GUN SLINGIN broke outwardly, chased three wide, but was done early. CUMULONIMBUS
broke a step slowly and got outrun. BUNDUKI dueled for the lead two wide, but bolted outwardly and lost his rider at the five sixteenths pole, then walked
off.
