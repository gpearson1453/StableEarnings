Footnotes
IRON PEARLS controlled the pace inside, was engaged from both sides through the stretch but held on determinedly and won the head bob. SUNNY
SAINT broke slowest, forced the pace outside, loomed a threat late but just missed. ROGUE RAGE saved ground throughout, raced close up, but could not
get by the top pair through the lane. ANGEL'S ENTRY moved closer to contention after half a mile then flattened out. HOOKEAI lagged far behind, swerved
to avoid fallen rival approaching the top of the stretch when far behind. MARACAIBO fell with a catastrophic injury near the quarter pole and was
euthanized. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident near the quarter pole.

SPECIAL BEAM rated behind trip of dueling leaders, angled wide into the stretch, wore down the pacesetters and was up in the final yards. CARNELIAN
vied three wide, led briefly in the stretch and held on gamely. PLATINUM GEM led along the inside to the stretch then tired in the final furlong. MISS
INVINCIBLE saved ground off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. TE AMO trailed early, advanced inside and was no factor. REIGN ON AND ON
dueled between rivals then gave way through the stretch. MURUMBI lacked speed outside and continued fading on the turn. SEIZE THE WHISKEY chased
wide down the backstretch and lacked a response.

behind for half a mile, angled wide, bid with the winner but was outfinished. ELLAS MY LOVE rallied three wide on the turn, led in midstretch but was nailed
late. TAPPING THE GLASS lacked speed racing wide on the turn then flattened out. SMITHWICK'S SPICE raced close up between rivals, eased back into
the far turn and failed to threaten. LAST INVESTMENT vied along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. TAPSASIONAL settled just off the leaders
inside and faltered. ARRIVEDERLA battled for the advantage outside then gave way in the stretch.

REMEMBER HYMN controlled the pace inside, was passed beat midstretch then inherited the lead again when the leader's rider fell off.. HOLY
GUACAMOLE saved ground within range and continued well along the rail. BIG DADDY BUZZ trailed early, moved wide in the stretch, swerved trying to
avoid the fallen rider late. GREGORIA'S BAY broke through the gate prior to start and ran off briefly then was no factor. EL GUAPO was fanned wide into
the first turn, chased and faltered. PERPETUAL CHANGE dropped back early and was far behind throughout. CASH KID broke a step slowly, moved
quickly to contention, bid to the front in midstretch, moved well clear when his rider appeared to loose his balance and fell from his mount in the concluding
stages.. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch incident.
