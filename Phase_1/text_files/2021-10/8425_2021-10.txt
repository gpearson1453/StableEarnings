through the final turn, moved up menacingly into the stretch but was not match for the winner late. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE broke alertly to set the early
pace, was overtaken approaching the far turn and faded inside. LIGHT FAST FEET sat just off the pace in the three path and was unable to keep pace with
the field with two furlongs remaining.

EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE contested the early pace inside, showed the way through the far turn, drew clear approaching the stretch then widened and was
ridden out. DAME DEVIL vied outside then sat just off the pace, lodged a rail bid under urging but was no match for the winner and held for place. GEM OF
INCEPTION raced mid pack, advanced four wide coming out of the final turn, rallied outside in the stretch but was unable to get by DAME DEVIL late. HEY
HEY RUN AWAY settled in range and lacked the kick needed. ENTITLED STAR saved ground inside and offered a mild bid late. MISSION REALITY
passed tiring rivals. SESAME failed to threaten in drive. FUNNY FLOWERS flashed early outside speed, angled in to the two path leaving the backstretch
and faltered. PHINALYWYN showed little. SAMURAI GIRL stalked the pace while four wide, chased the leader through the far turn and had nothing left in
reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
ANN OF WAR unhurried inside, moved up into striking position approaching the final turn, launched a rail bid under urging and prevailed under a long drive.
YNOTGIVEITAGO tracked outside, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, gained a slim lead into the lane, was met by ANN OF WAR mid stretch and
was out finished. WIDE EYED WILEY chased into the stretch and surged late to earn show. BRADYDABOSS chased four wide leaving the chute, moved up
alongside BIG Z leaving the backstretch, rallied between foes but lacked the closing response needed and was edged out late. BIG Z sprinted to the front,
took pressure through the far turn and gave way in stretch. STEAMIN DEMON chased throughout from rail. RED ECHO gapped early and passed tiring.
KNOWENTOHOLDUM chased wide through the backstretch and failed to threaten. SWEAT EQUITY hustled away, chased three wide early and was
outrun. I AM AN EMPRESS chased outside leaving the backstretch and faded gradually.

Footnotes
WILDCAT WILLY sat in striking position, swung five wide coming out of the final turn, pushed to the front and won going away. FOREVER LADY took back
leaving the chute, advanced outside in the far turn, chased the leader into the stretch but was no match and edged away late to prove second best.
GHOSTLY RUNNER vied outside leaving the chute, pressed the pace outside of NUVANTI, inherited the lead nearing the quarter pole but was soon
overtaken and worn down late stretch for place. GREYTOGO gained closer order leaving the backstretch, lodged an all out bid and flattened in stretch.
LILBITSPICY rallied belatedly. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS saved ground from rail and faded in stretch. LIVING SKY away alertly, dropped back and lacked a
serious bid. SHEIKH YA chased wide early and faded. UPTOME lacked a serious bid. NUVANTI emerged the leader entering the backstretch, was
overtaken at the quarter pole and wilted abruptly. ZURI RISASI tracked four to five wide and tired early.

Footnotes
DENSE FOG unhurried early, brushed WARBRIDGE in the backstretch, gained closer order entering the far turn, fanned three wide, dueled outside of
EVER TRUE approaching the stretch and won driving. PRESS GANG chased the leaders in the final turn, drove four wide into the lane and got by late for
place. EVER TRUE sent for speed outside to secure a rail position, took pressure in the far turn inside of CABIN JOHN and DENSE FOG and gave way
grudgingly late stretch. ITS ALL ON SLEW swung out in the final turn, rallied belatedly and missed. GEM ALTA bumped leaving the gate, raced near the
back of the pack, lacked room in traffic nearing the quarter pole and offered a mild late bid. CABIN JOHN broke outward into GEM ALTA, pressed the pace
outside then moved up alongside DENSE FOG to challenge the lead but was unable to move on with rivals and gave way. WARBRIDGE brushed in the
backstretch and lacked a response when asked. JOVIAL DESTINY chased three wide and failed to menace. PURELY GIVEN chased outside and tired.

Footnotes
TEMPLE OF ZOOM sat just off the pace inside from the two path, gained the lead in the final turn and kept to task under steady handling. FLASHY SISTER
advanced quickly in the far turn, angled out into the lane, gained late and finished clearly second best. BAINE THE BULL sat in striking distance while three
to four wide, bid near the three eighths pole, drifted out into the lane and evened out. EMERALD CANYON emerged the leader leaving the opening turn,
was overtaken approaching the quarter pole and flattened out. LITTLE ROSALYN stalked the pacesetters from the four path and lacked a kick. INDY
FRONT failed to menace. WITTS QUESTION raced four wide in the first turn, chased leaving the backstretch and was outrun. HEREVERYWISH offered
little.

Footnotes
BIG AND FLASHY allowed to settle outside, raced two to three wide in the final turn, closed steadily and was along in time. CALEDON SUMMER vied
inside, chased BOUND TO BE SMART into the lane, gained the upper hand early stretch and was edged out late. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL bumped entering
the backstretch, rated well off the pace in the five path, closed outside determinedly and nipped rivals late for show. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI was pinballed
leaving then knocked off stride, advanced quickly through the final turn along the rail and was narrowly denied after a multi-horse scramble to the finish. LIL
OL FLATTER sandwiched leaving, steadied to avoid GLINDA GOOD WITCH whose rider lost his stirrups, lodged an all out bid nearing the three sixteenth
pole and was out finished for show. BOUND TO BE SMART crossed over quickly to set the early pace, held good margins through the final turn, was
showing signs of tiring with a furlong remaining and faltered. COUNT ON IT broke outward then was jostled leaving the chute, chased four wide and failed to
threaten in drive. GLINDA GOOD WITCH was bumped repeatedly nearly losing the rider, rider lost his stirrups and navigated safely along the rail.
PRECIOUS NOTES tracked the pacesetters from the three path and stopped with a furlong remaining.
