Footnotes
FAST EH went to the front and never looked back. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR began bid approaching the quarter pole, chased through stretch but was no
match for winner. TIMELY RUCKUS bumped outside HIGHRISEINTHEPEG leaving the backstretch, lodged an all out bid into the stretch but was unable to
improve position. HIGHRISEINTHEPEG was bumped leaving the backstretch, raced four wide and passed tiring. RUN ROSSCO RUN raced in closest
pursuit and came up empty for the drive. STALWART BOY was not a factor. *TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
VISION QUEST emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, led the field through the backstretch, turned back challenge from INTENT TO STRIKE
entering the stretch and held. ITS ALL ON SLEW rated well off the pace, took closer order in the far turn, closed gradually outside and missed. INTENT TO
STRIKE stalked the pace from the three path, moved up menacingly but was unable to reach the eventual winner and gave way late. BUCKYS PICK saved
ground inside, bid three wide into stretch and yielded late. ACE OF DIAMONDS jostled away then trailed the field and bid belatedly. JOVIAL DESTINY
tracked four to five wide and failed to threaten. INDICATIVE raced in close quarters in the opening turn, tracked four wide and was done early.

Footnotes
SCARLETTE ROSE raced wide through the backstretch, drove five wide into the lane came together with LASKA, gained the lead in the final sixteenth and
won driving. LASKA raced near the back of the pack, drove four wide leaving the final turn, drifted out coming together with SCARLETTE ROSE, navigated
through traffic early stretch and was along late for place. JAMAICAN ME MAD tracked the pacesetters while five wide, went in pursuit of the leader from the
three eighths marker, moved up menacingly and was outkicked for place. YUKON MIST set the pace while four wide, moved clear into the far turn, was
showing signs of tiring early stretch and faltered. BLANCA saved ground early, lodged a bid nearing the three sixteenth pole and failed to threaten in drive.
OMEGA GAL settled inside, drove three wide into the lane and flattened out. DANCING ZAZINGA reserved from the three path and faded.
I'MAMUDDERTOO showed some speed then sat just off the pace and tired early. JOCKEY AND TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider
and trainer of LASKA against the rider of SCARLETTE ROSE alleging interference at the head of the lane was disallowed after review of the Board of the
Stewards. There was no change to the order of finish.

BOOKIE allowed to settle inside, went two wide on the turn then shifted inside at the head of the lane and won driving. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE set the
pace, was showing signs of tiring into the stretch and was caught. WISER TIMES fanned three wide, rallied into the stretch and edged away from MY
SAMURAI WARRIOR late stretch for show honors. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR sat just off the pace from the four path, lodged a bid entering the lane and
gave way inside. BE MY MACHO MAN raced wide through the backstretch, fanned three wide and yielded. PUNKY MONKEY assumed a stalking position
and was unable to keep pace with the field. BRIOSO tracked five wide early, had no response when asked then was pulled up abruptly, did not finished and
walked off.

INFINITE PATIENCE dueled inside of HERE'S HANNAH from the four path under a snug hold, disposed of rival in the far turn, saved ground through the
final turn, was given her cue and kept to task to an easy victory. SARAHS ELEGANCE trailed the field, gained closer order in the far turn, angled four wide
off the final turn, rallied gamely and was a clear second. RAIDER reserved off the pacesetters, began bid near the five sixteenth, moved up menacingly but
was unable to improve in the stretch and flattened out. HERE'S HANNAH vied outside, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded steadily.
FLY AWAY stalked inside, chased in the final turn and gave way.

hard drive. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT tracked five wide, fanned four wide in the far turn, moved up alongside WEDGE POND to challenge the lead, dueled
through stretch and was narrowly denied. GOOCH EXPRESS stalked four wide, rallied three wide and was along in time for show. BACKSTREET BOBBY
stalked inside, lodged a rail bid and was caught late. RED CHOCOLATE angled four wide and bid belatedly. WHERE'S THE GOLD trailed and closed late.
SIR BRONX reared at the start, stalked three wide, moved alongside WEDGE POND nearing the quarter pole and came up empty for the drive. SILVER
SPUN was never far back and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
COMMON KNOWLEDGE sat in striking position outside of the pacesetters, advanced three wide on the final turn inheriting the lead, drew clear and held
safely. PULL THE PIN raced three wide leaving the chute, closed gradually outside approaching the stretch then angled down the rail, was gaining late but
no threat to the winner. NEVVARE bid belatedly. HE'S CRIMSON CODE chased and passed tiring. SIR MIEZIE attended the early pace, pressed HERE
COMES BARNEY in the far turn and flattened out in stretch. HERE COMES BARNEY contested the early pace, dueled through the final turn inside of SIR
MIEZIE and had little left in reserve for the drive. ETU BABOU offered little. MARANGO never reached contention.

Footnotes
NO COLLUSION stalked the pace from the four path, lacked running room at the quarter pole, angled out to the four path, bid steadily and dug in late
getting up just in time. GO MAMA reserved off the leaders, began her bid from the three eighths, four to five wide into the lane, gained a slim lead at the
head of the stretch and was nipped a the wire. BIG AND FLASHY unhurried early, advanced quickly through the far turn, lodged a rail bid and was
outkicked. LIL OL FLATTER lacked early foot, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, drove five wide early stretch but could not muster the rally
required. CHATTY GAL pressed the pace from just off the rail, dueled inside of BELLS AND WHISTLES and gave way. BELLS AND WHISTLES set a
pressured pace from the four path, dueled through the far turn and had little left in reserve for the drive. LITTLE ROSALYN passed tiring rivals. BENNY'S
GIRLFRIEND outrun throughout. SIXTYSHADESOFBLUES chased early and was outrun.

Footnotes
GEM OF INCEPTION contested the pace outside, gained good margins through the far turn while saving ground, drew away when given cue and was
ridden out. TOP DEMON lagged early, rallied five wide and inched up for place. WITT NINE was under a snug hold early from the four path, drove between
foes at the head of the lane, was all out inside and was narrowly denied for place. INDY FRONT stalked from rail, dropped in the turn, swung out into the
lane, closed steadily outside and missed. MISSION REALITY tracked wide, chased four wide in the final turn and flattened out through stretch. DAME
DEVIL led the field into the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the field and faded gradually inside. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL pressed while five wide,
went in pursuit of the leader, and gave way in the final sixteenth. SWEATY BETTY was not a factor.

Footnotes
BONANZA CREEK allowed to settle early then settled near the back of the pack, advanced quickly outside in the final turn, raced wide into the lane then
closed steadily outside and won driving. DARE TO GO showed the way through the backstretch, saw margins diminish entering the lane, was overtaken
and just held sway. BACK ALLEY CAT saved ground along rail, rallied inside into the stretch and missed settling for show. TEE CLASS tracked inside,
rallied between and improved late. SILVER PRAIRIE stalked inside, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the five sixteenth marker, and failed to threaten in
drive. SMALL TOWN DUDE tracked the pacesetters while four wide and bid belatedly. IMPERIALITE fanned three wide in the first turn and lacked a serious
bid. COMMISSION MAN hustled outside, chased four wide in the backstretch and faded. TINY TYCOON bumped the rail leaving the opening turn, trailed
and chased to no avail. TWO TERMS chased outside and was not a factor. STRONG AND FREE broke slow, chased hard outside and tired early.
