Footnotes
STYNER was rated along three wide early, made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command leaving the quarter pole, then prevailed late after a long
drive. FROSTED INDIAN was well placed early on the inside, then was boxed by the quarter pole, slipped through leaving the turn to make a bid but was
outfinished to just miss. BASTIEN LE BROWN chased the early pace three wide, came five wide into the drive and rallied. MY CANDY BIZ was void of early
speed, started to unwind on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive and had a belated rally. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY pressed the early pace and made
a three wide bid to vie for command between horses by the furlong marker and faded late. REMEMBER HYMN bobbled at the start, then chased the pace
from the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn but had no punch in the drive. SAAFEN set a pressured pace on the inside, then came off the rail
leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TIVANO was void of early speed, then made a huge six wide move on the turn, continued that move in the stretch to prove much the best under a mild
drive. KNIGHTS KEY was allowed to settle early, then made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command leaving the turn but could not go with the
winner while second best. RUNNER RUNNER INDY was allowed to settle early while four wide, made a five wide move on the turn and in between rivals
but flattened out, stayed on for the show award. AND SEEK tracked the early pace four wide, made a three to four wide bid to take over on the turn but gave
way. LINDA'S NEKIA chased the early pace, then was shuffled back on the turn, then angled out to pass the tiring rivals. DAY was six wide into the first
turn, then raced wide throughout and was not a threat. SHAKA STYLE was sent to the lead on the inside and was through after a half mile. JUST ENOUGH
tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid to press the pace and stopped, vanned off

Footnotes
PATTY CAKES was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. GET
SERIOUS stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to vie for command, proved to be no match for the winner while lasting for the place
award. AUTOMATED TELLER was settled on the inside, then was shuffled back on the turn, then finished willingly on the inside to be along for the show
award. BLUEBERRY INDYGO stumbled at the start, then made a four wide run on the turn but came up empty in the drive. HOT BODE was reserved early,
swung out six wide for the drive and passed the tiring rivals. JUST ADD MOONLIGHT pressed the early pace and made a bid between rivals on the turn
and weakened. ARIANA VALENTINA was settled back early, came wide into the drive and had no rally. SHE'SRUNNINGHAPPY chased the early pace on
the inside and weakened. KISSIN COUSIN set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

BEST CAUSE tracked three deep, moved up to join the dueling leaders midway through the turn, took over at will into the stretch and drew away to score
with something left. PROMISE OF JOY dueled to the outside of PALIO SIENA through the turn, was unable to go on with the winner, but stayed on fairly
well to hold the place. KABIKEKA broke slow, dropped well back, took closer order into the turn, circled into the stretch five wide and continued on willingly
to earn the minor award. FRED'S SHEILA settled saving ground, shifted out and offered a mild bid entering the stretch, but failed to sustain the drive. PALIO
SIENA dueled along the inside through the turn and tired. LADY TIZMO was forwardly placed outside for a half and dropped out. YEYETZI failed to
respond.

STRIKING CHROME attended the pace to the outside of INEDATEQUILA to the second turn, moved up to engage that one, was floated out a bit into the
stretch, wore down that rival and edged clear late. INEDATEQUILA opened clear to dictate terms, drifted out a bit leaving the second turn, dug in to meet
the challenge but grudgingly gave in. CONGRATSROSY settled off of the inside, angled to the rail on the second turn, but failed to make headway through
the drive. REINA LA KELSY saved ground to no avail.

BESS settled off of the inside, advanced between runners through the turn, came three wide, split rivals and was fully extended to nail SKAMANIA in the
final strides. SKAMANIA set the pressured pace along the inside, drifted out leaving the turn, came four wide and fought on through a prolonged drive but
was turned away in the shadow of the wire. FREE TO FLY prompted the pace outside, was fanned wider still leaving the turn, weakened during the drive but
had enough left to preserve the minor award. MAGICGIRL was unhurried, came three wide and finished with a belated improvement. LADY JEAN attended
the pace along the inside, got through and loomed a danger leaving the turn, but failed to sustain the drive. THEA'S THEME was forwardly placed three
wide for a half and tired.

BUY THE BEST was allowed to settle early, eased out on the turn while advancing, came five wide into the drive and closed well on the outside and was
going away late to prove best, driving. MAESTRIA dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn, then drifted out
in the furlong ground under left handed urging, could not match strides with the winner late while saving the place award. BOSS LADY KIM chased the early
pace, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then had to checked around the sixteenths pole, then got the nod for the show award. SHE'S PEACHY
KEEN was well placed early on the inside, then was boxed by the five sixteenths and was shuffled back, then eased off the rail to be two wide by the quarter
pole, made a inside bid in the stretch but needed more late. MIA'S CRUSADE was bumped at the start, then was four wide on the turn, swung out six wide
for the drive and had a belated rally. GET GROOVY was settled back early on the inside, angled out in the stretch and had no rally. MINING CHROME
lacked a rally. ROCK ROSE dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. SPECIAL BEAM chased the early pace five wide and then came eight wide
into the drive and stopped. There was a stewards INQUIRY and the jockey on BOSS LADY KIM claimed foul versus MAESTRIA for interference in the
furlong grounds, after reviewing the replays the objection was allowed and MAESTRIA was disqualified from second and placed third.

Footnotes
CONSTITUENCY was allowed to settle early, made a four wide run on the turn, then continued that run in the drive and wore down the front runner late to
prove best under a drive. GALILEE was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and closed well on the outside, got nod for place award. BRODIX
dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then remained clear by the furlong marker but got tired
late and was caught, missed place award. LAREDO chased the early pace in between rivals, came three wide into the drive and was gaining late but
needed more. ENGLISH LAD dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. LA AITANA chased the early pace four wide and weakened. VITO ANDOLINI
ran off in the post parade, then chased the pace on the inside and stopped.
