Footnotes
MANAALABOUTDAMONEY tracked the early pace, was confidently handled in the three path on the turn, struck the front heading into the lane, felt
pressure in the final sixteenth from the oncoming runner-up but held to win in a drive. RUNNING ON EMPTY sat just off of the early pace, gained ground
leaving the turn and continued that run to pressure the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel him in while besting the rest. STARRY SIERRA broke
in a bit at the start, chased the early pace while saving ground and weakened in the late going. LOVER BOY TOM prompted the early pace from a ground
saving position and tired in the stretch run. SPLIT ACES was away well, showed early speed into the turn and faded in the stretch drive. STOP THE LIES
was away very slowly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ICE OR FIRE sat just off of the early leaders, mounted a bid while three wide nearing the top of the stretch, found a stubborn foe in MINOSO in the stretch
run and dug in in the final strides to prevail. MINOSO set quick fractions from the inside, was confronted by the winner off of the turn, stubbornly dueled ICE
OR FIRE and just relented in the final strides while holding for second. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER bumped QUICK AND SILVER at the break, had no early
speed, closed well in the stretch and was gaining on the top pair in the final sixteenth but could not reel them in while clear of the rest. CONTINENTAL
UNION settled just off of the early pace from a four wide position and was outfinished in the stretch run. KING EDDIE tracked the early pace from the two
path and tired in the late going. QUICK AND SILVER was bumped by SMOKIN ENCOUNTER at the break and chased the early leaders, was five wide on
the turn and lacked a late bid in the stretch. KLAY NATION chased the early pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch drive.

RED HOT LASS settled in the second flight in the early going, saved ground on the turn, stayed on the rail while improving position leaving the turn, put
away the runner-up inside of the final furlong and pulled away in the end. OH TRUTHY was away well and set quick fractions from a ground saving position,
was collared by the winner inside of the furlong marker and was no match for that foe, while besting the rest. WHAT UP NOW J T settled near the rear of
the field in the early going and did not have a final kick in the stretch run. MUNNINGS TALE had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and did not offer
a late rally in the stretch. SUNSET STAR chased the early pace from a three wide position and faded in the drive. BACALAR pressed the pace while two
wide and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BANDEENA was away well and set comfortable fractions while rating nicely, was confronted by the runner-up inside of the furlong marker, lost the lead to
that foe but battled back and kicked clear in the end. FRONT OF LINE (GB) hopped at the start and was hustled to prompt the pace, confronted the winner
off of the second turn, put a head in front of BANDEENA in the final furlong but could not go on with that run and was bested for the win while clear of the
rest. LIVIN' AT THE BU tracked the early leaders from a four wide path on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. QUICK TIME (GB) stalked
the early pace from the midflight, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the late going. STEIN'S GIRL was unhurried in the early running, was
five wide on the second turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. CLASS CODE settled at the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and
was not a factor. MANY BANKERS stalked the early pace from a ground saving position and faded in the late stages.

UNRAPTURED was bumped leaving the start, chased the early pace while saving ground, swung out for the drive, quickly put away MOB BOSS and pulled
away in the end in a good debut. MOB BOSS was sent leaving the break and set quick fractions from the inside, was collared by the winner leaving the turn
and was outkicked in the stretch run, while holding for second. IL BELLATOR was bumped sharply at the start by ONE LAST THOUGHT, tracked the early
pace from a three wide position and finished evenly in the late going. NUESTRO ENGREIDO stalked the pace from a two wide position and weakened in
the stretch. INIMITABLE was off slow, was hustled to chase the early pace and tired in the stretch drive. ONE LAST THOUGHT attempted to wheel at the
break and caused a chain reaction involving IL BELLATOR and UNRAPTURED, was outrun in the early going and was not a threat.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER was unhurried in the early stages, mounted a bid while two to three wide on the second turn, gained ground leaving the turn and
continued that run to make a late surge to just nail the runner-up on the line to prevail. SLEEP OVER was away well and set moderately quick fractions, had
a clear lead into the stretch but was tiring in the final sixteenth and was nailed in the last stride by BROKEN FINGER for the win, while besting the rest.
CHARMING VINTAGE settled at the rear of the field, saved ground along the second turn, rallied in the stretch but was outfinished by the top two.
COLLUSION DELUSION made a middle move to track the early pace and was outkicked in the stretch run. PERSEVERANCE settled in the second flight,
was four wide on the second turn and did not mount a late kick in the stretch. BLAKEFORD settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the second
turn and was not a factor. AUTISM SAVANT chased the early pace, lost ground along the backstretch and second turn while five wide and did not mount a
late bid. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI chased the pace from the midflight while two wide between horses and did not make a late rally. LOOKIN FOR GOLD
tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch. INCREDIBLE CHAMP attended to the early pace by SLEEP OVER, lost
ground and then stopped along the second turn, was eased and walked off under his own power.
