Footnotes
BABY STEPS was away quickly from inside, sped to the front then was challenged from inside, dueled through the turn and into the lane, fought back under
right-handed urging and dug in to prove best in the final sixteenth. COMEDIC chased briefly then angled to the inside and went up to duel for command,
held a short lead into the stretch, battled down the lane, lost the advantage nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed on gamely. PHENOM chased along the
inside to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and gained ground on the top pair late. SHE'S GOT A WAY settled off the pace, moved to the inside, entered the
stretch two wide and kept on through the final furlong. SUGAR SUGAR broke well then stalked the top pair from outside, moved to the two path on the turn
then exited three wide and lacked a bid in the stretch. LOMA VISTA raced in range, off the rail, went three wide into the turn, moved to the two path then
came three wide into the drive, had the rider lose whip in upper stretch and flattened out. SILENT BEAUTY dropped back early, trailed on the inside to the
stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
IT'S A RIDDLE forwardly placed behind the leader, bid inside on the turn, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared in upper stretch, drifted out through
the lane and held safely. LISTEN TO BLUE lagged behind early, raced three to four wide into the stretch, steered out widest and came with a late rally but
was unable to threaten the winner. BELLA RENELLA stalked off the inside, went four then five wide around the turn, kept within striking distance in the drive
but went evenly late. ROLINGA settled on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, passed tired rivals but needed to find more to threaten the top placings.
MAVALOUS MAVALOUS away quickly to take control, set the pace under pressure, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, vied between leaving the
bend, drifted out a bit in the lane and weakened. TRULY FABULOUS pressed from outside, three deep around the turn, came four wide into the lane, drifted
out in the stretch and weakened.

HARBOR SKY stalked the pacesetter through the early stages, drew alongside leaving the backstretch, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, shook free
in upper stretch and remained clear to the wire. MONGOL ALTAI raced in range early on, steered out into the stretch, rallied and gained the place. DA KINE
sped clear quickly, controlled the pace in the early stages, gained pressure nearing the far turn, headed around the turn, lost command at the
five-sixteenths, fought back leaving the turn and upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong. IRRESISTIBLY SEXY settled at the back, saved ground
around the far turn and never threatened. BRAVESTONE got bumped from outside at the start, traveled in range outside a rival, put in a mild bid three deep
on the far turn, could not sustain the challenge into the lane and weakened. HEIR (FR) broke in, bumped rival then got shuffled back at the start, went three
to four wide around both turns and weakened.

Footnotes
GRITTY GIRL vied three deep into and around the turn, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane and shook free in upper stretch and drew
away. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE fractious in the gate, well placed behind the top trio, took the turn two wide, moved out a bit in the stretch and proved
second best. SHISH KABOB fractious in the gate, tracked the top trio from inside, lacked room along the fence on the turn, angled three wide leaving the
bend and was along for the show. BLUE WILDCAT stumbled shortly after the start, chased two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the
stretch and kept on for a minor award. VEGAS DREAM vied for the lead between rivals into and around the turn, dueled briefly past the five-sixteenths,
chased the winner into the lane and weakened. THISONESFORBARRY tracked outside rivals to the turn, angled six wide leaving the bend and could not
rally. TECUMSEH CAROLINE off slow at the start spotting the field several lengths, lagged behind to the turn, wen two wide around the bend and passed
tired rivals. AM YISRAEL CHAI stalked the leaders outside a rival, lost ground around the turn and eased out five wide, then weakened in the drive. RUN
AUNTIE T RUN fractious in the gate, vied for the lead from inside into and around the turn, could not keep pace leaving the turn and gave way in the drive.
LASYA DANCE fractious in the gate, off slow to begin, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SWEET SONNY attended the pace from outside five rivals deep, challenged five deep around the turn and took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared
into the lane, inched away in the stretch then held the runner-up at bay. OUR LITTLE TIGER brushed leaving the gate, settled off the pace, raced along the
inside, steered off the rail and came six wide into the lane, closed well but could not get by the winner. PASITO tracked outside a pair of rivals early on,
continued outside a rival on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, summoned a mild late bid and earned the show honors. ELGOFRANCO up close
early four deep, vied for the lead four deep around the turn, chased the winner leaving the turn, tipped outside that rival at the top of the stretch and
flattened to a minor award. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN vied for command between foes into and around the turn, chased two wide into the lane and
weakened. BIG AL'S PRINCESS chased the speed battled from between rivals early, went three to four wide around the bend and lacked a rally. COAL
SHAFT vied for the lead from inside into and around the bend, chased the winner into the stretch and faded on the inside. LADY BEYONCE trailed early on,
went two to three wide around the turn, improved position in the lane but made no impact. WARREN'S MEMORABLE sat off the pace, went four to five wide
around the turn and failed to menace. V BUCKS vied for command three deep up the backstretch, remained three deep and fought between around the
turn, could not keep up past the quarter pole and gave way. ROYAL BLEND brushed with inside rival at the start, chased three then two wide around the
turn and had little left for the drive.

MAN FRIDAY steered to the inside for the clubhouse turn, moved out into the two path, asked past the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out and rallied to the front
inside the sixteenths pole and drove clear. COTOPAXI (IRE) pulled early, went three wide around the first turn, stalked outside rivals on the backstretch, bid
alongside the leader with a quarter of a mile remaining, took the lead entering the stretch, put away inside rival with a furlong to go but got outkicked by the
winner. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) angled to the inside, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch and showed a mild rally to earn the show. NUMERO
DIX (GB) unhurried at the back, swung four wide leaving the far turn, angled widest in the stretch and produced a mild rally. TIGERHON (FR) cleared to
take command and crossed over to the inside, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened down the lane. BIG
FISH settled outside a rival early, driven four wide into the lane, drifted in and brushed rival in upper stretch and could not rally. ROCKET SONG (FR) went
three wide around the first turn, raced up close outside the pacesetter early, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and never responded to urging and walked
into the van following the race. SPIRIT MAKER raced between foes then outside a rival on the first turn, traveled between runners again on the backstretch,
two then three wide around the far turn, got brushed from outside in upper stretch and could not rally. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) tracked the lead from

IMPOSSIBLE TASK hustled early and took the early lead, lost command at the five-eighths pole, chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide leaving the
bend, rallied alongside at the eighth pole, took over soon after and held gamely over the runner-up. ALBIZU broke out, lacked early speed, angled from the
four path to the rail around the turn, angled out in the lane and rallied between rivals and finished gamely inside the winner. BIG SCOTT DADDY traveled
near the back of the pack early on, saved ground along the inside, bid along the fence in the drive but faltered in deep stretch. HOLDEN THE LUTE tracked
the pace outside a rival, went four then five wide around the turn and went evenly late. AUGUSTA MELODY stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, bid
outside at the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, relinquished control midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. WIPE THE SLATE away quickly in the
beginning, chased off the rail, three then two wide on the turn and weakened. DONCIC chased early while a bit rank fighting the rider, went up to take
command at the five-eighths then cleared outside rival, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, resisted to the stretch, then weakened in the drive.
CRASH CORRIGAN went two to three wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

SUPER GAME dueled for command from inside to the stretch, cleared rival in upper stretch and held well under urging. TAMING THE TIGRESS broke in
and bumped rival, stalked on the inside, waited for room around the turn, lacked room in upper stretch and shifted out to a clear path at the eighth pole, then
finished well to earn the place. BELLA D got bumped from outside at the start, saved ground to the lane, lacked room in the pocket by the leader in upper
stretch and finished willingly to the wire. SHYLOCK EDDIE off bit slow to begin, allowed to settle and angled to the inside, swung out into the stretch and
finished well to fill out the superfecta. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA dueled from outside into and around the turn, then flattened between rivals in deep stretch.
GYPSY BLU stalked off inside then between foes, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a late bid. LUXURY LINER
forwardly placed outside the top pair, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. SQUARED SHADY chased outside rivals, went four wide around the
bend and never responded when asked. HOT ON THE TRAIL off a bit slow to begin, raced off the rail, angled in on the turn, steered out in the lane and
lacked a rally. DR WYSONG trailed early, went three then four wide wide around the turn and was always outrun. EMMA'S DANCE tracked outside a pair of
rivals early, remained outside a runner then four wide into the stretch and weakened. GOTTA BE LUCKY tracked off the inside then between rivals, dropped
back around the turn and tired.
