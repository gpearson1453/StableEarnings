GIVE ME TWO STEPS vied out of the gate then gained a clear advantage and held firm still unasked around the turn, saved ground entering the lane,
widened advantage under pressure and remained well clear. PROUD CONTENDER broke outward at the start and raced in range near the inside, given
cue past the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner entering the lane and sustained a steady inside bid for second best. KING FORCE chased after the leader
around the turn, went two wide into the lane and churned on for a share. WIND NINETY NINE got shut off at the start when PROUD CONTENDER veered
out, raced in the back then three wide into the lane and had no response. GOT FLOFFY raced up close in the opening quarter then failed to keep pace and
checked while fading around the turn.

TRAPPEZOID dueled outside of FACE OF VICTORY through the backstretch and battled on around the turn, shook free approaching the top of the stretch
and remained clear near the inside under steady urging. FACE OF VICTORY vied inside of TRAPPEZOID for the early lead, continued to match strides
around the turn, could not move on with the winner at the head of the lane but remained in pursuit and held place. HERO TIGER tracked the embattled pair
through early stages, commenced a steady bid around the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and secured show. SCAR raced off the early pace,
went four wide into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. JOE DI BAGGIO was not too far back in early stages, came two wide into the lane and offered
no late bid. JUPITER BLUES showed response in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

YES I'M SPITEFUL settled out of the gate and went two wide into the backstretch, tracked the pace to the far turn then launched a bid for the command,
remained game in pursuit of UKIYO through the lane and edged by foe in deep stretch. UKIYO quickly established the early lead and set the pace through
the backstretch, held firm two wide around the far turn, stayed on with response in the lane but could not hold off the winner in final stages. STRAIGHT TO
GO settled through early stages and raced off the second flight with a half mile left to run, given cue three wide near the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid
through the lane and cleared show. PRESSLY'S HOPE tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch, came under a ride on the inside around the far turn,
failed to move on and steadily weakened. ROYAL ROCKER stalked the leader to the far turn, came under a ride two wide and had no response.
CAPETOWN CANDY raced in the back three to four wide and never menaced.

LONG BLADE took over the lead and angled inside after the start, held a slim lead through early stages then took clearer command around the turn, saved
ground entering the lane then came out a few paths and held firm. MARCELINO applied pace pressure to LONG BLADE in the opening quarter, remained in
pursuit around the turn then was set down two wide for the drive, gained closer contention but could not reach the winner. ITALIAN CHARM lacked early
speed, went five wide into the lane and produced a mild rally to gain a share. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR chased up close in early stages, ran on three wide
around the turn then evened out. TENACITY ZIP launched a rail bid around the turn, stayed inside into the lane and had no late kick. FUZZY IRISH
RASCAL was not far back in the opening quarter then had no response when called upon and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
LADY BAFFLED hustled along in steady pursuit then moved up three wide to challenge for the lead approaching the quarter pole, dueled outside of
MADEFORSUMMER in the lane, shook free from rival nearing the final sixteenth then held late over fast gaining CHROME RACER. The latter hustled along
in steady pursuit, came four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure and was getting to the winner in final strides.
MADEFORSUMMER dueled inside of EASY for the early lead, battled on around the turn and took on the added challenge of LADY BAFFLED approaching
the quarter pole, battled inside of eventual winner through the lane then failed to be a match nearing the final sixteenth. LADY PUCHI raced off the early
speed, saved ground around the turn, came out three to four wide and needed more for late impact. MAGNOLIA MIST raced in the back, saved ground on
the rail into the lane and lacked a needed rally. EASY was a bit skittish loading in the gate then was off to a good start and vied outside of
MADEFORSUMMER, matched strides around the turn then came up empty turning for home. APPLES AND HONEY showed interest in the opening quarter
then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
HEY PADRE applied pace pressure to HAIL TO THE CHIEF through the backstretch then headed in pursuit of the leader late on the far turn, dueled outside
of rival through the lane then shook free under steady urging and held firm. MO HAWK quickly cleared on top and angled inside after the start, set a
moderate pace through the backstretch then came under attack from HEY PADRE late on the far turn, dueled inside of rival through into the final furlong
then failed to move on with the winner and held place. HAIL TO THE CHIEF was allowed to settle through early stages then was ridden along at the quarter
pole, angled out three to four wide in the upper stretch, responded under pressure and produced a solid finish. MISTER LEONARDO was unhurried along
the inside, headed in pursuit three furlongs from home, gained on the inside then between foes and loomed a threat late on the far turn, continued a bid in
range through the lane but needed more for serious impact. THENORTHREMEMBERS tracked the pace on the inside, was ridden along the rail around the
far turn then gave way in the lane. THORN rated off the top two leaders through the backstretch then weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
GANGLY raced in pursuit up the inside in early stages then loomed up three wide at the quarter pole, took over the lead approaching the upper stretch and
widened advantage under steady pressure. MAN OF VISION chased between foes in a compact flight then got shuffled back past the three eighths pole,
launched a re-bid two wide at the head of the lane and finished second best. HANDSOME PRINCE raced outside foes in the second flight around the turn,
sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane and secured show. ROYAL SQUEEZE hustled along in pursuit two wide between foes into the turn,
stayed on four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for serious impact. FIRST RULE vied outside of ONE FAST for the early lead, continued
to match strides around the turn then gave way in the lane. VINNIE VAN GO got bumped at the start then chased between foes in the second flight,
steadied approaching the quarter pole and weakened. ONE FAST held a slim lead in early stages then vied outside of FIRST RULE, fought back around the
turn then came up empty in the lane. FRENCHMEN STREET raced in the back then three wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
PURE SPEIGHT dueled inside of GLORIOUS BUISNESS for the early lead and battled on into the lane, dug in gamely and held a slight edge at the eighth
pole then widened advantage under steady pressure. GLORIOUS BUSINESS dueled outside of PURE SPEIGHT through early stages, fought back gamely
into the lane, could not move on with the winner in late stages but stayed on with effort. CRAFTY CRUSADER angled inside opening stages, launched a
three wide bid for the top pair near the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and bested the rest. WILDCAT ECHO raced off the early
speed, was ridden along two wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. GATORATER lacked speed, raced four wide into the lane and never
threatened. PALIMONIUM hustled along three to four wide and had failed to move on. TELECAST saved ground around the turn and had no late response.
