Footnotes
MY SIS CINDY came out and bumped rivals at the start, chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, eased out three wide
into the stretch, put to a drive in the lane and surged very late to get up at the wire. AT THE MARGIN pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch,
continued to hold the rail into the turn, found room along the inside entering the stretch, battled with leader in upper stretch, took the lead inside the
sixteenth, led into the final jumps, and nailed by outside rival at the wire in a very game effort. PERFECT REFLECTION bumped both sides at the start, took
command off the rail on the backstretch, continued to lead two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the two path and dueled with rallying inside rival in upper
stretch, lost lead approaching the sixteenth, gamely battled back and finished a game third after closing outside rival surged for the win. DAIRY KID bumped
by inside rival at the start, tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the three path, split rivals in
upper stretch and launched a mild rally under urging. SURPRISE PARTY knocked into rival at the start, pressed pace outside of leader on a loose reign on
the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and faded in upper stretch. EXPENSIVE DEVON off slow and settled off
the pace along the rail, continued to save ground on the turn and into the stretch, made mild progress while passing tired rivals in the lane. EXCESS COIL
bumped by inside rival into outside rival at the start, settled off the pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, altered to the inside in
upper stretch and failed to improve when asked. SWEETENER away well and settled into a tracking position widest on the backstretch, continued four wide
on the turn and into the stretch, asked and failed to respond, and coasted in to the finish.
