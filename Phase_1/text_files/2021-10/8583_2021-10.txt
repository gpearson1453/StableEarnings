Footnotes
GALTERO trailed for a little over a half, swung wide, closed rapidly past the middle of the racetrack and got up in the final strides. LAS ANA settled widest,
closed with a rapid moved into the far turn, quickly opened a daylight lead, drifted out to mid track through the stretch under right handed urging and was
caught nearing the wire. LEND AMERICA settled mid pack, swung wide, lacked room behind the drifting leader in the final stages, altered course inward
and finished with good courage. MR ZYDECO inside, failed to menace. DIAMOND LUCKIE passed tiring rivals. MUSTY RED vied for the lead along the
inside for a half, put a head in front briefly then weakened on the far turn. IRIE ISLAND MAN checked behind tiring rivals on the second turn then was never
a threat. PLONDER set the pace for a little over a half then was used up. HE'S A BELIEVER pressed the pace two and three wide then faltered on the
second turn. SILVER DOLLAR CITY pressed the pace three then four wide and stopped on the far turn. THE RIDER OF LEND AMERICA LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LAS ANA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
GOLDEN TEMPLE trailed widest into the turn, dropped inside, closed fast, made the lead past the furlong marker and drew off under right handed urging.
CARDIOVERSION chased the pace into the stretch, swung wide and finished second best in the six path. SHANNON'S GIRL never far back, angled in on
the turn and finished with good courage in the two path. DUDES LAWYER sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch,
drifted out then weakened late. NAUGHTY NELLIE close up for three furlongs, swung wide then gave way. MAGIC IN A HAT was no factor. NATALIA'S
TEMPLE had brief speed.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS ENJOY pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, dug in determinedly in the five path and got up in the final strides. CAZMAN close up near
the inside, angled out four wide entering the stretch, rallied to make the lead near the furlong marker, drifted in causing a chain reaction of bumping to his
inside, edged clear and just missed hanging on. BANDERAS never far back, passed tiring rivals late four wide. EKATI CHAMPAGNE pressed the pace two
then three wide into the stretch, was forced inward at the furlong marker causing him to bump rivals and checked then faded. GIO SAMMY set a pressured
pace from the two path into the stretch, was in tight and bumped between rivals at the furlong marker then dropped out of it. YEARS FLY BY close up from
the start, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch, was bumped at the furlong maker and dropped back. DIVULGENCE failed to menace. STRETCH
RUNNER was no factor. JIMMYS LIFESTYLE had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED
CAZMAN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH AND PLACED HIM SIXTH.

Footnotes
CARMEN OHIO chased the pace two wide through the turn, shifted out to the four path, rallied to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew off under
mild urging. CAN I GO TOO slow early, closed with a rush four wide through the stretch. ZENMODE close up, finished with good courage three wide. SHEZ
SHACKED UP rushed to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened. ARTIES CRYPTONITE close up inside, failed to
respond. MY BEST SIDE failed to menace. ABIGAIL LEE was no threat. ANGELINA was no factor. RONNI'S DAY chased the pace from the four path and
was through after a half. PRICEY APPEAL had brief speed five wide. SKIPSHOT LILLY was through early. COSTUME JEWELRY was never involved,
