Footnotes
MUCHO UNUSUAL broke through the gate prior to the start, stalked in the two path or outside a rival, took aim three wide leaving the far turn, roused in
upper stretch, took over and cleared briefly with a furlong remaining, dueled with TAPWATER in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. TAPWATER off slow to
begin, reserved between rivals first time through the stretch, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, angled four to five wide entering the stretch, drew
alongside the winner inside the eighth pole, dueled to the wire but could not get by. KUORA (PER) broke through the gate prior to the start, stalked along
the inside, angled three to four wide into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and steered inside approaching the eighth pole, finished willingly inside the
top pair but lacked the needed late punch. FAST JET COURT (BRZ) unhurried in the beginning, raced off the rail then came four wide into the stretch and
produced a mild late bid. SHE'S OUR CHARM set the pace on the inside, gained company at the half-mile pole, got headed by rival at the three-eighths,
lost command around the bend, fought to the quarter pole, and weakened in the lane. QUIET SECRETARY raced up close outside the pacesetter, applied
pressure at the half-mile pole, raced on even terms into the far turn, took over around the far turn, led clear into the stretch, collared by the winner in upper
stretch and gave way. SASSYSERB tracked outside rivals then off the rail, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and came
up empty.

Footnotes
SMILEFORME vied four deep up the backstretch, dueled outside PLATINUM EQUITY through the turn and into the stretch, cleared inside the eighth pole
and was kept to task to the wire. PLATINUM EQUITY vied for the lead three deep between rivals, dueled from inside around the turn, fought to midstretch
and had to settle for second best. MR. DOUGIE FRESH stalked the speed battle from off the rail, took the turn four then three wide and outkicked PELICAN
WAY for the show honors. PELICAN WAY got shuffled mildly between runners early, steered to the rail and got sent inside the top trio, lost ground into the
turn, angled to the two path around the bend, moved out in the stretch and lost the show. INDY JONES tracked four wide through the turn and made no
impact. BAM BAM AGAIN vied for the lead early up the backstretch, lost ground around the turn, chased along the rail into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
LETSGETLUCKY broke a bit slow, chased along the inside then steered off the rail, bid outside the leader on the turn and dueled to the lane, kicked clear in
upper stretch and drifted to the inside, then drew away in the final furlong. PRINCIPE CARLO pressed the pace from inside early then chased past the
half-mile pole, exited the bend two wide, moved out to the three path in the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. SQUALOTORO raced off the pace,
traveled outside a rival and two to three wide on the turn, showed a mild response to asking and nose out FIRST PREZ for third. FIRST PREZ broke out, got
crowded a bit between foes early, steered outside into the clear, went three deep into the turn, driven three wide into the stretch and got edged for the show
honors. NICHIREN set the pace outside a rival, cleared at the half-mile pole then crossed over to the inside, dueled with rival on the turn and into the
stretch, lost contact then switch outside the leader with a furlong to go and weakened. PREACHING TRAINER broke a step slow and got pinched back
between foes at the start, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EASTERN OCEAN broke well then stalked the leader from outside, got floated out crossing over the dirt by the leader, took over in upper stretch and drew
clear in the final sixteenth. NEWPARK (IRE) sped clear to take control, angled down the two path for the turn, drifted out crossing surfaces, lost the lead in
upper stretch and stayed on to hold the place. GREGORY'S PRIDE stalked three deep through the turn, angled out into the stretch, got bumped late and
gained the show. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR traveled in mid-pack from inside, lacked a bid in the lane but kept on and got edged for the show. TULSA
TORNADO off a bit slow to start, settled off the rail, raced between rivals around the turn, angled inward in upper stretch and needed to find more late.
UNCLE ADDOUMA tracked well off the inside, went five wide into the turn, moved down to the three path then steered back out nearing the stretch, urged
between rivals in the lane and finished one-pace. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB) off slow to begin, sat off the pace, raced three then four wide into the lane, came
out in upper stretch, drifted in and bumped rival late and never threatened. FLY THE SKY off slow to begin, raced near the back of the pack, steered out in
upper stretch and lacked room behind rivals late. CHERUBIC FACTOR threw his head and hopped at the start, raced wide into the lane and was never a
factor. DOMINANT SOUL forwardly placed near the inside through the turn, moved out in the stretch and faded.

BRILLIANT CUT pressed three deep then outside the pacesetter, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took over nearing the quarter pole, cleared in upper
stretch and held safely. LITTLE MISS ELLIE raced off the pace outside a pair of rivals, asked three wide around the turn and finished well to earn the place
honors. KEEP YOUR COIL broke out and came away a bit slow, was a bit rank between foes early, lost ground to the top pair leaving the backstretch,
chased two wide to the stretch, kept to task through the drive and was along for the show. I'M THE BOSS OF ME set the pace from inside under pressure,
got headed at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished command nearing the quarter pole, stayed alongside to upper stretch and weakened. MALIBU HANNAH
bumped with inner rival at the start, traveled between foes in the second flight, went two then three wide around the turn and failed to menace. HOUSE OF
TARGARYEN bumped leaving the gate, chased inside a pair of rivals at the back, exited the far turn two wide and came up empty.

TALKATIVE GAL attended the pace three deep, pressed two wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch, drifted through the lane and held gamely.
AWESOME TAYLOR settled off the rail, raced four into the turn, ranged up three wide entering the stretch, drew alongside TALKATIVE GAL, got floated out
through the lane and lacked the needed late punch to get by. BEACHGRASS settled inside then shifted to the two path around the turn, closed well inside
the top pair and proved a game third. KOBE IN MOTION off slow to begin, trailed in the early stages off the rail, went between rivals at the five-sixteenths
pole, moved to the three path around the turn, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally. HEAD START set the pace under pressure from BIG
MAMA THORNTON, put away that rival early on the turn, got tested again by TALKATIVE GAL and held a short lead to the stretch, ceded control in upper
stretch and gave way. SANGRE AZUL raced well off the pace early on, went three to four wide around the turn and failed to menace. BIG MAMA
THORNTON sent early, shifted in prior to the five-eighths pole, pressed between foes up the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, tired and eased in
the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) stalked the pace from inside then went between rivals, tipped out in the lane and drew alongside the runner-up with a sixteenth
remaining and got up late. SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR stalked in the two path then went up to apply pressure from outside, headed rival at the eighth pole, took
over in midstretch but got outkicked by the winner in the late stages. JAVANICA off alertly to begin then ceded the lead, was rated on the inside, waited for
room around the second bend, lacked room from upper to midstretch, found some room to run late and gained the show. ZERO TOLERANCE broke out,
corrected and sped clear then crossed over into the first turn, set the early pace then gained pressure in the middle stages, held command through the far
turn and into the stretch, clung to a narrow advantage with a furlong to go, relinquished the lead in midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. EDDIE'S
NEW DREAM hopped at the start, settled on the inside, angled out on the far turn, came three wide into lane, tried to angle out but was hemmed in and
lacked room in upper stretch, steered back to the inside and kept on under mild encouragement. FREEDOM FLYER unhurried in the beginning, traveled in
the two path around the first turn, went between foes in the middle stages, came four wide into drive and failed to threaten. MADONE got bumped from
inside at the start, settled at the back in the two path, moved out further on the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn, four wide into the lane and
could not find more in deep stretch. EGO TRIP (IRE) broke out and bumped rival at the start, rated in the two path early, raced outside a pair of rivals on the
backstretch and continued three deep to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MOOSE MITCHELL steadied when losing path early, tracked along the inside then angled three wide into the stretch, rallied to the front in midstretch and
won going away. CREATIVE PEAK set the pace under pressure, headed by rival midway around the turn, dueled to midstretch, was overtaken by the
winner and stayed on to secure the place. TRIBAL DANCING pressed the pace from outside, challenged around the turn, battled to midstretch, could not
kick on the winner and got edged for the place honors. STRAIGHT UP LOV stalked from outside, went three to four wide around the turn and lacked a late
bid. GRAZEN IN THE PARK off slow to begin, raced two wide through the turn, moved out in the stretch and passed tired rivals. STAR ENTRY attended the
pace three deep up the backstretch, chased the top pair three wide to the lane and faded. MR BUG Z sat off the pace in the early stages, angled in on the
turn and could not rally. JACK SIXPACK off a bit slow to start, dropped back to last entering the turn, raced wide through the bend and was outrun.

wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and came with a late run while unable to threaten the top pair. BLOSSOMING off slow to start, traveled along the
inside then went between foes near the halfway point, shifted to the inside nearing the second bend, waited behind rivals with a quarter mile remaining,
angled three wide leaving the bend and faltered in the final furlong. MACRELLETTA vied three deep around the first turn, prompted the pace from outside

the stretch run. FRENCH FRANC (FR) got crowded between rivals early, sat well off the pace, came three wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch
