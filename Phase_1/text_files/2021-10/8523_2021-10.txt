ROUSING YOU BABE was away a bit slowly and chased the leaders from the rear, was three to four wide on the turn and made a steady run in the stretch
to claim the place, while not a match for the winner. DIZZY LIZZY pressed the early pace from between horses on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch
run. PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and showed late interest in the stretch, but was not pressuring the leaders.
CHARMING GIRL tracked the pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch run. MUCHTOMYSURPRISE prompted the early pace while
saving ground and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ALESHA sat just off of the early pace, mounted a bid from the three path on the turn, confronted TRIBUTE TO JAZZ leaving the turn and kicked clear in the
end. AMANDA ROSE had no early speed, saved ground on the turn while still near the rear, rallied in the stretch and while no match for the winner won the
nod for the place. MARANDO PASS settled in the second flight, gained on the turn while two wide but was outfinished in the stretch, missing for second.
SACRED BEAUTY was a bit slow into stride and chased the early leaders from the rear, was three to four wide on the turn and did not make a late rally in
the stretch. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ was off well and contested the early pace, led leaving the turn but weakened in the stretch run. THISONESFORBARRY
pressed the early pace while saving ground and gave way in the stretch run. BRITTANY BREEZE chased the early pace from a ground saving position and
faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST was away well, set all of the fractions through the second turn, had a clear lead into the stretch and won in a drive. BOLD ARTICLE settled
off of the early pace, improved position along the second turn while four wide and continued that run into stretch to claim the place, while not pressuring the
winner. MANGOTANGO settled near the rear of the field, gained ground while three wide on the second turn but was outfinished in the stretch drive.
KERRALIA was forwardly placed to stalk the early pace while saving ground and was outkicked in the stretch run. SEGURO prompted the early pace, was
still in contention leaving the second turn but gave way in the late going. TOTALLY NORMAL chased the early pace from the second flight and weakened in
the stretch run. MALIBU JEWEL rider lost irons at the start and was not persevered with.
