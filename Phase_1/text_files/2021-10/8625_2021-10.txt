Footnotes
UPTOWN GEORGIE showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and raced well clear through the stretch run under a steady hand ride.
RECKLESS LOVE MHF pressed the early leader from the inside and was no match in the drive. JHESSABELL stalked the top pair from the outside, made a
rail bid through the far turn into the stretch and had not enough. FLYINGJ GIDEON dropped to the back of the pack early, raced four to five wide into the
upper stretch and had no late rally. RB BLYTZ was slow early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and never threatened. KD DERBY
GIRL was hustled and failed to respond. WMA RED SAND was off slowly, rushed to contention and tired readily.
