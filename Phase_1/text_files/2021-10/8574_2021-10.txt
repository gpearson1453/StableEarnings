Footnotes
ASIA ASIA pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, surged clear into the lane, was kept busy into just inside the
eighth pole and was ridden out to the end while widening her advantage. BEAUTIFUL D stepped out at the start bumping outside rival, moved to the lead
into turn, was under pressure from the inside into the far turn, could not keep up with the winner but kept on to save the place spot. QT BLIEGH raced near
the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and finished evenly while just missing the place spot. FREE TO RUN stumbled and was
bumped solidly at the start, raced near the rail into the turn, was checked when in tight early in turn, raced near the rail through the turns, came off the inside
into the lane and never was a serious threat. VOL DE SOLEIL chased the pace from the three path through the turns and lacked a closing response.
BEYONDSPOTLIGHT bobbled and bumped at the start, raced near the rail through the turns and was always last.

Footnotes
AL MILLON BOB stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained a clear lead into the lane, remained clear
with an eighth to go then was under an intermittent drive to the wire to hold. SONIC BURN was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into
the lane from the five path with momentum and finished with good energy while cutting into the deficit to the wire. EMERALD'S BOLT chased the two rival
duel through the turn, bid three wide near the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane with aim on the winner then weakened late. GO MANNY GO set
the pace while in the two path into the far turn, dropped closer to the inside in late turn then gave way along the rail. C F V NOBODYCARES was never a
factor while in the two or three path through the turns. VISERION ICE chased the pace into the far turn then was empty in mid-turn.

Footnotes
JOVA settled off the early pace, bid three wide and in the four path through mid-turn, cleared into the lane then held while being to the task. UNBRIDLED
BEAST vied for the lead from between rivals through mid-turn, could not keep up with the winner into the lane then chased that one home while well clear of
the next foe. FIRERY TALE vied for the early lead into the turn, settled off and was shuffled back when others rushed wide, re-bid into the lane and could
only manage a distant show. TOMATO BILL vied for the early lead while two wide through mid-turn, dropped to the rail when giving ground in late turn and
was empty into the lane. GOOD ONE stumbled to his knees at the start, trailed into the turn from the two or three path and was never in it.

TAPIT'S SPIRIT vied for the early lead two wide into the turn, cleared in mid-turn, widened into the lane then held while being kept to the task. TWO LAST
WORDS was bumped at the start, raced in the two path through the turn, split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and cleared for the place spot. POWELL
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the leader, moved closest to that one with an
eighth to go then needed more. THE QUEENS JULES broke out at the start and bumped outside rival, hustled up to challenge for the lead, could not keep
up with the winner then weakened in the drive. SLICK SILVER bid from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and
weakened. BANDIDO DE AMORES was in the three path through the turn and never factored. LITTLE KANSAS was in the four path through the turn,
swung into the lane from the five path while under a drive then faltered.

Footnotes
DEAN MARTINI settled off the pace down the backstretch, bid from the four path and three wide through late turn, gained a short lead into the lane,
maintained the advantage while under pressure then shook clear and widened late. EGO unhurried early while off the rail, bid four wide with the winner
through late turn, pressed the top one into the lane then could not keep up late while clearly second best. KING'S OVATION vied for the lead from the inside
into mid-turn, was no match for the top two into the lane then stayed on to pick up the minor share. NEPAL UP trailed into the far turn while near the inside,
was asked for more after mid-turn, came quickly into the lane from the seven path then flattened out late and missed the show spot. GOLD MONEY vied for
the lead two wide through mid-turn and was no longer a contender entering the lane. MR. QUALITY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn
then faded.

SMOOTH JUSTICE was clear early in the two path and held sway under mild urging. ROYAL'S GIRL stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late
bid. PEEKACHICA was unrushed in the two path and then found her best stride late. EXPRESS LADY saved ground to no avail. TINY SNEAKERS was off
awkwardly, stalked the pace in the four path, then faded in the stretch. WISHED was not a factor. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER raced in the four path before
fading. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE stalked the pace inside before giving way on the turn.

SISTER JUSTICE was clear early, was challenged late on the outside and was all out to last. AMAZINGNESS was bumped at the start, raced inside, angled
five wide at the quarter pole, rallied and proved second best. SONG OF THE SIREN raced four wide and bid belatedly for the show. BEYOND JUSTICE
stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late bid. SKIPPINJUSTICE saved ground, then gave way in the stretch. WRAPPINJUSTICE raced evenly.
MAYBE PRIZE and GIDDY GOOTZ were through early. HERKINDOFJUSTICE pressed the pace outside of the winner before giving way in the stretch.
