LICORICE DROP POPS settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out with a furlong to run, reached ROMAN RUSH nearing the sixteenth pole and
drew clear. ROMAN RUSH pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to open a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and yielded to the winner
through the final sixteenth. YEAR OF THE OX raced off the pacesetters early, checked nearing the eighth pole, moved inside and finished with good
energy. CREST DRIVE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. PURE PURSUIT set a pressured
pace while racing three-wide, was bumped nearing the three-eighths pole and gave way after going a half. KOA CAT showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. DREAMER'S REALITY threw his head at the break, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through
the second turn and did not offer a bid. GRAY GEM was bumped at the start, pressed the pace from between foes, was bumped again nearing the
three-eighths marker and weakened.

authority. JUST CLASSY lagged early, advanced three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy to gain the place. MISS
IMPORTANT lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. CHASE THE MUSIC chased the leaders from the
inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. BLOWING BAYOU was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly. CHIEFS LIL PEARL chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually gave way. CLAY'S QUARTZ lacked early foot, saved ground
throughout and did not offer a bid. HOLD THAT SMILE raced five-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the

not reach contention. CHIQUITA PIQUITA showed brief speed and weakened. PENNY JOE raced five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced

Footnotes
COSMIC TRIPSTER broke sharply to duel for the lead with KAYLA'S COWGIRL while racing three-wide, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and
edged away late. KAYLA'S COWGIRL was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way grudgingly to that foe in a
vigorous drive. PIN UP LADY settled off the leaders from the inside and finished with a steady bid. SHEZ A GRINDER lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. THECHAMPISFLORING chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.
ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL bobbled at the break, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BABY ROSE was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. MY LITE NITE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. RICKIE NINE TOE'S raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. NOBLE GIRL
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BRETT was away in good order to press the pace of PREMIER LEAGUE from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and quickly drew
off. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the third turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. PREMIER LEAGUE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way to the winner after going a half. LUKE'S
PLACE hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the third turn and finished with a late bid. LONO settled off the leaders from the
inside and failed to rally. GOLDEN FLAME raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the third turn and was not a factor. LORD VADER
showed brief speed and weakened. CUDDLY PANDA bobbled at the start and lagged throughout.
