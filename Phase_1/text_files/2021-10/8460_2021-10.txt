CALL ME KITTY broke alertly but settled at the rear of the pack, closed three-wide on the turn, bid approaching the stretch, dueled, led a furlong out and
widened under a hand ride. TOPOFTHEGLEN stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, bid approaching the stretch, dueled but could not match
strides with the winner and chased to the end. DONTCALLMESWEETY pressed the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished
gamely. ERRATIQUE gained a short early lead then drew clear, set the pace, was engaged late turn, yielded upper stretch and faded. CRUMLIN JET
settled at the back of the pack, closed two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. UNBEE NOANST was taken back early and
settled with rivals at the back of the pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
FIONNUALA stalked the pace, closed along the rail from mid backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn, challenged at the top of the stretch, battled, then
prevailed late under a hand ride. SUPER LUNAR stumbled at the break, settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the far turn, bid at the top of the
stretch, dueled, but was outfinished in the late stages. MIA'S AUTHORITY showed early speed, had a short lead mid turn, was engaged and dueled on the
backstretch, led at the half, moved clear into the far turn, was joined at the top of the stretch, was quickly headed and gave way. LA PRINCESSA POLLY
showed brief sleep as well, stalked on the backstretch, was shuffled back on the far turn, chased along the rail and finished gamely in vain. ROSA'S SOUL
broke outward, closed four-wide into the first turn, dueled into the backstretch, was headed mid backstretch, chased briefly but backed away from mid turn.
CLIFF'S HEAD stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then lacked rally. ONLY BELIEVE broke outward and was steadied sharply, was in
hand to the first turn then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SPEAK UNITY dueled early but drew away on the main track, was lugging out on the turn but continued to extend his advantage under a steady drive.
GANCHO raced in mid pack, came four and five-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was up late to take place. INCENDIO settled off the pace, was
hustled three-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. I'M A CHI TOO dueled briefly, stalked the pace, closed late turn but leveled out in
deep stretch. STUNNING RIVERS broke inward, settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but lacked a rally. QUEEN CASHMERE was taken back at
the outset, raced from off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but never reached contention. MUSICAL RELOAD pressed the pace early, settled
in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DEMOGORGON was the outside participant in a four way battle for the front, kicked clear with one of those combatants turning for home and had a clear
advantage by the sixteenth pole, keeping safe to the wire under urging. AT THE LYRIC sat off the pace and three wide, stayed three wide on the turn
closing into midpack, came out to the five path in upper stretch and gained ground to the wire outside, inching up without threatening the winner. DAZZLING
DIVA off the pace early, still near the rear two to three wide on the turn, shifted in at the eighth pole and straightened out quickly, closing with good late
energy while widest. MAJESTIC HORIZON broke out and bumped a rival at the start, was at the back and under restraint, got room in upper stretch and
zigzagged through traffic, brushing with rivals and running on erratically for a minor award. MISS BRENTWOOD was three wide in a duel for the front,
moved in tandem with the winner to put away the two pace combatants to their inside, stayed with that one to the final furlong when flattening out.
GORMLEY GIRL sat in midpack, was the closest pursuer of the four battlers dueling for the front turning for home but was outkicked down the final furlong.
OLYMPIC FENCER was inside a four way scramble for the lead which lasted until upper stretch, staying on gamely but tiring inside the final furlong.
INTENSE COMPANY (IRE) was bumped by a rival at the start and settled off the pace on the inside, angled out at the top of the stretch but was laying in
and went back to the fence at the sixteenth, levelling off from there. LOADED VIXEN was two wide in a four horse duel, began to taper off as they turned for
home and retreated in the final furlong. CULATELLO sat in midpack, found a seam between runners at the quarter pole but her mild rally flattened out at the
sixteenth marker. LOADED SECRET off the pace and two to four wide on the turn, never entering contention. WALTZOFTHESAMURAI rushed up the
inside but settled back to chase the fourpack on the lead, retreating on the turn and through the stretch.

LAMENT raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied and led a 16th out under driving. DAY TRIPPER, bothered at the start,
stalked the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, bid approaching the stretch, drove clear a furlong out but was passed mid stretch and chased to the
end. RAPPER ZAPPER, off slowly, raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied along the rail. READY FOR THE LADY
was off slowly, settled in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed gamely. STYLISH GENT broke outward,
pressed the pace, forced the issue on the far turn, dueled, but gave way a furlong out. THRILL OF THE DAY set a reserved pace, was headed at the top of
the stretch and retreated. LIKESO stalked, closed four and five-wide through the far turn but lacked a closing response. STEALTH MISSION steadied at the
break, settled off the pace and failed to menace.

Footnotes
REGAL INTENT was in the early mix for the front but took back and chased the duelers, re-engaged the lone pacesetter late on the turn and led in upper
stretch, widening and holding safe to the wire. CHANCEL was between runners for the front early, pressed inside when the winner took back, gave up the
lead to the eventual show finisher but re-rallied late in the stretch to capture the place spot along the inside of that foe. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE broke out at
the start, was three wide pushing the front and took the lead on the turn, was collared turning for home by the winner and lost the place late to the other front
end combatant who came on again. MAD DOG N JOE trailed early, had one beat on the turn when inside a foursome chasing the front pack, inside in upper
stretch and angled out in midstretch, closing well between the place and show finishers late but running out of real estate. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ off the
pace early, came three wide on the turn between runners chasing the top trio, but could only put in a mild run down the lane. EXPO rushed up inside the trio
scrambling for the early lead, took back to chase when that didn't work out, dropped back and was surrounded by rivals on the turn, running greenly down
the lane while inching up, his head held high. FOREST SELECTION began awkwardly but was in the scramble for the front early, abruptly falling back when
seemingly tussling with his rider and trailed by a wide margin on the turn and out in the four path, a minor close all that occurred in the stretch. TIZ
ROMANTIC off the pace, rallied four wide on the turn but ran out of steam at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
ENGLISH CONQUEROR settled off the pace, came four-wide through the clubhouse turn, chased three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the
stretch, bid a furlong out and drove clear then finished under a hand ride. RELIABILITY raced from off the pace, closed two and three-wide through the far
turn then rallied gamely between foes, coming his best in the late stages. SHANGASSAH settled off the pace, came three-wide through the first turn, closed
three and four-wide on the far turn, chased five-wide into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. VICTORY TOWN showed an early turn of speed
and drew off a comfortable lead, set a reserved pace, was asked for more upper stretch but was swarmed a furlong out and gave way grudgingly.
HOLYFIELD raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turns, launched an all out stretch drive but leveled out in the late stages. BROADWAY settled in mid
pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. SMALL TALK stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide late turn, was up close
in early stretch but evened out in the final furlong. UNILATERAL settled off the pace, chased hard on the far turn, caught the field in the stretch but failed to
menace.
