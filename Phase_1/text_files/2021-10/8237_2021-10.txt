Footnotes
THE DON OF SQUAN sat comfortably behind the leaders racing up the backstretch, while ALLABOUTTHEBEACH set an early pace only to be challenged
by ENGLISH LAD while biding his time with a ground saving trip. When the the rail opened at the quarter pole he was asked for more and dug in to
challenge ENGLISH LAD. Through the lane the two raced together as a pair until the final sixteenth when ultimately THE DON OF SQUAN bested an
equally game ENGLISH LAD. GALILEE broke well and allowed the field to lead the way, three wide up the backstretch, just a handful of lengths off the
leaders, made his bid at the quarter with a four wide move, looked poised to strike but ultimately was no match for the top two. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH
broke on top and rushed to the front leading for the first half mile until tiring behind the others. BREWING STORM broke clean and was in the mix up until
the top of the stretch where he was ultimately outrun.
