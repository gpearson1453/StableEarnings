the early lead, saved ground around the turn, was outfinished for the win, but proved a clear second. MONZZA unhurried in the beginning, made a steady
gain, rallied, five wide and got up for show. FIRST METAL COUNT dueled for the early lead, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. DOUBLE
BOGEY raced near the middle of the field, made a bid, faded and was no threat late. SUDDENLY lacked early speed and was never a threat. SOUTH AL
SPARKY raced in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid and faded. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH bobbled at the start, racing in the rear and was never close.

placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. SEE SASSY RUN lacked early speed, moved up between rivals, rallied down the stretch and
needed more ground. OPPS MY BAD raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. SHE WANTS HALF raced within striking distance, came around

Footnotes
LOUISIANA HERO unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid, pulled away and finished well.
KIERKEGAARD vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the final stretch, but proved no match for the winner.
VELVET RIDGE challenged for the early lead, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. GRACIDA raced in the middle of the field, made
a mild bid, but was no factor. TURN ON THE MAGIC lacked early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. NIPPY RED pressed the early pace, had an
outside trip and faded. LOUISIANA MOON void of early speed and was never close. STRONG RULES dueled on the front end and dropped back.
