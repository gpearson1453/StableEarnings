Footnotes
OFFLEE NAUGHTY off slow to begin, got bumped from outside twice early, settled at the back on the inside, hugged the rail into the stretch, tipped out and
rallied between foes, battled with outside pair late and prevailed. LONE SCOUT bumped with inside rival at the start, pulled on the inside first time through
the stretch, remained under a hold just off the pacesetter, shifted out and bumped rival past the quarter pole, angled out with a furlong remaining, rallied
three deep late and missed. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) up close outside the pacesetter early, applied pressure on the backstretch, dueled two wide on the far
turn, took over in upper stretch, challenged from both sides late, finished gamely between but could not hold off rivals. STREET RUCKUS set the pace on
the inside, pressured in the middle stages, dueled and held a short lead through the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong.
RIO OCHO (IRE) stumbled a bit at the start, pulled off heels while between rivals, tracked the pace in the two path, got knocked into rival and had the rider
lose his irons past the quarter pole, then coasted to the wire. AMERICAN GREAT off slow and bumped leaving the gate, came in and bumped rivals twice
first time through the stretch, moved to the three path to stalk the pace, got bumped from inside past the quarter pole and faded. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LONE SCOUT FROM SECOND TO FIFTH FOR SHIFTING OUT INTO THE PATH OF RIO OCHO PAST THE
QUARTER POLE, CAUSING THE RIDER TO STEADY AND LOSE HIS IRONS AND COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
EMPIRE PASS away quickly in the beginning, dueled with I'M A GIRAFFE into and around the turn and into the stretch, cleared rival at the eighth pole and
inched away. I'M A GIRAFFE dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, battled into upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner in
the final furlong but proved second best. SANGRE AZUL chased off the pace early on, went four wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and was
along for the show. SPINNING PLATES stalked the dueling pair outside a rival, asked right-handed around the turn and never responded to urging.
JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke in leaving the gate, rushed up and chased off the heels of the leaders, traveled a bit off the rail around the turn and weakened.
NEVER SWAY lacked early speed, angled to the inside and saved ground through the turn, remained inside in the stretch and never made an impact.

Footnotes
LANE WAY sat off the pace, gained ground through the turn and angled four wide, swooped by in upper stretch while drifting inward and drew away to set a
new track record. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB) off slow in the beginning, raced between rivals at the back of the field, shifted three wide into the lane, angled out
upper stretch and bested the rest. GREGORY'S PRIDE settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, lacked room in upper stretch then shifted out
and bumped rival and rallied for the show. COMMANDER KHAI showed early speed between rivals, failed to keep up into the turn, chased three wide into
the drive, took aim in upper stretch but faltered in the furlong grounds. CHERUBIC FACTOR brushed with NEWPARK at the start, traveled four deep at the
back of the field went three then four wide around the turn, came out in upper stretch and improved postion. NEWPARK (IRE) brushed with inside rival at
the start, was a bit rank crossing surfaces early, went up to press the pace three deep, dueled three then two wide around the turn, then weakened in the
drive. FLY THE SKY off slow to begin, traveled at the back of the pack on the inside, saved ground to the lane, lacked room from upper stretch to the
sixteenth pole and was too late to get going after gaining a clear path. FIRST PREZ well placed behind the top trio up the backstretch, took the turn two
wide, got bumped from inner rival in upper stretch and weakened. MOHAWK KING (IRE) sped to the front and angled to the inside, dueled around the turn,
lost command in upper stretch and gave way.

CE CE settled off the top pair, closed in around the turn while angling three to four wide into the lane, kicked clear from SCOTISH STAR under hand urging
in upper stretch and padded the margin in the final sixteenth. ON DECK unhurried in the beginning, moved to the inside for the turn, angled three wide
leaving the bend, moved out further in upper stretch and rallied for second. SCOTISH STAR (ARG) stumbled leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside,
battled through the turn, led into the lane, yielded to CE CE in upper stretch and got edged for the place honors. PROUD EMMA off slow from inside, moved
off the rail, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to make an impact. EYES OPEN dueled outside SCOTISH STAR into and around the turn and
into the stretch, then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM off alertly from outside, showed speed then pulled when the rider tried to rate, remained close up outside the leader and stalked in
the two path, bid with five-sixteenths remaining, took a short lead outside the quarter pole, cleared in upper and remained strong to the wire under hand
urging. BIG CLARE pulled early then stalked on the inside, shifted to the two path around the far turn, chased the winner through the furlong grounds and
held the place. BIG MAMA SUE brushed by inside rival at the start, pulled early down along the inside first time through the stretch, swung four wide into the
lane and summoned a mild rally. SECRET SQUARE vied for the lead early before taking control, challenged around the far turn and relinquished control
nearing the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. WARRENS CANDY GIRL stalked the speed three wide, put in a mild bid outside the top pair
around the far turn and weakened in the drive. UNUSUAL RIDE broke out and brushed rival, pulled first time through the stretch, tracked in the two path
then came three wide into the stretch and faded. BIG STRETCH unhurried at the back and moved inside, saved ground then angled out in stretch and was
never a factor. LENA'S BIG DAY traveled in mid-pack while three wide and had little left for the stretch run. DEL MAR FLASH stumbled leaving the gate,
pulled first time through the stretch, settled in the two path near the back, angled four wide leaving the far turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WINNING MAP away quickly to take control, set the pace on the inside through the turn, remained clear into the lane, given his cue in upper stretch, urged
right-handed inside the furlong grounds and won going away. SIR LONDON off slow to begin, went up to chase from inside, shifted out and took aim two
wide around the turn, could not sustain the momentum in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. KATONAH broke well from outside, forwardly
placed in early stages, traveled two to three wide around the turn, drifted to the rail in the lane and finished a clear third. DON'T SWEAR DAVE drifted in and
bumped early, unhurried outside a rival up the backstretch, went between foes into the lane and failed to threaten. MARCO POLO brushed from outside in
the beginning, raced in range between rivals then bumped entering the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and never rallied. NO LIMITATION got
pinballed between rivals early. BIG WAVE JAMES brushed inside rival at the start, tracked three deep and bumped with rival entering the turn, pressed
upon through the bend, entered the stretch three wide and came up empty. CLAMPETT got bumped from outside early, chased four deep and got bumped
entering the turn, came four wide into the lane, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MACKINNON put in tight and clipped heels on the first turn and dropped back, remained inside through the far turn then angled out in upper stretch and
surged clear in the final sixteenth. SILVER SURFER (GB) raced up close from the two path, bid outside on the far turn, took control in upper stretch, proved
no match for the winner in the furlong grounds and stayed on for the place. PICOTA (GB) angled to the inside early, checked off heels on the first turn then
angled off the inside, traveled two wide into the second bend, entered the lane a bit off the rail, rallied and gained the show. LAW ABIDING chased the pace
in the two path then moved inside late on the first turn, moved off the rail then exited the far turn two to three wide and got outkicked for the show.
AQUITANIA ARRIVAL raced off the pace two then three wide around the first turn, traveled three deep into the second bend, angled four wide leaving the
turn, came out in upper stretch and never threatened. THIRTY FOUR COUPE sped to the front from inside, showed the way up the backstretch, met the
challenger around the far turn and maintained control to the stretch, relinquished control in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BIRTH OF
COOL unhurried in the beginning, steered down to the two path early then moved to the inside, lacked room inside leaving the turn, still could not find a
clear path in upper stretch, looked to tip out but remained inside where an opening emerged, tried to rally but lacked room again late halting all momentum.
CARBONITE went four wide around the clubhouse turn, angled down to the two path and failed to menace. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE traveled in mid-pack off
the inside, angled out leaving the far turn and weakened. IL CAPITANO went four wide around the first turn, forwardly placed from outside, started to
weaken around the far turn and faded in the stretch. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
PRIVATE MISSION chased three then two wide around the first turn, went up to press the pace from outside, took over nearing the three-eighths pole,
kicked clear around the bend and held well under right-handed urging. AS TIME GOES BY traveled along the inside then angled out on the first turn, stalked
the pace off the rail, was closest in pursuit from the two path into the drive, could not threaten the winner late but proved second best. MISS BIGLY tracked
in the two path , checked hard behind a pair of rivals at the five-sixteenths, continued two wide to the stretch and kept on to earn the show honors.
STELLAR SOUND off a bit slow to begin, went four then five wide around the first turn, went between into the second turn, traveled three then four wide
around the final bend and weakened in the drive. LADY KATE took the first turn three then four wide, came five wide into the drive and lacked a rally.
SAMURAI CHARM showed speed along the inside and established the front, set the pace with PRIVATE MISSION to the outside in the middle stages, lost
command near the three-eighths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and tired. MISS STORMY D raced four wide early, remained wide up the
backstretch, came five wide into the stretch and made no impact. CALIFORNIA KOOK off a bit slow to begin, drifted out around the first turn, entered the far
turn along the rail then exited two wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CAIRO MEMORIES traveled along the inside, moved out on the backstretch, stalked outside a rival, rallied three wide around the far turn, cleared into the
stretch, came in at the top of the lane, drew away then held safely in the final sixteenth. HELENS WELL (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, in traffic briefly at the
five-sixteenths before shifting to a clear path, angled out into the stretch and further out in the lane and rallied for second. HEMMERLE drifted out into the
first turn then moved to the two path, raced in mid-pack between foes, angled four wide into the stretch and got outfinished for second. STERLING CREST
(IRE) floated out five wide into the first turn then came back to the three path, dropped to the back leaving that turn, came out and bumped rival in upper
stretch and rallied for a minor award. MISS BELLATRIX unhurried in the beginning on the inside, took a bad step early on the clubhouse turn, continued to
chase inside to the stretch, tipped out into the lane and could not rally. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER showed early speed between rivals then taken back and
moved inside, pulled from the five-eighths pole to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally after
gaining a clear path. SATURDAY NITE GIRL traveled two wide the moved out on the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, angled five wide into the
lane, got bumped in upper stretch and could not rally. DOLLY MAY (IRE) floated out four wide on the first turn then angled down to the two path, went
between foes on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, lost her path in upper stretch and lacked any further response. SAX went three wide around
the first turn, traveled outside a pair of rivals in the middle stages, got fanned four deep on the second bend then angled back to the two path leaving the
turn and was not a factor. LIAM'S DOVE forwardly placed early then went up to prompt the pace from outside, vied between rivals with a quarter mile
remaining, then weakened down the lane. IT'S SIMPLE sped clear and set the pace along the inside, pressured up the backstretch, vied with rivals around
the second bend, lost command leaving that turn and gave way.
