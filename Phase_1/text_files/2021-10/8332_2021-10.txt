ZAFEATHER raced in mid pack, was hustled on the far turn, rallied willingly and was up late under a confident hand ride. POOLSIDE MANNERS set a
reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, was all out in the stretch but was caught late. SASSY MARTINI stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn
but evened out in deep stretch. INFINITE PASSION was off slowly, raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a strong stretch
response. ZIP IT raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly. THANKS LAURA, rated in striking range, saved
ground on the final turn, chased hard to the stretch but never reached contention. ORIGINAL ME broke outward and was steadied, settled in mid pack,
chased into the stretch but failed to menace. SHAZEEN, rated off the pace, trailed to the stretch and passed a tiring rival. TALLY ROAD stalked the pace,
dropped back on the far turn, crossed the wire and walked off.

PLEASECALLMEBACK raced back in mid pack, circled rivals on the far turn, cut in upper stretch, took command and drove clear then finished under a
hand ride. BURNING MAN was unhurried to the far turn, closed five-wide late turn and rallied gamely. TAOS (FR) settled well off the pace, closed on the far
turn, led briefly upper stretch and chased after losing the lead. FULL EXTREME, well back early, closed on the final turn, chased widest into the stretch and
closed a gap. MAMBOINTHEFOREST stalked from far back, closed on the final turn, led briefly upper stretch but gave way. CAPOEIRA was unhurried
early, raced in mid pack on the far turn but never reached contention. THRESHOLD settled off the pace, chased on the far turn, was steadied at the top of
the stretch and failed to menace. DOCTOR UPTOWN, well off the early pace, advanced on the far turn but lacked a closing response. PRIMO TOUCH
sprinted to long lead, stayed well off the rail, extended his advantage o the backstretch, began to tired midway of the far turn and was headed approaching
the stretch.

PUNCH HARD along the rail and hard held in midpack, in behind a wall of runners at the quarter pole, angled out and got a seam in upper stretch and drove
by the perfect trip leader in the final forty yards. GUESTIMATION sat a cozy rail trip behind the leader, came outside that one turning for home and drove by
inside the eighth pole but was caught by the winner in the shadow of the wire. COLEYVILLE had one beat along the inside into the first turn, worked his way
up the fence in behind the eventual place finisher turning for home, came off the rail but into traffic midstretch and by the time space appeared, the top pair
were gone, closing nicely for the show spot. WIN D'ORO three wide in midpack on the first turn, circled three to four wide to loom outside the leaders at the
top of the stretch and continued to inch up but was outkicked by the top three finishers. FINALIST sped to the front, was stalked and pressed by a rival
throughout, shook that one off but couldn't hold a clear lead in upper stretch, outrun in the final stages but still game. SOUPER WATSON was three to two
wide on the first turn chasing the leaders, came three wide to loom outside the pacesetters turning for home but stalled from midstretch to the finish.
ARGENTIUM trailed, advanced three wide on the far turn and out widest into the stretch but his mild run ran out in midstretch, the rider up in the saddle the
final seventy yards. BODE'S TIPSY hit the gate at the start and was two wide in midpack, dropping back in late backstretch and never threatening.
LOMAKI'S GEM stalked the leader throughout, bid late on the second turn but retreated down the lane.

ROLLING SLOAN hit the gate leaving, stalked the pace, chased along the rail on the turn, responded smartly upper stretch and gained steadily and was up
late under a drive. TAKOTA bumped with DISCREET BEAR at the break, set a pressured pace, dueled from mid backstretch, was headed early turn,
regained an advantage late turn, shook clear into the stretch but failed to stave off the winner in the final yards. TARA DAWN was away slowly and settled
off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely between foes. CEFALO forced the issue in the early going,
drew even with the leader midway through the backstretch, took a short lead early turn, was headed past mid turn, chased into the stretch and was game to
the end. SEA ANNA DREAM raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely outside. MY SUGAR PIE
settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn, chased into the stretch but her rally stalled in the late stages. DISCREET BEAR bumped
with TAKOTA leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. NAITAKA settled off the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but never reached contention.
