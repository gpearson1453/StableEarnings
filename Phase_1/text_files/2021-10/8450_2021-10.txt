Footnotes
SCARLETT'S FLOWER bumped with BALI MOON and stumbled at the start, lost momentum and dropped back to last, remained reserved in the back then
angled out on the turn, hustled along five wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and finished going away. BALI MOON bumped with SCARLETTS
FLOWER at the start and raced near the back, angled to the outside and circled up into contention at the five sixteenths pole, sustained bid into the lane but
failed to be a match when the winner swept by mid-stretch. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR chased near the inside then edged back and angled out on the turn,
hustled along four wide into the lane and gained show. BRASS BAND broke sharply, cleared and crossed over to the inside, held firm around the turn then
got collared near the eighth pole and gave way. BRINGTHEWINE raced along the outside off the early speed, dropped inside late on the turn and lacked a
needed rally. READY TO RUMBLE was forwardly placed and chased in close contention around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. KHOWRITER
raced in range through early stages then flattened out around the turn. MONETARY SURPRISE showed response in the opening quarter then weakened.

CLAUDE for the lead in the upper stretch, vied into the final furlong then lacked closing response. BELLA ROMANCE raced off the pace, went two wide
around the turn and lacked a needed rally. KINGSTON QUEEN set a pressured pace, vied with MADAME CLAUDE at the quarter pole then gave way

Footnotes
WILD IRISHMAN held a slim lead around the first turn then set a pressured pace through the backstretch, held firm over pursers around the far turn then
saved ground into the lane, responded under pressure along the rail and widened to a clear advantage. PROCURADOR raced in the last flight, was ridden
along two wide around the far turn then moved out five wide for the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. EL ROSILLO was allowed to
settle in early stages then advanced five wide around the far turn, continued a three wide bid through the lane and churned on for a share. DANLEY raced in
range saving ground, launched a rail bid at the five sixteenths pole, sustained a two wide bid into the lane then flattened midstretch. THE DUNGEON settled
through the backstretch, hustled up along the rail on the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. EL POLICIA pulled wanting to
do more while being rated off the early pace, was ridden along four wide and gained position around the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. GUS K
was forwardly placed through the backstretch, remained in contention around the far turn then gave way. SUPER NECESSARY raced near midpack on the
outside, had no response when called upon entering the far turn and steadily faded. GO CRISTIAN applied pace pressure to the winner through the
backstretch then came up empty leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SHASTREE settled in good position tracking the top two leaders from the inside, tipped out three wide near the quarter pole, came under a left handed drive
in the upper stretch, responded and steadily edged up closer to the lead, reached equal terms with POSITVE REVIEW at the sixteenth pole, edged by to a
slim lead and held firm. POSITIVE REVIEW was forwardly placed behind the early leader, launched a bid for command around the turn, cleared on top at
the head of the lane, fought back when challenged by SHASTREE at the sixteenth pole then failed to maintain equal terms and had to settle for second
best. LABAN M MO raced off the early pace and hustled up around the turn, came four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. JET WINGS set the
early pace, held on top around the turn then got collared at the head of the lane and faded. FROSTED ARMOUR was not too far back early on, went three
wide around the turn and failed to respond. GLORY AND VICTORY raced off the pace then four wide into the lane and failed to factor. TOYI chased in
range in the opening quarter then retreated near the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
BRETT'S WORLD held a slim lead out of the chute, set a pressured pace over CONVERTER through the backstretch, continued with a slim lead around the
turn, saved ground into the lane, came under right handed pressure, responded willingly, re-broke on top and finished going away. CONVERTER applied
pace pressure to BRETT'S WORLD through the backstretch, launched a two bid for the leader at the quarter pole, could not reach the pulling away winner
but sustained a steady bid and secured second best. SMALL REASON bumped with KICK IN THE GAS then got pinched back at the start, was allowed to
settle through early stages, picked up the pace along the rail around the turn, continued a steady inside bid through the lane and churned on for a share.
WILD TEXAS TOM raced off the early pace, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn, gained position but needed more for late impact. KURT'S A
KEEPER raced in the second flight and tracked the top pair through the backstretch, remained in contention around the turn then gave way in the stretch
run. KICK IN THE GAS bumped with SMALL REASON at the start, raced in contention off the top flight through the backstretch then failed to progress
under pressure around the turn. STAR DEPUTY raced off the pace then three to four wide into the lane and had no response. BIG TREASURE steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN was allowed to settle near midpack in early stages, launched a bid two wide between foes around the far turn, dropped to the rail turning
for home, took closer order then tipped out three wide mid-stretch, kicked in gamely and got up late. RAISON THE GLASS rated not far off the early pace,
began to edge up closer four wide late on the far turn, took over the lead in the upper stretch, stayed on with response but could not hold off the late surge
from the winner. KARENVILLE tracked up closer and raced near the inside entering the far turn, angled out and launched a three wide bid near the quarter
pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and re-gained show. LA RUSIA hustled up out of the gate and held as slim lead around the first turn, set a
pressured pace through the backstretch, dueled with RED WIND around the far turn, briefly shook free then collared in the upper stretch and gave way.
ONE NIGHT STAND was unhurried early along the outside, hustled up four wide into the lane, gained position but lacked the needed response for impact.
DORA PRINCELLA raced off the pace through the backstretch, was ridden along two wide between foes around the turn then passed tiring foes in the lane.
RED WIND applied pace pressure to LA RUSIA and dueled with rival around the far turn then weakened in the upper stretch. SISTER IS DEVIL rated three
to four wide through the backstretch and failed to move on under pressure around the far turn. CACTUS KITTEN raced off the pace, saved ground and
failed to rally. FIRST GOLD raced near midpack, remained in range along the rail around the turn then steadily weakened. GINGERONMYMIND raced in
the back then wide into the lane and had no response. V K STAR raced four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch then came

Footnotes
FLASHY TOO was allowed to settle through early stages then moved into contention mid-way around the turn, took over the lead from ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED at the eighth pole, came out wider under left handed pressure and held firm. SWEET ACTRESS stalked up the inside through the
backstretch, tipped out three to four wide and launched a bid for FLASHY TOO, was solid in response but had to settle for second best. ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED was forwardly placed behind the early leader, vied for the lead around the turn, took command turning for home, got collared by the winner
at the furlong marker and weakened to show. PANOTTI saved ground through early stages then switched out three to four wide in the lane and produced a
mild bid. RIVERCREST ROAD raced off the pace, was ridden along four wide around the turn, stayed along the outside in the lane and needed more for
late impact. CRYSTAL LAGOON set the pace to the turn, vied for the lead then got collared past the quarter pole and gave way. ALWAYS EDEN raced off
the pace and saved ground to no avail. SHE ROX MY SOCKS raced two wide near midpack then lacked response around the turn. HEIFER raced in the
back then three wide into the lane and had no response. BAROLA was not too far back late in the backstretch then weakened around the turn.
