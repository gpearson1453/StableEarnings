THREE ILLUSIONS dueled early, shook clear on the turn, just lasted late while all out. EXTRA SALSA dueled early, chased the winner around the turn,
angled out in the stretch, finished well and just missed. APPEALING JULIA was allowed to settle early, rallied on the inside and closed a gap. ORBITING
THE SKY well placed and saved ground, had a even effort late. WOLF EYES was well placed three wide, remained a sharp factor in mid stretch and hung
late. BUYWON GETWON was off slowly and was outrun. LOW TIRE raced mid pack and had no rally. MISS IRISH BOSS was outrun. STONE ZONE
contended early and was through after a half.
