BETCHA set the pace while under pressure through the turn while under pressure from another, continued with a short lead outside the eighth then widened
through the final sixteenth. AMERICA RULES raced in the two path through the turn when near the back, continued near the two or three path into the lane
and finished willingly to be clear for the place spot. FORBIDDEN FRUIT pressed the pace two wide through the turn while in the three path, came into the
lane from the five path, was still a serious threat just outside the eighth pole then weakened late. JUMP RIGHT IN chased the pace from the four to the three
path through the turn then weakened in the drive. SECOND EXCHANGE raced in the three path through the turn and always was last.

Footnotes
BLOODLINE raced in the three path through the first turn, tracked the pacesetters down the backstretch while well rated, moved into the three path into the
far turn, caught the leader in late turn, cleared into the lane then widened from the three or four path to the wire. PURE ROCKET vied for the lead two wide
down the backstretch, cleared into the turn, was caught by the winner in late turn, stayed with that one into the lane then could not keep up and settled for
second best. BLUES TUNE raced in the two path down the backstretch, was shuffled approaching the far turn, asked for more nearing the three-eighths
pole, continued with good energy while coming into the lane from the five path and moved up to be clear for the show spot while not a threat to the top ones.
JIM AND JIM was never a serious factor while in the four path through the turns. MAJOR LLOYD in the two or three path through the turns when in
mid-pack then tired entering the lane. SMOKEY LEE vied for the lead for half while near the inside then was suddenly done in mid-turn. JUG ROCK was
done after half and eventually eased to the wire and vanned off. PRATHER chased the pacesetters from the three path into the far turn, was suddenly done,
dropping back through the field and was eased through the length of the lane and walked off.
