Footnotes
CANE CREEK ROAD broke out and bumped rival, sped clear and established the front, met challengers bid on the far turn, maintained a short lead through
the lane and would not be denied. MUCHO DEL ORO got bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace from inside, went two to three wide on the second turn,
moved out in the stretch, rallied three deep late and got up for second. ZIPPY BABY broke out and bumped both sides, stalked the leader up close from
outside, challenged around the far turn, kept the pressure on through the lane but lacked the needed late kick and got edged for second. KENNEBEC broke
out and bumped rival, was in tight inside a rival on the clubhouse turn, angled three wide into the stretch, steered out widest, rallied outside the top trio but
was not enough. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack early on, went two wide to the stretch and failed to find the
needed response. OPTIMISTIC VALOR unhurried in the beginning, hugged the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. RECKONING DAY raced three to four
wide on both turns and came up empty.

Footnotes
LEPRINO up close early inside the leader, got put in tight near the nine-sixteenths pole and switch outside the pacesetter, asked for run around the turn,
drew alongside in upper stretch and took over with a furlong remaining, fought with COLOSI in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. COLOSI stalked the
top pair off the rail, went three wide around the turn, bid three deep with a furlong to go, challenged LEPRINO late and could not get by. RED VALOR sped
to the front, set the pace outside LEPRINO then crossed over to take rail, showed the way into the lane, challenged from outside in upper stretch and
yielded to the top pair. STITZY lacked early speed, lost ground while three to four wide on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
GOOD VIBES ONLY dueled for the lead from outside, cleared foe past the quarter pole, urged left-handed in the lane and held the runner-up at bay. DEVIL
BE ME off slow to begin, moved into striking position up the backstretch, driven three wide into the lane, continued to give chase through the lane and
finished well but did not have enough to overhaul the winner. RIFEY turned his head and hopped slightly at the start, angled in for the turn and was put in
tight approaching the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch, steered out in the lane and finished with late run. MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE went
up to duel from inside, lost contact with the leader past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. ME MACHO chased off the inside, two to three wide
around the turn and could not rally. STRAUS'S PLACE tracked the pace outside a rival into the turn, went three wide around the bend, four wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. RICH WARRIOR settled off the inside, went two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the drive and made no
impact. STORM THE GATE dropped back early and never got involved. WHAT AN IDEA showed speed between a pair of rivals early then dropped back a
bit to chase, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, faded through the lane and was eased to the wire.

SO VERY SMART was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, took aim two wide leaving the turn, drew alongside with a furlong remaining, gained command
with a sixteenth remaining and held well over the late rally from the runner-up inside. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH got bumped from inside early, settled off the
pace, went four wide into the turn then angled down to the two path, found the rail in the stretch and rallied up the inside to earn the place honors. RAIN
DIVA sped to the front from inside, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, challenged at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead with a
sixteenth to go and flattened to third. DELTA WIND chased off the inside, asked past the three-eighths marker, went three wide into the drive and lacked the
needed response. WESTWARD BREEZE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, got forced out and bumped rival early, moved to the inside and saved ground to
the stretch and never made an impact. TIZ A MASTER chased the pace outside a rival, dropped back around the turn while three then four wide and tired.

Footnotes
BRITTLE AND YOO pressed the pace from outside, took over past the three-eighth pole, kicked clear midway around the turn, inched away into the stretch,
had the rider lose her whip at the three-sixteenths pole but still drew away under hand urging. LA PULCINELA tracked between rivals, went two wide into
the far turn, moved out and raced four wide outside a rival around the bend, angled back to the three path leaving the turn, finished willingly but had to settle
for second best. NAUGHTY EVELYN set the pace from inside under pressure, lost command past the three-eighth pole, chased the winner into the stretch
and flattened to third. BOSSY SOUL taken back early, trailed to the far turn, angled to the rail on the second bend and kept on to fill out the superfecta.
SOUL SWEET bobbled leaving the gate, tracked three deep, came four wide into the stretch and could not rally. BEIRUT BEAUTY broke out, pulled early
and had to steer to the outside on the clubhouse turn, advanced and was closest to the top pair up the backstretch, started to weaken around the far turn
and tired in the lane. CHEERFUL CHARM was rank along the inside on the first turn, dropped back around the second bend, taken off the rail leaving that
turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
