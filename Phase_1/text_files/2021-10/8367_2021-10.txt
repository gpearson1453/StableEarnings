Footnotes
GRAFTON STREET pressed the pace, led into the backstretch, set a reserved pace then held sway under a drive. LUCKMAN raced in mid pack, closed
two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, was game and held place. RUM CUP raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn and was all
out and gaining in the stretch. LARAQUE bumped with POT COMMITTED at the start, settled in mid pack, closed into the far turn, chased to the stretch but
finished evenly. BROADWAY SKY was off poorly, trailed to the stretch and posted a mild rally, POT COMMITTED, bumped at the start, stalked the pace,
was hustled along and was roused late turn but failed to menace. HAGEMEISTER PARK showed brief speed, stalked on the backstretch, was coming back
at the far turn, was pinched back by runners closing and lacked a rally. AFTER REVIEWING THE START, BROADWAY SKY WAS DETERMINED TO
HAVE HAD AN UNFAIR START AND WAS DEEMED TO BE A NON STARTER. WAGERS ON BROADWAY SKY WERE TO BE REFUNDED.

Footnotes
HELLO FRIENDS broke alertly, took off the trio for the early lead, steadied back in a chain reaction incident coming out of the chute and ended up in
midpack along the rail, advanced in behind the leader at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and drove by the two leaders outside the sixteenth
pole, inching away late. REINFORCED broke out at the start, was in the mix for the lead early between runners when the outside rival came in and forced
her to steady and she ended up tracking along the rail, came out to bid turning for home and got a very brief advantage without changing leads, hanging a
tad when the winner collared her immediately and pulled away late. PILOT EPISODE won the scramble for the lead and stayed out of the early confusion,
held the front until nearing the sixteenth pole, unable to match the energy of the top pair but holding the show. STERLING SPEED two wide in midpack
early, was outside the winner down the backside and to midturn, couldn't match that one's closing kick but did hold off two rivals late to her inside to hold a
minor award. SILVER DAHLIA was steadied hard along the inside when crowded coming out of the chute, off the pace after that, put in a nice rally around
the turn to be in behind the winner but could only close up the rail down the stretch to outfinish a rival who was to her outside from midway on the turn to the
wire. GLORIANNIA off the pace early, closed outside a rival from midturn to the wire, in tight inside the final sixteenth when between foes. IMAGERY drifted
in early when three wide going for the front, a chain reaction of events the result, stayed outside stalking and pressing the leader into the turn but began to
drop off turning for home and retreated down the lane. MODUS OPERANDI hit the side of the gate and began awkwardly, trailed down the backside on hold
behind runners and could not enter the fray with her mild close. STOKES outside and off the pace, could not reach contention with her mild three to five
wide run on the turn. MARAIS broke out at the start, in midpack three wide and out to five wide late on the turn but could not keep up down the lane.
GOLDEN GARTER chased three wide early, came three to four wide on the turn but couldn't sustain her momentum. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT COMING OUT OF THE CHUTE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER AS IT WAS CAUSED BY A RUNNER WHO
FINISHED BEHIND THOSE INCONVENIENCED.

shook clear midway of the backstretch, set a reserved pace but failed to contain the winner in deep stretch. JUSTIN'S WAY raced in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely. GIANT ONE settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide through the turn and finished
under a determined drive. AFIKOMAN raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, tipped out wide at the top of the stretch and rallied, but
evened out late. UNSPEAKABLE lost his path leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed three-wide late turn but evened out in the late stages. WICKED

Footnotes
WEDGEWOOD settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied fast and swept to the lead in the late stages under a hand ride.
ROCKCREST showed early speed, set a reserved pace but was caught in deep stretch. CITY BOY stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn and
rallied gamely. SPITE STORE was away slowly, raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely. REAL
MONEY, in range early, saved ground on the turn, angled out mid stretch and finished with a determined drive. SOUPER HOT settled off the pace, was
hustled two to four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied outside. SIR SEAMUS, in range, was hustled two-wide on the turn then
finished evenly inside rivals. READYFORPRIMETIME raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide through the turn then showed some interest in the
stretch. MALIBU SECRET was off slowly, closed to mid pack, was hustled four to six-wide on the turn but was never contentious. CELEBRATORY stalked
the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch but flattened out in the final 16th. ALACRITOUS, in range early, came four to six-wide through the turn then
evened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOD OF LOVE hopped up at the start and was bumped by a rival, settled off the pace ,two to three wide on the turn and bumped a rival to his outside when
coming out into the stretch, closed in the five path down the lane and collared his stablemate at the sixteenth pole, edging away late. FAST FEET led
quickly, allowed a rival up his inside down the backstretch, traded the front spot back and forth with that one while always appearing to have more to give,
put that one away in upper stretch and had a clear lead at the eighth pole, unable to fend off his stablemate but holding the place stubbornly. STRONGER
TOGETHER stumbled at the start, was taken back by the rider to midpack, advanced into range in the three path on the turn and loomed outides the pace
survivor in upper stretch, outkicked by the winner and unable to catch the front runner. DANCIN IN DA'NILE was between rivals for the early lead before
taken back, seemed to drop back in the two path on the bend before re-rallying into traffic in upper stretch, steadying out and coming again when room
appeared, green and changing leads in the final stages. SHAMATEUR chased inside, was in behind the leaders turning for home but could not match the
energy of others, running evenly on the fence down the lane. SPRING MOUNTAIN broke out and bumped a rival at the start, off the pace and along the
inside throughout, running on mildly down the stretch to best the balance while still inside. BRUTALITY hit the gate at the start and began sluggishly, trailed
three to four wide on the turn and was floated into the eight path turning for home, closing down the center of the track to run by a few rivals. HIDDEN
HONOR had one beat into the turn, came three to four wide into the stretch and was bumped a few times by the winner, unable to threated down the lane.
MENTORING was inside the leader and eventual place finisher throughout, traded the front back and forth until tiring in upper stretch, retreating from that
point. CHAIRMAN BOB was three wide in midpack early, came four wide into range on the turn but had nothing left for the stretch run. WHERE'S NEAL was
four wide stalking early, advanced smartly to loom three wide on the turn but retreated down the stretch. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY REGARDING CONTACT
BETWEEN THE WINNER, GOD OF LOVE, AND HIDDEN HONOR AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ART OF ALMOST settled at the back of the pack, was inside a rival entering the far turn, edged back a bit and angled out then closed three to five-wide
through the far turn, launched an all out rally from the outside and swept to command in the final furlong. SKYGAZE was off slowly and settled off the pace,
closed to mid pack on the backstretch, forced the issue three and four-wide on the turn, launched her rally at the top of the stretch but was outkicked by the
winner. JUXTAPOSE forced the pace, dueled from early backstretch, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. CRYSTAL GLACIER led early,
dueled from early backstretch but gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. SARATOGA VISION hopped at the start and lost her path, settled at the rear,
chased two to four-wide on the far turn then finished determinedly. AFLEET KATHERINE broke outward, stalked the pace, chased from the rail and
two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

pace, chased five then four-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. STRIBLING showed early speed, set a pressured pace, was headed a
