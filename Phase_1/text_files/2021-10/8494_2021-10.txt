Footnotes
GREY ROGUE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, drifted out down the home stretch and won under steady urging. THE THIMBLE raced within
contention, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. YANK CRIME pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, saved
ground around the final turn and was caught late for second. KING NATE lacked early speed, moved up, racing wide around the second turn, made a mild
bid, but was no factor. SING LOUD raced within striking distance, saved ground, weakened and finished evenly. THE THREE KS pressed the early pace,
raced wide around the first turn, faded and was no threat late. TRAELEE raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was no factor. BOBBY BOOTS
void of early speed and showed little. HOPE FOR CHANGE always raced near the back and was outrun. REPOSADO broke in, steadied, racing near the
back, steadied, while drifting out around the first turn and eventually pulled up down the home stretch. Walked off.

Footnotes
EZEE ENOUGH dueled for the early lead, drove clear down the stretch, was all out and held on well for the win. MATT'S PRIDE hopped at the start, racing
in the back, came around the turn wide, rallied and finished willingly. DIVA'S RANSOM pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, was close
throughout and got caught late for second. GRILLIN raced near the back, made a mild bid, finished wide and was no factor. D'WILD BARONESS
challenged on the front end in the early part, weakened and was no threat late. MISS UNDERRATED dueled on the front end, raced outside around the turn
and was finished early. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA always raced near the back and showed little.

pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the final stretch and was outfinished for the win. CABRO TORO raced within contention, saved ground
around the second turn, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. BOURBON SKY unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn,
made a late gain and finished willingly. AS THUNDER HEART raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and put forth an even effort.

challenged for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn, but was outfinished for the win. US SECOND CUTE PIE raced in the middle of the
field, moved up around the final turn, angled out down the lane, to get around a tiring LAKE SENSE, moved back to the rail and was a clear third at the wire.
SIMPLE SUNDAY raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. LAKE SENSE went to the front, drove clear and tired
down the home stretch. CUSTOM MADE raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. MISS LAUGHALOT raced within contention and dropped
back. MSCHITCHATTOUR raced in the rear, swerved out around the first turn to avoid BRIANNAS GIFT, who fell, was then pulled up and walked off.
