Footnotes
SIMMONS was off slowly, settled four to five wide down the backstretch, advanced on the turn four wide and continued that bid in the drive, closed well
under left handed crop urging to edge clear late. SHADYS KEEPER was away alertly and sent to the front and opened up a big lead on the turn, continued
well in front by the three eighths pole while racing off the rail, was clear leaving the turn but was caught in deep stretch while staying on to be clearly second
best. HANFORD was settled early inside a trio while three wide down the backstretch, then eased out on the turn and came five wide into the drive and
offered a late rally. SIR STEELE was settled early while three to four wide, then dropped down to the rail by the quarter pole while advancing, but finished
evenly late. CROSSOVER was settled back three wide early, then moved to the inside and lacked a response.

allowed to settle early, came six wide into the drive and offered a belated rally. KILIMANJARA was bumped and checked at the start, then made a six wide
run on the turn and came seven wide into the drive and was empty late. TESSA P stalked the early pace on the inside and weakened. AMETHYST chased
the early pace three wide and weakened. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN failed to menace. NATURE TRAIL showed brief speed on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
SARATOGA WILDCAT was well rated early and made a three wide move on the turn and drew clear by the quarter pole, then drew out by the furlong
marker and was kept safe late to prove best under a drive. BLUEGRASS POSSE was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and rallied well
in the drive. C C'S WARRIOR was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and offered a late rally to just miss the place award while getting up for the
show spot. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE set the early pace while clear, then was headed by the five sixteenths pole, gave way grudgingly in the drive, lost the
show spot late. MEROCKETMAN chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but flattened out. SKY GAZER R V F was settled back
early, came six wide into the drive and had a belated rally. CAMGO lacked a rally. TRUE WISDOM chased the pace on the inside and weakened. RING
THE BELLA was not a factor.

the drive and had no rally. INSPIRED GEM set a pressured pace early, then drew clear on the turn, went bad leaving the five sixteenths pole and was pulled

TRENDING UP was well rated early, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove much the best under a
drive. ROYAL KAZ set the pace on the inside while being well rated on the front end, was headed leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides with the
winner in the final furlong while clearly second best. CAYMAN ISLAND steadied around the half mile marker, stalked the pace on the inside, swung out four
wide for the drive but was empty, held show spot. ECHOES OF DESTINY was allowed to settle early on the inside, lacked rally. GEM JUAN was allowed to
settle three wide early, came five wide into the drive and had no rally.
