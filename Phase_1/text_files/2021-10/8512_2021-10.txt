Footnotes
JACK'S FINALE was unhurried while in the three path through the first turn and into the backstretch, chased the pace from the four to the three path
entering the far turn, bid through mid-turn, raced on near even terms into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole and widened through the final
sixteenth. LUSH BE A LADY tracked the pace while saving ground through the turn, was asked for more entering the lane, gained on the pacesetters
nearing the eighth pole then could not maintain the response through the final sixteenth while settling for second best. DASH OF SIMPLICITY set the pace
while near the inside into the far turn, was joined by the winner in late turn, dueled with that one into the lane and weakened. PRIZED CUPCAKE stalked the
pace from the four path through the backstretch, bid into the far turn and was done in late turn. SHES MY TREASURE raced on the lead under pressure
through the first turn, in tight and steadied entering the backstretch, settled back to chase the pace and was done in late turn. WICKED JUSTICE was in
tight and steadied entering the first turn, steadied and taken back and was never a factor thereafter.

Footnotes
SHIPSHAPE chased the pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide near mid-turn, dueled into the lane, gained the lead while straightening,
cleared outside the eighth pole then widened when under a hand ride late. GOT LOST settled off the pace while in the three path, moved quickly four wide
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, got nearest the winner entering the lane, could not keep up with that one but stayed on to be clear or the show spot.
PRINCE ACT bid from along the inside through late turn, could not stay with the top two after straightening in the lane but remained focused to the wire to
save the show spot. GUARD was clear early, joined by several others after mid-turn, dueled into late turn then could not keep up. CIRCLE INDY raced in
the two path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. CALL ME DROSSEL was never a factor while in the four to the
three path through the turn.

Footnotes
INCESSANT set the pace while racing near the inside, was pressured into the turn, re-cleared through the turn and into the lane, was kept to the task
through the final eighth when under a new challenge and held. WICKED ECSTASY pressed the winner while two wide into the far turn, chased into the lane,
re-bid after straightening and was slowly gaining at the end. STACY ATTACK was in the two or three path through the the turns, was never far back and
launched a bid in late turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired while drifting about the last eighth. PERTINACIOUS TIZ raced near the inside
through the turns and moved up while not a threat. DIME CUANDO saved ground throughout and never was a factor. POLYESTER BRIDE raced close up
early while saving ground, continued near the inside and steadily faded. MOREINTHEHAMPTONS was in the four to the two path through the first turn,
continued near the rail into the far turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BLUEMOON JUSTICE pressed the pacesetter two wide into the far turn, bid near the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane, was joined by the runner-up
outside the eighth pole, repelled that one nearing the sixteenth pole, re-cleared and widened to the wire. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL settled off the pace
into the far turn, bid four wide in late turn, moved to the winner outside the eighth pole, loomed a major threat then hung inside the eighth pole and settled
for the runner-up spot. RICH KINGDOM was unhurried into the far turn, asked for more after mid-turn, was five wide with momentum into the lane, got
nearest the top two when straightening then finished evenly. JINGLE trailed for half while near the inside, moved off the rail and into the two or three path
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up a couple while not a serious threat. BAKER'S MAN was never a factor while in the two
or three path through the far turn. MILLION DOLLAR RED stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, appeared to be a serious contender into late
turn but was empty through the lane. GALILEO'S ROCK set the pace along the inside through mid-turn and was done after being headed near the
five-sixteenth pole. GET N TIPSY stumbled at the start, lost momentum and spotted the field some three lengths, was ridden hard to rejoin the field into the
turn, raced along the inside into the backstretch and was done after going a half-mile.

Footnotes
TOUR THE MOON stalked the pace between foes, rallied at the three-sixteenths pole and wore down the leader under steady urging. JEOPARDY
THEORY led in the two path, bid at the quarter pole, went clear, drifted in late and was caught. BOULDER BAY stalked the pace inside, then lacked running
room in early stretch. C F V TEXAS RED vied inside, then gave way in the stretch. BELLA'S PRAYER stalked between foes, bid at the three-eighths pole,
then faltered in the stretch. BASSCOAT was not a factor. CORNER TAP stalked the pace in the four wide, then faded in the turn. JUSTICETHEBEAST vied
outside foes before pulling up on the far turn.
