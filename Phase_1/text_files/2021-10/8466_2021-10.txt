Footnotes
ROCKET RIDE chased well behind the leading pair, drew closer into the far turn, shifted out four wide near the five sixteenths for a bid, took the lead
outside of TOE THE LINE near the three sixteenths, and drove clear. OFF TO THE BEACH settled at the inside of the rear pair, inched forward inside past
the three quarters, was hard ridden into the far turn, chased five wide, was driven four wide into the lane, never threatened the winner but kept on willingly
for the place. TOE THE LINE broke slightly outward and lightly bumped TEARS ON A RIVER, then lightly bumped with LORD BOLSTON, settled outside of
OFF TO THE BEACH in the rear flight, raced three wide with the rear group down the backstretch, bid into the far turn, encroached on KING ZION past the
three eighths, led approaching the five sixteenths, was driven inside in upper stretch, proved no match for ROCKET RIDE past the three sixteenths,
flattened inside and lost the place. LORD BOLSTON lightly bumped with TOE THE LINE in the opening strides, chased outside of ROCKET RIDE around
the first turn, raced between horses in the rear flight down the backstretch, was relegated to the rear into the far turn, chased in the six path around that
bend, and passed tiring horses in upper stretch five wide. KING ZION set a pressured pace through the first turn, shook clear into the backstretch, was
prompted again by TEARS ON A RIVER into the far turn while leading in the two path, was headed approaching the five sixteenths by TOE THE LINE and
folded readily. TEARS ON A RIVER was lightly bumped in the opening strides by TOE THE LINE, pressed the pace two wide through the first turn, tracked
the leader down the backstretch, encroached outside of KING ZION again into the far turn, began to weaken between horses past the three eighths and had
no more in the drive.

Footnotes
CAVE CREEK, held up in close quarters just after the break, switched outside the field in early stages, was prompted to gain a position outside the leaders
nearing the turn, continued with a steady advance three deep into upper stretch and responded to brisk handling to wrest the advantage in time. GO
STORMIN GIRL, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, moved to challenge racing into upper stretch, continued in a protracted
skirmish gaining the advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. NEW RULES sprinted to the lead from the break, dictated the pace into the turn,
resisted a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and gave out in late stages. GODSGIFT tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the
inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane and continued evenly in the drive. ME SAY SO dropped out last early and failed to menace. HOOSIER
GOLD CASE tracked the leaders between foes in early stages but steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS led into the clubhouse turn and set a slow pace early, was engaged into the backstretch, set the pace while pressured by
RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT down the back straight and into the far turn, was headed by TAP THE MOJO near the three sixteenths, vied inside of that foe into
the lane, took the lead again for good near the three sixteenths and drove clear. TAP THE MOJO was grazed by RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT in the opening
strides, settled near the rear, bid three wide on the far turn, put his head in front near the five sixteenths, vied outside of LANDOFTHEPHAROAHS into
upper stretch, but could not contain him past the three sixteenths. HINTON tracked the leader inside through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the pace
down the backstretch, chased the leading flight in the two to three path around the far turn and inside in the lane, and proved no match for the leading pair in
the lane. IRISH MAJOR settled at the rear, raced in the three to four path on the far turn, swung out six wide for the drive, and passed tiring horses.
RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT broke in and grazed TAP THE MOJO in the opening strides, raced three wide in the tracking flight around the clubhouse turn,
advanced to prompt the leader into the backstretch, continued to prompt between horses around the far turn, flattened out from upper stretch, drifted out
and had nothing further under a drive. GIANT'S FORREST raced between horses in the tracking flight around the clubhouse turn, advanced to briefly
prompt the pace between LANDOFTHEPHAROAHS and RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT into the backstretch, soon settled back to track the leading flight, was
urged in the three to four path on the far turn behind the leading flight, came up empty five wide in upper stretch and drifted out.

POLITO, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, steadily gained momentum nearing upper stretch advancing in tandem with
GOOD YEGG, was fanned six wide racing through the stretch but continued with a sustained response to best that rival in the closing stages under strong
handling. GOOD YEGG was rated between foes in the last flight in the opening quarter, steadily drew into contention shifting out five wide racing into upper
stretch, moved to strike the front midstretch but couldn't match the winner's final kick. LOOK AWAY settled inside rivals in the last flight racing through the
backstretch, was shuffled out of close quarters nearing the turn, regained momentum nearing upper stretch to split foes just off the inside leaving midstretch
and continued with an effort to gain position inside the top pair late. DEORA STORE tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, angled to the
inside nearing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch to lodge a brief bid inside the leaders but flattened out in the last furlong. INSIDE THE CIRCLE was
urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. DASTARDLY
DEEDS tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the lane, shifted inwards under pressure
midstretch crossing into the path of MUCHOMATIC and emptied out in the last furlong. MUCHOMATIC, angled inwards while being urged pressing a rival's
pace racing to the turn, was carried out by that foe racing into upper stretch, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters midstretch while quickly giving way.

ENGLISH broke readily to gain terms with the leader prompting the pace between foes racing into the turn, took over from a stricken rival racing into upper
stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. MY BOSS LADY hopped while breaking a step slowly, was reserved outside foes racing to the turn,
angled to the four path racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the
wire. PECOS AUTUMN tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter, angled inwards on the turn, came around a stricken rival to advance
along the rail in the stretch but was outkicked for second. U CAN DO IT settled inside foes racing as part of the last flight on the backstretch, was shuffled
back avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn, swung out to the six path racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. I LOVE TO RACE, forwardly placed
three wide, continued in pursuit of the leaders in that path to upper stretch and gave way. TIZALADYBUG, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage racing into the turn, took an awkward step nearing upper stretch, was taken in hand by her rider while dropping out last and was vanned off the
course following the race.

NAVY SEAL was off sharply but settled back to chase four wide, began to rally four wide nearing the five sixteenths, came four wide into upper stretch,
bumped TOM'S LAST GENERAL past the quarter, continued to improve, led near the furlong marker and drove clear. BASEBALL POLITICS soon led, set
the pace down the back straight and while saving ground around the turn, was driven in upper stretch, got headed by NAVY SEAL nearing the furlong mark,
and chased on willingly to the wire while proving second best. TOM'S LAST GENERAL tracked the leader down the backstretch and two wide on the turn,
was driven between horses into the lane, was bumped by NAVY SEAL in upper stretch, chased on while no match for that foe and BASEBALL POLITICS,
and proved best of the rest. DREAM KEEPER was bumped hard by MAXIMILIANO in the opening strides and bumped into WAVE'NDUMONI as a result,
settled at the rear through the opening furlong, was keen to rejoin the main field approaching the half, raced two wide in the rear pair around the turn, swung
five wide into the lane and improved mildly. MAXIMILIANO broke out and bumped DREAM KEEPER soundly in the opening strides, chased between horses
down the backstretch, continued under a drive between horses three wide on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and weakened. WAVE'NDUMONI
was bumped by DREAM KEEPER in the opening strides after that foe was bumped by MAXIMILIANO, chased three wide down the back straight, dropped
in and raced toward the rear along the inside on the turn, was driven inside into the lane and found no rally.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME, bumped by OIL MONEY, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, was rated off the second flight three deep in early stages,
shifted four wide racing into the bend while being prompted to advance midway through the bend, continued with a sustained response in that path racing
through the stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm encouragement. FIRST MASAMUNE tracked the leader five deep as part of the second
flight on the backstretch, shifted inwards to advance on the pacesetter three deep racing through the turn, moved to challenge for command in that path
nearing the sixteenth marker but was outkicked. LOST IN MANHATTAN switched off the inside in early stages while being prompted to a forward placing
tracking just off the pacesetter between foes, steadily closed the gap on that rival to bid for command between foes leaving midstretch but couldn't match
the top pair while continuing willingly to edge a rival for a share. OIL MONEY, broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, angled sharply to the inside in
the opening stages while sprinting clear of the field, held sway on a comfortable margin to midstretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. WILE E
PEYOTE tracked the leader four wide between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards to race between foes on the turn and continued evenly to late
stages. D' YANK, held up avoiding close quarters near the inside just after the start, angled out four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals late.
BEEALEA was off slowly and failed to menace. MYSTERY MAN, brushed just after the start while racing in close quarters, pulled against restraint, was
bumped, then steadied out of tight quarters racing past the half mile marker and steadily faded into the lane. STALLONE, urged between foes in close
quarters in the opening stages, exchanged some contact with MYSTERY MAN racing past the half mile marker, angled to the inside racing into the turn
making brief pursuit of the leaders but soon gave way.
