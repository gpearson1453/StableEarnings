Footnotes
DOWN COLD broke a step slowly, rated far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes through
the final furlong, and got up approaching the wire. ROME set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a pressing foe in upper stretch, remained clear well
into the final furlong, but was worn down by an outer rallying foe inside the final sixteenth. DOCTOR NASH stalked along the inside, but was scrubbed on to
maintain position around the turn, then chased evenly between horses through the final furlong to prevail for show. RUMBLE READY tracked the pace two
to three wide around the turn, tipped four wide turning for home, but only produced a grinding rally, got outkicked by an outer foe inside the final furlong, and
kept on late, but was outfinished by an inner foe for show. ZIPPIN GIGI vied for the lead outside of ROME, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, drifted inwards under right handed pressure at the furlong grounds, and yielded inside of rivals late. ONE MORE BABY broke a step slowly, gained
along the rail down the backstretch to midpack, saved ground around the bend before shifting five wide in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. MATH
MAN was outrun early on, then passed tiring foes late. DUKE OF EDINBURGH lied off of the pace along the inside, but faded into the turn. SUPREMELY
tracked the pace, came under a drive while shifting three wide into the turn, chased the leading pair around the turn, then weakened passing the three
sixteenths pole. FLAGSTONE hopped after hesitating at the start and spotted the leaders many lengths, lied far off of the pace in the four path around the
turn, and never got involved. COHESION tracked from midpack two wide, took the turn four wide, but faded turning for home, then shied from an inner foe
while weakening in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) stalked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, took over in upper stretch, and drew off under hand urging. MISTY VEIL set the
pace, met SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE)'s bid entering the lane, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and was well clear of show. MAYBE LATER trailed
in the two path into the first turn, improved outside of a pair of rivals around the far turn to gain show, and failed to threaten the leaders. REINECKE saved
ground off of the pace, and failed to factor. SEASIDE RETREAT tracked three wide, but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
SANDSTONE prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead into the turn, led from outer foes around the bend, shook clear passing the quarter pole, and
drew off thereafter. EIVISSA tracked the pace from the four path around the turn, but only managed to chase the clear leader through the lane and proved
second best. SECRET OATH stalked along the inside, but failed to split foes turning for home, was shuffled back in tight quarters entering the lane,
regained stride in upper stretch, shifted to the five path in the final furlong, and stayed on to reach show. LOVE TO RUN tracked three wide, bid for the lead
outside of SANDSTONE into the turn, vied with that foe turning for home, but was repelled passing the quarter pole, and weakened. MALIBU MARIE stalked
two wide, then from between horses into the turn, shifted three wide turning for home, but faded through the lane. JOY MOON was slow into stride and
trailed the field in the four path into the turn, then never got involved. LATE NIGHT LADY broke slowly, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the
four to five path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. HANNAH'S HAVEN set the pace along the inside, but weakened inside of a pair of bidders passing the
three furlong pole, stopped turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
NECKER ISLAND stalked four wide, bid outside of foes into the turn, vied turning for home, then drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. PYRON pressed
three wide, produced an early bid for the lead into the turn when NECKER ISLAND forced his hand, vied between horses turning for home, was set down
approaching the three sixteenths pole, but got outkicked by his outer counterpart at the furlong grounds, yielded through the final sixteenth, but just lasted
for place. PNEUMATIC dueled for the lead two wide, vied between horses at the three furlong pole, but was outkicked by outer foe entering the lane, shifted
off of the rail in midstretch, and stayed on to regain on a tiring PYRON in the late stages, but missed reaching that foe for place on the wire. EBBEN dueled
for the lead along the inside, but gave way to a trio of outer foes passing the three furlong pole, then managed a minor placing through the lane.
SONNEMAN broke slowly, took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and moved up late. IN SKY WE TRUST took the turn in the four path
while off of the pace, and lacked a rally. LAMARTINE (BRZ) stalked along the inside, chased the leading ground around the turn, then faded through the
lane. FINNICK THE FIERCE broke slowly while leaning outwardly, then was outrun along the inside. LYKAN was outrun throughout and eased through the
lane.
