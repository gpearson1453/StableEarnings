Footnotes
JOHNNYPUMP two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a
furlong out, dueled through to the finish in game fashion and prevailed at the end. PROFUSION three then two wide in range of the leader, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took over narrow command swinging two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive engaged in head to head
combat a furlong from home, dueled gamely through to the finish but was ultimately denied on the wire. MAKE IT IN NY chased along the inside coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the
late stages while along for the show honors. SPEED EFFECT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch displaced from the front and weakened in the final furlong. BEDAZZLING chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and tired. YANKEE EMPIRE coaxed from the gate, advanced after the start and
was rated in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch while along the rail, ranged up inside through the turn getting placed in tight midway on the bend
as SPEED EFFECT moved closer to the inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. COACH BAHE
four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM bobbled at
the break, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired. ASK NEAL six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
made no impact. HALSTAAT chased four to five wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered five wide at the head of the stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
TURN OF EVENTS moved in while going to the front, controlled the action while inside around the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole,
kicked clear under the crop in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. COLTON'S COMMAND was reserved off the pace, went
three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner willingly in the drive, bumped with BIG
EVEREST late and narrowly defeated that foe for the place. BIG EVEREST (GB) broke open the front of his stall door prior to the start but remained in the
gate, bumped twice with a foe at the break while off a couple lengths slow, moved up while very rank under stout restraint, went around the turn in the two
path while still in reserve, waited behind foes in upper stretch, altered out for room outside the eighth-pole, pursued the winner while inside of COLTON'S
COMMAND in the final furlong, bumped with that opponent late and just missed the place but earned the show. SHIRAZ was well placed while rated just off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and weakened. LA LA LAND (IRE) settled comfortably on
the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SCUTTLEBUZZ bumped twice with an
opponent at the start while off a bit slow, was anchored at the rear under increasing vigorous restraint, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was let out
and asked at the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BOURBON MISSION stalked the pace on the outside then in the two
path on the turn, was given is cue at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. BASSO was reserved off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run,
raced inside to the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION ADDED FOLLOWING

IRISH GIANT bumped with a rival at the start and was slow into stride, dropped well off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path, was
driven three wide into the stretch, moved out while gaining outside furlong marker, rallied outside under a right-handed crop and closed strongly to win going
away. EXXTOP brushed with a foe near the five-eighths, settled off the pace, dropped back in hand near the nine-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the two
path, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, drifted in some while gaining into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead briefly outside the
sixteenth-pole but was overtaken by the winner while able to get the place. MAGNIFICENT CHROME was hustled from the start, moved up on the inside
under urging, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved in while gaining into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole
but was out-kicked while just able to get the show. PAPA SMOOTH moved up between foes to dispute the pace, drew off in tandem with POSSE CAN
DISCO while outside that foe in the two path on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, led under a strong drive into the final furlong, was collared outside
the sixteenth-pole and weakened. NOCTILUCENT dropped back while in hand, was guided under extra left-rein pressure in the four path early on the turn
then dropped to the two path, made his way to the rail late on that bend, gained into upper stretch then shifted out under a drive, chased into the final
furlong and flattened out. ERNIE BANKER brushed with a foe near the five-eighths, chased the pace, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and
tired. TALLAJ was urged along just off the pace, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch then drifted further out while
remaining on his lead and capitulated. POSSE CAN DISCO disputed the pace on the inside, vied along the rail while drawing off in tandem with PAPA
SMOOTH on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and stopped. MUCHO SUNSHINE was urged along on the outside, dropped back four then five wide
on the turn and had nothing left. WAR OF THRONES stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went three to four wide
on the turn and was no factor. MOMMIE'S JEWEL chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the
stretch and faltered then was eased but walked off. WISECRACK showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back while floating from three to five wide
on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also faltered then was eased but walked off.

for home and tired. ADDIS ABABA hard to load prior to the start, got pinched back at the break and conceded six lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, gave way and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
RING OF FIRE settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to
get up in the final stride. KING JAMES bobbled slightly at the start, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was carried five wide into upper
stretch, drifted in while rallying into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead late but was denied in the final stride while able to get the place. COUSIN
ANDREW settled towards the rear on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker
and finished well to get the show. FAIR HAIRED BOY settled off the pace, moved in with a half-mile to run, raced inside early on the turn then shifted to the
two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with good energy to just miss the show. KING MOONRACER settled off the pace, went two
then three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and gained but missed the superfecta. DETERMINED FURY settled on the inside, was
roused while saving ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and gained but missed the minor awards. STANHOPE set the clear pace,
extended the advantage while inside on the turn, widened while set down into upper stretch, remained well clear under the crop while still on his inside lead
into the final furlong, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken. REPO ROCKS broke a bit slow, went two then three wide on the turn and
gained late but failed to menace. R BOY BODE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, was
carried in into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. MONTATHAM broke out at the start, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MO MISCHIEF saved ground towards the back and never reached contention. SPECTATORLESS was
forwardly placed early, dropped back while taken up some near the nine-sixteenths, climbed into the turn, went around that bend in the two path, shifted
three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
CUPID'S HEART broke a half a beat slow and was bumped by SWEET LIES breaking outwards and conceded five lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, briefly tucked three wide into the turn before tipping back to the four path making
headway to be just off the pace inside five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch, came in a path straightened away when seizing command
three-sixteenths from home, then drew clear under a drive kept to task. LIBERTY FLAME six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch in range of
the leader, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced on that rival taking command nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
got collared three-sixteenths from home, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest for the place honors. WICKED LADY hustled
from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide straightening away
into upper stretch and kept on to prevail in a battle for the show honors. DOC DOC ROCK three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish but lost the
battle for the show honors on the wire. SWEET SUGAR BABY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. SWEET LIES broke out at the start bumping CUPID'S HEART, chased four then three wide under
a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and passed tired rivals. GLITTERING PRIZE showed the way in hand three then two wide,
made her way to the inside midway on the turn under pressure, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and yielded the front near the quarter pole,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. TIJERA LEE hustled from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired. SUMMER SNOW bobbled at the break,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and faltered.

Footnotes
SHIFTY SHE went straight to the front, showed the way through solid fractions, vied near the rail on the turn, responded well when set down into upper
stretch then came under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. HIGH OPINION was
taken under a tight hold early, dropped back with six furlongs to run then settled off the pace, was coaxed four wide on the turn then roused for more around
the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner with good courage in the stretch and earned the place. FLOWER POINT checked behind horses early then was
keen under restraint, moved up with six furlongs to run, saved ground on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished
willingly for the show. IN A HURRY was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue around the five-sixteenths,
chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) brushed with a foe early while taken under a
strong hold, was reserved off the pace under restraint, traveled around the turn in the two path, waited while blocked in upper stretch, was roused nearing
the furlong marker then came between horses inside that marker and also lacked the needed kick. TAMAHERE (FR) stalked the pace on the outside then in
the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened. RISKY MISCHIEF settled on the outside without
cover, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) was hustled from the start, brushed with a rival early, was
taken under a tight hold then dropped to the rear, went three then two wide on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) tracked the front from the two path leading the main flight, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling to the finish with NEVER SURPRISED to his inside and gamely prevailed taking
command in the final jumps to the finish. NEVER SURPRISED pulled on the bit eager into the first turn tucked to the two path, settled into the backstretch
showing the way uncontested along the inside safely in front as the field spread out well behind, remained inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths as rivals took closer order, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive confronted by the aforementioned foe just
inside the eighth pole, knocked heads through to the finish in game fashion but was nailed in the last strides to the wire. IT CAN BE DONE coaxed from the
gate, tracked the leader along the inside in closest aim isolated down the backstretch between that foe and the rest of the field, tipped to the two path three
furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. HILLIARD saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly threading through
some traffic for the last major share. SOLDIER RISING (GB) got forced to alter five then four wide into the first turn as ORIGINAL altered in front off the
heels of HE'SPUREGOLD, tucked to the two path near the rear of the field midway on that turn and settled rated near the rear of the field, tipped out three
then four wide into the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid closing
belatedly showing his best turn of foot as the leaders hit the finish while improving position. WAR BOMBER (IRE) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the finish while unable to impact the top spots.
SIFTING SANDS (GB) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. SLICKED BACK tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide into upper stretch and offered
no kick. HE'SPUREGOLD three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. FOUNDER saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide midway on the far turn, angled six to seven wide for home and
made no impact. ORIGINAL a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into
upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SILVER FIST went to the front, set the clear pace while in hand, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down after turning
into the stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drew off under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride
to the wire while much the best. KANT HURRY LOVE tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. THE HONORABLE RUTH settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out inside the furlong marker and weakened while best of the rest. LAOCHI broke near the back of the field,
was reserved under tight restraint, checked at the nine-sixteenths, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. KISSES FOR EMILY was hard
ridden on the outside, bumped with a rival at the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. TAKE CHARGE LISA was well placed just
off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back while crowded a touch into the stretch and capitulated.
GIGGLING GHOST broke in and was last to commence, angled in at the rear, was urged along at the back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
OUR REWARD was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, bumped with an opponent near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back while three then two
wide on the turn and failed to respond.
