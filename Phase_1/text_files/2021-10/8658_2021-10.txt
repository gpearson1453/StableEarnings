Footnotes
SHEZA SAVAGE soon led, took mild prompting by GOSHEN GIRL early, cleared in the two path into the turn, was engaged near the three eighths by
JOANS WAY, turned her back into the lane, opened up further when pushed along, and was allowed to cruise home late while well clear.
COLOROFACLOUD tracked the leading trio early, tracked the leading pair along the rail around the turn, proved no match for SHEZA SAVAGE from upper
stretch, chased on under a drive and outfinished JOAN'S WAY for the place. JOAN'S WAY tracked outside the leading pair early, edged closer to the leader
in the three path into the turn, loomed at the three eighths, proved no match for SHEZA SAVAGE into the lane, chased on under a drive but was outfinished
for place. PEYOTE PEGGY chased well behind the leading group, kept on in the three path while still well behind, chased under a drive four wide in the
lane, and ultimately proved no threat. HERO'S DAUGHTER was slow into stride, trailed early, took closer order with the rear of the field near the five
eighths, chased in the two path on the turn inside of PEYOTE PEGGY, raced three wide in the lane and lacked the needed rally in the lane. GOSHEN GIRL
prompted outside of SHEZA SAVAGE early, tracked her into the turn, while between horses, emptied out from near the three eighths, faded in the four path,
floated seven wide into the lane, offered no response when asked in upper stretch and drifted further out late. FIRE BACK broke outward, settled near the
rear early, was relegated to the rear near the five eighths as HERO'S DAUGHTER took closer order, trailed in the three path on the turn, and offered no bid
inside in the lane.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF PARIS broke readily to gain the advantage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside, shook clear
midway through the far turn, drifted out despite right handed pressure through the last furlong but held LION LOVE on a safe margin. The latter was rated
along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance along the inside
into the lane but proved only second best. A FAST BROAD settled last racing to the backstretch, then continued with a steady effort in the last three furlongs
to improve position between foes to the end. HER GOLD MINE broke inwards making some some contact with SING ALONG SUZY, was prompted to
contention while racing four wide through the first turn, continued three deep after a half to gain terms with the leaders nearing the second bend but soon
flattened out. DARING DAMSEL settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. AUTUMN ASPEN, urged
to terms prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. SING ALONG SUZY came through close quarters at
the start to track off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch but was through after a half.

DICK THE BRUISER tracked outside the leader, engaged outside him into the far turn, prompted in the four path around the second bend, came into the
lane three wide in the leading flight, took the lead at the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive and held sway. TWO COOKIE RULE chased between
horses around the first turn, chased midpack down the back straight, was pushed along into the far turn and improved to track the leading pair in the four
path, was taken five wide into the lane, kept on willingly under a drive, improved four wide late but was held at bay. DRAW THE LINE settled near the rear
four wide around the clubhouse turn, continued in second last down the backstretch, edged closer approaching the half mile mark, was pushed along in the
five path around the far turn and began to improve, raced four wide into the lane, kept on under a drive, angled out five wide inside the final furlong and
improved late. AZRAEL was quick to the lead, raced keenly through the clubhouse turn, continued to set the pace down the backstretch, was engaged by
DICK THE BRUISER into the far turn, continued on a narrow lead in the two to three path around the far turn, led between horses into the lane, clung to the
lead to the three sixteenths under a drive, was headed by DICK THE BRUISER at that point, kept on past the furlong mark and flattened out between late.
CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, settled toward the rear into the backstretch, chased inside of DRAW THE LINE
approaching the half, was taken between horses near the three eighths and urged, continued under a drive between into upper stretch, dropped inside near
the three sixteenths to bid inside of AZRAEL, loomed past midstretch but was outfinished. MAJESTIC JOHN'S tracked the leading pair inside through the
clubhouse turn, continued to track inside of DICK THE BRUISER down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn but nonetheless lost position, was
driven inside in upper stretch and proved empty. YALIKEANYTHING settled at the rear, raced five wide through the first turn, continued to trail down the
back straight and in the two to three path on the far turn, and had no rally under a drive in the lane.

TELLER, caught in close quarters just after the start, was reserved along the inside racing into the first turn, tipped out midway through the backstretch while
gathering momentum, continued with a steady advance while swinging out five wide racing into upper stretch to challenge for command, gained a narrow
advantage midstretch and held PINBALLER safe to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter ducked out sharply at the start while getting away
slowly, switched out four wide racing to the backstretch racing off the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn to upper stretch
challenging for command between foes, resisted the winner's bid while lugging a bit when failing to change leads in the closing stages and came up second
best. BEHAVIN MYSELF gained a forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, came through along the rail to
challenge when presented an opening in upper stretch but had no final kick. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was prompted to a position tracking just off the
pacesetter three deep racing to the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders while shifting inwards on the in far turn,then angled out four wide racing
through the stretch continuing in an even effort. SON OF GRACE, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to lodge a brief bid three deep nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly in the drive. KIT KOWALESKI settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. NOBEL sped to the lead while angling in sharply racing to the first turn, set the pace a bit off the rail to the second
bend, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch and gave out. OFF TO THE BEACH tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch and faded after a half. OPTION tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half and retreated early. TEA AFTER BALLET

STONEVICIOUS pressed the pace outside of MASQUERADE BALL down the backstretch, vied between horses in the leading flight around the turn and
into the stretch, checked approaching the three sixteenths when MUD ISLAND veered into him and pushed him into MASQUERADE BALL, regained his
stride, angled outside to make a bid on MUD ISLAND, rerallied, led near the sixteenth and drove clear. RAZO settled well behind the leading fivesome early,
took closer order toward the main group approaching the half, chased patiently in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied, vied
outside of ALEBRIJE in the final sixteenth and got the nod for place. ALEBRIJE broke a bit slowly, settled near the rear, raced at the inside of the rear flight
into the turn, was driven along the rail around the bend and into the lane, improved well in upper stretch, vied inside of RAZO in the final half furlong and lost
the place bob. MUD ISLAND tracked behind the leading trio, angled out on the turn to bid outside the leading trio past the three eighths, came four wide into
the lane in the leading line, veered inward sharply into STONEVICIOUS and MASQUERADE BALL approaching the three sixteenths, drove clear, was
reeled in near the sixteenth pole and flattened late. RODEO MAN was reluctant to load, veered out sharply in the opening strides, chased outside down the
backstretch and in the five path on the turn, came six wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. MASQUERADE BALL broke sharply, set a pressured
pace down the backstretch, vied inside in the leading flight around the turn and into the lane, checked approaching the three sixteenths after MUD ISLAND
veered in, and flattened out inside. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL broke slowly, settled at the rear, raced at the rear in the five path on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and lacked the needed rally. EL CARDINAL broke in and bumped HERO DRAGON early, attended the pace three wide down the backstretch,
disputed three wide on the turn, and came up empty three wide from the quarter. HERO DRAGON was bumped in the opening strides and shut off, settled
toward the rear, was pushed along it the five to six path on the turn, came six wide into the lane and proved empty. STEWARDS PERFORMED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE RUN IN UPPER STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MUD ISLAND FROM FOURTH TO SIXTH FOR VEERING
IN AND INTERFERING WITH MASQUERADE BALL.

LT. JUNIOR GRADE angled inwards tracking the pacesetter between foes in second flight from out of striking distance racing through the backstretch,
continued with a steady advance to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage in late stages, then drifted inwards brushing KOSHER
COWBOY while proving best. KOSHER COWBOY sprinted clear of the field along the inside in the opening quarter pulling against restraint, set the pace
into the bend, briefly resisted the winner's challenge racing past midstretch but lost the advantage and was steadied slightly when brushed by that foe
nearing the wire. WISE KHOZAN, bumped at the start, switched outside rivals to race as part of the second flight racing to the turn, then continued with a
steady effort to gain position three wide in late stages. COWBOYS FEATHER broke out bumping WISE KHOZAN, was righted, then angled to the inside
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane and faded in the drive. TODDLES tracked off the second flight along the inside
in early stages, tipped out racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. ON THE MUSCLE, caught in close quarters at the start, switched outside foes soon
after the break while settling out of striking distance and failed to menace thereafter. COCO BRAVADO tracked just off the second flight racing four wide
through the backstretch and faded early. THE GEEK, restless in the gate, dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF KOSHER
COWBOY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT, tracked the leaders from just out of striking position in the three path through the opening quarter, continued with a steady effort to
challenge for command racing through the stretch, wrested the advantage racing past the sixteenth marker and went clear under firm handling. STORMY
EMPIRE was rated off the second flight four wide between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn and continued with a steady effort to prevail for
the place honors nearing the wire. LONG TALL WOMAN broke readily, prompted a rival's pace in the opening half, edged clear nearing upper stretch but
failed to sustain that momentum. RARE ACTION ATTACK, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, settled last racing to the turn, swung out six wide
entering the stretch and made some belated progress. MANHATTAN LEGACY was rated off the second flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted out
four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. AROSE FOR LYLA tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening
quarter, angled neaer the inside racing into the turn, then shifted out splitting foes three deep in the stretch and finished evenly in late stages. RAGGEDY
DOLL PEACH tracked the leaders four wide in second flight, shifted inwards to race between rivals on the turn and faded in the drive. PERFECT DIVA was
rated off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was caught five wide racing through the turn and offered no rally. PECOS AUTUMN tracked off the
second flight inside rivals in the opening stages, steadied when losing her path to CHARLO racing into the turn quickly losing position and had no late
response. CHARLO tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening quarter, angled to the rail racing into the turn and gave way after a half.
ONE FLASHY GIRL settled well off the leaders racing through the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. AVASARALA, urged inside a rival disputing
the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
EGOMANIAC chased midfield through the clubhouse turn, continued in the chasing flight between horses down the backstretch, was pushed along in the
three to four path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane for the drive, sustained a rally down the lane while drifting out slightly and got up in the final
jumps. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE tracked the leading trio in the pocket, was pushed along in the three path on the far turn, angled out four wide approaching
the turn for home, engaged the leading flight in upper stretch, vied to midstretch, led past the furlong mark, kept on under a drive while drifting in late and
was caught in the last strides. RULE FOLLOWER tracked the leader three wide through the clubhouse turn, attended the pace three wide down the back
straight, vied in the leading flight three wide around the far turn, vied between horses from upper stretch, proved no match for CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE past
the furlong marker, but chased on to prove best of the rest. MCRAGS chased midpack inside, was pushed along in the two path in the chasing group
through the far turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and took mildly closer order, drifted out midstretch and ultimately lacked the needed finishing kick.
DOM CAETANO (ARG) soon trailed, took mildly closer order in the six to seven path on the far turn, raced six wide into the lane, and passed outside tiring
horses under a drive. MISCHIEVOUS MO tracked the pacesetter two wide early, advanced into the backstretch to press outside of FLORIDA FLASH, vied
between horses around the far turn, continued to dispute terms inside of RULE FOLLOWER and CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE from upper stretch, but weakened
past the furlong mark. FLORIDA FLASH set the pace inside around the clubhouse turn, took pressure from MISCHIEVOUS MO and RULE FOLLOWER to
his outside down the backstretch, vied for the lead inside those foes around the far turn, and emptied out past the five sixteenths. ROCKET RIDE settled
near the rear, advanced to midpack three wide down the backstretch, raced in the six path with the chasing group around the far turn, and came up empty in
the lane. B'S TURNING POINT settled near the rear, saved ground around the far turn, was driven inside into the lane and offered no bid.
