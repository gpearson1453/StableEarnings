and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the show. WROTE IN STONE well placed and
outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and evened out. MERCEDES JOE mid pack, held position on the
two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside into the stretch and ran evenly. LORD BYRON mid pack, moved up on the two path through

Footnotes
GUCCI GAL well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled with CHEROKEE CHATTER
inside the furlong marker and edged ahead of that one in the final strides. CHEROKEE CHATTER never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, bid
on that path into the lane, dueled with the winner late and was outfinished. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off
through the turn, then was no match in the late going and held the show safe. LA REINA DEL NORTE tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path
through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the lane and evened out. SOCIAL EXCLUSION ran evenly. SHOMETHESISTERS reared at the start, came
widest into the stretch and improved her position. MY OWN PASSION steadily lost ground. ISLAND BETTY mid pack, looped three and four wide through
the turn, drifted in into the stretch and faded. AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
ENJOY THE MUSIC well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain,
edged ahead and held. LEBASI allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch, closed well and missed. BEACH PASS
allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and edged up for the show. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. HONORABLE
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. HESASMOKIN allowed to
settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. VERY REPLACEABLE mid pack, faded after a half.

Footnotes
GENEVIEVE'S Z VA set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the lane, then drew off and lasted under steady pressure. VILLAGE QUEEN well placed,
moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. FEETS OF FEATHER allowed to
settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. NOT ORBINARY allowed to
settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and got up for a share. YA BEAUTY
(GB) mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. HAPPY BEE ran evenly, inside.
PRINCESS JAVONCIA fractious in the gate, broke it open before the start, then was hard to rate outside the leader and faded the final furlong. STYLISH
KITTEN was no factor. WHISTLER DIXIE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and had no stretch rally.
