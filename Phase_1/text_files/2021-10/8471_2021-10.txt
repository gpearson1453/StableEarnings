Footnotes
TONY ANN set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, then drew off under mild urging. M IS FOR MAGIC raced up
close behind the leader, saved ground through the turn, could not summon the needed late response but stayed on to best the rest. KATERINI away quickly
from outside, prompted the pace alongside the leader, lost contact past the five-sixteenths pole and got outkicked for the place. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) off a
bit slow to begin, tracked three deep on the turn, three wide into the lane and failed to produce a bid. CAMI KATE tossed her head and hopped slightly at
the start, went outside a pair of rivals on the turn, angled back to the two path leaving the bend and could not rally. DANI MO off slow to begin, tugged the
rider to a forward position, traveled between foes or two wide on the turn and weakened. BIG NEWS COMING stalked off the rail, got shuffled between into
the turn, bumped with inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail on the stretch, remained inside in the lane, got crowded a bit by rival drifting in
midstretch and could no t rally. STOIC LUNA off slow to begin, was a bit rank on the inside entering the turn, bumped with rival at the five-sixteenths pole,
remained inside to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ITSTHATTIME chased in the two path through the turn, tipped outside the top pair in upper stretch, drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth remaining,
dueled to the wire and won the photo. ALLEVA pressed the pace from outside, took over midway around the turn, cleared leaving the bend, led through the
lane then met the challenge from ITSTHATTIME with a sixteenth to go, dueled to the line and missed. HORSE GREEDY trailed on the inside into the turn,
went two wide into the lane, finished willingly and gained the show honors. RINSE AND REPEAT raced outside a rival near the back, took the turn two to
three wide, moved out in the stretch and finished evenly. BAM BAM AGAIN set the pace on the inside with company alongside, lost the lead with
five-sixteenths remaining, chased the leader into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SOMETHING SUPER tracked well off the inside, went five
then four wide on the turn and weakened. BIBLEMAN stalked off the rail, loomed three wide entering the stretch but tired in the lane.

Footnotes
DERECHO DANDY set the pace on the inside, challenged with a quarter of a mile remaining, turned away rival at the top of the stretch, kicked clear and
inched away. PICOTA (GB) stalked the pace from inside, angled out on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, finished well and earned the place
honors. KHANTARO D'ORO closest in pursuit in the two path, put in a mild bid from outside near the quarter pole, could not sustain the challenge at the top
of the lane and kept on to secure the show. WELLSWORT (IRE) tracked the pace two to three wide on the turns, spun four wide into the lane, drifted in
upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. CROSBY BEACH off slow and pulled a bit early, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path
around the bend, went three to four wide on the final curve, floated five wide into the stretch, drifted inward in upper stretch and again in midstretch and
never produced a bid. PERCOLATE (IRE) settled inside, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room through the lane then had to steady at the sixteenth
pole and coasted in after. CORSICA FLAVOR off a bit slow to begin, raced two wide into the first turn then moved to the rail, kept inside then came two wide
into the drive and never got involved. CRYPTO MUNNY taken back early and was reserved behind the field, saved ground through the far turn and was
always outrun.

Footnotes
SATURDAY HEIST sped to the front, set the pace on the inside, kicked clear around the turn, drew away in upper stretch and remained clear under urging.
MUCHA WOMAN stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, moved out in the stretch and finished willingly for a clear second. YELLOW DRESS brushed
leaving the gate, chased off the inside, three wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and outkicked RIGHTEOUSLY for the show.
RIGHTEOUSLY brushed with inner rival early, settled off the pace, came out into the stretch and got edged for the show. FRISCO FRILLS broke well from
outside, raced up close outside the pacesetter, chased that rival two wide to the stretch and weakened. MAGICAL THOUGHT off a bit slow to begin, lacked
early speed, took the turn four wide and passed tired rivals. MALIBU MISTRESS off a bit slow, tracked on the inside to the lane and failed to menace.
SWEET SOULMATE brushed with inner rival at the start, brushed with RIGHTEOUSLY in the early stages, navigated the turn three wide and came up
empty.

Footnotes
KA'NAH settled off the pace, angled down to the two path, shifted out at the top of the lane, rallied from outside and got up late. CROSSWORD closest in
pursuit up the backstretch, chased the leader two wide to the stretch, drew alongside with a furlong remaining, took over in midstretch but was overhauled
by the winner. INGEST showed the way up the backstretch, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged from outside at the eighth pole, overtaken in
midstretch and stayed on inside the top pair to the wire. INCH broke out and bumped rival, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, steered down to the
inside while taking closing order, saved ground through the turn then angled out in the stretch and failed to produce a bid. GORDY'S BOY angled to the
inside while sitting off the pace, swung out into the stretch and failed to threaten. MINSKY (IRE) knocked into rival at the start, chased between then outside
a rival turn, went two wide into the drive and weakened. HOT PURSUIT knocked into rival at the start, raced off the rail then angled to the two path, moved
to the rail around the bend and lacked further response. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA off slow to begin, raced in the two path into the turn, angled out and
came five wide into the stretch and was never a factor. CHASING FAME got bumped from inside leaving the gate, stalked from outside, went four then three
wide around the turn and faded.

HAPI HAPI steadied on the inside early on the first turn, moved off the rail leaving the first turn and further out on the backstretch, came four wide into the
lane, rallied and struck the front inside the sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. SQUALOTORO chased two wide on the first turn, angled five wide into the
stretch, rallied alongside HAPI HAPI and could not get by. BURNIN TURF hustled to the front, sped clear to take control, challenged on the far turn, met the
bid then kicked clear in upper stretch, was caught by the top pair at the sixteenth pole and finished a clear third. BETITO bumped leaving the gate, raced up
close outside the leader, bid outside on the far turn, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE broke out and bumped rival, sat off
the pack, moved closer up the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. BIG STORY bumped both sides leaving the gate, was rank
behind rival entering the first turn, stalked off the rail, came two wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. GOOD BYE PUTIN went four to five wide
around the first turn, remained wide up the backstretch, went six wide into the far turn, moved down to the four path then came back out and entered the

Footnotes
INDIAN PEAK settled early, went three wide into the bend, eased out a few paths while gaining ground through the turn, rallied outside a pair of rivals and
took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dueled with NORTH COUNTY GUY in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. NORTH COUNTY GUY tracked off the
inside, angled in on the turn, waited for room then tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes, dueled with INDIAN PEAK in deep stretch and could not
get by. UNBRIDLED ETHOS went two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane, closed fast outside the top pair but was too
late. WHOOPING JAY tracked widest early then angled to the two path on the turn, waited for room on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, steered out
and kept on to earn a minor award. DESMOND DOSS off slow to begin, trailed early on, angled widest and summoned a mild rally. GIVE ME THE LUTE
sped clear from inside to establish the front, pressured around the turn then moved clear again leaving the bend, held command in upper stretch then got
overtaken at the eighth pole and flattened out. TIGER DAD steadied off the heels of the leader early, chased three wide into the turn, moved out a bit
leaving the bend and failed to produce a bid. LOUD MOUTH raced off the pace, angled in for the turn, saved ground through the bend and failed to menace.
GROUND ATTACK turned his head and stumbled at the start, bid outside on the turn, could not keep up leaving the bend and faded out of contention.

in late and got up. LUNATIC bumped with WINTER STAR at the start, vied four deep up the backstretch, three deep into the turn, dueled with SCREAM
AND SHOUT through the bend, carried a short lead into the stretch, maintained the advantage through the lane but faltered late and got edged for the
score. B'ESAME ME MUCHO broke well from outside then dropped back off the pace, chased outside a pair of rivals, five wide into the turn, three to four
into the stretch, flew late but ran out of time. WINTER STAR bumped with LUNATIC at the start, chased between foes early, two to three wide into the
stretch and churned on to fill out the superfecta. MEASUREOFDEVOTION vied for command between foes then on the inside into the turn, chased the top
pair to the stretch and weakened. LIFE'S EMOTIONS tracked in the two path, a bit off the rail into the lane and faded. MISTAKA lacked early speed,
traveled along the inside into the turn, angled out and came three wide into the lane and was not a factor. CANDY RUNNER showed early speed inside the
top trio, could not keep up near the half-mile pole, dropped on the turn and tired. RETURN TO HARBOR raced in mid-pack early on, dropped back on the
turn while three then two wide and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO NICE (IRE) got crowded between early, put in tight quarters again and steadied past the five-eighths pole, raced outside a rival around the turn,
entered the lane three wide, steered out in the drive, flew late and surged clear. ANONYMOUSLY fractious in the gate, chased between then angled in on
the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out with a furlong remaining and finished well between foes to get up for second. GREG'S DIVA away quickly
from outside, crossed over to the inside, led clear into the stretch and got caught late. SEPTEMBER SECRET chased between then moved inside on the
backstretch, angled out on the turn and came three wide into the stretch, closed in and drew alongside with a sixteenth to go but lacked the needed late
kick. NU PI LAMBDA tracked two then three wide around the turn, tipped out and rallied in the stretch but needed to find more. MISS CAROUSEL sat off the
pace, took the turn two wide, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. ANOTHER EDDIE traveled in mid-pack early on, saved ground through the
turn, moved out in the stretch and lacked further response. XMAS SURPRISE stumbled at the start, ran up behind rival and steady past the half-mile pole,
saved ground on the inside, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. AWESOME DRIVE raced near the back of the pack, entered the turn two wide,
angled out and came four wide into the stretch, continued to angle out and raced widest through the lane and could not find the needed response. ISN'T
SHE LOVELY raced up close outside the leader, took aim two wide into the stretch, chased between in upper stretch and weakened. DERBY QUEST
lagged behind early, angled in and saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. FROSE forwardly placed four deep early, chased three wide around
the turn, got bothered from inside entering the stretch and weakened.
