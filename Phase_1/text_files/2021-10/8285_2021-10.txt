SUN TREADER was void of any early speed, advanced six wide into the turn, took control in late stretch and edged clear for the win. EPIC ADVENTURE
pressed the early pace, raced five wide, took a brief lead into the stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. GLENDORA MINECAT was
allowed to enter early, raced four wide and was empty late. PALICE REVENGE set a pressured pace from the inside and tired. HUNKY DUNN forced the
early pace from between rivals and faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
