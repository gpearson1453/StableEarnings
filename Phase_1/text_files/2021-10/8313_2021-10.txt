pace, chased into the stretch and was gaining late. SHISHKA raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then closed gamely in vain. MI
TORMENTA raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. HONEY GIRL broke outward, settled off the pace,
was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, rallied outside but failed to menace. PARABLE showed early speed then stalked the pace, chased three-wide
on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. NICE COMPANY was herded outward at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the
turn then leveled out in the late stages. DYNAMIC CONTRAST, rated off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but never reached

Footnotes
HONEY WON'T went out for the lead with two rivals, took back to track along the inside, stayed on the fence under restraint, got room up the rail in
midstretch and got the front inside the sixteenth pole, drawing away late. DOTTED LINE in midpack and taken a hold of early, angled out into the four path
turning for home when steadied in between rivals, got over to the rail nearing the sixteenth pole and followed the winner's path, up late for the place.
RECONFIGURE led between rivals early, was allowed the front those two rivals took back, had the same pair inside and outside of him turning for home
and lost the front to the winner at the sixteenth pole, losing the place spot late. SALVATOR MUNDI three wide in midpack early, came three to four wide on
the turn and out in the five path turning for home, had dead aim on the leaders at the eighth pole but could only inch up late for a minor award. SILENT
FLASH took off the early leader to stalk that rival, bid late on the turn and in upper stretch but was no match, tiring and losing positions in the final sixteenth.
SOUPER SUCCESS along the rail and at the back early, came along the two path on the turn and tipped out to the seven path turning for home, his rally
compromised by severely lugging in while wide in the final furlong, the rider having his hands full trying to keep him straight. CARMENOOTZ was taken back
early, came four to three wide on the turn and floated out by a rival into the eight path turning for home, mildly rallying to midstretch before levelling off.
FORESTER'S TURN three wide stalking early, chased three wide on the turn and in range at the top of the lane but retreated in the final furlong. WHERE'S
ANTHONY hit the side of the gate at the start, got a nice trip along the rail in midpack and was in behind the winner turning for home but ran out of run at the
eighth pole. SILENT JIMMIE was wide and trailed the field throughout.
