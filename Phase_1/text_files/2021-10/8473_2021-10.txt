Footnotes
PRIDE AND PASSION pressed the pace, closed late turn, led upper stretch and drove clear then finished under a hand ride. DOMINANT FACTOR raced in
mid pack, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then rallied gamely through the stretch. STRONG ATTITUDE was off slowly but showed speed,
set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch, chased, but evened out late. CORRELATE settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, angled
out in the final furlong and finished gamely. SILENT FIRE stalked the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn but leveled off in the final furlong. SAINT'S
REST raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. BLACK HILLS BRONCO broke alertly but settled off the pace,
closed hard three to five-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. MUSIC TRIBUTE settled in mid pack, chased four-wide on the turn but failed to
menace and evened out late. MR. MAGICAL broke out and was steadied, settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. WHIZMO was away slowly, stalked the pace, dropped back along the rail through the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SELFMADE was two wide between runners in midpack on the first turn, split rivals midway on the second turn and bid nearing the quarter pole, led turning
for home and had a clear advantage by the eighth pole, holding safe to the wire. CARL G sat three wide in midpack on the first turn, rallied three to five wide
on the far turn and was on the flank of the winner turning for home, outkicked by that rival to the wire but holding the place spot late under a hand ride.
SOUPER COHIBA off the pace and three wide on the first turn, advanced in the four path on the backstretch, came four to five wide on the second turn and
out in the six path turning for home, running on late for the show spot, inching up late on the place finisher. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was inside on the turns
and off the pace, trailed under restraint awaiting room on the far turn, steadied in behind a wall at the quarter and did not have a clear path until the eighth
pole, coming on quickly when room appeared but by then the leaders were gone. VELOCE stumbled at the break and settled in midpack along the rail,
stayed inside and waited for room into the lane but a mild rally stalled at the eighth pole. LUCAS N' LORI off the pace early came two to five wide on the far
turn and swung out into the eight path in upper stretch, failing to sustain his bid in the final sixteenth while widest. KNOPFLER was inside a three way speed
duel, stayed in front until the quarter pole but had nothing left for the stretch drive. LION'S GOLDENHEART stalked inside the speed duel, chased that trio
down the backside, had to steady when into a blind switch late on the far turn and retreated down the lane while on his wrong lead. MAJESTIC MELODY
had an awkward beginning but recovered to press the fast pace between runners, had a very brief lead near the quarter pole but tired down the stretch.
BREATHLESSNTHESAND was three wide pressing the pace through fast fractions, began to drop back on the far turn and fell back.

Footnotes
GUILEFUL stalked the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, was blocked upper stretch, angled out and surged to the lead and finished
under a hand ride. CHARDONNAY forced the pace, posted a brief bid early turn, rebid and dueled into the stretch, led upper stretch, was passed a 16th out
and chased to the end. SISTER SEAGULL raced in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch then rallied gamely, but late.
LISA MARIE was off slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide late on the3 far turn, closed in the stretch but evened out late.
MENAGERIE, in range, closed three-wide on the far turn, was up close at the top of the stretch, was determined, but evened out late. OPAL CREEK got
away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn and chased through the stretch. SPOOKY SPICE led early, set a pressured pace
along the rail, dueled into the stretch, led briefly and gave way. HALLANVAARA settled in mid pack, forced the issue four-wide late turn, dropped back at the

came two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out late. ICE DANCER, off slowly, raced in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn
then finished evenly. YANKEE JOE, also off slowly but had a turn of speed, set a pressured pace, dueled o the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch
and gave way. DOWNTOWN CRUMLIN settled in mid pack, dropped back early turn, moved to the outside and chased hard to the stretch but was unable
to threaten. CALM DOWN raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but his rally stalled in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MUTAMAKINA (GB) stalked a slow pace on the yielding going, was content to sit off the leader and turned up the pressure late on the far turn, went head
and head with the pacesetter down the lane and drove to the front at the sixteenth pole, all out to hold off her stablemate in the late stages. LA
DRAGONTEA (GB) trailed while three to two wide around the first turn, stayed at the back into the stretch when shifting out searching for a seam in upper
stretch, went from the six path back to the three path at the three sixteenths, found room at the sixteenth pole and flew late, a solid run in a fast final quarter.
KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) led through soft fractions, was stalked and challenged by the winner nearing the turn for home, headed at the sixteenth pole
and giving way grudgingly while game to the finish. WALIYAK (FR) chased the leaders along the inside to the stretch, came off the rail turning for home but
went back to the two path at the three sixteenths, outkicked by the top trio but holding a minor award over a rival to her inside. GREAT ISLAND was five to
three wide in midpack on the first turn, advanced down the backside to loom four wide on the far turn, still outside and dangerous looking at the eighth pole,
gradually fading from that point to the finish. KEYFLOWER (FR) turned left out soon after the start and got over to the fence into the first turn off the pace,
got a nice run through along the inside on the far turn and skimmed the rail down the stretch, in contention to the sixteenth pole but stalling in the final
seventy yards. FAMILY WAY hit the side of the gate at the start, chased the leaders two wide, loomed three wide turning for home but her rally stalled in the
final furlong when the pace quickened. COURT RETURN broke in and bumped with a rival at the start, two to three wide throughout, tipped out into the
seven path when the field fanned out turning for home but no rally was forthcoming. ETOILE (FR) was bumped by a rival at the start, sat along the rail in
midpack, tipped out to the five path turning for home but was out of run by the eighth pole. MERVEILLEUX was three to four wide off the pace and into
midpack on the far turn, never reaching contention.

under a strong drive. STRIKING MOON stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. LOOKIN TO STRIKE stalked the

TURNED ASIDE stalked the pace, split foes to go after the leader in the stretch and was all out and gaining in the late stages. OLYMPIC RUNNER hit the
gate leaving, settled off the pace, came along the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied and was also coming fast in deep stretch. MOMOS led into the turn,
set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. TOWN CRUISE forced the issue, came
three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but had no closing response. JOLIE OLIMPICA (BRZ) broke outward and settled off the pace, came
three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. WHITE FLAG raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, chased
three-wide into the stretch but evened out in deep stretch. RECONFIGURE settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn but had no response when
asked in the stretch. ADMIRALTY PIER broke inward, raced from off the pace, saved on the ground but lacked a rally. LUCKY CURLIN, in mid pack early,
was hustled four-wide on the turn, rallied, but flattened out with a 16th still on tap.
