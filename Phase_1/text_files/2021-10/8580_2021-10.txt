ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best.
BLONDE ATTITUDE was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and was up for place. EIGHT SPEED was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. KOZY KAT was up close, roused on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
finished well. DIAMONDSINHEREYES set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
PRINCESS FABIANA was off slow and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat.

ROSIEJEWEL DANCER set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was much the best. FRESH DREAMS was in
mid pack, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. MISS TEA BLONDE stalked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch evened out. POWER HOUSE showed no speed, was roused on the turn and was
the best of the rest. SUBZERO PLUS was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but was never in contention. IT'SNICETOBENICE tracked from the
outside and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. BEAU'S BEAUTY was up close early but checked into
the turn and was pulled up.

Footnotes
SETSON was well back, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. MY BOY CHRISTIAN set the pace and had
a clear lead on the far turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. AFLEET EDDIE was in touch and a factor on the far turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. BIG BOY BENNY was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the nine path at the top of
the stretch was up for a share. FLEX was in mid pack and moved up on the far turn but from the nine path at the top of the stretch was no threat.
WONNEFRAC stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. JUSTALITTLEHYPER had no speed, showed little and was not a
factor. CALL ME KALEN was in range early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
