MIDNIGHT PUNK stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drew off late. DONALD rated back in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked and
forced to steady on heels, then angled out and closed for the place. RED HOT LOOKS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong
marker, then weakened late and held the show. HENNY HEFNER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the
lane and edged up for a share. GRAZED MY BISCUITS well placed, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened
out. KING ECLIPTICAL was never involved.

evened out the final furlong. GOLDEN OAK allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed
well for a share. BIG FRANK mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
GIVEITSOMEWELLIE stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. SHE'S HOT TODAY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three
wide into the lane, then could not gain in the late going and held the place. NEVISIAN SPIRIT mid pack, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. ALYDARIUS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid
four wide into the lane, then had a mild stretch gain to get up for a share. COME ON CITY (GER) hopped and steadied at the start, ran evenly.
LEGENDARYS FIRST well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened. SPIN CLASS
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. ANIMAUXSELLE was no

Footnotes
SO MOXIE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late. CHEROKEE
CHATTER well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the
place in the final strides. GUCCI GAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held
the show. ALLEYESFOLLOWBELLE broke in, bumping a rival at the start, looped to position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane,
flattened and gained a share. KEYPIT mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and evened out. SIDE
ACTION mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. BEARS
BREECHES allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and improved her position. COUPLE OF NIKKIS well
placed and four wide, angled in and moved to position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no stretch rally. GENUWINE was no
factor. PERFECT DOLL stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the turn.
