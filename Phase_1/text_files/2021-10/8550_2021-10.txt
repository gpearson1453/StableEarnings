Footnotes
RB RATH was allowed to settle early on the inside, angled out four wide to make a bid in the stretch, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a
drive. FOUR HUNDRED PROOF AA dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but proved to be no match for the winner late while
clearly second best. UPTOWN MANONTOP dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the drive, bested rest. JOB AA was reserved early, advanced five
wide on the turn and offered a belated rally for the minor rewards. UPTOWN RINGOFFIRE chased the early pace on the inside and eased out on the turn
and came four wide into the stretch but came up empty. RB RICH RATH chased the early pace, came six wide into the drive and weakened.
GAILSMASQUERADE was not a factor. HIGHH DEMAND showed little. VAZS GONNA BURN SV was through early.
