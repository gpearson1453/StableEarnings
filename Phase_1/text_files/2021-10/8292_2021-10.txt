Footnotes
NORMANDY'S EMPIRE took over past the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of BLUE COLLAR BOY past the five
sixteenths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn then dug in determinedly through the stretch to keep that one at bay, while the latter,
stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and challenged past the five sixteenths, contested even terms
two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. YES SIR BOB stalked inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and ran evenly through the lane. SASSY RICK settled back off the rail on the opening turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, ran two
deep on the far turn then lost some ground entering the stretch. WE GOT THE MONEY raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. COBAN rounded the opening turn about the four path then faded approaching the five sixteenths pole.

ELVIRUS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under light pressure leaving the quarter pole and was only mildly urged in the lane. DASHING
CIRCLES settled off the rail then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and proved no match in the stretch. RAGING
WHIRLWIND raced well back from early contention then bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved his position while angling to the five path on the far
turn and came along for third mid-stretch`. MY BOY STRYKER saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled to the four path on the
far turn and finished evenly. FASHIONABLE settled off the earlier pace about the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn and showed little further. MOMZA settled off the pace about the four path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on
the far turn and had little left. ITS MR POPPI TO U was not a factor. R H F SPECTRE saved ground. INDY DEL SOL settled off the pace about the three
path and showed little response through the backstretch.

TAKE ME HOME raced with the pace inside then challenged and took the lead past the three eighths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far
turn and was steadily handled to late stretch. MY LOVELY GIRL took a slim lead leaving the three quarter pole and set the early pace, was caught past the
three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn but drifted while dropping back into the stretch and dug in to hold on for second.
COMPLETE SURPRISE settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn just off the rail
and ran evenly through the lane. MARY'S JEWEL saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn and
came through the stretch evenly. BOOGIE WITH ME settled back off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then
flattened the final furlong.

Footnotes
TOMMY PIES was reluctant to load and dropped well back to save ground, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, steadily closed at the rail
on the far turn, angled outward toward the head of the lane and entered the stretch about the five path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily
handled to draw clear. NEW SOUTH raced with the pace two deep and dueled at even terms into the backstretch, was headed mid-stretch and relented
later yards. NOW I'M BROKE rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four and five paths, was carried wider nearing the head of the lane and finished evenly to take third
later yards. OULOG raced well back off the rail the opening turn, started a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved off the rail on the far and ran evenly
down the lane. ALBERTANO was hustled at the rail and dueled at even terms from the half mile pole, had the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up
the nod past the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. DUSKY rounded the opening turn about the four path then stalked three wide into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded into the far turn. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY saved early ground, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail into the far turn. PREACHER'S BAY settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn.
