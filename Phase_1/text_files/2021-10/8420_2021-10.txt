Footnotes
ELGAR was bumped at the start, quickly shifted outside, drifted in continuously bumping a rival several times, rallied steadily, made the lead in the five path
near the furlong maker and won under mild urging. GOLD SHARK close up along the inside into the stretch, shifted out to mid track and rallied for second.
MAGICAL EXPRESS had speed between horses, was bumped repeatedly before a quarter, steadied and angled outside then went evenly. WILL
RUNAWAY pressed the pace along the inside early and was outfinished. FRONTIER MESA broke in front, set the pace along the inside to mid stretch and
weakened late. SMALL TOWN HERO took a bad step out of the gate, bumped ELGAR, was bumped then squeezed between rivals nearing the half mile
marker, had speed through the turn then swung wide, stopped and jogged to the wire. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER
REVIEW DISQUALIFIED ELGAR FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH AND PLACED HIM THIRD.
