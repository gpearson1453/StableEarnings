Footnotes
SKIP THE SMALLTALK stalked inside of STREET EDGE, saved ground through the turn, rallied under a drive inside of CHOPPER into the lane, took the
lead near the three sixteenths, drove clear, and held to the finish. FINAL CALL settled near the rear, was pushed along in the two to three path on the turn,
went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out, found his best in the final furlong and gained well late. NUMERO PRIMO settled near the rear, took up suddenly
near the half mile pole and altered several paths further outside, raced in the five to six path in the rear flight around the far turn, came six wide into the lane,
and offered belated improvement under a drive. STREET EDGE was restless in the gate and bumped by CHOPPER in the opening strides, stalked the
pace two wide down the backstretch and around the turn, came into the lane three wide in the leading flight, proved no match for SKIP THE SMALLTALK
from near the three sixteenths, and flattened out. CHOPPER set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was engaged in upper
stretch by SKIP THE SMALLTALK to his inside and STREET EDGE to his outside, lost the lead to SKIP THE SMALLTALK near the three sixteenths, and
weakened. TO THE BANK chased midpack, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, raced between horses in upper stretch and came up empty.
COPPER CROSSING was bumped between horses in the opening strides and took back, settled at the rear early, was pushed along in the two path on the
turn while at the rear, then driven inside in upper stretch, but offered no rally.

Footnotes
CHRISTY ATTACK was anxious in the gate when RULER DAENERYS acted up, chased the leader three wide between horses early, tracked the leading
pair in the two to three path on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, nonetheless responded with a rally under a drive and got up in time. AH LEAH chased
the leader five wide early, was pushed along for a bid in the three path on the turn, headed LA REBELDE at the three eighths, was clear into upper stretch,
kept on under a drive but drifted out late and was caught in the final jumps. LAURA N LUKAS chased the leader between horses early, settled back to
chase midpack in the two to three path on the turn, rallied under a drive in the lane and continued to gain late. RULER DAENERYS was restless in the gate,
chased the leader four wide between horses early, tracked the leading pair in the four path outside of CHRISTY ATTACK around the turn, was carried out in
upper stretch by that foe, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. NEVE DE LUA raced at the inside of the flight chasing the leader down the backstretch,
settled at the rear of the main group into the turn, was pushed along in the four path around the bend, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked
the needed rally. TIKA TOY bobbled in the opening strides, soon trailed, saved ground through the far turn, floated five wide into upper stretch, angled in
midstretch and passed tiring horses. PIPPITY DO DA broke inward, settled near the rear well behind the main pack, saved ground around the turn, and
offered no bid in the lane. LA REBELDE was sent hard, set the pace down the backstretch and into the turn in the two path, was headed by AH LEAH at the
three eighths, began to weaken despite being put to a drive and continued to fade in the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS NO FIVE
EIGHTHS TIME.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME broke sharply, was urged to a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn, switched outside a rival once headed by that foe
nearing the backstretch, was urged to press that foe for command racing into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, then gamely
withstood the challenge of ANDREAS in a prolonged drive to narrowly prevail in a game effort. The latter settled last racing to the backstretch, switched
outside foes after the opening three furlongs to advance to contention three wide, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch,
contested the issue in a protracted skirmish but just failed to edge the winner. PADDY'S HOUSE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, bid for command between foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. FULL MAGAZINE, off a step behind the leaders,
was prompted to gain the advantage while switching outside a rival racing into the first turn, gained the lead while angling to the rail entering the backstretch,
set the pace to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn and gave way. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS ducked inwards at the start,
was quickly collected to track off the leaders along the inside racing to the second bend, bore out on the far turn after his rider lost his irons, was pulled up
entering the lane and assisted by the outrider to walk off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN AND DECLARED ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS A NON-FINISHER.

Footnotes
SPECIAL PRYCE sent for pace but was outsprinted to the early lead, tracked the leading pair down the back straight, bid three wide between horses into
the turn, vied for the lead between horses past the three eighths, continued to vie outside of WEAREINITTOWINIT in upper stretch, shook clear past the
three sixteenths, and held safe under a drive. ROCKET HOTSHOT settled at the rear, began to improve in the two to three path on the turn from the seven
sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch for the drive, and continued to gain to the finish. POQUITO MAN tracked the leading pair outside of SPECIAL
PRYCE, engaged four wide into the turn, vied four wide past the three eighths, was driven four wide into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair from
there, but chased on best of the rest. STORM'S REFLECTION chased behind the tracking flight down the back straight, chased the leading line in the five
path on the turn, made a brief bid near the five sixteenths, was driven five wide between horses in upper stretch, chased on while drifting in midstretch, and
was outfinished for the show. WEAREINITTOWINIT prompted the early pace inside of COAL TOWN ROAD, led inside that foe near the three eighths,
almost immediately began to vie for that lead inside of SPECIAL PRYCE, continued to vie to upper stretch, was no match from the three sixteenths and
weakened inside. IMPERIAL TEMPLE raced two wide in the rear flight early, trailed in the four path on the turn, and offered no rally. COAL TOWN ROAD
sent for pace between horses, led early while taking pressure from WEAREINITTOWINIT, was headed approaching the three eighths, and emptied out from
the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES broke sharply to dictate the pace along the inside to the backstretch, met the challenge of a rival to duel for command leaving the
far turn into upper stretch, then turned back RICHIESGOTGAME through the closing stages to prevail under firm left handed pressure. The latter tracked
just off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, gained striking distance three deep between foes nearing the far turn, moved to challenge for
command racing into upper stretch, pressed the issue to strike the front in a prolonged drive but proved only second best. IWILLPERSEVERE, forwardly
placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, continued between foes to the far turn and kept on in the closing stages to prevail for a share. LAND
MARK DEAL, pulling against restraint along the inside stalking the pacesetter to the backstretch, lost some position tracking along the inside racing into the
far turn and gave way into upper stretch. WHAT'S UP DUDE broke inwards bumping FLY NIGHTLY, was righted while racing rank under restraint between
foes racing to the first turn, switched out four wide on the backstretch while being prompted to make a brief bid nearing the far turn but emptied out racing
into upper stretch. FLY NIGHTLY, off slowly, then bumped at the start, settled last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
TONE IT UP raced at the rear of the main pack early, improved in the three path on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, continued to rally, reeled in PRINCEDREAMCESS near the sixteenth pole and cleared. PRINCEDREAMCESS prompted outside of
STANDUP COMEDIENNE down the backstretch and into the turn, took the lead in the three path near the three eighths, shook clear into the lane, was
engaged midstretch by TONE IT UP and headed by that foe approaching the sixteenths, but chased on a clear second best. JOURNEYIST tracked the
leading trio early, lost ground past the five eighths while difficult to settle, chased in the two to three path at the rear of the main group around the turn, was
driven while angling five wide in upper stretch, and rallied mildly to prove best of the rest. BURNING BUSH hopped out of the gate, settled near the rear,
continued around the turn detached from all but OFFENSIVE CHARGE, drifted out while all out in upper stretch, and improved mildly past tiring horses.
OFFENSIVE CHARGE was off a bit slowly and then herded out slightly in the opening strides, was pushed along from the rear but still trailed through the far
turn and into the stretch in the two path, and chased on to pass tiring horses. STANDUP COMEDIENNE broke outward, was sent to a narrow early lead, led
narrowly in the two path on the turn, was headed by PRINCEDREAMCESS near the three eighths, proved no match into the lane and weakened. NIFF
broke sharply, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and along the rail on the turn, was driven inside behind the leader in upper stretch, and
emptied out.

Footnotes
LADY ATLANTIC, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, was urged to press the issue between rivals racing into the turn,
shook clear in upper stretch and just held PRINCESS RENEE to the wire in a stiff drive. The latter switched out early tracking off the first flight, angled
inwards racing into the bend, steadily gained position nearing the lane, split rivals in upper stretch, then rallied through late stages to challenge the winner
nearing the wire but just missed. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM, held up avoiding close quarters along the inside behind the second flight on the backstretch, tipped
out racing into the turn while being prompted to advance between foes, altered course four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on
the top pair. RONAN, off slowly, was settled into stride, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and made some belated progress. RUBY Y'ALL sprinted
to the lead from the break while angling to the inside, dueled for command inside when headed on the turn but gave way leaving midstretch. VARSITY
FLYGIRL was urged three wide between foes through the backstretch pursuing the pacesetter into the turn but gave way nearing upper stretch. CAVE
CREEK ducked out at the start, was righted, then urged to join the pace racing four wide into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. BOW DOWN
TEWMEY angled to the inside in early stages tracking the leaders but failed to seriously menace. PRINCESS TINE (FR) dropped out early.

Footnotes
NOT VERY GENTLE, reserved between foes racing to the first turn, conceded some position nearing the backstretch while angling nearer to the inside, was
prompted to advance shifting out on the far turn, split foes three deep nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady late response to bid inside the
pacesetter and go clear late under pressure. WILD FOX was urged to terms with a rival prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, forged clear racing
into the far turn but failed to sustain that momentum past the sixteenth marker. THE LAST OPTION tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final response. ABUELO NUNO tracked off the leaders three
deep racing through the first turn, gained some position while angling inwards after a half, gained contention between foes leaving the midway point of the
far turn but lacked the needed late bid. MANGO TREE drifted out a bit off the inside racing through the first turn tracking the leaders inside foes, switched
out on the backstretch but proved no threat. DARK WOOD (IRE) was outpaced early. DEWY'S HIT was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the
outset to the backstretch and gave way racing through the far turn.
