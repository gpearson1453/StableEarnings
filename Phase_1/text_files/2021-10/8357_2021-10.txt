BIGFOOT CITY was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, took command into the far turn and drew clear in the final stages under steady handling. THE
BLACK ALBUM (FR) settled to the back of the pack early on, made a steady advance towards the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole
and finished second best. TUNE TO WIN stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced towards the inside and had no late response. HOUSE LIMIT
showed good early speed to set all the pace and tired readily.

WICKED SUNSET stalked the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and closed in well late to be second best. SAPPHIRE SILK was sent along
early, stalked the top pair from the inside, continued to race inside of rivals in the stretch and had no final winning bid. BACK BEAUTY was quick to begin to
set all the early pace and was empty in the latter stages. MERGIE TROID dropped back early, raced towards the inside through the stretch run and failed to

TOMMY SPECIAL stalked the early going, moved up nearing the far turn, angled in to race near the inside around the far turn and finished well to get up
under strong encouragement. ONE LAST THOUGHT showed good early speed, resisted inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides late with the
winner to finish second best. STARRY SIERRA bobbled at the break, was hustled from the inside, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was
no match for the top pair in the drive. SPLIT ACES pressed the early leader, drifted a bit into the upper stretch and had no late response.
EDDIESPAGHETTI stumbled at the break, unseated his rider, a stewards inquiry was filed to look into the break and ruled no change.

I AM YOURS stalked the early going, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. DELIA MO pressed
the early leader, led inside the eighth pole, dug in and finished gamely to the wrie. UPTOWN RHAPSODY dropped back early, moved up three wide near
the quarter pole, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole, kept on in the drive but was no match for the top pair. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST vied for the
early lead from the inside and gave way. TOUGH TO CATCH settled off the early pace, was getting out in the stretch to race very wide and never
threatened.

Footnotes
MISS UNION was quick to begin to set all the pace and held gamely in the drive to be well clear under strong handling. LIGHT UP was forwardly placed to
lay up close early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner through the drive. CODE RIBBON stalked the pace, moved up
four wide near the quarter pole but had not enough for the top pair in the drive. VAPING ANGEL was slow early and failed to have a response.

Footnotes
PALALEO settled off the early pace, moved up five through the upper lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. SCRATCHY APACHE stalked
the early pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. EL BEAUTIFUL showed good early speed from the outside,
raced three wide in the drive while racing between rivals and weakened late. COLONEL MIKE settled off the early going, raced five wide at the three
sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. STREET DEMAND was off a step slow, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a serious
factor. KAZANSKY failed to respond. WINK AND A DREAM was hustled along to lay up close early on and tired.
