OLD TOWN ROAD tracked the pace early, was in the two path into the lane, took over command with ease and drew away down the lane under a hand
ride. KING OF TRUTH raced up close early on while in tight along the backstretch, was in the two path into the lane, altered out down the lane and was no
match for the winner. SUBURBAN COURT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. COME ALONE was never
a threat. WHATSTHECONNECTION was through after a half.

Footnotes
MARK OF THE Z stalked two wide, ranged up to the clear leader in midstretch, forged an advantage a sixteenth from home, and held from a lunging
STRIKE ME DOWN late. STRIKE ME DOWN stalked three wide, chased a rallying MARK OF THE Z through the lane, and stayed on to reach place on the
wire. QUICK TEMPO opened up early on, but met MARK OF THE Z's challenge in midstretch, was headed a sixteenth from home, then got nailed on the
wire by another foe for place. EXPROMPT (FR) broke a step slowly, lied off of the pace two to three wide, and failed to threaten. COMPETITIVE SAINT
settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. INHALATION (GB) hopped at the start, saved ground in
midpack, but to no avail. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF was outrun.

Footnotes
CHEETARA (CHI) managed an uncontested lead while well in hand and in the two path around both turns, responded to urging in upper stretch, inched
clear with a furlong to run, and lasted from an oncharging SALLY'S CURLIN. SALLY'S CURLIN settled far off of the pace along the inside, swung five wide
turning for home, rallied through the lane with a good kick, but ran out of ground to catch CHEETARA (CHI) on the wire. ITS COLD IN DEHERE stalked two
wide, but came under coaxing to inch closer passing the three furlong pole, and only managed to chase the leader home while getting outkicked for place in
the final furlong. TASTING THE STARS stalked along the inside, then chased along the rail through the lane. HIGH REGARD lied at the rear two wide,
advanced to tracking range into the far turn, but failed to factor thereafter. FINAL CUT tracked three wide, but weakened passing the half mile pole, and was
done early.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN SARATOGA saved ground off of the pace around each turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane before smoothly splitting the leaders at
the three sixteenths pole, swiftly took over shortly after, and held safely from a rallying LUCK MONEY late. LUCK MONEY settled far off of the pace two
wide, saved ground around the second and third turns before swinging six wide entering the lane, produced a stout kick in upper stretch to take aim on a
clear SUMMER IN SARATOGA approaching the final sixteenth, but was denied reaching that rival late. MICHELINE rated off of the pace two wide, came
under urging at the three furlong pole to pick up stride, shifted seven wide entering the lane to be widest of all, and stayed on well to reach show while
chasing LUCK MONEY's rally. KELSEY'S CROSS required a shoe repair after the post parade and created a post time delay, then stalked from the two
path early on, tipped three wide around the second turn, sustained in range position around the final turn, but was floated four wide by the eventual winner
passing the quarter pole, got outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, then saved fourth between rivals. ENGLISH AFFAIR trailed along the inside, shifted to
the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses in the final furlong, but failed to menace. LA LUNE (GB) tracked two wide, shifted five wide
entering the lane, but was outkicked for a minor placing in midstretch, and lacked a rally. VIBURNUM was last away, sat reserved two wide, shifted to the
five path in upper stretch, and moved up. KEY BISCAYNE pressed two wide, bid for the lead along with SUMMER IN SARATOGA in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. EESHA MY FLOWER set the pace, but was headed by foes at the three sixteenths pole, and
weakened on her left lead. I HEAR YOU saved ground in midpack, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY was sent early on to set the pace along the inside, met WARRIOR'S CHARGE's bid around the far turn, repelled that foe and shook
clear passing the five sixteenths pole, then lasted from that rival's rebid approaching the wire. WARRIOR'S CHARGE pressed the pace two wide, came
under coaxing at the three furlong pole to range up outside of THOMAS SHELBY around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the five
sixteenths pole, sustained his chase in upper stretch, came again late as the leader tired, but missed. HIGHEST HONORS trailed two wide, gained three
wide around the far turn to bid for place in upper stretch, but delayed his lead change to inside the final furlong, and leveled off. PIRATE'S PUNCH saved
ground off of the pace, advanced to a tracking position into the far turn, but chased under urging around that bend, and tired through the lane. MY SIXTH
SENSE stalked from the two path, but faded passing the three furlong pole. ROYAL MESA tracked three wide, then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
DAWN'S DANCER tracked from midpack along the inside then two wide around the far turn, split foes at the three sixteenths pole to take aim on a leading
JOY OF PAINTING, ranged up to that foe at the sixteenth pole, and edged clear. JOY OF PAINTING set the pace, inched clear entering the lane, but was
worn down in the late stages. AIZU saved ground far off of the pace, shifted seven wide in midstretch with many lengths to find, but produced a strong kick,
and flew late to just miss place. GLADYS settled off of the pace two wide, cut the corner turning for home, then rallied belatedly along the rail through the
final furlong. TEXAS SHUFFLE stalked along the inside, chased through midstretch as DAWN'S DANCER rallied alongside, tipped outside of the leader at
the sixteenth pole while getting outkicked by that foe, then lost show to rivals on either sides late. MAGNA MATER (IRE) lied off of the pace along the inside,
gained ground four wide turning for home, but leveled off while getting floated five wide in midstretch. UYUNI settled three wide, swung six wide entering the
lane, but lacked a rally. AMICHE pressed the pace two wide, but yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE tracked two wide,
gained four to three wide around the far turn to take aim on the leader, but flattened out on her left lead while being floated four wide in midstretch.
PLIANTLEA never got involved. POINT WILD failed to make an impact. URSULINA stalked three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.
