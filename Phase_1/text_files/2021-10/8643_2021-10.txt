Footnotes
I'M LISTENING settled nicely in range of the early leaders, raced two wide between foes going by the half mile marker then moved up to challenge for the
lead at the quarter pole, drifted out wider through the lane under right handed pressure and finished well clear. ROCKSTAR GIRL tracked the pace on the
inside, angled out midway around the turn, set down five wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and gained second best. MAHKATO settled through
early stages then took closer order late on the backstretch, advanced to the lead near the three eighths pole, led the way out of the turn then got collared by
the winner in the upper stretch and gave way. ALGODONAL settled in the back although never far back, picked up the pace four wide late on the turn,
sustained a steady bid through the lane and needed more for serious impact. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN applied pace pressure to GUILIA AMMANNATI
through the backstretch then failed to keep pace and faded around the turn. GIULIA AMMANNATI set a pressured pace through the backstretch, got
collared entering the turn and steadily weakened.

backstretch, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, fought back in the upper stretch then came up empty leaving the furlong marker. MIZ THE BEST tracked
the early pace, was ridden along mid-way around the turn, came out wider for the drive and failed to move on. MEJORAMIGA raced off the pace, hustled up

HARD FOUGHT set the pace through the backstretch and held firm around the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, responded, dug in under
strong handling and held on in final strides. ROUGH SEA raced near midpack along the outside, crept up closer racing four wide around the turn then was
set down for the drive, pursued the winner gamely through the lane, was inching up in final strides and just missed. CRAZY KATER tracked the early pace
and raced in close contention around the turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and secured show. POINT DRIVEN broke
awkwardly at the start, settled through early stages and saved ground around the turn, given cue turning for home, came out wider for the drive and lacked
the needed kick for impact. LUCKY RAMSEY raced in range up the inside, headed in pursuit late on the turn, shifted out wide past the eighth pole and had
no late kick. GOLAZO settled between foes in early stages, hustled up four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. WAR STROLL raced in the back
then picked up the pace four wide entering the turn, advanced into contention then failed to keep pace in the lane. WILLING TO SPEED stalked the
pacesetter through the backstretch then had no response when called upon on the turn.

Footnotes
SEMPER FI raced under a snug hold to rate off the embattled duo, tipped out late on the turn then was ridden along three wide into the lane, gained the
advantage in the final furlong and held firm. ALPHA CHI RHO vied outside of ALGEBRAIC for the early lead, battled on two wide past the eighth pole,
fought back when the winner came on to challenge but lacked the needed kick to move on. ALGEBRAIC vied inside of ALPHA CHI RHO for the early lead,
battled on into the final furlong then had no kick left in late reserve. MAGIC MULE raced in the back along the inside and got shuffled back heading into the
turn, shifted out four to five wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. CHAMBO raced off the top two flights, came under a ride on the rail around the
turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to move on. DEGAS was well placed sitting just off the embattled duo through the early going, roused three to
four wide around the turn, had no response then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CONFUSION BABY BOY settled nicely while rated off the second flight in the early going, picked up the pace three wide around the turn, came out four to
five wide into the lane, responded under a left-handed drive, steadily edged up closer then moved by PHANTOM RO under confident handling and finished
clear. PHANTOM RO vied outside of SCOTTSDALE for the early lead, continued to match strides around the turn, shook free in the upper stretch, held
clear on top a furlong out then failed to hold off the winner. COLONIST was reserved and raced in or near the back, was ridden along two wide around the
turn, shifted out at the head of the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure and closed with response. PROUD ENOUGH raced off the early speed,
went three to four wide around the turn, swung out wide for the drive and had a mild improve. BRIAN'S AVENUE was well placed tracking the top pair,
hustled up two to three wide around the turn the flattened out in the lane. ODDS ON was forwardly placed out of the gate then dropped off the early speed,
saved ground into the lane and failed to move on. BLUE DANUBE was well placed sitting just off the top flight, coaxed inside around the turn then
weakened in the lane. SCOTTSDALE vied inside of PHANTOM RO for the early lead, battled on around the turn, stayed on in the upper stretch then came
empty.

Footnotes
GOOD LIFE CIDER rated inside through early stages, picked up the pace on the rail around the turn, tipped out three wide heading into the lane, took over
the lead in the upper stretch, remained game on top under a driving finish and just lasted. SWEET HOME DIXIE tracked the pace through the backstretch,
moved up three wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive, responded under left handed pressure, remained game in pursuit, had aim on GOOD
LIFE CIDER in final strides, was inching up approaching the wire and just missed. WITTY BANTER settled through early stages then picked up the pace
two wide around the turn, stayed on with good response through the lane and secured show. TAYLER'S CHROME stalked the pacesetter through the
backstretch, launched a bid for the leader around the turn, came out wider for the drive then moved back in two wide at the eighth pole and flattened out.
MIT MAZEL set the pace near the inside, held firm around the turn then came out five wide into the stretch, got collared for the lead and gave way.
FOLLOW THE FLAG raced off the early pace, came three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BACKSTREET GAL raced off the pace,
urged along the outside turning for home and failed to move on. FOREVER DREAMING raced wide into the lane and never reached contention. INANNA'S
QUEST lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and never menaced.

JACK OF HEARTS applied pace pressure to REBEL VICTORY through the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn, dug in gamely under strong
handling in the upper stretch, took command, angled inside and pulled away. UNCOMMON VALOR tracked the pace on the inside through early stages,
was ridden along the rail around the turn, shifted out four wide in the upper stretch, finished with response and captured place. REBEL VICTORY set a
pressured pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead with the winner around the turn, could not maintain equal terms in the upper stretch but stayed on
with response then got edged out late for place. SUPER HOUDINI was reserved in the back, swung wide into the lane and improved position.
TIPYOURHATTOTHAT exchanged bumps with FULGURANT after the start then tracked the top two pacesetters, advanced to loom a threat three wide at
the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane then flattened out. FULGURANT exchanged bumped after the start and raced off the early pace, came four
wide into the lane and never threatened. LET US MAKE GOLD raced off the top two flights entering the turn and had no response when called upon.
