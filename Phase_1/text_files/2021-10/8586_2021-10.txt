SWEET SAVAGE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear and towards the inside, then was challenged and briefly passed leaving the turn, then
was sent down and responded well to draw clear in the stretch to prove best under a drive. EMILIA STRONG was settled early and advanced on the inside
on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive, finished well. MIA CALIA chased the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and gained a
short lead leaving the turn, but flattened out in the drive. CAPRICHOSA chased the early pace five wide and was four wide on the turn but lacked the
needed stretch bid. TIME SENSITIVE was off a step slow, then was five wide to the three eighths marker, then dropped down and was between rivals on
the turn, then had no late rally. QUEST FOR JUSTICE chased the early pace four wide and weakened. SUPERSTITIOUS SUE was off slowly and not a
factor.

MAKEMEASAMMICH was away alertly to set the early pace while clear and racing off the rail, drifted out on the turn, came into the stretch in the six path,
remained clear through the stretch to prove best under a drive. SILVER LOCKS chased the early pace three wide, then dropped down to the inside in the
drive and finished willingly but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. SLEEPY N JOYFUL fractious in the gate, then settled early, then was
asked on the turn while on the inside but offered no rally. NIKKIS KITTEN had no rally while having a four wide trip. IVY lacked a rally. MISS SVENGAIL
showed little. ELF'S TUNE had a five wide trip early and stopped.
