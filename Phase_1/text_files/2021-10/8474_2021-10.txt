RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP broke outwardly and bumped at the start, was in a bit tight soon after and switched out, went four to five wide on the turn, struck
the lead in upper stretch, dueled with an inside rival the dug in to fend off the late rally of COST AVERAGE, who was slightly boxed in along the inside
leaving the backstretch and dropped back to last, moved out on the turn, was six wide coming to the quarter pole, rallied but needed more. DESTINY ONE
stalked the early leaders, advanced four then three wide on the turn to make a bid, lost the lead in upper stretch but kept on gamely. FANTASY SUITE
broke inwardly exchanging a bump at the start then moved forward between runners and had minor contact at that juncture, vied outside a foe two wide,
came up empty. NONAME BANDIT broke awkwardly, was bumped and steadied then rushed up inside to vie for the lead, turned up empty. INDIAN
NIGHTS got away alertly, exchanged light contact early, was up close three to four wide and in behind through the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
REAL PENNY broke outwardly, tracked off the leaders, went mostly in the two path on the turn shifting inside a rival near the quarter pole, bid inside in
upper stretch, edged clear late and held well. WARRIORS MARK broke a step slowly, moved forward inside to set the pace facing pressure, came out a bit
to the two path on the turn, fought on in the stretch. READS PET ZENON stalked the early pace from outside, was in contention three to four wide on the
turn, lost ground turning for home but kept on late to miss second. JEEPS STRIDE tossed his head at the start, was forwardly-positioned between runners,
went two to three wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch. CHIPPSTER was within range on the turn going four to five wide but failed to rally.
CHARLIE DYNASTY raced at the rear off the inside, went mostly five to six wide on the turn then shifted in late on that bend, was never near enough to
threaten. RIGHT ON TIME dropped back on the turn while moving out from three to six wide, faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION FINAL TIME WAS
HAND-TIMED.

turn and ran on evenly. WISKEY CROWN exchanged a bump at the start, shifted in from six to four wide near the quarter pole, went evenly. BISCUIT

Footnotes
RIG RIDER was reluctant to load, tracked in behind the leaders inside, steadied slightly entering the turn, made an inside bid in late stretch and held from
several others. ZENFULLY ZESTY pressed the pace from inside a foe racing on or just off the rail through the turn, was just clear in upper stretch, drifted a
bit and just failed. WHERES BRAYDEN stalked the leaders, took closer order four wide on the turn, kept on late but just missed. LEAD MONTEREY was in
tight heading up the backstretch and had to tap on the brakes, switched out at that juncture, went three to four wide on the turn, came out nine wide in the
stretch, rallied but too late. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was up close early, went three to four wide on the turn, began to weaken in the stretch while also in tight
quarters, had no late kick. REAL ME set the pace from outside, going two to three wide on the turn, gave way in the lane. RUNNING FOR GRACE lacked
early speed, went two to three wide on the turn and ran on. QUETZALCOATL failed to threaten after going three to four wide on the turn. TRUEZER chased
mid-pack two to three wide, came up empty.
