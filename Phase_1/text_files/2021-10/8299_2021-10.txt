PASSIONFORTREASURE quickly sprinted out and gained a clear lead through quick fractions, led throughout and remained well clear late under firm
handling. QUICKPAY raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch three wide and was second best. LUCKY TO HAVE ME chased, the winner throughout and
went evenly late. TIZ INDEPENDENCE allowed to settle, failed to menace. POLO PLAYER contended for five eights, then tired in the stretch. SIERRA
DIAMOND had good position early and tired on the far turn. BESTOW was no factor early, dropped back quickly on the far turn and was distanced in the
stretch and walked off.
