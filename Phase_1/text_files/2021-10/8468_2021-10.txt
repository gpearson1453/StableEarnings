Footnotes
WICKED WORKOUT broke sluggishly, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead, was under right
hand urging, closed with a rush and took the lead late. FUNNY ENOUGH sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out late and was no
match for the winner. BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL circled the turn, was four deep turning for home, steadied near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out.
THISMIGHTBETHEONE , three wide chasing the pace on the turn, flattened out between horses and was steadied near the finish when caught in narrow
quarters. AWAY TO RETURN saved ground around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. WINDS OF CAPRI , steadied in traffic leaving the
backstretch, was done in upper stretch. ELEGANTDREAM raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. GOLDEN GLOW was outrun.
HOOSIER ARTIST was outrun. An objection by the rider of THISMIGHTBETHEONE against FUNNY ENOUGH for alleged interference in deep stretch was
not allowed.

Footnotes
ARBUTUS bobbled in behind at the break and was bumped, straightened and edged up off the inside to prompt the pace, went after the leader with an
outside bid leaving the half mile marker, took over into the lane, shook clear past the quarter pole, kept on under right handed rousing and dug in to narrowly
fend off IMAGINE VICTORY. IMAGINE VICTORY , taken to rate while saving ground, moved closer past the three eighths, eased out and worked between
foes near mid stretch, shifted out, kept on grinding, ranged up outside the winner in deep stretch but could not get past. HELLO ROSIE SAY , bumped and
pinched back at the break, was well back early on, came under a ride leaving the far turn, angled four to five wide soon into the lane and closed steadily.
MONIQUES DAREDEVIL bore out at the break and bumped HELLO ROSIE SAY, corrected and stalked under asking while off the rail, moved up to loom
three to four wide in upper stretch, chased outside rivals past mid stretch then hung. WALK IT OUT NANNY cleared early, set the pace towards the inside,
took pressure past the half mile marker, ceded command into the lane then weakened near the furlong grounds. An objection by the rider of HELLO ROSIE
SAY against the winner for alleged interference leaving the gate was not allowed

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE had speed and vied early to the inside of a rival, rated back off the leaders nearing the turn, was attempting to get out a bit mid turn,
was able to be guided down towards the rail and bid in upper stretch, kicked away under hand urging past the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed
asking in the final eighth and held sway. EXTRA MEDIUM rated in mid pack, edged up three wide nearing the turn, dropped in and advanced between foe in
mid stretch then continued gamely to save the place. GET A VALENTINE saved ground and was in range early, drafted back some around the turn,
continued inside through the lane and closed steadily. FLASHINTHENIGHT , four to five wide with pursuit, ranged up outside rivals in mid stretch then
flattened out late. CALL WIL , three wide outside a rival, angled four wide and advanced between foes nearing mid stretch, chased to the sixteenth marker
then faded. FIZBO broke outward then steadied, lagged back, circled four wide into the lane, shifted out wider and had a belated kick. WILD WILLIAM was
sent up outside, pressed three wide outside, remained a factor to mid stretch and faded. KEEPING THE PEACE lacked speed, saved ground into the lane,
swung out and lacked a bid. BIG HAMBONE vied two wide early, met an outside bid and took pressure around the turn, led into the lane then weakened
and drifted past mid stretch. ODDS ON , off the pace, raced two to three wide, was between rivals into the lane and weakened.

VANCE SCHOLARS pulled his way to contention, disputed the pace towards the rail and under firm rating, spurted clear near the three sixteenths and
eagerly pulled away under a steady hand ride. MERCURY TEN , taken to rate inside, edged up while saving ground past the quarter pole, gave willing
chase through the final furlong and was clearly best of the rest. NOT AS LUCKY AS US broke slowly, rushed up between foes early, was hard ridden
towards the inside chasing the leaders, came three wide for the drive and churned on. NIGHT BOSS , four wide making some progress mid turn, angled five
wide and between foes into the stretch, edged up a bit then flattened out. WONDER WATER tracked three wide leaving the far turn, came four wide under a
ride into the lane, failed to kick on, angled in near mid stretch and faded. EPIC RISE vied two to three wide outside the winner, stayed on willingly to the
three sixteenths then weakened. MONEY ROOM broke slowly, pulled his way forward between foes early on, steadied near the far turn, angled out and
came up empty. ICY MINISTER broke a step slow and was outrun. KAZU , four to six wide outside rivals, pursued to the head of the lane then gave way.

DECIDING VOTE , hugged the inner rail around both turns, remained along the rail in upper stretch, eased out to the two path in mid stretch, closed
between horses and led late. STATE CROWN stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and had a mild rally.
POSITIVE DANGER set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. DIXIE CANNON prompted the pace outside POSITIVE DANGER and weakened.
KISS THE GIRL , in the two path entering the stretch, worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. DON'T BLAME JUDY ,
three wide both turns, lacked the needed rally. FIONNBHARR , outside horses in the stretch, passed tired ones. BRAMBLE BAY , shuffled back soon after
the break, swung to the five path turning for home and was no factor. PALM READER , well placed inside horses, weakened in the drive. MAGIC
ELECTION , three wide the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and weakened.

YOUNGEST OF FIVE vied inside a pair of rivals while under a light hold, kicked clear under asking into the lane, opened up and was kept alert with some
left handed asking near mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. WAR TOCSIN , away alertly, disputed the pace between runners, saw the leader get
away soon into the lane but kept on with game chase the earn the place. ALWAYS SUNSHINE , off slow after acting up in the gate, regrouped and moved
up between rivals then guided towards the rail, had aim off the embattled leaders mid turn, got through along the rail in upper stretch but failed to seriously
kick on through the final furlong. TYBALT lacked speed off the rail, was under pressure after a half mile, angled four to five wide for the drive and had some
belated action. MCCAIN stalked two wide behind rivals early on, dropped back a bit after a half mile, was under pressure into the lane and kept on with
some interest. HONOR THE FLEET , three deep pressing the pace, stayed on to upper stretch, failed to kick on under a ride and gave way. ABSENTEE
lagged inside, swung out into the lane but lacked a bid. ARTHUR'S HOPE broke a step slow, edged up four wide early on and stalked, failed to keep pace
past the five sixteenths and weakened.

SIDNEY SUE hugged the inner rail entering the turn, swung three wide approaching the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch and lasted under
urging. TOSS A COIN broke slowly, worked between horses through the stretch and rallied. ZOLA B , four deep on the turn, was well positioned in mid
stretch and flattened out. BROADWAY MELODY lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home and failed to be a menace. TIKTOKNAWAY saved
ground on the turn disputing the pace and gave way. HEART OF SECRETS , in the four path turning for home, failed to rally. BLAZE FINERY , three wide
entering the turn, dropped back on the turn then passed tired horses late. MISS BOSCONOVITCH disputed the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way.
