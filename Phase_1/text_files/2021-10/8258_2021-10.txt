Footnotes
SMITTEN ENOUGH chased the pace racing off the rail around the turn, gained the lead outside LITTLE BOLD BANDIT approaching the eighth pole, drifted
in when clear and lasted. BLOODPROF , steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, raced in the three path between horses turning for home and
rallied. LIFESPAN encountered traffic in upper stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied late. DESHACKLED , along the inner rail around the far turn,
eased out to the two path mid stretch and flattened out. BOONDOGGLE worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. KING SHAWN
came in leaving the starting gate and failed to be a threat. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT sprinted to long lead entering the turn, set the pace along the inner rail
and gave way near the eighth pole. TEMPTING MOMENT , four deep on the turn, weakened. TRUE SHIPMAN was outrun. DAPER'S DRINK was outrun.
An objection by the rider of BLOODPROF against the winner for alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed.

Footnotes
SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS tracked a contested pace while three wide and under confident handling, bid three deep past the five sixteenths, took over
entering the lane, spurted clear under a drive past the eighth pole then held firm. BIRTHDAY WISH broke inward and brushed with a rival, corrected and
rated inside, edged up mid turn, swung four wide into the lane, straightened and closed steadily to gain. MEXICALI ROSE set a pressured pace towards the
rail, ceded command into the lane, battled on past mid stretch then weakened in the final seventy yards. SIMPLE SUGAR , hustled along three to four wide
pursuing the leaders, came up empty through the drive. LOVE DUST , brushed at the break, settled back off the pace while saving some ground, eased out
then back in but failed to muster up a solid kick. SEE THAT GIRL pressed the paced two wide outside the leader, failed to kick on between rivals nearing the
lane and gave way.

Footnotes
TOE CURLIN' KISS , pinched back leaving the starting gate, circled the first turn three wide, was four wide on the far turn, floated to the six path in mid
stretch, closed determinedly outside horses and was up at the wire. CORAL LEGACY stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, was three wide
when commencing a run entering the stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA stalked the pace
racing near the rail, eased out a bit for the drive, moved up to reach a striking position in mid stretch and flattened out. RESIDENT LIBERAL lacked speed,
worked between horses on the far turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. MARYLAND PRIDE raced inside horses under rating down
the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, remained along the inner rail in upper stretch, was forced to alter course when blocked in mid stretch.
PRINCE OF CAPS showed speed along the inner rail, dueled around the far turn and weakened in the drive. KNOCKHOLT , three wide both turns, failed to
menace. MAKE A STAND , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, remained three wide on the far turn and weakened. MINT
GAME was outrun. STRINGFELLA dueled outside PRINCE OF CAPS around the far turn and faltered the final furlong.

Footnotes
WINDRUSH KARMA sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside while handling some pressure, moved clear mid turn, was guided to about the three
path in upper stretch and widened while ridden out. PEARLYVILLE , three wide, moved up after a half mile, pursued four wide into the lane, flattened out
through the final furlong but remained clear of the rest. CELESTIAL DIVA dropped in towards the rail near the five eighths, edged closer near the three
eighths, stayed inside for the drive and churned on. GUAPA CHICA , rated five wide early, advanced four wide mid turn to loom, came six wide for the drive
and faded in the final furlong. BELLATORA broke outward and bumped with a rival, regrouped and settled two wide, edged up past the five sixteenths,
steadied off the heels of a tiring rival soon after, angled out but lacked a serious finish. CAN I EVER lacked speed, angled four wide into the lane but failed
to muster up a legitimate kick. SHE BE A DANCER , taken to rate early, angled six wide and lacked a bid. UNION BETTY , bumped at the break, raced
three to four wide mid turn and failed to menace. C TWO pressed the pace outside the winner, failed to keep up past the five sixteenths, faltered and was
eased late. PEACHY BETWEEN US saved ground giving early chase, dropped back into the turn then swung very wide in upper stretch. KYOSHA lost her
action near the three quarter pole, was pulled up and vanned off.

TIDAL WATERS bumped ZELDABORNE when coming in at the break, showed speed near the inner rail, rated back leaving the backstretch, eased outside
mid way on the turn, swept to command outside TIPSY TOURIST in upper stretch then drew clear. ISLAND PHILO saved ground around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and rallied. ZOLA B lacked speed, raced inside horses throughout and rallied. LOOK WHAT I FOUND , three wide leaving the turn,
swung to the six path in mid stretch and offered a mild rally outside rivals. SUMMER ODDS , four wide on the turn, raced between horses in the drive and
passed tired ones. WRONGFULLY ACCUSED , well positioned on the turn, gave way. ZELDABORNE , pinched back after being bumped at the break,
raced off the rail in the stretch and failed to rally. TIPSY TOURIST sped to the early lead, angled in leaving the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail
and gave way. REAWAKENED , jostled leaving the starting gate, was no factor. EPONINE , wide on the turn, was outrun.

MAGIC ELECTION prompted the pace outside DOUBLE FIREBALL, moved to take that one on past the three eighths, sparred under coaxing into the lane,
wrested command past the eighth pole, kicked clear under strong handling with a sixteenth to go, switched over to her correct lead and held firm. BEAM OF
LIGHT , unhurried early while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, circled four wide in hand into the lane, responded when roused soon after and
closed steadily. DOUBLE FIREBALL cleared into the first turn and dropped in to set the pace, rated kindly through the backstretch run, dug in when
confronted near the five sixteenths, dueled past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. BECKON , under a firm hold early while saving ground and
close up, settled through the backstretch, eased out in the drive and kept trying between rivals. SERENADE A KITTEN angled out into the backstretch and
tracked the pace outside a rival, moved closer past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase in upper stretch but finished evenly. DANCING TIL DUSK , three
wide in mid pack, was under pressure into the lane and only had a mild kick. DANGER ZONE settled off the pace and off the inside, angled well wide for the
drive but lacked a serious run. COLOR CRUSH , off the pace, raced two to three wide under asking into the lane, angled out then lacked some room near
the sixteenth pole. MAUREENLOVESFRANK saved ground and faded. MY CANDY GIRL stumbled soon after the break, dropped off the pace and never
recovered.

CLICK TO CONFIRM , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, was steered outside in upper stretch, her rider briefly dropped his left rein in mid stretch,
swept to command and drew off under urging. I'M GITTIN THERE lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path in upper
stretch and rallied outside foes. BUFF MY BOOTS lightly bumped with SPARKLE SPRINKLE leaving the starting gate, was sent to the early lead, set the
pace along the inner rail and tired the final furlong. CABRA CHICA dropped back on the turn, raced well off the rail in the stretch and passed a pair of tired
foes. NO MORE MASK raced along the inner rail on the turn and weakened in the drive. SPARKLE SPRINKLE lightly bumped with BUFF MY BOOTS
leaving the starting gate, prompted that one around the and to mid stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
EPHEMERAL stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. LOVE MY CAT
lacked speed, circled foes on the far turn, was six deep entering the stretch and rallied. LAUGH IT OFF raced mid pack down the backstretch, was in the
five path turning for home, moved up to the eighth pole and flattened out late. BAY B , in the five path turning for home, passed tired horses. MONSTER
RISING , angled in, raced along the inner rail down the backstretch while stalking the pace and failed to rally. VESPER stalked the pace, was well placed in
the three path on the far turn and weakened. ENGLISH PENNY , no threat, passed tired horses. SILVER AND BLUES was not a factor. SURELY TRUE
was no factor. FAST FASHION showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch, faltered and was eased. LONG DISTANCE LOVE
disputed the pace outside FAST FASHION, faltered and was eased.
