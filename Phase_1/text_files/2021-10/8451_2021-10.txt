Footnotes
TORN JEANS set the pace, continued to gradually edge further away from his pursuers through the far turn and into the lane, shortened stride in the final
sixteenth and drifted out late but ultimately held. GIRLS COUNT tracked the leader two wide through the clubhouse turn, settled back to chase the leading
pair between horses down the back straight, edged forward and tracked the leader in the two path on the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch,
continued to track the leader through midstretch, improved well late despite being carried out by the pacesetter but narrowly missed. MISSEN THE POINT
settled patiently at the rear, chased in the three path on the far turn, improved three wide in upper stretch, and chased on willingly to the wire though no
match for the top two. IMAGINE GOLD chased outside of MI ENLACE through the clubhouse turn, chased the leading pair three wide down the backstretch,
continued to chase the leader in the four path on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and flattened out. COUGER tracked the leader inside of GIRLS
COUNT through the clubhouse turn, was keen to stay in touch with the pacesetter into the backstretch, began to lose ground on the leader in the three path
between horses on the far turn, and continued to weaken in the lane. MI ENLACE raced at the inside of the chasing flight to the five eighths, and weakened
inside from there.

Footnotes
LOUD N PROUD broke readily, gained a position stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, was prompted to press the issue nearing upper
stretch, dueled past the furlong marker and prevailed under firm right handed pressure. DIDDLEY was hustled to the lead while angling inwards, set the
pace into the turn, dueled for command with the eventual winner to midstretch but yielded late. MAY WE ALL tracked just off the first flight a bit off the inside
racing to the turn, tipped out three wide entering the lane while being prompted to advance but couldn't gain terms with the top pair while prevailing for a
share. RENEGADE BOB tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into the lane while being prompted to
advance and was outkicked for a share. FORT RIDGE broke slowly, settled well off the leaders to the turn, displayed some late interest to gain position
between foes leaving midstretch but lost momentum when being steadied out of tight quarters racing past the sixteenth marker. SIRCORRI tracked off the
first flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but faded in late stages. WILLOW RIDGE hopped, then was shuffled back
avoiding close quarters at the start and trailed throughout.

MAGICIAN STONE broke inward and grazed WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW in the opening strides, tracked the leader down the backstretch, drew closer in the
three path on the turn, swept to the leader's side approaching the quarter pole, vied outside him in upper stretch, and drove clear from midstretch.
WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW was reluctant to load, hopped slightly at the break and was bumped between horses, sent to the lead and soon cleared, led in
the two path on the turn, was engaged by MAGICIAN STONE to his outside approaching the quarter pole, vied inside that foe in upper stretch, proved no
match from midstretch, but chased on well enough to hold the place. IZU IZ OR IZU AINT broke out and bumped WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW in the opening
strides, settled at the rear, edged slightly closer in the two to three path on the turn, drove past VITALE and ERUDITE from their inside in upper stretch, kept
on willingly while drifting out mildly and narrowly missed the place. VITALE broke outward, settled second last, chased while saving ground around the turn,
swung out four wide for the drive, and offered no rally. ERUDITE chased just outside of MAGICIAN STONE down the backstretch, chased the leading pair in
the four to five path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAGI tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and wrested a
narrow advantage in time under encouragement. HIGH HERO tracked the leaders between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards on the turn, shifted
out in upper stretch to bid three deep between foes leaving midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while prevailing narrowly for the place honors. TALE
OF THE NILE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued to make mild progress to
late stages. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL, off slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight early, was prompted to advance nearing the lane to split foes in upper
stretch, then continued with interest to gain position inside the leaders while being outkicked for a share. GREELEYS ICE, in touch prompting the pacesetter
in the opening three sixteenths, pressed the issue entering the turn, took over nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum through the last
furlong. STRATE REMARK broke out, making contact with MARCO'S DREAM, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes in second flight
racing to the turn but retreated early. MARCO'S DREAM, bumped, then squeezed back avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled a bit off the inside racing
to the turn and failed to seriously menace. DOM THE BOMB broke sharply, was hustled along the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn,
dueled inside a rival through the bend and gave out abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
SYMBOLIST soon led, was prompted by JIMMIE T from near the three quarters, continued to set a pressured pace inside of JIMMIE T through the far turn,
shook her off into the lane, and drove clear. DOM CAETANO (ARG) soon trailed, began to draw slightly closer past the half mile, kicked on in earnest in the
five path near the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane, and gained with good interest to the finish. MISCHIEVOUS MO chased while saving ground,
swung out five wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive but was caught late for the place. JIMMIE T stumbled in the opening strides, advanced four wide
around the clubhouse turn, prompted outside of SYMBOLIST from near the three quarters, pressed the pace two wide around the far turn, proved no match
for SYMBOLIST into the lane, chased on but was outfinished late. FLORIDA FLASH chased at the rear of the main pack, was urged between horses into
the far turn, offered a mild three wide bid under a drive around that bend, but could not sustain it in the lane. MINISTRY OF ART tracked the leader two wide
on the first turn, tracked the leading pair between horses down the backstretch, chased the leading pair between horses two wide on the turn, flattened
gradually from the three eighths and had nothing further for the drive. WHATA SHOW OFF settled in second last, raced in the three path on the far turn, and
mustered no bid. POWERFUL MAN chased three wide between horses on the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair outside of MINISTRY OF ART down
the back straight, stopped at the seven sixteenths, weakened in the four path, took up while weakening near the five sixteenths as DOM CAETANO came
in, and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
PERFECT DIVA tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, made a steady advance on the pacesetter three deep between foes racing into
upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under energetic handling. SUMMER SHOES, off a step behind the leaders, was guided to the inside
in the opening stages while prompted to a position just off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch, altered course leaving the furlong marker to split
foes bidding inside the leaders and edged rivals for the place honors at the wire. SHARP HERO tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight in the
opening quarter, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner racing four wide through the turn to upper stretch but was outkicked by the
top pair. COLOROFACLOUD was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards
exchanging some contact with JOAN'S WAY nearing upper stretch, then again approaching the furlong marker but continued with interest to improve
position. JOAN'S WAY was rated off the second flight while angling inside nearing the turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch, was bumped nearing
the lane, then again approaching midstretch while racing in close quarters and had no final kick. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY, urged inside rivals disputing the
pace from the outset, shook clear racing into the turn, maintained the advantage to midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. PEYOTE PEGGY
settled well off the leaders racing to the turn and proved no real threat. SAINT J J, urged three wide prompting the pace racing into the turn and gave way
into upper stretch. CREAL SUGAR was urged between foes pressing the pace racing to the turn and emptied out early. HOLD ME GIRL, off slowly, was
settled last outside a rival, was bumped soundly by MIZ TROUBADOUR, then forced wide racing past the five furlong marker and failed to menace
thereafter. GOSHEN GIRL settled outside foes racing through the backstretch and proved no factor. MIZ TROUBADOUR, off awkwardly while getting away
slowly, settled into stride near the inside, veered out sharply racing past the five furlong marker bumping a rival soundly, was taken up nearing the stretch
but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
HUSH Y'ALL tracked the leading pair, continued just behind the leading flight in the three to four path on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane for the
drive, loomed outside of GOOD MONGOLIA from upper stretch, kept fighting under a drive despite being carried out by that foe, drew even in the final
strides and got the nod. GOOD MONGOLIA broke sharply, pressed the pace outside of LOUIE P, took the lead approaching the three eighths while racing
in the three path, raced three wide into upper stretch, drifted out as HUSH Y'ALL encroached outside her in the final furlong, kept battling under a drive but
lost the nod. CHAINMAIL settled near the rear inside of HERO ALEXANDRA early, continued in second last down the backstretch and in the three path on
the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, chased the leading pair under a drive down the lane but proved no match. HERO ALEXANDRA settled two wide
in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn, raced at the rear down the backstretch, lost ground on the rest of the pack while urged in the two path on the far
turn, was driven inside into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. LOUIE P was keen to the lead inside into the clubhouse turn, set the pace while pressured
by GOOD MONGOLIA, was headed by that foe approaching the three eighths, emptied out inside and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
Z U SOON was urged inside foes while getting out racing past the gap, came under right handed pressure disputing the pace inside a rival in the opening
quarter, was eased off the pace to track the pacesetter inside foes racing into the turn, tipped out in upper stretch to bid between foes, then shifted out three
wide nearing midstretch and responded to stout pressure to regain the advantage in time. RIDE RICHIE RIDE, urged between foes forcing the pace racing
through the backstretch, went clear racing into the turn while shifting to the inside, dueled for command inside rivals past midstretch and prevailed for the
place honors while failing to contain the winner. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY, forwardly placed four wide in the opening quarter, made steady progress three deep
on the turn, shifted in to press the pacesetter racing into upper stretch striking the front but was outkicked by the top pair late. FLASHY RICHIE settled well
off the leaders racing to the turn, was fanned six wide entering upper stretch, shifted inwards nearing midstretch to split foes four wide and continued with
interest to gain position to the end. MON AMI FUZZIE threw his at the head starting bumping a rival while breaking awkwardly, was taken up while dropping
out last and never gained contention while passing some tiring foes late. DEMAND RANSOM tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn,
continued four wide on the bend and flattened out in upper stretch. BABA'S BOY, caught in tight quarters along the inside in the opening stages, tracked off
the leaders along the rail and faded into upper stretch. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN, brushed, then caught in close quarters between foes just after the start,
tracked off the leaders between foes and steadily faded nearing the lane. POWER THROUGH, urged three wide between foes pursuing the leaders through
the backstretch into the turn, gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
LION LOVE settled in second last early, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, was urged through horses past the three eighths and
began to improve in the two path, was driven into upper stretch, rallied, took the lead approaching the furlong pole, and held sway under a drive.
DREAMING OF PARIS was keen to lead into the clubhouse turn, continued to set the pace while still keen down the back straight, led in the three path on
the far turn, floated three wide into the lane, saw his lead diminish while drifting out in upper stretch, was headed by LION LOVE inside her approaching the
furlong pole, could not reel her back in but kept on willingly for place. WAY TOO SMARTE chased inside of A FAST BROAD early, settled back toward the
rear down the backstretch, chased five wide around the far turn, ranged up four wide in upper stretch, continued to improve under a drive despite drifting
out, and got up late for the show. A FAST BROAD chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase midpack down the backstretch, edged
closer four wide under a drive through the far turn, turned for home under a drive three wide in range, was close up between the leading pair to midstretch,
but proved no match in the final furlong and lost the show. DARING DAMSEL settled at the rear, was driven six wide toward the rear on the second turn,
came five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. NOCTURNAL MISSION tracked the leader outside of TEMRIK through the clubhouse turn,
continued to track the leader down the backstretch and while positioned three wide on the far turn, was swarmed approaching the quarter pole and driven
between foes into the lane, and weakened. TEMRIK hit the gate at the break, raced keenly while tracking the leader inside of NOCTURNAL MISSION
through the clubhouse turn, continued to pull while tracking the leader into the backstretch, continued to track in range until stopping at the seven sixteenths,
weakened inside and was not persevered with late.
