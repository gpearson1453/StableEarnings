Footnotes
CORKMAN settled off the pace, raced under a tight hold while between horses passing the five-eighths, moved closer at that juncture, drafted in the two
path on the turn, advanced to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the runner-up in the final
furlong and proved best under steady urging. REMEMBERMOM came away in front, contested the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the rail on the turn,
shook clear briefly at the five-sixteenths then was quickly challenged by the winner, came out under urging into the stretch, lost the lead inside the
three-sixteenths, fought on determinedly in the final furlong but missed while in a different zipcode then the third-place finisher. FLIGHT TO PARADISE was
hustled from the start then taken in hand and rated off the pace, went three wide while asked on the turn and came up empty while clearly best of the rest.
DEPUTIES EDGE showed early speed then dropped off the pace, was urged along while inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, angled four
wide outside the quarter-pole, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to respond. NAPOLEON COMPLEX showed early speed, contested the pace
between foes, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and retreated. GREAT GRAND SON was off slow and spotted the
front a couple lengths, rushed up on the outside to contest the pace, dropped back three then four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) showed the way rated along the inside, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug
in under threat through the final furlong and gamely held on to prevail. MR. VINCENT tracked the pace along the inside growing briefly rank under restraint
early on into the backstretch, settled better midway, remained patiently handled until set down spinning four then three wide straightened away into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive threatening through to the finish but was ultimately repelled on the wire. LA HARA (IRE) brushed at the start by RECKLESS
SPIRIT, who broke inwards, settled two to three wide in pursuit under a rating hold, remained on hold until let out angled five wide into upper stretch, kicked
on through the final furlong surging late outside the top pair but missed at the end. FRONT MAN rated two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished in the late stages. RECKLESS
SPIRIT settled unhurried two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to the finish. SOMETHINGTOTELLYOU tracked the pace just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside
for home, kept on under a drive and was outkicked. STANFORD (IRE) stumbled at the start, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun three then two wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

Footnotes
MALIBU LUNA was urged along towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed strongly to
get the lead at the furlong marker then edged clear under steady urging. RED PEPPER GRILL was ridden along off the pace, raced inside to the two path
on the turn, moved out near the furlong marker and finished with good energy to safely secure the place. MAZAL EIGHTEEN showed the way on a clear
advantage, drew off along the rail on the turn, was set down in the two path in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner at the furlong marker and weakened
but was clear for the show. HOLLYWOOD GINA raced just off the pace, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.
SWEETER broke a step slow, was coaxed along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
CHARLOTTE WEBLEY tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on the turn and faltered. MISSION TRAIL showed speed then
dropped just off the pace, raced inside to the two path under urging on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, came
inwards rallying to take command near the eighth pole, then drew clear under a vigorous hand ride to the finish. KING OF HOLLYWOOD broke out at the
start filling the space left vacated by the slow breaking EXCLUSIVE ORDER, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside into the far turn, took
the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while prevailing in the battle for the place honors. WICK LOVES A FIGHT four wide
briefly, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
kept on to the finish but was ultimately bested in the battle for the place honors. PIPITO pulled early on before settling in hand along the inside showing the
way, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole,
then weakened in the late stages. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for
home and weakened. R DOC chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the
drive. EXCLUSIVE ORDER broke a beat slow when lunging slightly and awkward and lost his lane to KING OF HOLLYWOOD, saved ground at the tail of
the field growing detached from the main body, came under coaxing near the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. MADE
TO BE LUCKY broke in at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made
no impact. ASSET TALENT two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NO MORE MISCHIEF broke in and bumped with a foe, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked for her best in upper
stretch, dueled inside the runner-up from that point, was bumped by that opponent at the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under strong urging. PACIFIC
GROVE was well spotted just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, gained three wide into the stretch, made
an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, dueled with the winner, came in under a right-handed crop and bumped that foe at the sixteenth-pole, fought
determinedly to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. NEXT TUESDAY was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a
foe, vied along the rail while still inside that rival on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back outside the furlong marker and weakened
but was clear for the show. LOVE UNLIMITED bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the
turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and was no factor. LUNA FORTUNA tracked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, chased
into the stretch and tired. EXCHANGE ROAD settled on the inside, dropped back while crowded against the rail near the nine-sixteenths then angled out,
chased five wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MEZCAL just off the inside tracking from the front, tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, angled out near the eighth
pole and rallied to issue a challenge taking command inside the sixteenth marker, then edged clear under a stiff hand drive to the wire. BLUE TIMES

bend taking the inside route into upper stretch let out for the drive, shied out slightly under a left handed crop, dug in under threat and was collared just
inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to be along safe for the place honors. SITTING PRETTY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. EXCEPT TEMPTATION chased along the inside patiently handled until roused
cutting the corner into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick. PRUNING tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. PEACEBETHEJOURNEY three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in
pursuit throughout under coaxing from three furlongs out, got taken in hand near the eighth pole as a rival tipped out safely in front and tired. MAYHAP

Footnotes
AUG LUTES broke in and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid just
inside the furlong marker then took the lead and prevailed under strong urging. BAY STORM pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the
turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was overtaken while just able to get the place.
KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into upper stretch, chased
in the final furlong, pursued the winner willingly into the final sixteenth, had the rider lose his crop late and just missed second while narrowly able to get the
show. INVINCIBLE GAL (GB) broke out and bumped with an opponent, was rated in front half of the field, went around the turn a bit off the inside, was
asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and just missed the show. ALWAYZ LATE settled towards the rear of the field, went two to
three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. MISS DRACARYS took an awkward stride and was taken up some
outside the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, approached the quarter-pole under restraint, was roused in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. ADELAIDE MISS was hustled from the start then moved out early, established a nice position in third, chased
three wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. POR QUE NO settled off the pace, was roused in the three path on
the turn and failed to rally. HONEY PANTS was last to commence, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. CALDEE was hustled
from the start, set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths and gave way. ORBS
BABY GIRL broke a bit awkwardly, settled off the pace, dropped back while traveling a bit awkwardly around the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn
and failed to respond.

PATTY H coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the two path under some pressure from EASY TO BLESS to the outside, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drifted out edging clear to the eighth pole and was
corrected, then continued to drift out to the finish while holding well to the end. ROYAL MEGHAN three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick. EASY TO BLESS coaxed from the
gate, prompted the pace of PATTY H from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three then two wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WHISPERING PINES four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
to six wide into upper stretch and came up empty. UNION GABLES bobbled at the break, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
