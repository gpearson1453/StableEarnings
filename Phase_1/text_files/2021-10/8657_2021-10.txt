path through the turn, bid outside the leader and flattened out. SOLAR GIRL mid pack and three wide, angled to the two path through the turn, then
weakened in the lane. MIAMI SOUVENIRS broke out, exchanging bumps at the start and was no factor. POLITICAL ASTRAY broke in at the start,

stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten
and held the place. TREVESS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then closed well late and
missed the place. LET'S BE HONEST well placed and between, gained position two and three wide through the turn, drifted out into the stretch and evened.
BARGAINAIRE allowed to settle, moved up outside into the turn, looped four wide through the turn and had no stretch rally. NURSE JUDY was never
involved and drifted out through the stretch.

Footnotes
MANNIX (IRE) mid pack and inside, angled out and looped quickly four wide through the second turn, gaining the lead into the stretch, then drew off and
was kept to the task. GRAND DAVID bobbled at the start, sprinted clear, held sway to the stretch, then stayed on and held the place, while no threat to the
winner. PIONEER OF MEDINA mid pack and inside, angled out and moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and
had a mild late gain. T VILLE mid pack and outside, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out, gaining a
share. BELOVED WARRIOR allowed to settle, looped five wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, drifted in slightly and weakened.
IMPETUOUS SOUL four wide through the first turn, gained a stalking position into the second, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened.
TEPPER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded. ASTRAL RIDE well placed and between, saved ground on the
two path through the second turn, loosing some ground, then had no stretch rally. GRABBING THE MONEY was no factor. VLADISLAV showed little.
MACHINEGUNPREACHER broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved.

Footnotes
QUEEN DOMINA bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside, shook clear quickly, drifted out into the stretch carrying rivals, then drew off and was kept
to the task. LUNAR BLAST broke in, bumping at the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out and was carried out by the leader,
then could not threaten that one, while clearly best of the rest. LYRICAL stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through
the turn, was carried out into the stretch by the leader and flattened. GINGERONMYMIND never far back, came widest into the stretch and faded. BEARS
BREECHES was never involved.

UNBRIDLED CHROME allowed to settle, waited for room on heels into the turn, was steered out a bit greenly three and four wide a quarter-mile out, drifted
out to the five path into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. BELLA MIURA hopped at the start, looped to position three and four wide through
the turn, bid four wide into the lane, took command, then was no match for the winner late. PLAYA INCLUSION broke in at the start, tracked the pace,
saving ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and flattened out. TITANIC ROSE well placed
and outside, looped three wide through the turn, gained a short lead into the stretch, then weakened and held a share. ALEIDA broke out, bumping at the
start, set the pace inside and weakened in the stretch. SHE IS ROYALTY fractious in the gate, passed tiring rivals. MOSA MIA well placed and inside,
steadily lost ground. RACHEL DREAM well placed and three wide, faded through the turn. TIZ NENA broke sharply from the gate to stalk the pace, gained a

Footnotes
RAPTUROUS rated back in the early going, angled out from the two path through the turn, exchanged bumps three wide with WOW TAPIT, angled out
further in the stretch, made a steady gain while appearing to try to lug in and was up late. KIT KELLER set the pace off the rail, angled in to save ground
through the turn, dueled with LAST LEAF through the lane, holding that one off, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. LAST LEAF well
placed, angled out and gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled with the leader and hung. JACKKNIFE stalked the
pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader, then could not stay with that one, drifted in and weakened. WOW
TAPIT allowed to settle, angled out and looped up three and four wide through the turn, exchanged bumps with RAPTUROUS nearing the lane, fell,
immediately regained his feet, was soon apprehended by the outrider and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQURY INTO THE RACE RESULTED IN NO
CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

gain and edged up in the final strides. DILIGENT mid pack and inside, raced boxed through the second turn, waited, got through inside, gained a short lead
and was outfinished. FAMOUS GENT well placed and outside, held position three through the second turn, bid on that path and flattened out. PAPA
HONOR never far back, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened. DREAM LINER (BRZ)
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. INDY LYON sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start, turned back a challenge into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late. NEW YORK STYLE well placed, saved ground on the two
path through the second turn, gained position outside the leader, then faded the final furlong. MR. AXEL was no factor. STUNNING BABY was never
involved.

Footnotes
RAIN tracked the pace, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
drove clear late. SHE TAKES HEART set the pace on the inside, drew off through the turn, then was no match late and held the place. NATIONALIST well
placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. READY ORB NOT allowed to settle,
saved ground into the turn, angled four wide to the stretch and got up for a share. GRACE'S DRAMA allowed to settle, moved to position three wide through
the turn, bid on that path, drifted in and weakened. LADY FIORELLA ran evenly. JOST SAYIN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside and improved position. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was no factor. MIGHTY ELECTRICA stalked the pace on the outside, angled in into the turn
and faded. DANA GRACE mid pack and outside, faded widest through the turn.
