TAPTIME trailed the field early on from the inside, was in the three path into the lane, took over command down the lane then drew away late and was
geared down in the final stages. KATIE'S BELLE pressed the pace early, raced in the three path along the first turn, was in the two path into the lane and no
match for the winner in the stretch run. BEYOND A MILLION stalked the pace early, raced in the four path along the first turn, was on the inside into the lane
and weakened late in the stretch drive. ITALIAN TWIN raced in the two path along the first turn and set the early pace, was bearing out a bit down the
backstretch then blew the far turn and faltered down the lane.

IGNITIS chased under steady urging two wide from midpack, shifted outside of the leading pair while inching closer turning for home, ranged up to those
rivals in upper stretch, and drew off approaching the furlong grounds. ALMANZO pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home as IGNITIS
got closer, vied between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked by that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and kept on to prove second best.
MALIBU MIKE lied off of the pace in the two path, split foes two wide entering the lane, and improved to reach show approaching the wire. LAKE TAHOE
set the pace inside of a pressing ALMANZO, got headed by that foe turning for home, then gave way inside of that foe and a bidding IGNITIS in upper
stretch, and lost show late. MR. YASUDA broke slowly, lied far off of the pace in the three path into the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and moved
up. OILER tracked in midpack four wide, then tired through the lane. CLOUD CREEK failed to factor. KING DOODLE lied close up three wide early on,
stalked into the turn, but faded around the bend. UNDERDRESSED tracked along the inside around the turn, then weakened turning for home. ALL
CHOKED UP broke a step slowly, and was outrun. LAKE TAHOE RACED UNDER THE NAME GRUDEN.

Footnotes
FLANIGAN'S COVE stalked along the inside, shifted three wide leaving the three furlong grounds for clear sailing, took aim on a clear ENGLISH
TREASURE approaching the furlong marker while exchanging brushes with an inner FAST AS FLIGHT, outkicked that foe and ranged up to the leader
passing the furlong pole, dueled a sixteenth from home, and edged ahead late. ENGLISH TREASURE set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes into the
first turn, cleared off entering the backstretch, showed the way in hand around the far turn, shifted outwards subtly at the furlong pole causing FAST AS
FLIGHT to shy, dug in passing that marker as FLANIGAN'S COVE menaced, gamely dueled with that rival into the final sixteenth, but was bested. BELLA
CONCHITA tracked two wide, shifted four wide around the far turn, and chased the leaders through the lane. PALAMOS (GB) settled far off of the pace
along the inside, shifted four wide into the far turn, then stayed on while lugging inwards on her left lead through the lane. FAST AS FLIGHT vied three wide
into the first turn, took back to stalk around that bend, shifted down two wide passing the three furlong pole, came into the lane between horses, exchanged
brushes with her outer counterpart approaching midstretch before shying from her inner drifting foe at the furlong grounds, steadied mildly, and gave way.
MISS TULSA tracked along the inside, pulled in the bit into the backstretch, left the rail entering the lane, then shifted in and chased through the lane.
TRICK HAT trailed, took the far turn four wide, and stayed on. DIBBLE DIBBLE saved ground far off of the pace, and failed to menace. WICKED INTENT
was last away and never got involved. FLEETING GLIMPSE prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, and weakened through
the lane. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS lied off of the pace three wide, came under all out pressure into the far turn, then weakened around it. THE RIDER OF
FAST AS FLIGHT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FLANIGAN'S COVE FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT IT WAS
DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane as MILLIKEN gave chase, dug in gamely as that foe bid inside the final furlong, and
tenaciously held to the wire. MILLIKEN stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader to take dead aim, steadily grinded away at that foe's
advantage in midstretch, sustained his determined charge late, but was denied. NOTARY trailed, saved ground around the bend, gained along the rail
before tipping three wide at the furlong grounds, and moved up. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE bobbled slightly at the start, lied off of the pace, shifted three
wide into the turn, then six wide turning for home, and stayed on. TULANE TRYST prompted the pace two wide, but weakened at the quarter pole.
GRANDEUR tracked from midpack along the inside, then chased through the lane without threatening. SIMOVITCH tracked from midpack four wide, and
weakened. BEARS WATCHING lied off of the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS stalked
three wide, then weakened entering the lane. SPANKHURST stumbled at the start, got caught five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and was done
early.

Footnotes
MALTHAEL bobbled slightly before bumping with foes on both sides at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, tracked while gaining and shifting three to
four wide around the far turn, hung on her left lead while chasing CIBOLIAN through upper stretch after that foe made first run, but changed leads at the
furlong pole, surged to edge an advantage leaving that marker, dueled as that foe sustained the battle through the late stages, and held. CIBOLIAN tracked
from the inside, shifted two wide turning into the lane for the first time, then four wide into the third turn, gained while tucking three wide around that bend,
bid for the lead in upper stretch, led passing the three sixteenths pole as MALTHALE ranged up, but hung on her left lead, was headed passing the furlong
pole, fought on thereafter, but failed to regain even terms. MUD PIE settled at the rear two wide, gained four wide around the far turn before shifting five
wide entering the lane, then rallied to take aim on the leading pair in the final furlong, and chased them home while narrowing the gap. CHEYENNE'S
COLONEL bobbled before being squeezed between horses at the start, but was not costed positioning, lied off of the pace three wide around the first turn,
then stayed on through the lane for a minor share. BIG BUZZ set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way. FANTASIOSO
(ARG) stumbled at the start but was not costed early positioning, settled at the rear inside, shifted two wide into the final bend, then four wide entering the
lane, and moved up without threatening. HUGE BIGLY stalked along the inside, was forced to pause and got minorly shuffled behind a tiring ARTEMUS
EAGLE entering the lane, then lacked a rally thereafter, and faded. INTRADAY (BRZ) broke out and bumped a foe at the start, saved ground from midpack
early on, but faded into the far turn. ARTEMUS EAGLE bumped an inner foe at the start, recovered into the first turn to prompt the pace setter from the
outside, but chased that foe around the final turn, and weakened entering the lane. HIGHESTDISTINCTION took a bump from an inner foe at the start,
stalked two wide, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
FLORIS prompted the pace three wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off in upper stretch. MY CORALENA tracked from midpack in the two path,
shifted four to five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach place on the wire. BIT O BODIE stalked four wide, bid entering the lane, but quickly proved
no match for the leader in upper stretch, chased thereafter, but was nailed on the wire for place. WINZE lied off of the pace four wide, veered in in upper
stretch while picking up stride, then stayed on between horses late. CHA CHA MISSION took a solid bump to her hind quarters a few strides out of the gate,
lost action and multiple lengths of position, then saved ground at the rear of the field and improved along the rail through the lane. FLIRTATIOUS KITTY
broke inwardly and bumped a rival into other foes, vied two wide and between horses, but yielded to outer foes turning for home. PALACE MAGIC required
a shoe repair in the paddock, then shied from an outer foe into an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack three wide, tipped five wide entering the lane, and
failed to factor. MAGIC LAMP was bumped by an outer foe before slamming into an inner rival at the start, then lied off of the pace along the inside, and
failed to factor. AMERICAIN BOURNE was outrun. AS YOU WERE set the pace, but was headed by a pair of foes into the turn, and weakened turning for
home.
