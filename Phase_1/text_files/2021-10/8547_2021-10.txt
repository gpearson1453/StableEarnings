was steadily encouraged through the lane and just lasted. COMBINATION gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail, was carried outward nearing the

off the pace, improved at the rail on the turn then dug in through the lane to finish evenly in third. FIX ME A SANDWICH became fractious and unseated his
rider in the gate, chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, angled out toward the head of the lane and finished evenly; widest. BULL SHARK
chased and rounded the turn off the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. BARNSTORM gave only distant chase and rounded the turn off the rail.

Footnotes
GRECIAN ADMIRAL stalked from the three path then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at near even terms from the five sixteenths and took the
nod two deep approaching the top of the lane, dug in determinedly through the stretch and edged clear the final yards. J J WEDGIT MAN stalked two deep
then took the lead past the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms leaving the five sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the rail toward the top of the
lane but dug in gamely to late stretch before relenting the final yards. EXPLOITATION rated close inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened the final furlong. HARD BEING ME settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. MELTECH rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the five path on the far turn and showed little more. BRILLIANT IDEAS rounded the opening turn in
the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. OWL RUN broke outward to make light contact with D Tachyon, saved ground on the
opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. FOREFRONT set the early pace inside, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and gave
chase from that point but weakened at the rail into the far turn. D TACHYON was bumped at the break and settled off the pace in the two and three paths,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
ANOTHER VICTORY was carried to the five path into the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took
the nod four wide approaching the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to inch clear of SUBSTANTIAL, who angled out into the first turn and left the turn
toward the outside, challenged three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole and dug in gamely to late stretch before relenting later yards. FU MAN SUE raced
close two deep early but dropped back from between horses midway on the opening turn, recovered stride to bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled
at mostly even terms, was overcome leaving the turn but continued to duel for third. RUSH TO THE CASTLE stalked from the three path, took a slim lead at
the nine sixteenths pole, was met past the three eighths, continued a close factor at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the stretch duel for third. COZZE
CAT became a bit anxious in the gate then set the early pace inside, was caught leaving the nine sixteenths pole and weakened past the three eighths.
SILVER TAURUS saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
JESSICA settled off the pace and off the rail the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily
progressed in the three path of the far turn, closed to the lead later yards and inched further ahead of TALKTHETALK nearing the wire, while the latter
settled in the three path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead nearing the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and
was steadily encouraged through the lane, but was caught later yards and flattened stride nearing the wire. AWESOME ALANA raced in the five path the
first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid approaching the quarter pole, improved off the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path into the lane and
finished evenly while gaining on the top two. BODES SUNSET rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled outside into the backstretch, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path, passed some rivals in the lane then flattened later yards. NANCYSAIDSO
stalked off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn but lost some ground into the lane and flattened stride.
HOSS KITTEN saved ground into the first turn and raced well back toward mid track, angled in nearing the far turn, angled back out through the turn,
entered the stretch about the four path and showed little more. GLORIOUS MYSTERY steadied at the rail into the first turn, raced blocked through the turn
and showed little response down the backstretch. COME AND GET IT rated off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded
at the rail into the far turn. JIMMYSEXTRAGIRL took the lead leaving the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the quarter, showed no further response and was eased inside the eighth pole, pulled up lame and was vanned
off.
