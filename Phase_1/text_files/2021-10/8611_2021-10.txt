and finished well to just get up under strong handling. BAKENEKO was under a firm hold early on, raced along the inside around the far turn through lane
and finished gamely while racing near the rail to just miss. DESERT COWBOY hesitated at the break, settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near
the quarter pole and made a good late gain. UNORTHODOX was slow early on, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late.
SPANISH SEA stalked the early pace from the outside, was ridden along near the three eighths pole, raced three wide in the drive and weakened a bit late.
BALLYHOO PRINCE showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BADGER TOOTH raced four wide nearing the
seven eighths pole, was four wide backstretch, raced in tight quarters near the eighth pole and had no late rally. MR. MOSLEY tracked the leader while
racing two wide and gave way. EMPHASIZE raced four wide around the far turn and had no response. CALL IT LOVE fractious in the gate, was rank,

Footnotes
TYREEK was rated down the backstretch, moved up two to three wide in the drive and prevailed under strong handling. CRYING FOR MORE showed good
early speed from the outside to set the early pace, raced near the rail around the far turn into the lane, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. JUST
PICK ONE stalked the early pace, shifted out to the four to five path and finished gamely to the wire. ZIP THE LIP stalked the top pair down the backstretch,
raced along the inside around the far turn and had note enough for the top trio. CHARLIE POTATOES was unhurried early early, raced four deep through
the far turn and had no late rally. STAND MY GROUND was slow early on, raced five wide around the far turn and had no final response. DAPER'S DRINK
stalked the early pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no response. TRUE SHIPMAN dropped back early on, raced five wide nearing the
quarter marker and never was a factor.

Footnotes
CAN THE QUEEN broke in, stalked from the outside, steadied nearing the half mile pole, angled five wide and finished well late to get up under steady
handling. WHISKEY AND RYE stalked the pace from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn, held a clear lead inside the eighth pole but was wore
down late to finish second best. ELLANATION was jostled at the break, settled to the middle of the pack early, raced five deep into the upper lane and
slowly closed in. FIFTEEN ROYALS was bumped at the break, angled five to six wide and showed good late interest. AVA O was forwardly placed to lay up
close early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY was hustled to set the pace from the outside
and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ROSELBA broke to the outside, checked near the half mile pole and had no rally. OLIVE KAT was shuffled back
around the far turn and never was a serious factor. FLYINGONTHEGROUND waited near the three eighths pole while racing between rivals, raced three
wide nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. MUMBAI raced up close early on and faded. WHISPURRING KITTEN was in tight at the break, raced
along the inside around the far turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
COMMANDEER was rated while racing three wide down the backstretch, continued to race three wide in the stretch run, dug in and edged clear late under
strong pressure. BENANDJOE showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside, was over taken by Commander near the eighth pole, dug in
and held the place position late. BIG VENEZUELA stalked the early pace, waited nearing the quarter pole, experienced traffic near the three sixteenths pole,
angled out and finished willingly to the wire. LIDSTROM dropped back early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive.
TITAN'S WILL pressed the early pace while racing between rivals, raced in the two path and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FRIENDLY FELLA stalked
the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. SASSY KING was slow early,
raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
MY CANDY GIRL stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide around the far turn, dug in late while racing well off the inside and
prevailed under strong pressure. AWESOME JAZZ was off slowly, settled off the early pace, angled six to seven wide through the lane and closed in well
late. COLOR CRUSH was bumped at the break, raced along the inside around the far turn, split rivals near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire while
racing near the inside. SERENADE A KITTEN was bumped at the break, moved up five to six wide and showed good late interest. INDIAN NICHOLS
stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and finished evenly. DOUBLE HAPPINESS was slow in the early stages, raced six wide near
the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. BECKON was coaxed along to lay up close early and faded while racing three wide. DOUBLE
FIREBALL pressed early on and gave way. NO DOWN DAYS broke in, stalked the top trio early, raced four deep near the quarter pole and had no
response. DANCING TIL DUSK settled off the early going, raced three wide around the far turn and never was a factor.
