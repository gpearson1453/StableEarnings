Footnotes
LUCKY STREAK broke in front, angled in nearing the first turn causing a chain reaction of rivals being squeezed to his inside, set all the pace and
maintained his advantage under brisk handling. JUST TAPIT IN unhurried early, rallied late in the four path and finished second best. RIDGE WEST bore in
at the start bumping rivals, was forced inward nearing the first turn, stalked the pace along the inside into the far turn, loomed boldly two wide nearing the
quarter pole then was outfinished. KISSINGER failed to menace. JIMTOWN well placed, failed to respond. GOLDEN AFLEET pressed the pace two wide
for nearly six furlongs then weakened. BISCUITS AND GRITS was bumped and squeezed between rivals at the start, forced inward nearing the fifteen
sixteenths pole, had his heels clipped then was through after a half. INSPIRED TO ROCK was shut off along the rail nearing the fifteen sixteenths pole
causing him to clip heels, stumbled and nearly unseat his rider then jogged around the racetrack while never in contact with his field. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED LUCKY STREAK FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE FIRST TURN AND
PLACED HIM LAST.

alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then faltered in the final furlong. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY bumped at the start and was no

Footnotes
LONESOME PHIL broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch under right handed urging and lasted under
strong handling. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER stalked the pace into the stretch and was steadily gaining ground two wide in a determined effort. PERFECT
SENSE unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the six path. EXONERATED PREZ allowed to settle, finished with good courage along the
rail. SIN CITY SLICK passed tiring rivals. JOE COOL chased the winner down the backstretch, loomed boldly two wide nearing the quarter pole, had speed
into the stretch then came up empty. GOOSE DOWN GREY had good early speed then faded. STOP MAKING SENSE had brief speed. BO RHAPSODY
was no threat. GET ALONG was a sharp threat along the inside into the turn then flattened out.

Footnotes
THE TWO NANCY'S vied for the lead along the rail, slipped through in upper stretch to make the lead then widened under left handed urging to win as
much the best. CHARGAREE never far back, altered course from the five path to the rail in upper stretch, rallied determinedly and got up for second. JILLY
FROM JERSEY away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished. HOBOKEN HUSTLE had speed from the start, loomed boldly three
and four wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. BLACK BUTTE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and faded late. CHAMPAGNE BLING
failed to menace. TURING MACHINE was through after a half. FRIDAY was no threat. CHANCE OF FROST trailed.
