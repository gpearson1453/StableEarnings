SALTY NUGGET raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away late. AT U LOVER
dueled for the lead from between foes, responded when challenged by the winner with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late.
STARACROSSTHEWATER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out and finished with good
courage. SHE FLYS FOREVER was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. BRITE LILY was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the leaders nearing the eighth pole and gave way late. LOVE U L C lagged throughout.

Footnotes
SWISS SCRIPT was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SHENANDOAH STAR, vied with that rival and was taken on by HYPHY before
going a half, held gamely in the drive and edged away late. SHENANDOAH STAR disputed the pace from between foes with the winner but could not get by
that foe in the drive. HYPHY broke sharply to press the pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the quarter and
failed to gain late. LIZETTA was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a striking position but lacked the needed closing response.
PENNY JOE showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. LIBERTY FLIES hopped at the start, lacked early
foot and did not offer a bid.

EL MAESTRO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with something left. STONUS MAXIMUS chased
the winner while racing three-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. DANCE BALLERINA raced five-wide through the
first turn, raced unhurried early, lacked racing room approaching the stretch and finished willingly when clear. NEUMEISTER was forwardly placed early,
raced from off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was carried out through the first turn, raced four-wide through
the second turn and did not reach contention. BETE ROUGE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
LUCINDA RELLA raced off the pacesetters early, drifted out through the first turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS stalked the pace of TURNAROUND while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew off
as a handy winner. TURNAROUND broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin after going a half, remained in control into the final
quarter and yielded to the winner. TRASK was away in good order to press the pace of TURNAROUND for the opening quarter, remained in a contending
position throughout and failed to gain in the drive. PULPITS POWER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late
run. MUSKET POWDER was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. MOONLIGHT BLUE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the fourth turn and weakened. PERFECT COME BACK broke in the air and did not compete thereafter.

PACKRAT BRANT lacked early speed, advanced five-wide to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole, vied and was up. RUNNIN' SERAGHINI was reserved just
off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with the winner but could not match strides with that rival late. GABBY TOM
settled off the leaders from off the rail, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late energy. HE'S BANDIDO was away in good order to
dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way late. COASTING NOW broke sharply to duel for the early advantage from between foes and gave
way after going a half. LONGFORD was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. JHAWK FLYER vied for
the lead from the inside for the opening quarter and weakened.

Footnotes
SPEEDY TOM was carried out through the first turn, dueled for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker
and held off the closing PREMIER LEAGUE late. PREMIER LEAGUE lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was gaining on the
winner late. MOBJACK was carried out through the first turn, pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. NORTH OF
THORP settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some late run.
SPARKLING STARR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late.
KEEN JAMES was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MISTER G. Q. clipped heels nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. LORD VADER lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a
bid. MR. ATLANTICO set a pressured pace, drifted out through the first turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.
