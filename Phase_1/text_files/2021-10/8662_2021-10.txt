VOOM pressed the pace from outside, took a short lead at the eighth pole, led into the final sixteenth and got outkicked by the winner. AVENTAPP sped to
the front from inside, set the pace with company alongside, held a short lead through the turn and into the stretch, lost command with an eighth of a mile
remaining but stayed on well from inside for a game third. BOWL OF CHERRIES got bumped from outside at the start, chased two wide around the bend,
moved out in the stretch and gained ground on the top trio late. MAGICAL WAND tracked outside a rival or off the rail, went four then three wide around the
turn and failed to menace. BIG STRIKE off a bit slow to begin the got bumped soon after, raced along the inside then steered out and came four wide into
the stretch but failed to menace. AIR FORCE WOMAN off slow to start, raced outside a rival then shifted inward near the quarter pole, traveled a bit off the
rail into the stretch and could not rally. CAL ROUGH shifted in and bumped rival at the start, settled on the inside, lost ground through the turn and
weakened. STRIKING TIGRESS broke in and bumped rival at the start, was rank through the early stages, took the turn three wide, drifted in through the
lane and was not a factor.

BRISTOL BAYOU vied three deep early then dueled leaving the backstretch, cleared around the turn, drew off under mild urging and ridden out to the wire.
FULL OF GRACE away quickly then vied between rivals for the lead, could not keep pace and chased the top pair past the half-mile pole, traveled along the
inside then asked two wide on the turn, could not threaten then winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. COVER VERSION off slow from
outside, angled to the inside, steered out and came three wide into the stretch and was along for the show. SADIE BLUEGRASS brushed the gate then got
bothered leaving the gate, taken out into the clear by the rider early, advanced around the turn and was closest in pursuit three wide into the stretch, then
flattened out in the lane. MISS ALEGRIA broke in a bit at the start, went up to vie with a pair of rivals from inside then dueled with COVER VERSION leaving
the backstretch, lost contact with that rival at the three-eighths and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
AWAKE AT MIDNYTE bobbled at the start but still came away quickly, pressed the pace from outside, dueled in the stretch and dug in late to outkick the
runner-up. ADARE MANOR off a bit slow from inside, hustled early and went up to take control and set a pressured pace, held a short lead to the lane,
dueled with AWAKE AT MIDNYTE in the final furlong, fought gamely to the wire but came up a bit short. UNDER THE STARS tracked from outside early on,
went four wide around the turn, kept to task through the drive, closed well and kept gaining on the top pair to the wire. MUY CHISTOSA broke well and
attended the pace three deep to the turn, could not match strides around the turn and chased three wide exiting the bend and flattened out. MISS
EVERYTHING off slow and broke in a bit, went up to chase from inside, traveled a bit off the rail leaving the bend and weakened. HOT TEA trailed early,
raced four to five wide around the turn and failed to menace. A PAYCHEQUE SMILE chased between foes, was in traffic and crowded at the
seven-sixteenths pole, came out into the stretch and tired. BUTTERFLY BARB hard to load prior to the start, chased off rail then between rivals to the turn,
dropped back around the bend and raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

turn, bid between at the eight pole, took a short lead nearing the sixteenth pole and got outkicked by the winner. BRIX stumbled at the start then came in
and bumped a rival soon after, chased between then outside rivals, angled four wide leaving the turn, rallied and got outkicked by the top pair. LIAR LIAR

mild rally. JOHNNY PODRES off a bit slow to start, traveled four deep near the front, bumped between rivals into the turn, continued four deep through the
bend, came in and impeded rivals in upper stretch, bid three deep at the eighth pole and faltered late. SLY up close early five deep, got pinched between

Footnotes
B'ESAME ME MUCHO coaxed early from the gate, dueled briefly then ceded the lead on the first turn, went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, dueled
around the far turn, took over past the quarter pole and drew away. MEDUSA'S GAZE stalked the pacesetter off the rail, chased two wide into the stretch,
could not summon the needed rally but finished a clear second. QUEEN OF LOVE sent for the lead from outside, vied with a rival then cleared on the first
turn, gained company in middle stages, dueled around the second bend, then flattened to third in the stretch run. DYNAMITE QUEEN pulled a bit early and
had to angled out then back in on the first turn, stalked from inside to the far turn, driven along the rail into the stretch and lacked a late bid. ARISTEIA went
three then four wide around the first turn, tracked outside rival then came three wide into the lane and weakened. WINTER STAR was rank early, went
between foes on the first turn, two to three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. SLEW SOUTH unhurried on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and
never threatened. PORTUGUESEPRINCESS went two to three wide then got shuffled between on the first turn, exited the far turn three wide and failed to
menace. DUAL REALITY off a bit slow to begin, lagged behind early, raced near the inside, came out leaving the first turn, went outside rivals on the
backstretch, came four wide into the lane, tired and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CLAMPETT stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, angled outside the top pair in the lane, rallied three deep and drove clear late. TOWN BOY chased
off the rail, bid outside leaving the backstretch, lost contact with the leader around the bend, re-bid in midstretch, led briefly late but was overtaken by the
winner. CON ON THE RUN sped clear to take control, gained pressure leaving the backstretch, cleared again on the turn, held command into the furlong
grounds, challenged from a pair of rivals and yielded late. HANDY DANDY broke well from outside, ducked in nearing the five-eighths pole, chased outside
the top pair, navigated the turn four then three wide and weakened. COMMISSIONER DAVID sat well off the pace in the early going, raced two wide then
angled to the rail on the turn and failed to menace. MAD STEVEN tracked off the rail, three then two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MISSING
MAURICE off slow to begin then lugged out soon after, moved back to the inside then entered the stretch two wide and never got involved. AFTER THE
CANDY got impeded early by rival swerving inward and lost action, traveled five wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and could not rally.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT EVEN THOUGH HANDY DANDY SWERVED IN AND IMPEDED AFTER THE CANDY
EARLY, IT DID NOT COST THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

the lead from inside, dueled down the hill with MAC DADDY TOO, vied with rivals to midstretch, was no match for the winner in the late stages but stayed
on to hold the place and got bumped nearing the wire. MAC DADDY TOO dueled for the lead from outside, vied with rivals to midstretch and got edged for
the place. VANTASTIC off slow and got bumped inward at the start, waited for room briefly crossing the turn, got put in tight quarters at the three-sixteenths
pole, tried to rally but lacked room late then tried to squeeze through an opening in the closing moments and bumped rival near the wire. COTOPAXI (IRE)
stalked three deep early then outside a rival on the hill, got floated out entering the stretch and lacked a late bid. GO ON traveled in mid-pack early on, raced
two to three wide around the turn, shifted in at the three-sixteenth pole and lacked room to advance late. SNAZZY DRESSER stalked off the rail then moved
inside for the turn and weakened down the lane. CUMBERLAND AVENUE was off slow and bumped inner rival at the start, trailed down the hill and was

Footnotes
SUBCONSCIOUS stalked the pacesetter in the two path, bid outside on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch, inched away and
remained strong to the wire under right-handed urging. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) tossed his head and hopped slightly before losing his path at the start, angled
to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and rallied for the place honors. BEYOND BRILLIANT raced near middle portion of the track
first time through the stretch then angled to the three path nearing the first turn, remained off the rail through the middle stages, took aim three wide around
the far turn but finished evenly in the late stages. HUDSON RIDGE unhurried in the beginning, went two to three wide around the first turn, three to four
wide on the second bend and kept on to round on the superfecta. FLASHIEST broke slow and inward, steadied off heels on the first turn, sat off the pace
near the back of the pack, went two wide into the second turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and summoned a mild response. ZOFFARELLI (IRE)
stalked along the inside, angled three wide leaving the second bend, lacked room behind rivals from upper to midstretch, then kept on when finding room
between rivals late. JUNGLE CRY stumbled leaving the gate, steered down to the two path early, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, moved out to the two
path on the far turn, tipped out a bit further in the lane and flattened. NONE ABOVE THE LAW traveled in mid-pack, raced between rivals then got crowded
a bit past the seven-sixteenths pole, came three wide into lane and flattened between rivals late. ROCK YOUR WORLD sped clear and to establish the
front, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured on the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. WOOTTON ASSET
(FR) was off a step slow and broke out a bit, trailed early on, went two wide into the far turn, angled four wide around the bend and was always outrun.
