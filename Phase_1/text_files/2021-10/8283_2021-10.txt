marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. DOUBLE DOT tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and closed well for the place. BIG LIZ allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made
a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. MAGIC LEMONS well placed, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then weakened and held a share. CRAZY DELIGHT allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the
second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. MY OWN PASSION sprinted to a long lead quickly and stopped. PERFECTNESS
well placed, lost some ground four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. PRAIRIE CITIZEN always outrn.

HUMOUR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the stretch, then was no match then final furlong and held the place. PREQUALIFIED
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed well for the show. VERY
REPLACEABLE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, flattened and held a share. BABY
BULL allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened. FIGHTIN PHIL stalked the pace
outside and faded through the second turn. CHAOS KID mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.
