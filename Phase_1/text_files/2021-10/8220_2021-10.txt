Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TAKE raced four wide into the opening turn, drove between nearing the head of the stretch, dueled inside of LIVING SKY in the final furlong and
narrowly prevailed. LIVING SKY hustled outside to the turn, chased three wide into the lane, dueled outside of MIDNIGHT TAKE and was out finished.
BRADYDABOSS broke in leaving the gate, chased inside through the turn, angled out to the two path late stretch and was along late to secure show. WIDE
EYED WILEY lacked early speed, shifted out to the three path late stretch and bid belatedly. CRITICAL CONDITION sped to the front quickly, had nothing
left in reserve for the drive and gave way. STEAMIN DEMON broke slow and passed tiring. SOARIN DIVA chased the early pace, was taken back entering
the turn and faded. ARIZONA BREW away slow and was not a factor. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race
but made no change.

Footnotes
CAGEY unhurried early then took a stalking position, lodged a rail bid into the lane, swept the leaders and held under pressure. FLASHY SISTER took
closer order in the far turn, chased inside through the stretch gaining ground on the leader but was no match. EMERALD CANYON hustled outside then
angled in to secure an inside position, led the field through the backstretch, turned back challenge from BAINE THE BULL and just held on for show.
HEREVERYWISH saved inside from second flight, began her bid nearing the quarter pole, closed outside and missed. BAINE THE BULL outsprinted
through the opening turn, sat in striking position from the three path, moved up alongside the leader nearing the quarter and came up empty for the drive. LA
CHICA DE FUEGO trailed wide through the backstretch and offered a mild late bid. LITTLE ROSALYN failed to produce a bid. WITTS QUESTION failed to
menace.

THIS TIME LUCKY set the pace from just off the rail, drove clear entering the stretch and was kept to task. HARRY'S HAMMER raced at the back of the
pack, circled into the lane and gained late. ANIAR reserved off the pace early, fanned four wide on the final turn and held for show. BOOKIE raced five wide
through the backstretch, rallied outside and missed. CYCLONE DAN pressed while three wide and lacked closing response. STAPLETON attended the
pace from the four path, chased the leader into the lane and faded. BE MY MACHO MAN last away, saved ground and tired. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR
hurried four wide into the backstretch, fanned four wide on the turn then was in tight approaching the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE contested the early pace from the rail, led the field through the far turn, widened into the stretch and was much the best. GEM OF
INCEPTION broke awkwardly, chased four wide through the backstretch, angled out after the quarter pole, chased but was no match for winner. HEY HEY
RUN AWAY quickest leaving the chute, was soon overtaken, chased inside and flattened. TALA stalked five to six wide early and lacked a kick. ENTITLED
STAR rated off the pace inside and passed tiring rival. FUNNY FLOWERS stalked three wide under a snug hold, chased the leader in the final turn and
faded. BELLA GALINA pressed the early pace from the five path and had no response when called upon. SHEENA was no a factor.

ASTRONOMICAL chased inside, swung three wide into the lane, closed steadily outside and got by in time. TRIPLE POWER vied inside, responded to
challenge from WALKTHELINE through the final turn, rallied determinedly inside, edged away from the fore mentioned and was caught late. WALKTHELINE
contested the early pace from between foes, moved up alongside TRIPLE POWER to challenge the lead, dueled entering the stretch but was unable to get
by under heavy urging and was edged out. MR. DAZZLE chased three wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid from the rail but failed to threaten.
WEDGE POND stalked outside, fanned three wide into the opening turn and flattened out. MISTER SNICKERS failed to menace. ALL UNDER CONTROL
failed to be a factor. BON PRIX chased four wide leaving the backstretch and tired with two furlongs remaining. BURNING LOVE never involved.

driving. PREDESTINED vied three wide to the first turn, emerged the leader racing into the backstretch, showed the way through the far turn and was out
finished. IMPERIALITE took back into the first turn, shifted outside leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly outside nearing the quarter pole and closed
late to secure show. SILVER PRAIRIE fanned four wide, settled mid pack and rallied belatedly. SMALL TOWN DUDE chased from rail entering the lane and
flattened out late stretch. DARE TO GO raced four wide through the backstretch, took closer order in the final turn and yielded late. REMAIN CALM went
three wide in the first turn and showed a mild interest late. SMILEY broke inward, chased the pace from the three path and gave way. CODE OF THE
WEST hurried away and failed to produce a bid. KICKEN WEST G. stalked four to five wide and was done early. BLAZING CHANNING chased wide, began
bid nearing the three eighths marker and wilted abruptly.
