Footnotes
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER hugged the inner rail around the turn while stalking the pace, eased out in upper stretch, rallied on her left lead, swept to
command near the sixteenth pole and lasted under urging. CANDY LIGHT raced in mid pack around the turn and closed nicely between horses. CANDY
ARCADE , between horses on the turn, chased the pace, floated to the four path in mid stretch and flattened out. BETTER CALL MAMA accelerated to the
early lead, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and tired in the drive`. DATE NIGHT KISSES , an early factor along the inner rail, failed to rally. CIRCLE HOME
broke slowly and passed tired rivals late. MELIPONINI BEE , no factor, was four deep turning for home and drifted in in upper stretch. UNBRIDLED IRISH
was outrun. TREAT FOR THE EYES chased the pace to the stretch then gave way. MY MAGIC LADY trailed after breaking sluggishly.

Footnotes
DEMO DOCTOR cleared soon after the break, dropped in a bit and set a rated but pressured pace three wide, dropped in a bit into the turn, turned away an
outside threat from ERAWAN approaching the lane, was roused clear soon after, spurted away near mid stretch then held firm under steady left handed
asking. ERAWAN , in range three wide outside rivals, bid four wide under a ride nearing the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds and stayed on
well. ICE RAIN , fractious in the gate, forced the early pace four wide outside the winner, pressed three wide between foes nearing the lane, failed to
seriously kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. ERIC'S EMPIRE , off last after hesitating, pulled his way forward to the inside of rivals nearing the five
eighths and stalked, was under asking into the lane, shifted out but came up empty. JACK GAVE BACK lagged back, raced well wide in upper stretch and
lacked a rally. JACKIE A , rated off the rail early on, raced between rivals nearing the turn, was coaxed along mid turn, angled out and gave way.

ASSUME rated three deep and within range of the contested pace, bid three deep when given her cue nearing the quarter pole, assumed command outside
rivals in mid stretch, dueled then drove clear late. LUCRE settled off the pace, dropped in nearing the half mile marker, came back out to be five wide
gaining momentum into the lane, straightened and closed steadily to nab the place. A GIRL NAMED JAC , edged up inside leaving the five eighths pole and
stalked, was nudged along to hold position around the turn, got through in upper stretch, battled past mid stretch then was out kicked late. IZZYBELLA
broke a bit sluggishly then was hard used soon after, bid inside foes and contested the pace from the five eighths, came off the rail entering the lane, fought
on between foes past the three sixteenths, steadied out of a tight spot soon after, altered out and kept on with effort. LOVE IN HER EYES , between foes
early, shifted in some around the turn and came up empty. HASHTAG LUCKY dueled outside a rival, failed to kick on past the quarter pole, wandered
outward a bit and faded.

WHERE U B sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside, was nudged along while handling outside pressure past the five sixteenths, responded to
firmer asking and kicked away past the three sixteenths, was kept alert with right handed asking past the furlong grounds, wandered outward and won under
steady hand encouragement. JOSEF IS REAL , three wide stalking the winner, took closer order past the five sixteenths, drifted out a bit into the lane, gave
hard chase past the furlong grounds, failed to seriously kick on through the final sixteenth but managed to save the place. COUNT THE SHELLS had speed
then eased back a bit nearing the half mile marker, moved up between foes and raced three wide into the lane, shifted in near the sixteenth pole and
finished with good energy. DISTANT THUNDER prompted the pace outside the winner, was under heavy pressure past the five sixteenths, pursued to mid
stretch then faded late. TOP BOSS broke outward and hit the gate, reacted to that and came back in to make solid contact with LITTLE BAY, steadied soon
after, moved up four wide into the turn, chased and churned on. SING A VERSE , off the pace, saved ground into the lane then checked when lacking room
past the three sixteenths. SWING YOUR SWORD saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back some mid turn, eased out but failed to generate a solid
comeback. GATOR FIFTY TWO , taken to rate off the rail, was in a good spot past the three eighths, circled four to five wide into the lane, failed to go on
past the three sixteenths and faded. KICKSTARTER rank at the break, steadied soon after and failed to menace. LITTLE BAY , jostled at the break, saved
ground well back past the three eighths and failed to menace. EL ROJO , bumped at the break, dropped well back early, was being eased in upper stretch
then was pulled up late and walked off.

PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch and around the turn, was under urging mid way on the bend, steadily gained
and took the lead near the sixteenth pole. I CAN RUN saved ground on the turn, raced inside horses through the stretch, and split foes late. ESTATE
hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead through the stretch and hung. MIDDLE ISLAND
broke slowly, advanced three wide to reach contention turning for home and tired. LADY MOSLER , taken to the four path in upper stretch, lacked the
necessary late effort. JACKIE THE JOKER rushed to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and tired late. AMAZON QUEEN , well placed four
deep leaving the turn, faltered and was eased late. MISS KEEN was outrun. PSYCHE broke slowly and was outrun.

BUSTOFF took over early, dropped in towards the rail and set a rated pace, turned away WEATHER WIZ nearing the lane, opened up after being set down
in upper stretch, kicked away and was kept to a drive to about the sixteenth pole. WEATHER WIZ , three wide into the first turn, prompted the pace outside
winner, was under asking trying to keep pace nearing the lane, faded through the final sixteenth but managed to stay on for the place. MY GOOD MAN
settled off the pace while saving ground swung four wide into the lane, straightened and brought a mild run. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY , between foes early,
stalked three wide through the backstretch run, chased to the outside of a rival as the leaders widened past the five sixteenths then faded. CLOSER LOOK ,
unruly behind the gate, stalked inside, was under asking past the three eighths, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and weakened. BIG BEAUTIFUL
WALL , four wide, gave way.

Footnotes
FOMO prompted the pace two wide around the turn, secured command in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously to prevail. EVER CLEAR brushed with
CHAUFFEUR leaving the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, moved up to challenge for the lead outside FOMO near the eighth pole then hung. PICKIN
SEA GLASS broke awkwardly, swung outside in upper stretch, raced greenly while rallying and steadied on a rival's heels when drifting in near the sixteenth
pole. HELLO AMIGO saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail through the stretch, chased the pace and failed to rally. CHAUFFEUR brushed
with EVER CLEAR leaving the backstretch, circled the turn four deep and failed to rally. DANCE ON THE MOON showed speed along the inner rail and
gave way. HANDS DOWN was no factor. CARSON AND I , four deep on the turn, was no factor. ITS MR POPPI TO U was outrun. An objection by the rider
of CHAUFFEUR against EVER CLEAR for alleged interference entering the turn was not allowed.
