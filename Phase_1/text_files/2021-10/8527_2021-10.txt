Footnotes
CALL OF HONOR set the pace early, raced in the two path into the lane then widened down the lane under a steady drive. ROUSING SIREN stalked the
pace early, raced in the two path along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and had no late gain on the winner. TIZ THE JOURNEY raced back
early on, was in the two path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. MY HOT TODDY chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the far
turn, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. MR. PETERKIN came out at the start and never a factor. SUPER D'ORO broke
slow and came inward at the start, trailed the field early on, was in the two path into the lane, clipped heels and fell in the stretch, walked off after the race.
WHAT THE ELLE pressed the pace early, raced in the two path along the far turn, tired into the lane, fell over fallen foe in the stretch and was vanned off
after the race.

bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on, began a move along the far turn, was in the two path into the lane, continued the rally down the lane and
moved up while no match for the winner. COUNTRY CAPTAIN chased the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane while making a bid but weakened
late in the stretch run. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC broke a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position
down the lane. SOUTHERNER was bumped and bothered early on, raced three wide along the first turn and stalked the early pace, was in the three path
into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. KOUFAX was bumped and bothered early on, raced between horses along the first turn, tracked the pace early
down the backstretch, was in the two path into the lane and empty down the lane. SUPPRESSOR raced four wide along the first turn, chased the pace early
on, was in the five path into the lane and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HERE MI SONG was well rated early on from behind foes, raced in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and edged past the leaders three wide
in the final stages. CARMEL CRUSH stalked the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and three wide near the
three sixteenths pole while making a bid, was under a long drive, inched ahead slightly late but was caught nearing the wire. JURA set the pace early, raced
in the two path into the lane, was under a long drive down the lane and gave in nearing the wire from the inside of foes. COUSTEAU was steadied along
down the backstretch from the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane then was in tight a bit near the three sixteenths pole and lost momentum briefly then
weakened late in the drive. DRIVE FOR FUN trailed the field early on, raced in the five path along the turn, was in the seven path into the lane and moved
up in the stretch run. NAMESAKE was in the five path entering the lane and never a threat. HABITUS had early speed while two wide then folded up.
RIVER SHANNON raced in the five path through the turn while through after a half.

Footnotes
CAROTARI shied inwards from MAVEN's incident and bumped an inner foe at the start, recovered to set the pace, cleared into the turn, showed the way in
hand as foes ranged up turning for home, but shook clear of those rivals when let out passing the quarter pole, and held from an oncharging BAD BEAT
BRIAN late. BAD BEAT BRIAN put GET WESTERN into tight quarters while achieving an inside stalking position in the opening furlong, tracked comfortably
from the pocket around the turn, chased CAROTARI through upper stretch as that foe scooted away, gained place from an outer foe while tipping outside of
the clear leader at the furlong pole, and rallied well through the late stages to cut the gap, but was denied. JOHNNY UNLEASHED was pinched back
between horses at the start, rushed to chased the pace setter three wide into the turn, ranged up to bid turning for home, but was repelled by the leader
passing the quarter pole, hung on his left lead thereafter, got outkicked for place in midstretch, and faded. SHIP IT RED broke outwardly and bumped an
outer foe at the start, stalked two wide and between horses into the turn, but was outmoved by an outer foe turning for home, shifted out and bumped GET
WESTERN passing the three sixteenths pole, and lacked a rally thereafter. GET WESTERN was put to tight quarters by BAD BEAT BRIAN while trying to
gain inside stalking position in the opening furlong, took back but got rank into the turn, settled and tracked from the two path around the bend, shifted three
wide entering the lane, but was pinched between horses passing the three sixteenths pole, then kept on. SMART REMARK saved ground far off of the
pace, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up. MAVEN broke through the gate a fraction of a second before the rest of the gates opened, was
wrangled back and spotted the leaders multiple lengths due to the incident, recovered to rush to a four wide midpack position into the turn, ranged up
outside of foes turning for home, but delayed a lead change entering the lane, faded passing the quarter pole, and continued to weaken after being bumped
by an inner foe in upper stretch. HOLIDAY STONE lied off of the pace four wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. DARK OAK never
got involved. BOLDOR lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and weakened. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN MAVEN
BEING DECLARED A NON-STARTER. THE RIDER OF GET WESTERN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHIP IT RED FOR INTERFENENCE
IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE stalked three wide while perched outside of the leading duo, loomed while ranging up well in hand turning for home to bid for the lead
entering the lane, lugged inwards after taking over passing the three sixteenths pole, but responded briskly to a left handed crop at the sixteenth pole, and
powered away. OSCARETTE pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home simultaneously with GOODNIGHT OLIVE, battled with that foe
entering the lane, but swiftly proved no match for that rival passing the three sixteenths pole, and safely held place thereafter. MUN LUV tracked along the
inside, around the turn, tipped two wide entering the lane, and stayed on well for a minor share. BAHAMA MISCHIEF broke outwardly into a rival, settled far
off of the pace along the inside, saved ground, then sustained a rail rally through the lane to just miss reaching show. ENCOURAGING broke a step slowly,
tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. TERRANOVA set the pace, met a pair of bids turning for home,
proved no match for those foes entering the lane, and gave way. FLASHY CHARGE got bumped between horses at the start, then failed to factor. FITS
THE JILL brushed the gate and was last away, then never got involved. SEEKING SPIRITS was off slowly and got outrun. UNBRIDLED TWISTER chased
from the three to four paths around the turn, lugged inwards in upper stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
SPOOKY CHANNEL lied forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, tucked to the rail entering the stretch for the first time, stalked comfortably from the
pocket while well in hand and tugging mildly in the bit, gained place in upper stretch while shifting outside of the clear leader, ranged up to that foe inside the
final furlong, sustained a bid while being herded many paths outwards through the late stages, and forged an advantage a few strides from the wire. TWO
EMMYS set the pace along the inside, showed the way well in hand with his ears pricked while feeling mild pressure from an outer rival, shook clear from a
pair of bidding rivals at the quarter pole, drew off through midstretch as SPOOKY CHANNEL gave chase, but met that foe's bid while drifting outwards in the
final furlong, and was bested in the late stages. RY'S THE GUY stalked two wide, pressed the leader around the final bend, but failed to keep pace with that
foe and an inner rallying rival in upper stretch, and chased them home while managing show. BAMA BREEZE settled off fo the pace while caught four wide
around the first turn, tucked two wide through the lane for the first time, but shifted out and gained five wide into the final turn, ranged up to the leading pair
around that bend, but leveled off after being floated four wide in upper stretch. ANOTHER MYSTERY got caught three wide and between horses while off of
the pace around the first turn, tucked and saved ground around the second and third bends, but bumped KENTUCKY GHOST while trying to shift out from
behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, created racing room in midstretch, and stayed on. SOLE VOLANTE trailed around the opening two turns, attempted
a six wide rally around the final bend, then moved up while failing to threaten. KENTUCKY GHOST settled two wide, but was bumped by an inner foe in
upper stretch to be six wide approaching the furlong grounds, and faltered. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted five
wide into the third turn, but lacked a true rally through the lane and failed to menace. GLYNN COUNTY tracked along the inside, but came under coaxing
down the backstretch, was driven three wide and between horses around the final turn, but lacked a response. YAMATO tracked two wide, but faded four
wide around the far turn. BREAKPOINT (CHI) stalked three wide, but steadied and faltered between horses into the final bend, and was not persevered with
thereafter.

TEJANO TWIST tracked intently along the inside, tipped to the two path while inside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, blew past the leader passing the three
sixteenths pole, assumed command entering midstretch, and widened under a mild hand ride. OVERBORE vied three wide early on, relaxed to stalk into the
turn, but chased a clear RED LABEL under a drive around the turn, got floated four wide in upper stretch while getting outkicked by an inner rival, and kept
on to prove second best. COOL PAPA G intentionally took back at the start without incident, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, shifted five
wide in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. RED LABEL was hustled along early on to vie for the lead between horses, intently drove clear into
the turn, managed a clear margin around the bend while under steady urging, but tired noticeably entering the lane, brushed the inner railing while hanging
on his left lead as outer foes ranged up in upper stretch, then was overhauled passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. PRIVATE ROAD tracked
two wide, shifted six wide at the quarter pole, and failed to factor. AIN'T STRAIGHT vied inside of a pair of rivals early on, chased RED LABEL around the
bend after that foe cleared off into the turn, shifted three wide and between horses passing the quarter pole, but faltered on his left lead at the three
sixteenths pole. LAND REMEMBERED saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. LANSDOWNE lied off of the pace, but steadily faded four widen
around the turn. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY chased from midpack five wide into the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole, was eased through the lane,
then walked back after an abbreviated gallop out.

Footnotes
LUCY'S CAKES FLY stalked comfortably along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane for clear sailing, ranged up outside of DREAMFUL in
midstretch, then drove past that foe a sixteenth from home. DREAMFUL pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn and into the final furlong, but
was outkicked at the sixteenth pole, and proved second best. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three wide,
then stayed on through the final furlong to reach show. PRINCESS NINA lied off of the pace two wide, stayed on through the lane to bid for show between
horses late, but was outfinished by an outer rival. OLLIE'S GOLD pulled forward after a step slow start to set the pace into the first turn, showed the way
from a rival around the far turn, clung to an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, but was headed at that marker, yielded, then lost show on the wire.
AMORTIZATION (IRE) saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. WAVE OF GOODNESS stalked two wide, then three to four wide around the far turn, but
faded through the lane. THROMBOCYTOPENIA never got invoved. TIME FOR GLORY tracked two wide, chased four wide around the far turn, but
weakened entering the lane. JAZZY LADY was outrun throughout.
