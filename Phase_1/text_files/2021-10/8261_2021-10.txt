IMILINGO stalked the pace edging closer on the turn looming abreast the pacesetter in upper stretch taking over late to win clear. DIMPLES OF VENUS
raced mid pack rallying on the turn vying four then five wide down the lane salvaging place at mid track. KIKI DO U LOVE ME broke sharply clearing the
field holding daylight through the turn, threatened from the outside in upper stretch would wear under pressure fading late. EGG NOG gained on the turn
vying from the inside in upper stretch leveling off late. TAP THE CAT gained on the turn then faded on the inside in upper stretch. NURSE KATIE played no
factor. ONE LUCK GIRL was always outrun. RENS GOLD crowded at the break dropped far turn showing little interest easing in upper stretch jogging to the
wire walking off after the race.

giving all to the end. DIALED UP pressured the pace through the turn extending into upper stretch being squeezed and steadied on the inside past the
eighth dropping off there. PABLO'S QUEST slow early failed to menace. PRE FLIGHT was never involved. WAVE LAND OUTLAW was always outrun.
