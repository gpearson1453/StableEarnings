KID MACHO settled far behind outside, bid wide into the stretch and drew off while kept to his task. SUPERHIGHWAY chased inside well behind, made a
quick move inside to the front at the quarter pole but tired. ARRIVEDERCI dueled outside, took over into the far turn, moved clear then proved empty.
RINGS OF JUPITER was well placed behind the dueling leaders but lacked a rally. SYNERGIZED forced the pace along the rail to the far turn and gave
way. SPARTY raced close up for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

LAVERY forced the pace between rivals then wore down the leader in a long drive. DANZAFIED hustled to the front inside, moved clear in midstretch but
could not hold off the winner late. RACE CRAFT dropped far behind inside, angled out on the turn and closed well. PATEGORY ONE prompted the pace
three wide and flattened out through the stretch. ONE NATION lacked speed in the two path, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. ALMASHRIQ broke

BODE O settled well back, circled his field on the turn then drew away in the stretch without pressure. CELTIC HEART saved ground off the pace, swung
wide into the stretch rallying to be easily second best. MY COUSIN RICH underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, bid outside on the turn then tired. NICKY
DA FOX broke alertly and alternated for the lead inside then came up empty in the stretch. STELLA'S TOUR was urged close up in the two path and
weakened in the stretch. NOT A POSTINO dropped back early inside and was never in contention. CALL HOME earned a narrow advantage outside for half
a mile and stopped.

MY BOY TATE bid four wide on the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole and drew away while geared down late. ABSENTEE trailed far behind, moved
wide in the stretch with late energy while no threat to the winner. DONTMESAWITHME saved ground off the pace and continued willingly. TRINGALE close
up outside, tried to move with the winner and faded. PRENDIMI chased in the two path, was asked for run into the far turn but had no response. HOPEFUL
TREASURE dueled outside with a narrow advantage then gave way. POWERFUL ALLY was hustled up to duel inside then stopped abruptly.
