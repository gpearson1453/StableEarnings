Footnotes
STORMY SPOTS vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled on the inside down the home stretch and proved the best late. CUPIE CUTIE
went to the front, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished for the win. HIDDEN EXPECTATION unhurried in the early
part, came around the second turn four wide, made an outside bid and finished willingly. AMERICAN REALITY pressed the pace, had an outside trip, made
a mild bid and hung. C C TAKESOVER raced in the back of the pack early, passed tiring rivals downs the lane. T R'S FIRST was never a serious threat.
ABIGAILS TAKEOVER raced within contention in the early going, dropped back around the final turn and was done.

Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, moved up around the final turn from the outside, took command leaving the turn and
held off a late charge by Love To Learn. LOVE TO LEARN unhurried early, began moving up entering the 2nd turn, rallied late but could not catch the
winner. DIXIELAND DREAM raced behind the top two early, moved up from the inside to vie for the lead around the second turn but could not match strides
with the top two late. HAPPY SONRISA raced in the rear, moved up down the home stretch and was outfinished for the show. SUPER LEGS showed a late
rally down the home stretch but could not gain on the top ones. FABULOUS GIRL vied for the early lead, gave way down the home stretch. HARLANS
WARRIOR took the early lead, tired down the lane. FIANNA HILLS raced within contention in the early going but began dropping back down the lane and
had nothing left. BADGERI CANDY was never a threat.

Footnotes
VODKA GIMLET squeezed back at the start, quickly moved up to vie for the lead from the outside down the back stretch, rallied late down the lane to prove
best at the wire. TAMBOURINE STAR vied for the lead inbetween horses, bothered late but held on for 2nd. BIND FAITH vied for the lead from the inside,
took a clear lead around the turn, ducked in down the lane, hit rail, steadied and had to settle for show. KING OF CONTRABAND raced behind the leaders
and put forth an even effort. INTO WISHING raced in the middle of the pack throughout. CLASSIC'S OMEGA raced in back of the pack and was never a
serious threat. DUDE DROP KID raced in the rear and showed little. BIG SESSY broke well but quickly dropped back and was no factor late. FLAT OUT
FABIO was never a threat.

MOMENT vied for the early lead, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held off a late challenge by SKYCRAFT. SKYCRAFT void of early speed,
made a steady gain, rallied down the stretch and just missed. KING OF THE TESTO challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, but proved
no match late for the top two. ARCHIE pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. FOOLISH STEVE raced within contention, faded and was no
threat late. GREELEY'S DEALER lacked early speed and showed little. PROMISING SHOES always raced near the back, came around the final turn on the
outside and was outrun.

Footnotes
DIXIELAND MUSIC raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the lane, was all out and held on for the win. LUCKY BIG
DADDY stumbled at the start, racing in the rear, made a late rail bid and needed more ground. SPIRIT SOUL lacked early speed, made a steady gain and
was a clear third at the wire. BUBBA SMACK void of early speed, made a wide late gain. CONQUISTADOR GOLD raced near the middle of the field, eased
back and passed tired ones late. CROOKED BANKER vied for the early lead and faded. BRAIZEN FIRE pressed the early pace, raced outside around the
turn and made a steady retreat. PHAROAHSWHEEL dueled for the early lead, raced around the turn three wide and dropped back. HE'S A CLASSIC went
to the front and was finished early. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR void of early speed and showed little.
