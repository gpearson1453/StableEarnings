FOOLISH TO DECEIVE was away in good order to duel for the lead with HEAVY HAUL while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half,
opened a clear lead and held sway to the wire. STREET MOXIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady rally. WORKING was forwardly placed just off the dueling leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain
on the winner late. PAMPERS N' BOOTS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly.
TETON was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. WILD WILD KINGDOM raced four-wide through the first turn,
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. HEAVY HAUL broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside for a
half and weakened.

best in the stiff drive. OFFICER OF WAR sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner
approaching the stretch, vied with that rival and just missed. ATTERCOP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. DOHENY BEACH lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and
finished evenly. PEQUENO MONTE was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not
