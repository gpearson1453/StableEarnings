BOSSY BABY got away alertly, attended the pace, moved to the fore three wide on the turn, kicked clear. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC broke outwardly a bit,
shifted in and tracked along the rail into the turn, came out at the quarter pole, moved into upper stretch five wide before shifting in, was no match for the
winner. MS. LEA was in tight and steadied after the start, settled at the rear going five wide on the turn, ran on willingly. BRILLIANT BEAUTY broke out and
bumped a rival, was mildly coaxed forward to set the pace racing in the two path, weakened. SPECIAL WINGS lacked early speed racing outside rivals off
the lead, went four wide on the turn and ran on. PLATINUM BUTTON failed to threaten after racing inisde. BRASS COUNTY was between foes early, went
two to three wide on the turn, came up empty. DE FELINA'S SONG was bumped outwardly and made light contact with a rival then steadied slightly at the
start, recovered to chase four wide into the turn, eased in the stretch and vanned off.

CREATIVE BID stalked the leaders, advanced between foes three then two wide on the turn to take charge, drew away under steady handling while much
the best. THE MET tracked from inside, came out late on the turn but slightly steadied on heels past the quarter pole, ran on but was no match for the
winner. ROCKS A BLACK SUIT broke a step slowly, was urged but lacking early speed, went two to three wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and
improved. VALIANT CHARGE was very reluctant to load, set the early tempo, vied four wide between on the turn, weakened. ARROGANT PUNCH
attended from outside going five wide on the turn, weakened. LEA COSTA ME broke awkwardly, went two to three wide on the turn at the rear and was
never a threat. SUPER HUNK broke outwardly, shifted in heading up the backstretch, bid inside foes but just off the fence midway on the turn, faded.

HELLO HELLO MISTER got away alertly, attended the pace from outside, moved to the fore past the quarter pole having gone three to four wide on the
turn, drew off in the lane. DON WITH THE WIND was forwardly-placed pressing from inside, bid into the turn, was no match for the winner. SUN TREADER
raced off the leaders inside rivals up the backstretch, went two to three deep on the turn, kept on for show honors. SOULONG raced outside rivals off the
leaders, went five wide on the turn, appeared poised to get show honors under stout urging but was outfinished for that prize. CHATTER BAR contended
two to three wide between runners, gave way in the stretch. DAN WHO failed to rally after going two to three wide on the turn. ATTILA'S FLAG raced
between foes early, went four wide on the turn, dropped back and shifted out nine deep turning for home, failed to rally. TROOPER failed to threaten racing
along the inside.

Footnotes
KRIS WHO set the pace in the clear racing off the fence, went in the two to three path on the turn, came a bit wider into upper stretch, held sway under
steady urging. LEATHERNECK tracked from inside, came out three wide turning for home, gained steadily but slowly and needed more. PHOENIX FIRE
shifted in heading up the backstretch, was in striking range in the two path turning into upper stretch then evened out late. BORTSTEIN stalked the early
pace, went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE came out soon after the start and was forwardly-positioned in pursuit of the
leaders, raced outside foes four wide on the turn and failed to rally. BECOME AN INSIDER chased into the turn, dropped back five wide, was not a late
threat. BEAN AND THE BUG moved out clearing the gap, raced last but one into the turn going four then six wide on that bend, failed to threaten. HAPPY
FORTY EIGHT was quite fractious in the gate, readily dropped back in the early going racing off the inside, faded. Due to a timer malfunction the race was
hand timed.

Footnotes
ABBIE'S WAY settled mid-pack, tracked along the rail on the turn, bid inside in upper stretch and kicked clear. MCGOLDIE raced outside the winner up the
backstretch into the turn going two wide on that bend, lugged out a path in upper stretch, gained the place without threatening the winner. MINNIE ME HA
settled well back, went four to five wide on the turn, swung widest of all to be ten deep in upper stretch, gained belatedly. SUPERDUPERJUSTICE broke in
the air spotting the field a couple lengths but readily recovered to advance through between foes, went three to four wide on the turn, forced to move out in
upper stretch and ran on. INDIAN DIVA set the pace in the two path facing pressure, faltered and faded. PRINCESS JADA was within range early, put to
urging late on the turn going four to five wide on that bend, swung out nine deep turning for home and failed to rally. HOT TO SURF switched off the inside
going in the three to four path on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep then shifted in and ran on evenly. DONNA WHO chased from outside going
five then four wide on the the turn before moving eight deep into upper stretch, weakened. DELETERIOUS failed to threaten after racing in the rear in the
five path through the turn. IROQUOIS HEART pressed the pace three wide into the turn, came out six deep turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S OVER DUDE exchanged a bump at the start, vied inside into the first turn, took a narrow lead briefly up the backstretch, was overtaken by outside foes
still saving ground, regained the lead in late stretch and dug in to edge clear. ANXIOUS INDIAN attended from outside, went three to four wide, took a
narrow lead on the far turn till past the furlong marker and was outfinished. MORE FIREWATER exchanged a bump at the break, contended from between
runners, was outkicked. BOB'SALLWICKED moved out and bumped a rival heading into the first turn, went four wide on that bend racing between foes,
continued outside a rival into the far turn having moved in and going two wide on that bend, came out for the drive and was not a threat to the top three.
TALKABOUTNAVARONE came out to the three path entering the first turn, tracked off the leading trio inside a runner, moved back nearer the rail into the
far turn, failed to rally. KELL'S KISS altered in heading into the first turn, raced on or just off the fence from that point through the far turn, failed to menace.
SANDIA'S BEST was in a bit tight entering the first turn, went three wide on that bend, moved out six wide turning for home. HIT A NOTE broke a step
slowly at the start, moved up outside a foe heading into the first turn then was carried out and bumped on that bend, continued to pursue five wide, asked to
keep up at the half but came up empty. FINAL DECEPTION tossed his head at the break, raced off the inside in the two to four path on the turns, was not a
factor.

Footnotes
LINCOLN COUNTY KID was ridden along early on the turn, moved out from three to five wide on that bend, kicked on late to share the top prize.
GAMBLING COWBOY angled in early, entered the turn two deep, moved out four wide nearing the quarter pole then out a further path at the head of the
stretch, took a narrow lead in upper stretch and shared the win. FLYING PHANTOM broke a step slowly at the start, shifted out from three to five wide on
the turn, altered outside two foes past the quarter pole, was gaining late. COMET CAUSEY contended three wide and between runners, exchanged a light
brush in upper stretch and kept on gamely. DIGGER'S GOLD was carried in early, settled well back along or just off the rail, came out five wide turning for
home and gained mildly. POOF HE'S GONE vied outside foes four wide, exchanged a light brush in upper stretch, faltered and faded. SMOOTH BLUES
vied two wide and between runners, weakened. SNIGGLE dropped back lacking early speed, went five to six wide on the turn and was not a threat. ZESTY
JAZZMAN vied inside, gave way.
