Footnotes
AUJARA shuffled from rail to turn, angled out, drifted out stretch, held. ANGELINA good position to the stretch, angled in around winner mid stretch. I'M
LEGIT no speed to the turn, rallied outside, shut off final sixteenth. INDELIBLE IMAGE rushed to duel early on, brushed winner into stretch, weakened.
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE sharp break outside, led into stretch, faltered in late going. FLASH PATRIARCH saved ground to no avail. LINE DANCER rushed to
duel winner to turn, gave way readily. GIGGLIN KATE always trailed while far back in the stretch run. The stewards posted the inquiry sign after the finish,
reviewing the replay for several minutes, they disqualified AUJARA from first to third position for interference twice in the stretch run to both ANGELINA and
I'M LEGIT causing both to alter course in through the final furlong.
