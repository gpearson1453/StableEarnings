Footnotes
CADEAU DE PAIX prompted the pace two wide, floated three wide while forging an advantage entering the lane, and edged away. CATECHISM set the
pace inside of a vying rival, failed to keep pace with that foe while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, lost place to an inner bidding foe soon after, but
kept on, changed to her right lead at the sixteenth pole, and regained the place honors late. GIRLS A BULLET stalked behind the pace setters, tucked from
the two path to the rail into the the turn, produced a rail bid leaving the quarter pole when the leader vacated the inside, claimed place while failing to keep
pace with an outer rival, but flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth, and lost that position late. TACHLIS tracked three wide, ranged up
turning for home before being floated four wide entering the lane, but failed to sustain a bid while hanging on her left lead, and flattened out. DIAMOND
LYDIAMARIE lagged behind around the turn, and surpassed a tiring rival. SISTER'S GHOST lacked speed in the two path, and tired in the five path through
the lane.

Footnotes
ARMY STAR prompted the leader while applying stern outer pressure into the turn, vied turning for home, sparred through a prolonged duel well into the
final furlong, then forged an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and kept his inner game counterpart at bay. RETAINED broke sharply and cut across
while clearing in the opening stages, set the pace from a stoutly pressing ARMY STAR around the turn, dug in to resist that foe's bid turning for home, clung
to a narrow margin in the prolonged battle entering the final furlong, but was headed at the sixteenth pole. NATURAL RED bumped an inner foe at the start,
chased in midpack in the two path, claimed show from outer foes leaving the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, and held. SUITABLE stalked in
the three path and between horses, exchanged bumps with an outer rival near the half mile pole in order to sustain his position outside of the top pair, but
floated to the five path entering the lane while failing to keep pace with them, then hung on his left lead while failing to claim show. PHILHARMONIC raced
in midpack three wide, but failed to factor. GRIMES took a bump from an outer foe at the start, chased along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the
leading pair while tipping outside of them entering the lane, and gave way. SAILOR'S CHANCE was jostled between horses at the start, took the turn in the
four path while far back, and never got involved. HENDRIX chased four wide, exchanged bumps with an inner foe while hoping to shift down nearing the
turn, then weakened turning for home. FULL MAG required a readjustment in the gate without much fuss, then broke a step slowly, and was outrun.
WARHORSE WEST was outrun in the two path. CHILI RED saved ground off of the pace while tiring.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, shied slightly from an outer foe at the eleven sixteenths pole, tipped outside of that
rival into the turn, tracked while shifted to the three path around the bend, then swung to the five path entering the lane to be outside of the leading trio,
ranged up to take aim on a leading AWESOME INDRA at the furlong grounds, produced a bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead. AWESOME INDRA
set the pace inside of a pair of forward foes while a path off of the rail around the turn, inched clear of them in upper stretch, held sway into the final furlong
while hanging on his left lead, but drifted out slightly from left handed encouragement leaving that juncture, changed leads when corrected approaching the
final sixteenth, but was collared by an outer foe in the process, and was bested soon after. INVALUABLE tracked four wide, stalked the top pair from the
four path around the turn, but failed to progress between horses in upper stretch, got outkicked for minor rewards by an outer foe at the furlong grounds,
then kept on to achieve show late. FOREIGN EXCHANGE pressed the leader from the three path while between horses around the turn, but failed to keep
pace with her in upper stretch, got outkicked for place by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and yielded. L. A. STAR trailed, then came into the lane in the
four path and moved up. FRILLS chased while forward three wide and between horses, but faded at the three furlong pole. AFERDITA was unruly in the
gates while awaiting the start, then broke a step slowly, chased along the inside, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
BLUE KENTUCKY was hustled to the fore after outbreaking rivals, set the pace inside of a prompting STORMY PATTERN, dug in to resist that rival and
foe's bid turning for home, gamely clung to a narrow margin from the aforementioned one in the prolonged duel through the lane, and just held. STORMY
PATTERN pressed two wide, bid for the lead turning for home along with an outer DESOTO'S WAR, but failed to gain an advantage from an inner game
BLUE KENTUCKY as their outer counterpart faltered in upper stretch, then sparred through the final furlong while not quite at the leader's throatlatch, and
was staved off late while hanging. DESOTO'S WAR stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair
entering the lane, and remained well clear of the rest. NOT YET CHARLIE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack two wide and between
horses, then only inside of a rival while a bit off of the rail around the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead and failed to
menace. SAG HARBOR stalked along the inside, but gave way entering the lane. HOT PASTRAMI laid off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the
two to three paths, and made little impact. CHASIN CHARLIE squarely bumped an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. LUCKY PROMISE was
squeezed between horses at the start, and got outrun. WEST WARPATH tracked four wide, but fade.

Footnotes
LADY PUCHI was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, patiently awaited racing room from the two path
around the far turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch to find clear sailing between horses, rallied with a clear ISN'T SHE LOVELY to catch in midstretch,
ranged up to that foe in the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. ISN'T SHE LOVELY pulled to a clear margin while in the four path around the first turn,
responded to rider received a breather nearing the far turn while tucking to the inside, saw her large margin diminish around that bend, but spurted clear
once more when set down in upper stretch, held sway into the final furlong, but was worn down by a rallying rival inside the final sixteenth, and saved place
late. QUEEN JUDITH broke a beat slowly, trailed around both turns, came into the lane three wide, gradually shifted out seven wide approaching
midstretch, and rallied outside of rivals, but ran out of ground to achieve place. QUARIA BRAVA saved ground off of the pace, searched for racing room
while inching closer along the fence in upper stretch, altered course three wide and between horses to improve with a sixteenth to go, but was outkicked for
show. HERINGTON ROCKET tracked in midpack three to two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn before fanning five wide entering the lane,
but leveled off while floating six wide in upper stretch. PRECURSORY tracked two wide, pursued while being floated four to five wide in upper stretch, but
lacked a kick between horses. DUPLICITOUS tacked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, but failed to progress before fading in the final
furlong. SENSITIVITY was bumped off stride after making contact with an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the pace setter
turning for home in hopes of producing a bid, but failed ot keep pace in upper stretch, held place until the furlong grounds, but faltered late. LIVY B broke a
step slowly, was void of speed in the three path, swung seven wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. AIZU rated off of the pace three to four wide, but
yielded six wide entering the lane. WAYWARDNESS stalked five to four wide around the first turn, then two to three wide around the far turn, but weakened
between horses at the three sixteenths pole. THREE TIPSY CHIX brushed with an outer rival at the start, and never got involved.

Footnotes
TEJANO TWIST rated off of the pace in the two path, launched a gain between horses in upper stretch, took aim on the leading pair in midstretch, ranged
up to KNOCKER DOWN entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. KNOCKER DOWN laid close up along the inside, but failed to secure position inside of
the leader into the turn, was unable to slip through tight quarters to bid at the three furlong pole, stalked turning for home before easily being allowed to slip
inside of the leader in upper stretch after that foe created ample room, wrestled an advantage and drove clear approaching the furlong grounds as an outer
TEJANO TWIST menaced, but failed to resist that foe's bid at the sixteenth pole. PEACEFUL WATERS set the pace while a bit off of the inside, kept an
inner KNOCKER DOWN in tight quarters while not allowing that foe a rail bid at the three furlong pole, but shifted further out entering the lane, which did
allow for that rival to slip inside in upper stretch, got headed while failing to change leads, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.
COPPOLA pressed from the three path, but gave way in upper stretch. SURFER DUDE tracked from the four path, but failed to menace. STRAVA chased
along the inside while a bit off of the fence around the turn, and tired. STONEVICIOUS broke a step slowly, then got outrun. MAKE IT BIG trailed in the four
path, and showed little.

Footnotes
AROUND THE SUN stalked along the inside, checked around the first turn as the leader crossed over, rated while intently tracking the top pair from the
pocket thereafter, pursued a clearing WATCH THIS MUNNY in upper stretch, tipped outside of her to take aim at the furlong grounds, then sustained her
charge to drive past that foe in the final sixteenth. WATCH THIS MUNNY set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook clear of that rival in upper stretch,
held sway entering the final furlong, but met AROUND THE SUN's bid a sixteenth from home, and was bested late before lasting for place. BOLTORO took
a mild nudge from an outer rival at the start, rated off of the pace, shifted three to five wide entering the lane, grinded away outside of foes while hanging on
her left lead, changed over inside the final furlong, and rallied through the late stages, but missed reaching place. PAINT ME PERFECT tracked from
midpack two wide, pursued four wide around the far turn, then chased from between horses through midstretch, bid for show in the final sixteenth, but was
outkicked by an outer rival for that position. SELF CONFIDENT tracked along the inside, sustained a rail chase to gain show at the sixteenth marker, but
faltered late. BOLT FOR ALLISON stalked three wide, but failed to progress while hanging on her left lead through the lane. AMERICAN ODALISQUE
brushed with rivals on either side at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path then between horses around the far turn, and made little impact.
MYSTIFY prompted the pace two wide, but yielded in upper stretch, and tired between horses. NOBLE BERNADETTE saved ground off of the pace, but
steadied behind traffic while in the two path entering the lane, and failed to factor. DREAM ROLE hopped while breaking slowly, rated at the rear two wide,
and never got involved. FREEFORM broke a step slowly before brushing an inner rival at the start, then was outrun while saving ground.

Footnotes
STROBE tugged to the fore early on, set the pace in the two path while well in hand around the turn, responded readily to a set of light shoulder taps
approaching midstretch, spurted away from a chasing foe entering the final furlong, and continued to pull away despite being put to wraps a sixteenth from
home. CLASSIC MOMENT laid close up along the inside, stalked around the turn, tipped outside of the clear leader to take aim, but proved no match for
that foe shortly after, and remained well clear of show. ANGKOR tracked two wide and between horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and emerged from
the group to claim show at the furlong grounds. LET MY PEOPLE GO brushed with an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four
wide and between horses entering the lane before being floated five wide by an inner foe in upper stretch, then only produced a mild kick. MAHAAMEL took
a mild nudge from an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, but failed to progress along the rail through the lane. IGNITIS laid far back in the three
path and made little impact. AMERICAN ICON broke slowly, took the turn in the four path while far back, fanned seven wide in upper stretch, and failed to
factor. SPARTY SENSE stalked three wide, but faded entering the lane. DRIVE FOR FUN brushed an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, shifted five
wide entering the lane, but gave way after being floated six wide in upper stretch. EMPERADOR was outrun.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) stalked along the inside, easily slipped inside of the leader in upper stretch, gained an advantage coming to the furlong grounds,
inched away to a clear margin at that juncture, then held sway under driving pressure through the late stages. TEMPLE tracked two wide and between
horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and sustained a grinding charge among foes to reach place late. HIGHEST HONORS broke slowly, rated off of the
pace three wide, tucked to the rail while towards the back into the second turn, saved ground while improving turning for home, then chased from behind the
leaders through the lane while lacking the needed rail kick to reach place. CHANNEL MAKER pressed two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane,
vied while getting outkicked by a rail bidding foe in upper stretch, chased that clearing rival into the final furlong, but faltered among foes late. BALTHUS
(IRE) stumbled at the start, settled off of the pace, shifted from the three path to the five path while towards the rear entering the lane, chased with a mild
kick, but steadied behind traffic entering the final sixteenth, altered out and between horses shortly after, and stayed on. MIRA MISSION stalked three wide,
floated four wide entering the lane, outside of inner bidders through midstretch, but yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. CELLIST tracked four
wide, came into the lane six wide, and stayed on between horses in the late stages. RED KNIGHT settled at the rear along the inside, steadied behind foes
into the far turn, then shifted to the four path turning for home before fanning seven wide entering the lane, yet only managed a grinding charge before
leveling off. ARKLOW tracked in midpack along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, shifted off of the fence entering the lane, chased behind
rivals through midstretch, offered a mild kick between horses in the final furlong, but was stymied behind traffic through the late stages. ACCREDIT set the
pace along the inside, vacated the inside into the lane, vied between horses in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. ADMISSION OFFICE
broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide, then in the four path around the second turn, and was outrun around the final bend. BRITISH ROYALTY laid off of
the pace three wide, got keen racing through the lane for the first time, then gave way around the final turn.

Footnotes
ALMANZO tracked three wide, rallied through the lane to bid leaving the furlong grounds, and drew clear. AWESOME CHARGE pressed the pace two wide,
failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, kept on after getting outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, and regained that position from a
weakening rival at the sixteenth pole. IMPENETRABLE set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead, and faltered in
the final furlong. PUDGE BOY PALACE tracked in midpack in the five path, and stayed on. RIKIO chased along the inside, but tired. LUCKY DUDE
stumbled badly and miraculously did not lose his rider at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, and improved. SOUTHERN SENSE laid off of the pace
three wide, checked among foes nearing the turn, then took the bend in the four path, and failed to factor. ROBUST raced in midpack in the two path, but
tired. BODIEFUL tracked in midpack three wide and between horses, but faded around the turn. COOPER TIME broke slowly, showed little, then was
vanned off.
