Footnotes
ICE FLOE showed speed from the outside, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. PURE ELEGANCE
was unhurried early and a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CEEBETT'S BOW was away
alertly and saved ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. COCOTARA tracked the early leaders and raced
evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. MARVEL was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.

BIZNIZ tracked the leaders from the outside, had a good position on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FOURTEEN
DAYS stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. DEVIL IN HER HEART was in range
and roused on the turn but needed more. TERRIFIC LADY was well back and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was
not a factor.

the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. RADCLIFFE was in touch, moved up on the turn and had a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch
but was outfinished. KING OF AWESOME settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. CORA was off the pace and saved ground
on the turn but was never a threat. MAMMOTH SPRING showed speed from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of

Footnotes
MAXIMUM DANGER set the pace, took command far turn and was much the best. MAYITO was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and was clearly
second best. SYNCHROMESH was off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. BIG
BROWN BREWSKII tracked leaders, was in tight on the far turn and finished evenly. DYNAMIC MISSION was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn
but leveled off. ARTIE'S ALL IN was in mid pack and saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire. PRINCESS LAVENDER stalked the early leader but
chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch. OMEGNA was in touch but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
