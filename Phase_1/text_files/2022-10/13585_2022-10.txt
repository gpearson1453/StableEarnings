Footnotes
AVERY BLUE bumped in the beginning, stalked the leader on the inside, drew alongside leaving the bend, kicked clear at the top of the stretch and held
safely. SHOCKING GREY tracked three deep into the turn, roused and gained around the bend, got floated out five wide entering the stretch, finished
willingly while drifting out and earned the place honors. DON'T JU FORGET reserved in the early stages, went three wide into the turn, angled to the inside
late on the bend, finished with a mild rail rally and gained the show. TECUMSEH CAROLINE broke a step slow then got bumped twice in the early going,
tracked on the inside, roused leaving the turn, tipped out in the drive and finished evenly. THREE POINT OH bumped both sides at the start, set the pace in
the two path, clung to a short lead leaving the bend, could not match the winner at the top of the lane and weakened. ADAM'S CREED bumped with inner
rival early, pulled between on the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide and lacked a rally. GOOD BOO JOO came in leaving the gate, stalked up the
backstretch, went three deep around the bend, altered out in upper stretch and could not rally. SHEZMISBEHAVING was off slow to begin, settled off the
pace, raced two wide then three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. STRAWBERRYONTOP came in at the start, raced up close outside the
pacesetter, coaxed through the turn, drifted into the lane and weakened. SISTER'S REVENGE was off a bit slow then steadied behind a rival, bobbled
crossing surfaces, angled to the inside and had to steady entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. BOSSY PEGASUS dropped back to
last early, went three deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
FORE FLAG cleared quickly and crossed over to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, given his cue with a quarter mile left to run, urged left
handed then flagged with the right hand in the final sixteenth and stayed clear. DONNER LAKE was off slow and stumbled shortly after the start, sat off the
pace in the two path or outside a rival, lacked room on the far turn and had to angle to the rail, tipped out in the lane and closed well for the place. TOUCH
OF ZEN threw his head at the start, pulled a bit on the inside near the back, steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out leaving the bend and gained the
show. HOT LEGS ROMOLO was prominent early between rivals into the clubhouse turn then ceded control and was rated in the two path, chased on the
inside into the stretch and lacked a late bid. AGADOR SPARTACUS pulled along the inside early, stalked up the backstretch, steadied into the far turn,
moved out into the lane and went evenly late. DARK MARCUS was off slow to begin, trailed on the inside then moved off the rail around the first turn, went
between rivals on the backstretch, three deep at the quarter pole, moved out further and lacked a rally. ATTENZIONE came away slow, raced two to three
wide on the first turn near the back, went three deep into the far turn, stayed off the rail into the drive and came up empty. ARTISTIC SERVE was off slow to
begin, went up outside the top pair into the first turn, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, was asked three then two wide on the far turn but dropped
back losing positions and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SONIC BREES settled inside, moved off the rail nearing the turn, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, bid three deep into the lane, cleared with a furlong
remaining and gamely prevailed. DIVINE FEMININE chased outside rivals then took the turn five wide, rallied widest through the lane and could not get by
the winner. FIREMAN DAN brushed leaving the gate, raced near the back and climbed a bit while off the rail, coaxed around the turn but paused briefly at
the quarter pole, lacked room in upper stretch, split foes midstretch and finished well for a game third. SAWASDEE bobbled and brushed at the start, up
close early then checked between, stalked the top pair on the inside into the turn, lacked room at the top of the stretch, roused when gaining a clear path,
rallied along the fence but got outkicked. QUICK INTRO stalked off the rail then outside a rival, went three to four wide around the turn, kept on through the
final furlong but needed to find more. WINK AND A DREAM tracked three deep, went four wide into the turn, moved down to the two path, steered out into
the stretch and lacked a rally. SAYERS brushed leaving the gate, went up to duel outside a rival, fought to upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner
and weakened in the furlong grounds. TOM BOMBADIL bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead at the half-mile pole, fought
through the turn still on the rail and weakened down the lane. SMILING AT VAL coaxed from the gate, chased between then suffered a mild shuffle into the
turn, dropped back around the bend while three wide and could not recover. PORT O' CALL bumped leaving the gate, trailed early, saved ground through
the turn and failed to menace.

COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) settled inside, moved into range in the middle stages, continued along the fence through the far turn, steered out in the
stretch, rallied outside the top pair and proved best late. SELL THE DREAM rated in the early going along the inside, moved off the rail and outside the
pacesetter on the backstretch, gave chase two wide into the stretch, drew alongside and took over at the eighth pole, put away QUEENZY with a sixteenth
remaining but was overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. BOLT'S BROAD broke a step slow, tracked three deep around the first turn, rounded
the far turn two wide, came out in the lane then moved back inside and rallied to gain third. FAST AND SHINY pulled and steadied between early, tracked in
the two path, spun three wide into the lane and finished evenly late. QUEENZY cleared and crossed over nearing the clubhouse turn, set all the pace to the
stretch, challenged from outside in upper stretch, relinquished the lead with a furlong to go and flattened in deep stretch. BOLTS BABE broke a step slow on
the inside, checked along the fence early then began to pull early, trailed two wide into the stretch and never threatened. COURT SNORT reserved in the
two path early, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. EXCELIA (IRE) stalked in the two path early, outside the top pair on the backstretch,

ARABIAN LION broke in a bit then went up to establish the front, crossed over to the two path, took pressure from ELWOOD BLUES and moved to the
inside around the bend, was given his cue at the top of the stretch and moved clear, urged right handed with a furlong left to run, then was flagged with the
left hand and drew away under strong handling late. ELWOOD BLUES broke a step slow then went up to chase the pacesetter from outside, applied
pressure around the turn, lost contact in upper stretch, chased willingly through the final furlong but was no match for the winner. NAVY MAN chased the
leader from the inside, roused around the turn and cut the corner into the stretch, could not threaten the top pair and stayed on for a clear third. ROLL ON
BIG JOE stalked three deep into the turn, entered the stretch four wide and weakened. RAJI raced in range in the two path into the turn, steered out in
upper stretch and lacked further response. SMART CODE chased three deep then had his path taken by ARABIAN LION early and lost some ground, raced
outside a rival then three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. STORMING MACHINE broke a step slow, trailed early, went four
wide into the turn, exited three wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and went up to clear and crossed over to the inside, opened up a large lead early,
remained comfortably in front into the stretch and held safely under strong handling and left handed enouragement. COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) settled
off the pace and angled from the three path to the rail on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch racing near the back, took the second turn three then
four wide, rallied and edged SUGAR FIX for second. SUGAR FIX tracked between rivals early, gained two wide through the far turn, took aim in upper
stretch but faltered in the late stages and got edged for the place honors. WARRENS CANDY GIRL was off slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside,
raced two wide on the far turn, altered in with a sixteenth to go and kept on for a minor award. JAVANICA settled inside, got put in tight and steadied at the
five-sixteenths pole, went between rivals in the stretch and failed to threaten. ROCKING REDHEAD tracked three deep early, took the second turn two to
three wide and weakened. NATURAL COLOUR (GB) steadied behind the leader early, chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, saved ground on the
second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
PERFECT FLIGHT raced up close on the outside then moved up to apply pressure, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival and moved
inside while dueling with STREET RUCKUS, resisted into the final sixteenth and held gamely to the wire. EXAULTED rated on the inside, was boxed in with
three furlongs left to run, tipped out at the five-sixteenths pole, lugged in upper stretch, was corrected and steered back outside the top pair, rallied three
deep and missed. STREET RUCKUS chased four wide around the first turn, bid three deep then dueled outside PERFECT FLIGHT leaving the turn, fought
through the lane then got outfinished between rivals late. CODE RUNNER unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved
out in the lane and failed to menace while earning a minor award. NO HANG CHARLIE cleared and steered to the inside, set the pace under pressure up
the backstretch, lost command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the lane. SHORTMAN tracked three deep into the first turn, remained
outside the top pair into the second bend, dropped back and raced two wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
YENG AGAIN was closest in pursuit chasing the top pair in the two path, got carried wide by the leader crossing the dirt, headed rival at the eighth pole and
drove clear in deep stretch. RESPECT THE CODE away quickly then dueled outside a rival for the lead, cleared past the half-mile pole, lugged out crossing
the dirt, clung to a narrow lead with a furlong to go and was no match for the winner late. GO ON stalked two wide or outside a rival out of range around the
turn, got bumped four wide into the stretch and finished well for third. TIME TO PARTY unhurried in the beginning, raced outside rivals four wide into the
turn, moved into the three path around the bend, drifted six wide crossing surfaces, kept trying through the lane but needed to find more late. CLUB ASPEN
sat off the pace two wide, came three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and could not rally. MAGIC MAN tracked off the rail early then angled
to the rail for the turn, drifted out and bumped rival into the stretch and weakened. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) broke inward and came away last, settled early
outside a pair of rivals, came out and entered the stretch seven wide and lacked a rally. ELEVADO raced off the pace on the inside, tipped two wide leaving
the bend, came back to the inside and lacked room along the fence, moved out and weakened. SILENT FURY dueled for the lead from inside, could not
keep up past the half-mile pole, tired in the lane, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
PACKS A WAHLOP rated on the inside then moved outside the pacesetter, bid two wide on the far turn, put a head in front at the eighth pole and kicked
clear under left handed urging and steady handling. CASTLEKNOCK took control early and moved inside, pressured by PACKS A WAHLOP around the far
turn, maintained command to the stretch, resisted in upper stretch then lost command at the eighth pole, could not kick on with the winner late but proved
second best. MALIBU COAST was off slow to begin, stalked the pace on the inside, remained along the rail through the far turn, angled out in upper stretch,
failed to find the needed late kick but kept on to secure the show. GAS ME UP pulled and became rank between rivals early, steadied between rivals on the
first turn, raced between rivals into the far turn in the two path, spun three wide into the lane and lacked the needed late bid. FOR A LAUGH (IRE) was off
slow and shuffled back at the start, was reserved early and guided to the inside, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch and could not rally. DANDY
MAN SHINES (IRE) was off slow to begin, trailed two wide near the back early, went between rivals and continued two wide on the far turn, tipped out into
the stretch and failed to menace. AH JEEZ tracked outside a rival early, three deep in the middle stages, asked four wide into the lane and could not rally.
RUSSELLS HUSTLE was off slow to begin, pulled a bit early, went three deep into the first turn racing at the back, angled to the rail on the far turn and
failed to make an impact. GIVER NOT A TAKER chased three deep then steadied between rivals on the first turn, took the second turn three then two wide
and weakened. SUBURBAN PRINCE forwardly placed in the two path early, chased four deep into the far turn, dropped back around that bend and faded.
DE LA LUNA pulled early, chased four deep around the clubhouse turn, remained wide up the backstretch, angled down to the two path around the far turn
while dropping back and tired.
