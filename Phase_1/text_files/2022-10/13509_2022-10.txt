Footnotes
STRINGFELLA took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, was urged away from the three eighths, rounded the far
turn near the rail then kept alert in the lane. STRONG LIL KOKORO stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and settled for second best. MIO GRACELAND rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. PONTICELLO settled back in the three path on the opening turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well back in the three path the first turn and was not a factor. MASTER THIS
was not a factor. FIGAROS FORTUNE had a brief early lead inside, was caught at the nine sixteenths pole then faded through the backstretch.

EPIC TIME stalked the pace inside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, surged to a clear lead two deep midway on the far turn and drew off the
final furlong. BRIGHT DAWN settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
dug in through the stretch to take second the final strides. CHANGE YOUR LUCK tapered in while closing to the lead past the three quarter pole and rated
the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail and dropped back midway on the far turn, then flattened the final
sixteenth. BLUE N GOLD saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was eased to the
three path into the stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. SEATTLE SAILAWAY ducked in and made contact with Rocket's Castle leaving the gate,
rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. JAXJAXXORJACKS settled
in the two and three paths the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS saved

Footnotes
VIOLENT WONDER rounded the opening turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at
even terms from the five sixteenths, contested the far turn two deep and dug in determinedly to edge clear of WILDCAT GIRL in the final strides, while the
latter rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was met and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, contested
the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod inside the sixteenth pole and relented the final yards. COWGIRL SHINE settled off the rail on the opening turn,
picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn but showed little more in the lane. AMERICAN DREAMER
raced with the early pace two deep then stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted into
the lane and flattened stride. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY rounded the first turn in the four path, entered the backstretch outside and gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn but showed little more. MISS GRAND SLAM stalked from the three path through the front stretch, gave
chase into the first turn but faded toward the five sixteenths pole. EMPTY ENVELOPE saved ground racing well back on the first turn, eased out past the
half mile pole but showed little response through the backstretch. CHARACTER COUNTS showed little response.
