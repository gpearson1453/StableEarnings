came off the rail at the head of the stretch hooked up with that rival at the quarter pole and inched up and was able to put the head in front in the final yards.
RED BOTTOM REBEL was away a step slow to trail the field out of the gate but quickly got into stride and took the lead along the rail was challenged into
the turn then hooked up with LIL MISS DE BUY at the quarter pole and the pair staged a stretch long duel still held the lead 50 yards from the wire but was
caught in the final yards. GOODNIGHTLOVING raced along the inside and when RED BOTTOM REBEL came off the rail turning for home slipped into

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN ROSE was away in good order took the lead along the inside at the quarter pole was challenged and headed on the turn came back and
opened a clear lead at the top of the stretch and held gamely for the win. UNPLUCKED GEM was wide from the outset and was forced four wide on the turn
and then five to six wide turning for home closed ground on the turn but could never get to the winner in a solid effort. DERONDA was well off the early pace
came through along the inside and closed with a rush to get third while never a threat to the top two. FASHIONABLY QUICK was up close in the two path
and put a head in front on the turn but gave way through the stretch. MISS IZZY BEE settled along the inside mid pack continued on the rail through the turn
but had no rally through the stretch. HATCHET GURL was up close to the pace while three wide was in contention until the field turned for home and then
dropped back. AL'S PRINCESS went right to the back from the outset and was never a factor.

CALL THE SHOTS was in the two path off the pace lost some ground on the turn and entering the stretch but came on with a strong rush in the final
hundred yards and was up at the wire. D'WILD MUFFIN showed good early speed and had the rail opened a good lead in the stretch but shortened stride in
the final yards and could not hold off the winner. DONNAS FINAL WORD came three wide on the turn to get into contention but could not get to the top two
and had to settle for third. NEON DREAMS was away in good order and was close to the leaders before the first quarter dropped back quickly along the
inside then came on again along the inside through the stretch for a minor share. OUT OF THE SKY arced along the inside in the middle of the pack but
never mounted a rally. THAT'S ALL RIGHT raced in the middle of the pack but was five wide and could not make up ground. OVER EXPOSED raced along
the inside and never mounted a rally. MILLI STARR was four wide throughout and never mounted a rally. HEY ROXY was up close for the first three eighths
and then dropped back quickly while wide on the turn. LANKY LOU trailed the entire race and was never a factor.

LA ROSA DRIVE sprinted away from the gates and opened a big lead and got to the rail by the first turn was given a breather up the backstretch then
opened up again and, once again, was given a breather on the second turn but was able to pull clear again to win going away. BEHOLD THAT WORD was
allowed to settle in the back of the pack well off the pace along the inside was still well back turning for home but made a strong run through the stretch on
the inside to be up for second. AWESOME SUNSET was away slow to trail in the early stages made a big move four to five wide on the first turn to get into
contention was closest to the leader turning for home but could not hold second. ATOKA GIRL was mid pack while in the two path and four wide entering
the stretch and could not make up ground. STARLIGHT TWIST raced along the rail but had no rally in the stretch. GOLD PASS was towards the back then
made a sweeping five wide move up the backstretch to get into contention but could not sustain that rally and tired. RYRYSWEETIE was four wide into the
first turn and then dropped back and was not a factor.
