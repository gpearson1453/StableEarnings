JONNY QUIST pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid leaving the three eighths and quickly drew clear, then remained clear by the furlong marker
and then maintained a safe margin to the wire under left handed crop urging. LA PAZ chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive and
rallied, second best. HANFORD was well placed along the inside, then advanced mildly two wide by the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest.
JUSTICEOFTHEPEACE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened on the turn. BAILEY COFFEE steadied slightly into the first turn, then settled
four to three wide and was not a threat.

HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH showed good speed on the outside to set a pressured pace three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, then drifted out
in the final furlong while remaining clear, driving. OUTSPEND chased the pace on the outside and was four wide by the quarter pole while advancing,
bumped with PENNIES PRINCESS leaving the turn, angled in leaving the furlong marker but failed to gain on the winner, second best. ROSE OF
SHANAKILL pressed the early pace on the inside, then fell back on the turn, swung out wide leaving the turn and held the show award. HOP TO A
DECISION was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked the needed rally. PENNIES PRINCESS chased the early pace from between rivals, then
advanced three wide by the quarter pole, bumped leaving the turn and weakened. HAZARD was off a step slow, shifted to the outside and had no response
while wide.

FAIRY DUST set the pressured pace from the inside while being well handled, kicked clear leaving the turn and drew out to prove much the best while being
ridden out. LUSCIOUS LOLA tracked the pace on the inside, then was boxed nearing the quarter pole, forced way out and came three wide into the lane but
proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS was allowed to settle three to four wide, came six wide into the lane
and was along for the show award. COUNTESS SHANAKILL pressed the pace three wide, then was two to three wide on the turn and was bumped nearing
the quarter pole and forced out four wide and then was empty in the lane.
