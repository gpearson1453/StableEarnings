Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO stalked the pace three wide, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. UNCAPTURED KING raced well back four wide
and ran on to gain the place the in the final strides. POSITIVELY AWESOME vied inside early, angled out when VINNIE VAN GO cleared nearing the
half-mile pole, re-bid two wide between foes around the turn, turned for home on near even terms and weakened. VINNIE VAN GO set the pace along the
rail and tired in the drive. CATCHING FISH raced off the pace two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. NACHO PAPA chased
the pace inside and dropped back while in tight at the rail through most of the stretch. PALADIO broke outwardly and bumped POSEIDON at the start, raced
three wide and never threatened. POSEIDEN was bumped at the start, raced three wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
CATCHING MAGIC raced from wellback in the four path, shifted inside around the turn, drifted back out to the four path while taking aim in upper stretch,
and drew past in the final furlong. KNIGHTS BIRD dueled from inside, opened up slightly into the lane, but yielded late to place. CAJUN RED got bumped
by an outer foe at the start, was held up from the three path early, shifted in while looking for room around the turn, floated out to the five path into the
stretch, but finished evenly for show. EXTRACTION WILL stalked in the two path, steadied slightly from the four path turning into the lane, but was one
paced. BAKER BLOCK broke in and bumped an inner foe, chased in the five path, took aim while swinging out to the seven path into the stretch, but
flattened. MINISTER QUINN dueled for the early lead from the three path but gave way around the turn. TRAVELINGBLUESMAN trailed into the stretch
and was no menace. BEN RUMSON tracked in the four path but backed up starting around the turn.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN ANTHONY settled off the pace along the inside, made a quick bid at the rail inside of a trio around the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths
pole, angled in to the three path turning for home and surged clear under a drive. TIZADUKE stalked the pace in the four path around the far turn, bid three
wide between foes midway around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. MATEO tracked the
pace in the two path, clipped heels near the three-eighths pole, dropped back in the six path thereafter then kept trying and gained the show.
BEFRIENDTHEENEMY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BUDDHA BOY stalked the pace three wide, bid four wide into the far turn but
came up empty in the lane. BREEZE BABY advanced four wide to the lead around the first turn, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and into
the far turn but was faltered midway around the bend. KAIZEN broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground and made little impact. TACTICAL STRIKE was outrun
inside.

Footnotes
FULL DISCLOSURE led from inside, was roused while floating out to the six path going into the stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. HEALS THE
SOUL prompted the pace from the three path, was cued to bid while being floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and was repelled by the
winner but ran on to secure place. ADIOS GARY stalked from inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and kept on for show. NEOPHYTE
rated along the inside, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but finished evenly. DOO WOP DON chased from the four path, was ridden along in
the three path turning into the lane, but was one paced. BIRD WILDCAT tracked in the three path early but faded going into the stretch. BLACK SEAL was
behind in the four path early and never threatened.

Footnotes
DUBSTEP had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace inside, made good progress inside down the backstretch, bid at the rail entering the turn,
drew clear near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the three path nearing the top of the stretch and held clear under a drive. STARE IF YOU MUST
raced well back two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and stayed on for the place. AMORE MOON raced
in range two wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and churned on for the show. FLAT OUT COOL raced in range three wide, made
some progress still three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and evened out. KILKENNY BELLA raced off the early pace in the
four path, angled to the rail entering the far turn, appeared to hit the rail squeezing through near the five-sixteenths pole, angled back out soon after and
lacked the needed rally. BELLA MIURA saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. LORD JOAN was outrun inside.
BULLET ON TAP set the pace in the three path around the first turn, cleared off early on the backstretch, angled in and tired around the far turn. DEADLY
TRAIL saved ground and failed to menace. BREEZY CONNECTION had early speed in the two path and retreated around the far turn. JAMAICAN
INVADER was outrun while racing three and four wide.

TURBO pressed in the four path, took over when cued around the turn, drifted out through the stretch, but drew clear. DANGEROUS RIDE stalked in the
two path, was driven from the three path into the lane, ran on and dug in to place. SOUPER BLESSING rated from inside, was coaxed from the two path
around the turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on but hung late to show. BIG SAVE tracked in the three path, was hustled from the
five path around the turn, got floated out to the eight path in the stretch, but was tired. NO NAME DUDE led from the three path early but yielded midway
around the turn. BOLD MAJESTIC missed the break, broke in, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DORTH VADER stalked the pace two wide, took the lead between foes near the three-eighths pole, dueled inside of CHARLIE'S WISH from the quarter
pole to the eighth pole then kicked clear through the final furlong. CHARLIE'S WISH settled off the early pace outside, bid three wide nearing the
three-eighths pole, dueled outside of the winner from there past the eighth pole and was clearly second best. ESOTERIC bumped with EXTRA INDY soon
after the start, raced off the pace four and five wide and was along for the show. ALTERNATE ROCK had early speed while in tight at the rail down the
backstretch, angled four wide leaving the three-eighths pole and faded. HOAX set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the quarter pole. EXTRA
INDY bumped with ESOTERIC soon after the start, chased the pace inside and had no response.

Footnotes
SEA HUNTER (IRE) stalked the leading trio from inside, angled out under coaxing to bid from the five path into the lane, took the lead passing the eighth
pole, and held on willingly. COOLER KING steadied after the start, rated from the four path, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place.
CHRISTENSEN prompted the pace while three wide, led under a drive into the lane, but flattened out late for show. WOLF HUNTER pressed between rivals
but faded in the stretch. GEM COLLECTION trailed from three path early and was no factor. SKI COUNTRY was wellback in the five path early and was
never a threat. ENJOYABLE MISCHIEF led from inside but gave way at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
WAR OF AGES dueled from inside, was cued to open up into the lane, and held gamely. FAWNING bumped and steadied after the start, trailed from the
four path, moved up while five wide around the turn, drifted out to the nine path into the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. SIX FEET APART
dueled from two wide, was roused midway around the turn, floated out to the four path into the lane, and kept on for show. FROSTY BREW stalked in the
four path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, but finished evenly. HARD TO CAPTURE raced in midpack while two wide, slightly steadied into the
turn, but was no factor. SMOOTH PEBBLE hit the gate and got squeezed after the start, rated in the two path, moved up between foes around the turn, but
flattened in the stretch. DANNYHILL bumped an inner foe after the start, tracked in the five path but was empty in the stretch. CROSSTALK chased from
inside but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
LUCK IN THE DUSK was extremely reluctant to load, raced off the pace four wide, circled five wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole,
quickly cleared, angled to the rail in upper stretch, just lasted and bumped the runner-up a few strides past the wire. BEACH READY saved ground off the
pace, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn, closed through the lane, just missed and was bumped a few strides after the wire. SHERLYN
GO GO tracked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, angled out when the winner cleared in upper stretch and flattened out a bit
late. STARLIT SOFI was bounced around repeatedly at the start, raced in range between foes early, chased inside around the far turn and improved
position in the lane. SOUPER SLEWS CASH set the pace along the rail and weakened through the lane. BLACK ICE failed to menace while racing three
wide around the first turn and six wide around the far turn. SOFIA D 'AMORE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two and three wide and tired
around the far turn. PROMINENCIA tracked the pace four wide, had aim turning for home and faded in the drive. ELISSA JOE was pinballed between rivals
at the start, dropped well back in the two path, made a little progress five wide around the far turn and had little left for the drive. STURDY GIRL saved
ground around the turns, angled out near the quarter pole and had no response. UPSTREET was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and
retreated around the far turn. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BEACH AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
