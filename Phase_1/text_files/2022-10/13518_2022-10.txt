Footnotes
LUCKY MUCHO MAN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced near the quarter pole, swung three wide for
home, came inwards bumping NORTH POLE straightened away, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch to the finish in game fashion and prevailed
by a head on the wire. NORTH POLE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took narrow command spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, got bumped straightened away by the aforementioned foe, dug in dueling through to the finish gamely but was ultimately bested at
the end. VINNY TWO CENTS broke in at the start under coaxing, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
yielded the front near the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. REUNION TOUR coaxed from the start, chased five then
four wide, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. LEFTY'S WAR chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside
at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. RIVER OF NO RETURN chased three then two wide, suffered a catastrophic
injury near the seven-sixteenths and fell heavily to the ground, was attended to by veterinarian and was subsequently euthanized on track.

Footnotes
LUNA'S SONG broke in and hit the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, was roused while closer to the three path
coming to the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. KARA PARA brushed with a
rival at the start, was well placed while coaxed along just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, angled out while asked for her best in upper stretch
and safely secured the place while unable to match the winner. SWEET LIBERTY broke a half-step slow, settled on the far outside, gained in the five path
around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. SPINNING
COLORS went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the advantage to the winner under
urging in upper stretch and tired. SHOWEMYOURHEELS was forwardly placed on the outside, went around the turn in the three path, chased the winner
into the final furlong and came up empty. IRISH EMPRESS bumped twice with a foe at the start and was off a step slow, settled at the rear, moved from the
rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. BODE'S GIRL broke in and bumped twice with a foe, settled off the pace, dropped well behind while three
to the five path around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MASABEEH was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the lead coming to the
quarter-pole, came out a bit into upper stretch, fought back inside of the runner-up, regained the advantage near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under
strong urging. OUR JESSICA pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path around the turn, gained the lead approaching the quarter-pole,
fought outside of the winner into the final furlong, lost the advantage back to the winner at the sixteenth-pole and missed while clear for the place. IN MY
WAKE was well placed down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into upper stretch, moved out and
a made a brief bid into the final furlong then was outfinished while clear for the show. HOLIDAY JAZZ was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the
five path around the turn and lacked the needed response. ICE KREEM SUNDAE bumped with a rival at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several
lengths, was urged at the rear, went four wide around the turn, drifted in at the furlong marker and was no factor. INFRINGEMENT was urged along on the
outside, angled in near the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the two path under strong encouragement and failed to respond. ELEGANT LAOBAN
stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, was urged well off the pace, rounded the turn in the two
path and was no factor. ONE TRACK MINE broke awkwardly and was off a step slow, settled off the early pace, moved in under urging late on the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

upper stretch between foes, dug in under a drive as the field stacked across the track and took over narrow command a furlong out, fought on game to the
finish clinging to the lead before inching away in the late going to prevail. FORESTWOOD LANE vied early on before backing off some to chase four wide,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide for home, ran on to secure the place honors. MR. BRIGGS vied early on from the two path

and was collared just outside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. FOREVER WICKED got bumped at the start by SCOTTY due to

Footnotes
MOSIENKO settled off the pace, raced between foes while two then three wide around the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further
out, chased the runner-up on the outside into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and got up under strong urging to prevail. PATTY H went to the
front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two to three path around the turn, responded well when set down inside the
three-sixteenths, led to the final stride but was denied while clear for the place. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled off the pace, was roused in the two path
on the turn, chased the top two under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the show. SECRET LOVE bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to
track the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MOVIE MOXY bumped
with a foe at the start then dropped back, was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the four path around the turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HONEY MONEY moved in early then was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was
asked outside the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch and failed to respond. BANK ON ANNA moved out then stalked the leader on the
outside of that foe, was asked in the three path while between foes on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ABLETON broke out at the start trading a bump with TOGA DANCER who broke inwards, dueled briefly with IMPAZIBLE PRINCE before shaking off that
rival five and a half furlongs from home to hold sole command, tucked three then two wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive under tepid threat from flanking challengers before holding sway and safe to the finish kept busy to the
end. SENSE A GIANT bumped at the start by KIMBO DANCER due to pressure from THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, ran on under a drive but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. ADDICTED TO YOU toss his head and was caught
in the hands of the assistant starter at the start getting away last and conceding five to six lengths to the front, chased three wide from the tail of the field
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. THE
SLEEPYCHIPMUNK broke out at the start bumping KIMBO DANCER into SENSE A GIANT, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in to briefly threaten near the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. TOGA DANCER broke in at the
start trading a bump with ABLETON, chased five then four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response.
IMPAZIBLE PRINCE bobbled at the break, showed brief speed dueling with ABLETON early until shaken off with five and a half furlongs to go, chased four
then five wide, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. KIMBO DANCER got bumped at the start by THE SLEEPCHIPMUNK and in turn bumped SENSE
A GIANT, chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, spun two to three wide for home and faltered. There was a Stewards' Inquiry
into the start focusing on ADDICTED TO YOU. After review, it was deemed that ADDICTED TO YOU did not receive a fair start when tangled in the hands
of the assistant starter and therefore ADDICTED TO YOU was declared a non starter prior to the race being declared official.
