Footnotes
COMMANDER KHAI stumbled a bit but recovered quickly and went to the front outside a pair of rivals, cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the
way along the rail to the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole and held under hand urging. ONE SILK STOCKING bumped leaving the gate, settled three
deep, inched closer around the turn, rallied outside the winner but ran out of time. DANIEL'S MAGIC tracked the pace from inside, got blocked behind rival
entering the turn, stayed inside the tipped out into the stretch, steered out further in the lane, put in late run and gained the show. BOCHOMBO broke out
and bumped on both sides, showed early speed between rivals then chased outside a foe up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide and finished
evenly late. KIMMER was unhurried on the inside, saved ground through the turn, summoned a mild rally up the rail but needed to find more late. SANTOS
TO WILSON pressed the pace from inside early then chased the leader past the half-mile pole, tossed his head entering the turn, kept inside through the
turn, became rank again with a furlong remaining and weakened. BRIT'S WIT got bumped on both sides at the start, traveled off the pace then moved into
range between rivals, took the turn two to three wide, tipped out in the lane and lacked a rally. SITTIN ON GO bumped leaving the gate then took up shortly
after, raced outside a rival, trailed three then two wide on the turn and weakened.

ICY FLAVOR dueled for the lead outside a rival, cleared past the quarter pole and held safely under left handed urging. OUR SHINING LIGHT (IRE) broke a
step slow, stalked off the inside then tugged the rider up alongside the top pair, chased three then two wide around the turn, finished willingly in the drive but
had to settle for second best. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY stumbled leaving the gate, sat off the pace, angled out and got bumped four wide into the stretch,
summoned a mild response and bested the rest. IVORY SKY bumped from inside the start, steered to the inside after dropping back, tipped two wide on the
turn, was caught in traffic and altered inward then altered back out in upper stretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. PRECEDENT chased inside
rivals early on, got put in tight and steadied at the three-eighths pole then again near the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch and kept on
while unable to threaten. U R PRESSED bumped outside rival at the start, moved into range between in the two path, angled to the rail around the bend,
went between foes at the sixteenth marker and lacked a rally. NAUGHTY NIKO dropped back early, raced between foes then two wide into the turn, angled
to the rail then steered back out and came three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and improved position. FACETIOUS chased three deep early
on, between foes on the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. CONCH DADDY dueled for the lead from inside, lost touch with the leader past the
quarter pole and weakened down the lane. STRAIGHTTODASOURCE bobbled crossing onto the dirt, chased three deep then four wide into the lane and
was not a factor. AN ARMY OF LIGHT stalked the top pair from outside, brushed with inner rival five deep entering the turn, bumped outer rival while three
wide entering the stretch, got crowded and steadied in upper stretch and weakened. OUR JOURNEY chased four deep then got put in tight, brushed and
steadied on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE HARBOR stalked in the two path, went between foes on the backstretch, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, took over late on the bend,
kicked clear at the top of the stretch and drew off. KITTEN CALLS chased five deep into the turn then moved into the three path, took aim three deep at the
quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner but was clearly second best. TROJAN WAY led three deep into the first turn, cleared and crossed over to the
inside, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost command soon after and flattened to third. SHEZ OUR ARCH
stumbled leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail, went two then three wide on the far turn, passed tired rivals but was unable to
threaten. RELUCTANT broke a step slow, went four deep into the first turn then angled to the two path, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, got put in
a bit tight at the five-sixteenths pole, lost ground and came three wide into the stretch and faded. PRINCESS CATERINA coaxed from the gate and was
forwardly placed on the inside, dropped back under coaxing on the far turn, entered the lane two wide and tired.

Footnotes
FEATHERS (IRE) unhurried on the inside, tipped between rivals on the far turn then lacked room at the quarter pole, gained a clear path then angled out in
upper stretch, flew late and inhaled the runner-up. GALLOVIE (GB) broke well and settled in a stalking position in the two path, drew closer into and on the
far turn, challenged three deep in upper stretch, quickly took over, moved clear but got run down by the winner late. LOUD LOUD MUSIC stalked the pace
along the rail, put in a bid from inside at the top of the stretch but could not match the top pair in the final furlong. KUORA (PER) brushed leaving the gate,
raced between foes then two wide off the pace, angled out on the far turn and spun five wide into the lane, produced a mild rally and earned a minor award.
DRAW ME brushed leaving the gate then steadied briefly shortly after, traveled three deep off the pace, outside a rival on the backstretch, angled in on the
far turn but needed to find more in the final furlong. NOVELLA tracked two wide out of range, pushed on through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
lacked a rally. KITTYHAWK LASS unhurried on the inside at the back, tipped two then three wide on the far turn and failed to menace. BLUSHING (FR)
broke out and bumped rival, sped clear and moved inside, held a diminished around the far turn and into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened. ZABAVA took a bumped from inside at the start, raced two wide outside a rival at the back on the first turn, raced three deep at the
five-sixteenths pole then four wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. HOT ON THE TRAIL settled three wide early, came four wide into the lane,
lost her path in upper stretch and could not recover. MISS HARD KNOCKS threw her head at the start, chased three wide to the stretch and faded. OREO'S
DREAM traveled off the pace on the inside, had to check back with three furlong left to run, dropped back to last around the bend and weakened.

MODERA took a bump from HIALEAH HOTTIE early then dueled from outside, held a short lead between rivals through the turn, resisted through the lane
and held gamely. HIALEAH HOTTIE drifted in and bumped MODERA early, ceded command and stalked outside the top pair in hand, vied three deep
around the turn, kept the pressure on through the lane and could not get by. BRUINS MASTERY broke a step slow, tracked three to four wide around the
bend and gained the show. LA PALOMA BLANCA stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to duel from inside, fought with rivals around the turn,
lost touch into the stretch and weakened. SHORT JOURNEY hit the gate at the start, raced near the back then trailed into the turn, traveled three deep at
the five-sixteenths pole and failed to menace. FAST INVESTMENT broke a step slow, chased on the inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and
came up empty. SHES A KILLA QUEEN tossed her head and hit the gate to come away slow, traveled along the rail then moved into the two path on the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SCHOOL DANCE got bumped from inside entering the first turn, raced in mid-pack outside a rival, angled four wide into the stretch, rallied to the front with a
sixteenth remaining, kicked clear and won going away. RVALENTINA bumped leaving the gate, was rated on the inside early, drew closer up the
backstretch, drew up on even terms into the far turn, dueled and took over around that bend, cleared into the stretch, overtaken by the winner at the
sixteenth pole and held the place. DOLLY MAY (IRE) stalked two wide early, between runners into the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and was no
match for the top pair. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER broke a step slow on the outside, tracked three deep then outside a rival on the first turn, remained two
wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and produced a mild rally to round out the suprfecta. ROCK THE BOURBON bumped leaving the gate then took
a bumped from outside early, traveled between foes then in the two path off the pace, was coaxed on the inside through the far turn, moved out with a
furlong remaining and improved position. BEACHGRASS bumped leaving the gate then bumped with outside rival into the first turn, raced in mid-pack and
moved closer up the backstretch, asked right handed around the bend while shifting to the two path, switch to the left hand in the lane and flattened out.
WITCH MOON bumped in the beginning, trailed on the inside early, moved out in the middle stages, went between rivals on the far turn, came out into the
stretch and was not a factor. ICE QUEEN drifted in and bumped rival early, reserved in the two path then steered to the inside, saved ground to the lane,
lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out past the eighth pole and could not regain momentum. LIZY D bumped leaving the gate, got put in tight along the rail
on the first turn then settled inside near the back, saved ground to the stretch and failed to make an impact. SENSIBLE MOVE broke in and bumped rival at
the start, lost path and steadied early, got forced out into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROPERS N WRANGLERS broke well and took a comfortable
lead early, was headed entering the far turn, dueled around the bend and relinquished control, then gave way in the stretch. RUN FOR MY HONEY pulled
early then stalked in the two path, raced three deep into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and faded.
