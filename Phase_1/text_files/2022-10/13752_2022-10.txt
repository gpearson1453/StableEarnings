Footnotes
LIGURIA went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide outside the
quarter-pole, rallied six wide into upper stretch and closed strongly to get up late. ERNA went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the
way with a clear advantage, was asked while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a strong hand-ride
into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead after being put to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter and was caught while clear for the place.
THEGIRLFROMIRELAND showed speed while taken in hand between horses early, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace down the
backstretch, was asked in the three path on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while
able to get the show. JUST A SPLASH (IRE) bumped repeatedly with KEEP IT SEXY down the opening straightaway, saved ground while reserved off the
pace, steadied against the rail at the seven-sixteenths then was roused, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch then
quickly tipped to the seven path and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. KEEP IT SEXY bumped repeatedly with JUST A SPLASH down
the initial straightaway, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. NYXED was
hustled from the gate, went four then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, vied in the two
path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered. PASSIONATE DREAM dropped to the rear early, rounded the first turn in the two path,
settled at the back, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. TREASURED GEM went four then three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards
the rear, came under urging in the two path on the final turn and failed to respond. INVEST WISELY was hustled from the start, saved ground while well
placed just off the pace, was given her cue on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated. SOURCES AND USES went three wide on the first

drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. HATCH chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, dug in dueling to the finish with MAJOR SPIN and bested that rival for the place honors while offering up a mild kick. MAJOR SPIN broke in at the
start bumping BASIS RISK and SWIFT TAP in tandem with pressure inside from SKYLANDER breaking outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, dug in knocking heads to the finish with the aforementioned foe, offered up a mild bid but was ultimately bested
for the place honors while clear for the show. BLAKE B. chased four to five wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch
and stayed on one paced to the finish. SKYLANDER broke out at the start bumping SWIFT TAP into BASIS RISK against pressure outside from the

Footnotes
EVVIE JETS pulled under restraint while tracking the pace in the two path, was confidently handled around the far turn, gained to make a bid in the three
path at the quarter-pole, took the lead while set down in upper stretch, drifted in into the final furlong and held under a strong hand-ride to the wire. PLUM
ALI was hustled from the gate then taken in hand before the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was reserved at the rear, leveled out nearing
the half-mile pole, came under urging with three furlongs to run, traveled around the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch then quickly
moved to the five path, gained outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to just get the place. MESSIDOR (IRE) was taken under a tight hold
early then rated three wide on the outside, came under urging on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and
finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to earn the show. POR QUE NO was hustled to the front, showed the way under restraint on the
inside with a clear advantage, was let out some midway down the backstretch, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, spun off the inside into the
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths, was carried in by that foe into the final furlong and out-kicked then missed the trifecta.
KEPT WAITING was taken in hand early then became rank along the rail under restraint, tugged hard at the bit through the first turn, leveled out before the
half-mile pole, saved ground while roused on the far turn and faltered.

AGUA DULCE (GB) was hustled to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in
upper stretch, extended the advantage coming to the eighth-pole, responded well under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and held under strong
urging. AKAYLA (IRE) bumped soundly with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside down the backstretch, moved from the two
path to the four path around the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy to garner the place. R
ROSE' ALL DAY went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the
stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and finished with good courage to just get the show. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE was well placed just off the
pace on the inside, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner to the wire and just missed the
show. LETTER OF GOLD rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the
stretch then moved further out and gained but flattened out in the end. MILIEU bumped soundly with a rival at the start, became rank under restraint nearing
the first turn, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was roused on the final turn and failed to threaten. ON THE PAYROLL stalked the pace on the
outside in the three path, was given her cue on the far turn, chased past the quarter-pole, was taken up off the heels of the leader into upper stretch and
tired. MORE THAN A DIVA tossed her head while rank along the rail early, saved ground while reserved off the pace, moved to the two path late on the far
turn, was roused near the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. WILL BE FAMOUS broke out then was corrected by the rider, went two to three
wide on the first turn, settled outside near the middle of the field, was roused while two to three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then
moved further out and capitulated.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL CITY stumbled at the start and was last to commence, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was reserved on the inside, moved
closer late on the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole, moved out for
room in upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth then powered clear to prove much the best. MACKINNON was bit keen while
showing speed in hand early, prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, took over into the stretch, led under a drive to just before the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but just held the place. GRAND SONATA saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, traveled around the far
turn in the two path while held up some behind horses, was roused four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly able
to get the show. WICKED FAST angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground while unhurried at the back, was roused late on the far turn, cut the corner
into the stretch, moved off the rail in the drive and finished with good energy to just miss the trifecta while up for the last spot in the superfecta.
CONSTITUTIONLAWYER showed speed on the inside of two foes, backed off the pace passing the wire for the first time, became keen into the first turn,
tugged hard at the bit while two path to the inside, was rated just off the pace, saved ground while let out on the far turn, shifted three wide at the
quarter-pole, was carried out in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked. ST ANTHONY went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, was roused three wide between foes on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. NANTASKET BEACH showed speed while in hand,
set the pace on the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. LIMITED
LIABILITY traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was reserved on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths,
came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BE BETTER went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, chased three
wide on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and came up empty. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) went four wide on the first turn, was
reserved on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
STEADY ON went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed behind the solo leader, moved closer midway down the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth then drew clear
under steady handling. JAVA BUZZ went clear early, opened up in the two path while needing extra left-rein pressure, was let out on the far turn then
roused nearing the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held the place. INTERNAL
CAPITAL brushed with a foe just after the start, bumped with a rival early, moved in nearing the first turn, settled on the inside, shifted three wide into the
stretch, gained in the final furlong, came between horses into the final sixteenth and improved for the show. CHULAINN saved ground on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show.
EMBOITE (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with another foe early, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, had the rider lose his crop inside the
three-sixteenths and weakened. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS broke out at the start, jostled with a foe nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was
rated outside but with cover, raced four wide on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. IMPULSIVENESS jostled with a foe while between horses nearing the first turn then was taken up some while in tight quarters, went around that
bend in the two path, settled towards the back, was roused while two to three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and was no factor.
MY BOY PADDY broke out and bumped with an opponent, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved outside at the back but with cover, raced five
wide under urging on the far turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GHOST GIANT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the sixteenth pole, inched clear under a drive kept to task. PHANTOM SMOKE three then two
wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command near
the sixteenth marker, then ran on to secure the place honors. NEURO two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors. YARROW chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot. KLICKITAT chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was out-finished in the late stages. NOT PHAR NOW coaxed from the
start, knocked heads early on with DEEP COVER before establishing sole command, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning just
off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late going. BREW PUB hustled from the
gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DEEP COVER dueled early to the
inside of NOT PHAR NOW before chasing along the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
