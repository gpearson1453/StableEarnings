Footnotes
MO WINE PLEASE tracked along from the three path, sifted inside around leg weary rival nearing the quarter pole, then shifted outside leader nearing the
top of the stretch, game fight through the lane, got the nod in final jumps. ANY MINUTE nice early speed, briefly dueled into the turn, put away inside foe
around the turn, clear lead nearing the quarter pole, outside pressure came calling turning for home, fought on hard through the wire. RUNNER slow to start,
raced along the inside into the turn, shifted around foes leaving the three eighths pole, good energy through the stretch. RICKYS REVENGE slow start,
raced off the pace till midway turn, split rivals nearing the quarter pole, moved inside late, even strides to the wire. ROCKY DICE very slow into stride, raced
well off the pace around the turn, moved past the faders late. LOVED AGAIN raced off the pace and four deep, moved up around the outside on the turn,
empty stretch. DRUM AND DRUMMER sent to the front early, dueled along the inside heading into the turn, outrun stretch.

pursuit around the turn, bid stalled nearing the furlong marker. JACKSON ROAD step slow at the start, raced four deep and off the pace into the turn, mild
gain outside late. SILVER PHANTOM brief speed, inside around the turn, outrun through the lane. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY clean start from the outside,

hand ride through the stretch. PRINCIPE rated between runners around the first turn, stayed off the pace three deep into far turn, shifted out five wide for
the stretch run, along late for the place. MAYBE IT'S TIME easy speed around the first, coaxed along into far turn, caught from the the outside midway far
turn, even stretch. SETTE STELLE three wide around the first turn, off the pace into far turn, five wide leaving the quarter pole, never a factor. THE REGION

Footnotes
ICE BAR nice clean trip, tracked the leader from the three path into far turn, moved up easily to contest the lead, clear leaving the quarter pole, shook off
only threat nearing the furlong marker, steady drive through the wire. ONLY CHILD nice tracking two wide position around the first turn , stayed off the rail
and between runners into far turn, shifted out four wide for clear run leaving the quarter pole, second best today. MERCURY TEN sent strait away to the
front, controlled the tempo into far turn, under outside pressure leaving the quarter pole, finished even through the wire. DIAMANTE DE ORO step slow at
the start, moved along between runners into far turn, no head way late. DUBROVNIK slow into stride, raced off the pace and just off the rail into far turn,
mild move in deep stretch. CHERRYS CROSS four wide around the first turn, tracked off the pace and three deep, no late gain. GREGORIA'S BAY ground
saving trip, lost ground along the inside far turn, outrun stretch.
