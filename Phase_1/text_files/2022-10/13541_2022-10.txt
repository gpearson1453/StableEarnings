Footnotes
JACK'S LILLY rated close in the two and three paths, challenged and took the nod at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point,
contested the advantage two deep on the far turn, drew clear toward the eighth pole and drew off under steady stretch handling. LINDA'S TAJ tapered to
the inside and rated the pace, was met and dueled at mostly even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail
on the far turn, dropped back entering the stretch and had to settle for second best. CAN'T FIGURE bobbled leaving the gate then stalked inside, bid
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER settled in the three path
the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and showed little in the lane. PRINCESS MIA
ROSE saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DALLAS was slow early and raced well back. KOKOLORES
rounded the first turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SKYFLY rated a slim lead inside on the first turn, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily
handled in the lane. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE settled off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, was bumped in the
vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. DYLADDIE stalked the early pace
between horses then eased out past the half mile pole, picked up the chase at the three eighths, angled in and made contact with Holiday Connection in the
vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, was forced outward into the lane and flattened stride. MIDDLE ISLAND steadied off the
heels of Holiday Connection into the first turn then left the turn outside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path
and flattened in the lane. I B NASTY settled back off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn.
TINAS SHINING STAR saved ground. HOLIDAY CONNECTION angled in entering the first turn and stalked three wide, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole but was pinched back and bumped into Alittlesliceof Pie in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.
Following a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Dyladdie for interference in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, lodged by
the rider of Holiday Connection, there was no change.

Footnotes
INDIANA RED rated close inside through the front stretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the head
of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. DRUM AND BASS rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
was met at the rail approaching the head of the lane, raced close to mid-stretch but relented later yards. GOLD GUY saved ground on the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. POLITICAL DECISION
stalked the early pace two deep, bolted approaching the seven sixteenths but straightened course and gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the
turn in the six path and showed little further. SCHOOLYARD BULLY rounded the opening turn in the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, then weakened at the rail on the far turn. DATA DEAL settled in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened while losing ground on the far turn. CITIZEN'S FIRE was never a factor.
