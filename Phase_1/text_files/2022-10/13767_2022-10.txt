vied briefly. BOGARTS VICTRESS lacked needed finish. PECOS RIVER QUEEN no real threat. NV PAINT MY DESTINY ducked in start, bumped both
sides early. RIII DE AXE came up empty. TH MISS MOON SHINE hopped start, rank, bounced between rivals early. JJ FIRST DOWN DASH very fractious
gate, bumped hard early. LETHAL WOMEN bumped, shut off, steadied.
