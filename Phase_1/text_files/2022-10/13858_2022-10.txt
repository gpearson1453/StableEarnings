Footnotes
JERRY JEFF WALKER was hustled leaving the break, set a pressured early pace, shook free nearing the quarter marker, was confronted by SUN AND
SURF inside of the eighth pole, determinedly held that foe at bay to deep stretch and got the nod in the final strides. SUN AND SURF was away slowly,
chased the early pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to mid-stretch, confronted JERRY JEFF WALKER
inside of the furlong marker, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch, made a final push and just missed for the win in the final strides, while
besting the rest. PASSION OF JOE'S chased the early pace from the rear, swung four wide into the drive, could not impact the top two in deep stretch and
was outkicked, while holding safely in the end for third. RENEGADE WARRIOR chased the decent pace, came two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground
in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. GO GABRIELLA disputed the early pace, lost ground to the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, could not
keep pace in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ROISTER showed early speed and set the pace into the first turn, was well rated while setting moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was asked
for run leaving the second turn, spurted clear nearing the furlong marker, drew away while kept to task in the final sixteenth and was much the best. CAT
GAMER came five wide into the first turn then settled two wide into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, came in tight and
was boxed in nearing the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and held well in the end to secure
place. STAN THE HOT MAN was hustled leaving the break to dispute the early pace, ceded the lead and stalked ROISTER through the backstretch run,
lost ground nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and held for show in the late stages. DANNY
MICHAEL was unhurried, saved ground through the backstretch run, was steered four wide into the second turn, slipped back to the inside for the drive and
finished evenly in the stretch run. COMMAND A PREMIUM came three wide into the first turn while forwardly placed, stalked the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, maintained position to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch drive, could not keep pace in mid-stretch and weakened. NIGHT
PROOF tracked the early pace while three wide on the first turn, lost position along the backstretch, came three wide along the second turn, swung four
wide into upper stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and tired.

Footnotes
DI LAURIAN was hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, shook free on the second turn, drew clear in
mid-stretch and was kept to task in the late stages while remaining clear over the oncoming runner-up. STRAUS'S PLACE was allowed to settle, saved
ground to the second turn, closed well in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was second best. RUNAWAY KRISTIN settled off
of the early pace, came in tight on the second turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch, found his best stride late and was clear for show in the final stages.
MISO FAST was unhurried, saved ground to the second turn, swung five wide into the drive and produced a mild late rally. PERSEVERANCE showed early
speed, prompted the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground to the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch
and weakened. UNUSUAL CODE raced three wide into the first turn while forwardly placed, swung four wide into the drive, dropped back nearing
mid-stretch and gave way. POLACCO broke in the air and spotted the field leaving the start, raced four wide outside of rivals on the first turn, improved
position four wide on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
JOHNNY DAR broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the lead into upper
stretch and drew away under steady urging in the final sixteenth. ZIPPY BABY was allowed to settle, came two wide into the backstretch run, gained ground
from an inside path nearing the quarter marker, continued that advance to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and held for place over an oncoming
rival. YOU KIDDING ME was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, advanced along the rail on the far turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and just missed for place while well clear in the end for show. MIDNIGHT METAL stalked the early
pace from a three wide path, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, made a mild late bid in the final stages but was unable to impact the leaders. LIL
MIRACLE MAN raced close to the early pace while under a tight hold, tracked the pacesetter to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened
in the drive. OH GREAT (IRE) settled off of the early pace while four wide, came three wide into the backstretch run, dropped to the rear on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch run and was not a late factor. THE LONNA RANGER came five wide into the first turn while rating off of the pace, made a
middle move nearing the half-mile marker, could not sustain that run on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUE ETTAS GHOST was allowed to settle, was roused four wide on the far turn, circled five wide into the drive, closed with a rush in mid-stretch, took
command inside of the sixteenth-marker and held gamely over the quickly oncoming runner-up. COCORITA rated off of the early fractions, lost position
while three wide nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and was blocked at the top of the lane, swung out inside of the furlong marker, drifted under left
handed urging, made a late surge in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. FRONT OF LINE (GB) stalked the solid early fractions,
improved position while three wide on the second turn, made a grinding advance to take a narrow lead in mid-stretch, could not hold off SUE ETTAS
GHOST nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in deep stretch and held for third in the end. GOLD RUSH GAL broke out at the start and was off a
step slowly, settled three wide off of the early fractions while never far back, tracked the leaders to the second turn, mounted a four wide rally into upper
stretch and was outkicked in the drive. TYCHE AWAITS YOU unhurried in the early stages, advanced along the inside on the second turn, lost the crop
nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late kick. PRECIOUS INSIGHT was forwardly placed into the first turn while three wide,
made a middle move to take command nearing the half-mile marker, drew clear while setting decent fractions approaching the top of the lane, came under
pressure in mid-stretch and gave way. ENGEE OMBEE showed early speed after a good beginning and dictated terms into the first turn, ceded the lead to
PRECIOUS INSIGHT along the backstretch run, chased that rival along the far turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly and cleared the field to set the early pace, was well handled while carving fast fractions to the quarter marker, drew
clear to mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the end. MARY MARGARET bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased
from the rear early on, improved position on the turn, angled out leaving the quarter marker, rallied five wide in mid-stretch, finished well in the final
sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and was up for place. SWANEE chased the quick early pace, gained ground from an inside position
nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide into the drive, pursued REDSTWIRLINGDANCER to mid-stretch, could not make headway late on the winner,
was outfinished for place in the final strides and was well clear for show. LOUD FUSAICHI tracked the fast early pace, raced two wide between rivals on the
turn, was shuffled back nearing the top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. SUPERSONIC FLYER chased the pace, swung
five wide into the drive and was not a threat. PERFECTLY JULIE was forwardly placed in the early stages, gained ground three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the drive, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and faded. RUNAWAY PRINCESS chased the fast early pace, was outrun nearing the quarter
marker and was not a factor.

ALWAYS AT EASE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground along the turn, angled out nearing the top of the lane, loomed four wide nearing the
furlong marker, closed fast nearing the sixteenth-marker and wore down foes late to prevail. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS broke awkwardly and was away a step
slowly, recovered to chase the pace from the second flight heading to the turn, chased along the rail then angled out midway through the bend, mounted a
three wide bid in upper stretch, vied for the lead in mid-stretch, was outkicked in deep stretch by the winner and held on for place. CALIFORNIA BLING
bumped at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, advanced two wide in upper stretch, closed with a rush in the final furlong and just missed
for place while securing show in the final strides. ROSE OF MOONCOIN showed early speed, pressed the pace to the turn, kept pressure on the pacesetter
to the quarter marker, vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds, was outfinished in the late stages and was just edged for the minor awards. CAHUILLA
chased the fast fractions, swung four wide into the drive and offered a mild late rally. OH ANGEL stalked the early quick pace from the rail, came in tight and
steadied in upper stretch, lost position nearing the furlong marker and weakened. A LITTLE GRACE was hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions
through the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded. BOB'S VAI chased the fast early pace from the second flight, came three wide along the turn,
swung widest into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUICKLY PARK IT was unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, advanced leaving the three-furlong marker, was
roused two wide nearing the top of the lane, collared AMI PLEASE nearing the eighth pole, quickly pulled away nearing the sixteenth-marker and was
geared down in the final strides as much the best. AMI PLEASE showed good speed after an alert beginning and established the early advantage, was well
rated through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the lead nearing the top of the lane, was confronted by QUICKLY PARK IT nearing the furlong
grounds, was overtaken by the winner and was no match late, while holding well in the end for place. SALLY'S SASSY was allowed to settle, came three
wide into the backstretch run, went four wide leaving the second turn, could not make headway on the top pair late, passed tiring foes in the final stages and
was clear for show. BOLT'S BROAD saved ground while rating off of the early pace, ran evenly to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and
lacked a late response. JUANA GALLO was crowded a bit at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to be close to the solid pace through the
backstretch run, gained ground two wide nearing the top of the lane, could not match strides nearing the eighth pole and tired. SMILING LADY was hustled
to be forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid pace through the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper
stretch and faltered in the final furlong. E Z PHARIS settled three wide off of the early fractions, could not keep pace on the far turn, stopped in upper
stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
GRAZEN IN THE SUN was up close and between horses early, backed off before the half-mile pole, was asked to pick it up in earnest passing the
three-furlong marker, made a sweeping move while racing five wide into the stretch and outfinished TAMANTARI to gain the top prize. TAMANTARI was
with the leading pack through the early stages, was pushed a bit to keep up with the leaders going into the turn, separated from the pack and had dead aim
on the leading pair turning for home three-wide with GRAZEN IN THE SUN to his outside, battled that foe gamely to the wire but came up short in a solid
effort. DELIA MO won the dash for the lead after the break, was joined by TWO TWELVE after a furlong, lost the lead to that one entering the turn,
continued to chase him home down the stretch, finally managed to pass that rival in the final furlong only to be overtaken by a pair of closers to his outside
in the final yards. TWO TWELVE broke alertly, sped to the front and engaged, then edged ahead of DELIA MO thorough the turn, emerged at the top of the
stretch with narrow lead, battled the length of the stretch but gave way in the final sixteenth. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA was bothered a bit by STRKING
SHIRL after the break, still one of the first into stride, got in good position early, backed off the early speed duel down the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn and loomed a threat at the top of the stretch while looking to move to the outside, angled to the rail when no path was available and lacked a response
from that point. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS broke in a tangle, then was bothered by LA PRIMER ESTRELLA and forced to check, fought the rider a bit down
the backstretch, began to run on past the half-mile marker but that bid flattened out in the stretch. BIG JOLT was away in good order, struggled to keep
pace after a quarter mile, dropped back to last on the turn, angled over to the rail and went evenly to the wire. STRIKING SHIRL broke out at the break
forcing LA PRIMER ESTRELLA into the path of DAREDEVIL PRINCESS, was outrun in the early going then pushed to keep up heading into the turn, saved
ground but lacked a response and was never a threat.
