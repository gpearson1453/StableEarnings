Footnotes
IRONY set a rated pace inside, repulsed bids around the far turn and held sway under a drive. STARLIT SOFI stalked the pace two wide around the first
turn and from the rail around the far turn, angled outside of the winner in upper stretch, had aim but could not seriously gain on that foe. MEDIATION
prompted the winner three wide and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. MAJOR PRYCE raced in range four wide around the first turn,
three wide around the far turn, angled in in upper stretch and went evenly. SING SCAT lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced four wide
around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. RESONANCIA was off a step slow, raced three wide around the first
turn, made a four wide middle move and flattened out. MAMA STRONG failed to menace while racing two wide. REBATE chased the pace inside and came
up empty in the lane. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
EXCHANGE DAY tracked in the four path, was coaxed from the five path into the lane, and drew past in the final furlong. URANIUM pressed in the three
path, took the lead from the two path into the stretch, and ran on to hold place. THE PREDICAMENT raced in midpack from the five path, was roused from
the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. LOYAL LOUIE raced in midfield from the three path, shifted out to the five path going into the lane, but
finished evenly. POSEIDON'S SON trailed from the four path early, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. TORETTO rated from
inside, was driven from the four path into the lane, but flattened. EARTH stalked from inside but faded in the stretch. JOE DI BAGGIO chased in the six path
but was never a threat. LOVIELEE led from the two path but gave way at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
AWESOME PIC set a clear pace in the two path and widened while ridden out. ASTONISHING ANABEL was bumped soon after the start, chased the pace
two wide between foes, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole and was clearly second best in the lane. WHEELINGNDEALING stumbled at the start,
was bumped on both sides soon after, moved up four wide around the turn and was along for the show. VAL'S GAL was bumped between foes soon after
the start, recovered to prompt the winner in the three path and tired in the lane. MISS ARIA chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. FINAL
EPISODE veered in soon after the start and bumped several foes, raced three wide and played no further factor. GINRIN was shuffled back soon after the
start, raced two wide and was never a threat.

Footnotes
MAN ON THE MOON bobbled at the start, prompted the early pace, took the lead while three wide around the turn, was coaxed from the five path into the
lane, and held on. CREATIVE CLOUD chased in the six path, got floated out to the nine path going into the stretch, and ran on for place. RUSSIAN TO WIN
tracked in the six path, swung out to bid from the eight path into the lane, but hung late to show. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT dueled from the three path early but
flattened going into the stretch. ENSIGN PARKER stalked from inside, was ridden from the five path into the lane, but was one paced. PIYPA DE LYNDA
trailed from the five path early and was never a threat. EXALTED CHARM dueled from the two path early but gave way midway around the turn. FROLIC
MAN rated from the four path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
HROTHGAR set the early pace along the rail, settled back inside once DOUBLE BLESSING became intent on the lead down the backstretch, chased inside
around the far turn, angled three wide nearing the head of the lane, took over in upper stretch and edged clear under a drive. J P CORNETTA raced in
range inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on for the place. FORTY FLASH tracked the pace three wide, stayed on through the lane but
was outkicked. STARSHIP WIZARD raced off the early pace two wide, moved up four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. MY MAN FLINT
vied two wide between foes, angled in in upper stretch and tired. DOUBLE BLESSING vied three wide around the first turn, drew clear around the far turn
and caved in the lane. SOLAR TAP was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ADIOS BABY led from the two path, was cued and started opening up into the lane, and much the best. ALEXA'S DREAM rated along the inside, was
coaxed from the two path into the stretch, and improved for place. MOOR STRENGTH prompted the pace from inside, was ridden from the four path into
the lane, but finished evenly for show, DREAMSTER tracked in the five path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, but flattened. MAGNA COLORS
trailed from the four path early and was never a threat. HEIRESSTRAY stalked in the four path but began fading around the turn. DEADLY TRAIL was
hustled along in the three path, but took an awkward step going into the turn and was pulled up, and walked off..

Footnotes
O'CONNOR (CHI) settled off the pace along the rail around the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, cruised up three wide around the far turn,
seized command near the five-sixteenths and drew off under a drive. OCTANE broke outwardly and bumped UNIVERSAL PAYDAY into SOLE VOLANTE,
stalked the pace in the three path around the first turn, took a brief lead near the three-eighths pole, could not keep pace with the winner from there but
lasted for the place. SOLE VOLANTE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide and ran on outside to just miss the place. SIR OLLIE chased the
pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) set the pace in the two path and tired around the far turn.
UNIVERSAL PAYDAY was bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. BRASSTOWN stalked the pace four wide and was through
after a half.

BLACK BELT stalked the pace in the three path, took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging in the
final sixteenth and held safe. DESERT RULER saved ground in range, advanced along the rail around the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole, angled
three wide soon after and finished well to narrow the gap. KHOZY MY BOY was in range while racing four wide, lacked a rally and was along for the show.
WIND NINETY NINE chased the pace three wide and had no response. WALL STREET TRADER set the pace in two path and tired in the lane.

MARYQUITECONTRARY rated in the six path, loomed up to make a bid from the five path into the stretch, and drew clear. QUINOA TIFAH led from the
three path, was coaxed from the two path midway around the turn, and dug in from the rail down the stretch to hold place. RESTOFTHESTORY tracked in
the two path, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and kept on for show. STARSHIP NALA raced from wellback in the seven path early, ranged
up to bid from the five path going into the lane, but was one paced. DON'T GET KHOZY trailed from the four path early and was never a factor. SONAR
stalked from inside but faded going into the stretch. STREAKING GREY prompted the pace from the five path but was done early.

Footnotes
RARE JEWEL was bumped early, angled to the rail nearing the turn, advanced inside around the bend, tipped two wide in upper stretch, closed
determinedly and was up in the final strides. HELL'S KITTEN set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and led until the final strides.
CORPORATE AFFAIR tracked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced in the final furlong. GLORY AND VICTORY
lacked early speed inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. ASTRAL RIDE came in and bumped SOUTHERN BREEZE into
RARE JEWELL not long after the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. HEARNS bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide, lugged in
in the stretch and finished evenly. GLASTRIER raced well back two wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. BEN RUMSON failed
to menace while racing three wide. KALINBA was bumped the start then forced to check soon after, raced well back four wide, came eight wide into lane
and made little impact. MINISTER QUINN stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. BAKER BLOCK was outrun inside. SOUTHERN
BREEZE veered in at the start and bumped foes, was bumped inward not long after, chased the pace two wide between foes, was eased in the lane and
vanned off.
