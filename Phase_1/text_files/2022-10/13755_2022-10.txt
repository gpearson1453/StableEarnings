half mile, improved position while racing four wide around the second bend and finished evenly. TRIPLE TITOS raced in the three path in the early going,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, came around the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked. SKATING DATE

around the far turn and never threatened. DIABLO D ORO saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, lost

Footnotes
PHARIBE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail approaching the quarter pole
and kicked clear. LADYNESS raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path
coming around the far turn and kept on to the wire. JACKIE'S QUEST raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated
the far turn from the two path and made a mild improvement of position late. APRILS LUCK raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle
of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.
SIRENETTA led the field between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
WEST VIRGINIA GAL trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GREGORIA'S BAY tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn, swung wide into the stretch,
drew off down the lane and was geared down at the wire. DON CICCIO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. MIGHTY FROSTED
led the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the lane. LIGHT WORK raced off
the pace on the inside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and was empty from there. LUXURY BOY stumbled leaving the gate,
recovered to press the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
