BIGSHOT ON NOTHING broke alertly and moved clear then remained safe under a drive. WINDSOR GOLD ducked in soon after the start, saved ground
and finished well. NICKY DA FOX raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued willingly. ONE MORE SCOOP broke very slowly, advanced
extremely wide and faded. FLAG very awkward at the break, rushed to contention and stopped. BOBBYSFRIENDPOPEYE displayed poor action and lost
contact with his field. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

JACKIE B GOOD raced off the pace three wide, reached even terms then wore down the leader following a long drive. DESTINATION SPEED set a
measured pace inside, shook loose on the final turn, was collared again and continued gamely. MAGNOLIA ROAD settled inside the dueling leaders,
loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. CATALON prompted the pace outside to the stretch and faltered. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL trailed briefly and was
always outrun. HOT LITTLE NUMBER flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly. LOVE CHANNEL lagged far behind losing contact with her field.

THE JUDGE AND JURY close up inside, angled out on the turn and was just up following a long battle. PRINTRACK forced the pace outside, took over
after half a mile and finished gamely to the finish. EXPENSIVE CUT raced very wide off the leaders and was up for show. IRISH HONOR broke slowly and
dropped far behind then showed some late energy while no threat. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF broke slowly and was bumped early, rushed to the front inside
then tired. EXTREME FORCE lacked speed outside, drifted very wide on the turn and faded.

saved ground, advanced into the stretch to get up for the place. RON DON SCORESE prompted the pace outside, led briefly then flattened out. MY TRAIN
raced wide close up then lacked finishing kick. JAMMINWITHBRANDON was fanned wide opening half mile and retreated. PRIVATE NETWORK hustled to
the front inside, was collared near the quarter pole and faded. MR THRIFTY chased in the two path and was finished before half a mile.
