Footnotes
STORMY CUT chased top pair to the turn, rallied outside to the front, lasted. LUCKY CAT TOO good position throughout, rallied into the stretch, coming on.
MISS SOVELIA inside duel to turn, weakened while holding the show spot. CREATIVE WHIT outside speed, stayed game into stretch, grudgingly late.
SUMMER AUTUMN ROSE no speed to the turn, ran up inside through the stretch run. UNTUTTABLE SPEED no speed to the turn, improved position
outside late stretch. SURE FIRE broke sharp outside, never menaced thereafter. BAYERN BABY through early, dropped back quickly. PACIFIC GROVE
never factored throughout. ROBERTO'S DREAM through early, dropped back quickly. ISABIS never a factor. SHESA RUNNER always trailed.
