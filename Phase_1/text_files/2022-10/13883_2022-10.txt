Footnotes
TEMPO MADNESS broke well to take command leaving the chute, cleared from the outside easily to be in front on the rail down the backstretch, raced
comfortably on the lead through the turn, opened up in upper stretch and cruised in for the unchallenged win. BEAU GUEST settled mid pack inside at the
half, advanced up the fence through the turn, shifted out mildly three wide for the stretch drive and closed belatedly to best the rest down the lane. RUM
CUP was unhurried early to be near the back inside at the half, picked up the bit racing on the fence three furlongs from the wire nd finished with interest to
get up for show in deep stretch. MR. DE tracked on the rail under a snug hold behind the frontrunning winner with a half remaining, was asked to go after
the winner turning for home, could not threaten and stalled at the furlong marker. SOVEREIGN CAUSE tracked the loose leader in the second flight two
wide into the turn, was urged to keep up at the quarter pole and retreated outside in upper stretch. COLLABORATIVE travelled in midfield just off the rail
down the backside, was ridden for more five sixteenths to the finish, offered little response and could not make an impact in the late stages of the race.
STREET MAX trailed the field with a half remaining, lost contact with the pack running on the turn and could not get involved for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ONE BAY HEMINGWAY shifted in two wide into the first turn, steadied just slightly at the eleven-sixteenths, came out a bit at that juncture, bid three to four
wide leaving the far turn, dueled from the top of the stretch and inched past late. WAR IN CHARGE was brushed lightly at the break, moved forward and
shifted in from three to two wide on the first turn in pursuit of the pacesetter, moved to the lead at the five-sixteenths but was engaged just thereafter, dueled
the length of the stretch and was outfinished. DOMI angled in near the inside and was encouraged along after the break but lacking significant early speed,
continued to save ground on the far turn, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, ran on to get up for show honors over FOUR K FORCE, who moved
clear to set the pace racing in the two path, was overtaken midway on the far turn and lacked a late kick. PIDIN saved ground inside tracking the pace on
the first turn, steadied very slightly about the eleven-sixteenths, came out a bit on the far turn while encouraged along and a bit further at the top of the
stretch, ran on without late impact. ARNIE P switched outside foes, raced three to four wide on the turns and off the pace, failed to rally. SMART SKY broke
slowly and awkwardly, was never near enough to threaten. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PIDIN AGAINST WAR IN CHARGE
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
MAD MOCHA took control inside from the onset, continued be uncontested up front down the backstretch, opened up on the field turning for home and held
safe while tiring nearing the wire. INDY CHAMPAGNE settled in mid pack on the rail at the half, rallied up the fence five sixteenths to the finish, shifted out
three wide at the furlong marker and closed well in stretch but ran out of room at the wire. BILL NEEDLE chased the winner inside from the beginning, was
ridden to pace with the leader midway on the far turn, could not close the gap in upper stretch and stalled late losing the place award. MAGNIFICENT
MARIO was situated near the rear in the early stages, commenced his run midpoint on the far turn navigating between runners, angled just outside four
wide at the top of the stretch and finished with good energy for a minor share. KILLARY stalked outside close the back in the beginning, trailed the field into
the far turn, and passed tiring rivals up the fence through the stretch. DRAMATIC FASHION trailed at the start, put in a mild run outside foes three wide
midway on the far turn, was floated out to the five path for the drive and could not be a factor racing to the wire. COLONEL MUSTARD travelled five wide
into the first turn, rated in the middle of the pack outside foes with a half remaining, made an early move three wide into the second turn to be in the mix and
retreated between rivals at the top of the lane. ANYQUIST tracked in a good spot two wide in the second flight down the backstretch, was urged between
horses three furlongs to the finish, offered no rally and faltered at the quarter marker.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF THIEVES came out a bit just after the break, settled off the pace four to five wide through the first turn, was still well back entering the far turn,
tipped out seven deep late on that bend while being encouraged along, came out to be eight wide in upper stretch with aim, rallied outside JUSTIN'S WAY
dueling with that one late to prevail. JUSTIN'S WAY shifted in racing mid-pack two to three wide, angled out in upper stretch, engaged with the
aforementioned and rallied in tandem but was outfinished. POINT TO THE STARS settled toward the back inside early, switched out for the run up the
backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn, rallied between runners late to get up for show honors. BENLION was taken up when in tight just after
the break, shifted in while unhurried at the rear, swung eight wide into the stretch and rallied but needed more. ROOKIE RADAR set the pace racing off the
rail, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. CHELSEA DAGGER tracked two wide early, moved out about three deep late on the far turn then shifted
back in at the top of the stretch, ran on mildly. BLACK SUN veered out six wide into the first turn, was forwardly-positioned between runners into the far turn
going four then five wide on that bend, was within range but could only run on evenly. DOCTOR WU settled outside four wide stalking the pace, went four
wide on both turns, lacked the needed late kick. KLIMTOGLORY chased the pace two to three wide, weakened. RUNNINFORCOVER saved ground to no
avail. MORE THAN A DANCE was forced out seven wide into the first turn, continued a bit wide and failed to rally.

Footnotes
ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) settled nicely to track the contesting leaders inside through the turn, waited behind the dueling foursome at the quarter pole, slipped
up the fence at the furlong marker and finished up determinedly to hold off the closing challenger outside. SHEKKY SHEBAZ travelled near the back three
wide down the backside, circled four wide five sixteenths from home, was full of run through the stretch in the seven path and just missed at the finish with a
solid effort. BOHEMIAN BOY set the early fractions inside engaging with an outside rival throughout the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch by
runners, battled on stubbornly to hold a brief lead at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly the final sixteenth. THERE'S NO JOE was situated close
the back of the pack at the half, began to rally while behind rivals looking for a clear path at the top of the stretch, angled out eight wide in mid stretch and
showed some good late energy to get up for a minor share. REAL MONEY stalked three wide on the outside in the early stages, loomed six wide between
horses to be in the mix for the drive, battled on for an eighth and faded in deep stretch. SALVATOR MUNDI was unhurried down the backstretch to trail,
continued to seem them all running on the turn and passed weary stragglers in the final eighth. WARP RIDE tracked the dueling leaders between horses
running on the turn, took closer order to bid five wide turning for home, fought on until the final sixteenth and stopped in deep stretch. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE)
contested for the front outside through the turn, was collared by challengers on either side with a quarter remaining, gave way three sixteenths to the finish
and was empty at the furlong pole.

MO TOURIST moved forward and set the pace inside on or just off the rail, edged away on the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch while being kept to the
task. KING ELVIS shifted in two wide into the first turn, was in a touch tight on heels about the five-eighths, went two to three wide on the far turn, came out
four to five wide for the stretch run, was second best. WHITEWALKER settled inside off the early pace, switched out up the backstretch, went three to four
wide on the far turn, ran on to get up for show honors over. VICTORIA'S CHIEF , who veered out four wide into the first turn, raced off the pace then
advanced four wide and outside up the backstretch and far turn, was within striking distance but had no late kick. COHERENCE was forced five wide into
the first turn, moved back in on that bend, came out again five wide on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. VINCENZINO was a bit reluctant to load,
pursued the pace three to four wide, dropped back but managed to pass some tired rivals in the stretch. MAGIC TOMAHAWK tracked from inside on or just
off the rail, steadied on heels slightly past the quarter pole, failed to rally. CRUMLIN LAD pressed the eventual winner two to three wide, came up empty.
PREETZAH'S STAR was shuffled back at the start, raced four wide early, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
DANCIN IN DA'NILE settled kindly near the back in the early stages, travelled around rivals just outside through the turn, had clear run in the seven path at
the top of the stretch, took command at the furlong marker and was going away in the end. LAC MACAZA stalked nicely all alone midfield at the half, began
to rally when a path opened up five wide at the three sixteenths pole, split rivals to threaten with an eighth remaining but could not catch the winner in deep
stretch. MALIBU UPROAR travelled three deep outside at the half mile marker, advanced on the rail into the turn, split foes in the three path turning for
home, shifted outwards more to be six wide in mid stretch and battled to the wire to claim the show money. STEAK AND CHEESE was situated on the rail
close the the rear in the beginning, followed the winner two wide on the turn, continued on the path set be the winner seven wide rallying outside and closed
in to be on the fringes at the wire. RON'S GIZMO was in a good position tracking the leaders inside throughout the turn, began to creep closer up the fence
at the top of the stretch, was steadied sharply in mid stretch on the rail and regrouped the final sixteenth to finish up willingly at the wire. ALLEY OOP
JOHNNY chased the frontrunner three wide on the turn, loomed five wide to be at the quarter pole, arguably poked his nose in front briefly with three
sixteenths left and tired in the last sixteenth. UNCLE BULL broke sharp to lead the field down the backstretch, continued to set the pace the turn, was
collared nearing the three sixteenths pole, drifted inwards under right handed urging at the furlong marker and faltered the final sixteenth. GRANDSON was
shuffled back racing on the turn, angled out to be six wide for the stretch drive and could not make an impact through the stretch. MITZI pressed the issue
just behind the leader racing around the turn, took closer order to contend three wide between rivals turning for home, had little left in reserve for the drive
and retreated the last eighth. SUNRISE DRIVE stalked on the fence in the middle of the pack at the half, saved all the ground racing inside on the turn and
could not reach contention running on the fence to the finish. SHANGASSAH stalked midfield three wide down the backside, was ridden to keep pace three
furlongs from the finish, offered a mild response until upper stretch and gave way. FINALIST hopped at the break, hit the gate to trail the field down the
backside could not recover enough from the start and was not involved racing to the wire.

Footnotes
NO WHAMMIE moved clear in the two path on the first turn, was pressured by a foe early up the backstretch, headed by that one at the half-mile marker,
dueled to the wire and dug in to prevail under steady urging. UMNEYAAT moved forward three to four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace up the
backstretch taking a narrow lead about the half, dueled to the wire but was outfinished. BROKEN PROPOSAL tracked from inside, came out in the stretch,
secured show honors while no threat to the top pair. NORTHERN PASSAGE stalked mid-pack two to three wide between rivals to the far turn, on that bend
and in upper stretch, needed more. ABSOLUTE JEWEL raced outside foes three to four wide on the turns, moved out with inside rivals in upper stretch and
was outkicked by those for the minor awards. HALLANVAARA tucked in two to three wide off the early pace, moved out and went four wide on the far turn
coming into upper stretch further afield from the inside, failed to menace. NICOLE'S SONG switched out off the inside and advanced five wide up the
backstretch,
evened
out
thereafter.
FREDERICIA
was
taken
back
and
shifted
in
to
the
two
path,
was
never

to
threaten.
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS saved ground on or just off the rail, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
ENCHANT ME settled on the rail near the back of the pack at the half, crept closer to the frontrunner advancing on the fence through the far turn, angled out
to the three path for the drive and wore down the leader in a gutsy stretch battle the final eighth. GASTON was well in hand behind the leaders entering the
backside, waited to pounce on the rail on the far turn, assumed control turning for home just outside, battled inside with the winner in the final eighth and lost
the nod in a photo at the line. SOUPER LEGACY lead the field inside down the backstretch, was collared outside at the top of the stretch, offered little
resistance in upper stretch and finished willingly to be a clear third. BLAST IN THE SNOW stalked three wide outside foes entering the far turn, was urged
three furlongs from the finish to be in range of the leaders four wide turning for home and needed more late to threaten for the top placings at the wire.
CUPID'S DUDE travelled three wide into the first turn, trailed the field at the half, angled out five wide for the stretch run and offered little finishing kick
through the lane. FENWICK was situated at the back with runners on either side with a half mile to run, could not keep up with the field running on the far
turn and could only pass a stopping rival in the lane. GIANT ONE chased the pacesetter through the backstretch, was ridden with three eighths from the
finish but could not make an impression and backed away at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LARAQUE settled just off the pace tracking inside, was patiently handled through the far turn, came out for room in upper stretch, took aim and under
steady handling just got up in time. BAYTOWN ELVIS moved clear and shifted in heading into the first turn, set the pace inside, was pressured up the
backstretch, kept on gamely. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE shifted in to track in behind inside, came out a bit turning for home, engaged the leader by the furlong
marker, dueled, was outfinished. PERFECT PLAY settled toward the back inside, saved ground through both turns, showed good late interest to improve.
SUPER HEADLINE was in a bit tight early and into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, moved out and advanced four to six wide on the far
turn, evened out in the drive. QUIET REBEL settled off the pace three wide early, tipped out and advanced four to five wide on the far turn, evened out in
the stretch. FACTOTUM stalked three wide, moved closer to force the issue about the five-and-one-half, steadily weakened in the stretch. COUSIN BOB
was in tight heading into the first turn, raced off the pace inside foes but in the two path early, moved out four wide for the far turn, was never near enough to
threaten. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN pursued from between runners two to three wide, dropped back. BODACIOUS BIZ was forwardly-placed three to four
wide leaving the first turn and up the backstretch, steadily dropped back. INCENDIO shifted in two to three wide early trailing the field, was never a factor.
AHMAS moved three then four wide late on the first turn and ranged up alongside the leaders about the half-mile pole, faltered and faded.
