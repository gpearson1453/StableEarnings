Footnotes
HYPHY was sent to establish the early lead, rated nicely through the turn, drew clear into upper stretch, was kept to task in mid-stretch, was confronted by
ALESHA in deep stretch and just held on for the win in the final strides. ALESHA was allowed to settle early on, came three wide into the turn then slipped
to the two path entering the top of the lane, closed fast in the drive, came within aim of the winner in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while well
clear of the rest for place. AMERICAN ROYALTY chased the pace from the inside, was not able to impact the top two in the stretch run but finished well in
the end to secure the show. SHEZ A GRINDER was forwardly placed to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and
did not produce a late rally. TEASPOON OF PEPPER bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, came four to five wide
nearing the top of the lane and was not a late threat.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE TAYLOR was hustled leaving the start, established the early advantage and set moderate fractions through the first half-mile, drew clear along
the far turn, drew off in the lane and was geared down in deep stretch to be much the best in the end. SWEET MEG was allowed to settle, was unhurried
through the backstretch run, came two then three wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but finished well late to secure place.
CHARLIE THE GENT stalked the early pace outside of rivals, raced in pursuit of MY LITTLE TAYLOR through the backstretch run, stayed closest to the
winner on the far turn, gave way in the drive and held for third in the late stages. LONO raced close to the early pace, stalked the moderate fractions along
the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the drive. J C EXPRESS was unhurried in the early going, advanced along the
backstretch run to come within aim of the pacesetter, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

SHEZA GIRLY GIRL rated off of the early pace, improved position midway through the turn, circled five wide into upper stretch, loomed nearing the furlong
grounds and pulled away in the final sixteenth. CANAM GAL hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the early pace, made a quick move two
wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, yielded to the winner in the late stages but held well in the end to secure second.
DAMN THE TORPEDOES tracked the early fractions, was roused four wide on the turn, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, could not go on with the winner
in deep stretch, was held at bay for second but was an easy third in the end. XTRAFINE XTINA was asked for early speed and was sent to dispute the early
pace, lost position on the turn and tired in the stretch run. THE FUN BEGINS broke alertly and showed good early speed, contested the pace to the turn,
came three wide while vying for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with the leaders in upper stretch and faltered late.

Footnotes
NAUVOO was hustled to the early lead, set contested fractions through the first half-mile, drew clear along the second turn, took a long lead to mid-stretch,
had the margin cut into in deep stretch but kept to task late to stay clear under the wire. HOT JOURNEY was allowed to settle, saved ground through the
backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, made a steady gain on NAUVOO in the drive, showed a bit of greenness late, was no
match for the winner in deep stretch but was well clear of the rest for second at the end. RUSSELL came in tight entering the first turn, was bumped by BIG
DIFFERNCE then carried out APLOMBADO nearing the seven-furlong marker, was unhurried through the backstretch run, improved position on the far turn,
was no match for the top two in the drive but stayed on to be clear for third in the end. MONEY MUNCHER stumbled leaving the break and was off a step
slowly, settled in the second flight, came four wide into the drive and lacked a late response. BIG DIFFERENCE showed early speed, bumped RUSSELL
while in tight on the run into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter through decent early fractions, could not match strides with NAUVOO on the far turn and
tired in the drive. APLOMBADO was asked to show early speed, came in tight and was carried out four wide into the first turn, settled off of the solid
fractions through the backstretch run, lost contact three wide on the far turn and faltered in the stretch run.

Footnotes
GREAT STORY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed good speed to the turn, was confronted by HANDR'SDREAM nearing the quarter
marker, repelled that bid into upper stretch, felt late pressure again from the runner-up in deep stretch and gamely held that one at bay to prevail.
HANDR'SDREAM tracked the early fractions, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased GREAT STORY to mid-stretch, made a late push in
deep stretch, was denied for the win in the final strides but held well in the end for place. ARMA D'ORO settled off of the solid early fractions, advanced
three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a late surge in deep stretch but could not get by the game top pair and was clear in
the end for third. HUNTERS GHOST stumbled at the start and spotted the field leaving the gate, lacked speed through the turn, was not able to impact the
leaders in deep stretch but finished well in the final sixteenth. JUNE GLOOM was away a step slowly, chased two wide to the turn, came in tight at the
three-furlong marker, lost position nearing the top of the lane and did not offer a late rally. ROYAL JESTER chased the early fractions, saved ground
through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

SACRED RIDER was away in good order and was hustled to set the early pace, dictated terms while carving out decent fractions to the half-mile marker,
briefly lost the lead to BOTTLE OF SMOKE on the far turn but came again and re-established the advantage heading for the top of the lane, was set down
for the drive, felt late pressure from HONOS MAN but gamely kept to task in the end to prevail. HONOS MAN was allowed to settle, came three wide into
the backstretch run, was roused four wide on the far turn, mounted a five wide rally in upper stretch, found his best stride in deep stretch, could not reel in
the winner in the final stages but stayed on well late to secure second. BOTTLE OF SMOKE was forwardly placed in the early stages, attended to the
decent fractions through the backstretch run, came three wide into the second turn, took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker, battled with the winner to
upper stretch, could not match strides in deep stretch and was outfinished late for second. UNION DANCE stalked the early pace, maintained position to the
half-mile marker, gained ground three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked late. MOUNT PELLIAR
hopped at the break and was away a step slowly, settled off of the early fractions, maintained a two wide path to the second turn while near the rear, gained
ground nearing the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
ALPHIE'S ANGEL chased the early leader while four-wide down the backstretch, began a strong bid from the three-furlong pole, easily overpowered the
tiring pacesetter and finished well under heavy pressure to win going away. DAD'S LADY broke best but ceded the early pace to ALPHIE'S ANGEL, chasing
that one through the turn, was passed by the eventual winner near the five-sixteenths pole, had to wait a bit for some running room at the top of the stretch
and ran on well but was second best. TIGER'S WISH was fractious in the gate, broke alertly but was outrun in the early stages despite being pressed for
speed by her rider, found her best stride going into the turn while under constant pressure and finished somewhat evenly to get third while never posing a
threat. OH SUMMER came away from the gate in good order, sped to a big early lead through the first quarter mile while well off the rail, saw that lead
evaporate on the turn and was done at the quarter pole, had nothing to offer down the stretch. JACKIE SERMON was devoid of early speed, trailed the field
early to the outside of TIGER'S WISH, began to lose contact with the field passing the three furlong marker and finished far back while not being persevered
with.
