BULLAWAY was allowed to settle on the outside while off the pace came four to five wide on the turn took the lead at the eighth pole and steadily drew
clear. TULSA TIME was away well and showed good early speed but stayed one off the rail into the turn took a brief lead at the head of the stretch but could
not fend off the winner through the stretch. CHUCK NAZTY was three wide on the turn took a brief lead between calls but could not sustain the run through
the stretch. RED WES was away a step slow to trail out of the gate was hustled after the slow start and came through along the rail took a brief lead on the
rail in the turn but dropped back in the stretch. TOMBI was at the back shortly after the start and never mounted a rally while never a factor in the outcome.

KNIGHTED was away a step slow to trail out of the gate settled along the inside and began a steady move towards the leaders up the backstretch got close
to the lead turning for home angled out and drew clear in the stretch. BIG DADDY DON was away best took the lead along the inside while challenged going
into the turn still held the lead into the stretch but could not match strides with the winner while clearly second best. LINCHTOWN was allowed to settle off
the pace came four wide on the turn and then six wide entering the stretch and finished well for third. CHICKEN N BISCUIT raced in the two path in the
middle of the pack and never mounted a rally. BE ALL EARS raced three wide the entire race dropped back some on the turn and made a mild bid through
the lane. BUMPER POOL raced along the inside in the middle of the pack and could not make up ground. BAD BOY BILL was the quickest for the first
quarter but began to fade after a half and dropped back quickly in the lane. ALL RISE UP was well off the pace and never mounted a serious charge.
LONESTAR CHROME was up close after a quarter then began a steady fade and was not a factor.

INTO CLASSIC was allowed to stalk the pace in the two path made her move into the second turn and went right by the leader and steadily drew clear to
win handily. LADY CLARE was four wide the entire race was able to get the place while never a serious threat to the winner. POETIC PURSUIT raced along
the inside for most of the race tried to slip inside the tiring FLO TIME turning for home but had to steady was taken to the two path and then was in tight
between rivals and could not make up ground. AMERICAN REALITY raced in the two path was in contention for second turning for home but lacked the
needed rally. FLO TIME was ridden hard to get the lead into the first turn along the inside held the lead going into the second turn but tired and dropped

Footnotes
WIN FOR FUN was always three wide while chasing the pace came into contention on the turn and edged clear through the stretch. DALLAS GOLD raced
along the inside while just off the rail came through to get second. CLEARLY MAD was away quickly and went right to the front while racing off the rail tired
through the stretch but held third. ORDER OF THE DAY made a three wide bid up the backstretch and on the turn but could not sustain the rally and
flattened out. THREE FOR THREE was chasing the pace in the two path for the fist quarter dropped back some when the field raced wide into the turn and
had no rally in the stretch. DEL ARGENT raced along the inside on the turn and could not make up ground. THE GREATEST EAGLE was always towards
the back of the pack on the inside and had no rally. RANCHER was always towards the back in the two path and tired in the stretch.
