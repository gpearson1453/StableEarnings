Footnotes
HE IS READY sprinted away from the field through the first turn, held sway without challenge, then was under steady pressure through the lane to maintain
a commanding lead. WHONEW'S TREASURE tracked the pace, angled out three wide into the stretch, closed willingly and made up ground on the winner,
while no real threat, was clearly best of the rest. GRAVE DANGER well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on
that path into the lane and evened out. NATHANIEL'S HOPE broke sharply from the gate and was well placed outside, held position two and three wide
through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and held a share. BRAMBLE BEACH mid pack, lost some ground four wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. MAGIC WIZARD allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn and had no
rally. BAGE was no factor. PER RULING #23007PI FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, HE IS READY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st
TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

WINDY CITY GIRL tracked the pace rating, angled to the two path and bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, lugging in, dueled, edged ahead
and held. KEYPIT sprinted away from the field through the first turn, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, dueled with the winner through the
lane and was no match for that one late. LACEE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
closed for the show. CHARLIV allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and got up for a share. NOT

STARSHIP EMPIRE never far back, tracked the pace and was boxed into the stretch, came through inside into the stretch, angled out, lugged in slightly,
then drew off under steady pressure. CITY PLAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch, held sway to the furlong
marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT allowed to settle, moved up inside through the second turn,
angled four wide into the stretch, lugged in and could not gain the final furlong. CANADIAN GAME well placed, held position on the two path through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. GIANT PAYDAY well placed and outside, faded three wide through the second

outfinished. JUST PRAISE rated outside early, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then final sixteenth
and held a share. LIGHT CRUISER well placed and inside, tracked the pace through the second turn, loosing some ground, angled out and faded into the

Footnotes
SWEET AMY mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, came four and five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. SPEED
CHESS tracked the pace, angled to the two path through the turn, angled in around a tiring rival and got through into the stretch, then was no match for the
winner, while best of the rest. VAN HAVEN well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn to gain a short lead, then weakened late and
held the show. DYNA'S HONOR allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and edged up
for a share. LIBERTALIA never far back, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then drifted in and faded the
final furlong. BROKEN LOVE passed tiring rivals. SPECIAL ASSISTANT broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved. LOVERS AT
MIDNIGHT rushed up and sprinted clear pulling, then faded into the stretch.
