Footnotes
ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) was quick to begin, taken in hand to be rated along from the inside down the backstretch, continued an inside bid near the
quarter pole, angled to the outside of R Tenderoni through the upper stretch and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE
tracked the early pace while racing between, shifted out to race five wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. ERAWAN was allowed
to settle early, raced along the inside past the quarter pole and closed in well late while racing three deep. R TENDERONI showed good early speed to set
the pace and gave way grudgingly late. SASSY KING dropped back early on, moved up four wide through the far turn and lacked a final bid. ARTEMUS
BRIDGE raced four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace from the outside and faded.

MONYINTHEBANKSEY tracked the early leader from the outside, confidently ridden handled through the far turn, asked near the three sixteenths pole and
edged clear late under strong pressure. KRACHENWAGEN showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, was confronted through the far
turn and kept on to finish second best. DR. FERBER was slow early on to race at the back of the pack, moved up three wide through the far turn and kept
on to finish willingly to the wire. GHOST STALKER stalked the pace, raced near the inside throughout and lacked a rally. LOST MY VOWCHER was
unhurried in the early going, hard ridden near the three eighths pole while racing from the inside and had no response. The final time was hand timed.

SMALL BUT FEISTY stalked the top pair down the backstretch, made a three wide bid through the far turn and raced well clear in the stretch run under a
steady hand ride. ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE was allowed to settle early on, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four to five wide through the
upper stretch, rallied for the place position but was no match for the winner. I AM THE MIKE settled off the early pace, advanced through far turn near the
inside, raced near the rail into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. BULLOUT bobbled at the break, raced near the back of the pack early,
raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. DOLLARS N SENSE vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way. GRO pressed the
pace from the outside of foe and faded the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN pressed the early pace while racing between rivals, shook clear near the eighth pole, dug in and prevailed under all out pressure. MR.
HUSTLE chased the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide around the far turn and rallied gamely to the wire. MOMOS stalked the top trio early,
raced five to six wide between rivals in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. SMITHWICK'S SPICE chased the early pace, raced near the inside
through the stretch run and made a good late gain to finish willingly. RADICAL RIGHT shuffled at the break, raced off the early pace, moved up through the
stretch run while racing from the inside and improved position. EMBOLDEN raced with the second flight early, raced along the inside through the far turn
and made a late gain to improve position. SEMPER FI raced off the pace, was five deep around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. A ROSE FOR
RAVEN raced mid pack early on, was six to seven deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. WOW WHATA SUMMER was void of early speed,
angled widest through the lane and never threatened. PREMIERE CHOICE pressed the pace from the outside and weakened. KOBE TOUGH was
squeezed back at the start, raced off the early going, checked sharply near the eighth pole and never threatened. STRIKE SILVER showed good early
speed to set the early pace along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCE PERE was rated along from the inside off the top pair down the backstretch, angled out three wide through the upper stretch to race outside of rival
while racing three deep and finished well to prove best under strong encouragement. GREAT IDEA settled off the early going, edged up through the far turn,
raced along the inside near the quarter pole, worked its way through rivals while racing three to two wide and finished gamely to the wire. NEVER
SATISFIED chased the early pace, raced five deep into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. WORTHY OF GOLD stalked the pace from the
outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn and raced evenly late with no closing run. SUNDAY MISCHIEF showed good early speed to set the
pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. GALLANT GEORGE was coaxed along early, raced from the rail around the far turn through the stretch,
angled out near the sixteenth pole and had no response. CRYSTALOLOGY raced off the early pace, was four deep near the quarter pole and lacked a rally.
UNCLE REMI was hustled from the outside, raced four deep past the quarter pole and never was a factor. GRATITUDE ATTITUDE settled off the early
pace, raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
COMBAT QUEEN prompt the pace from the outside and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. A GIRL NAMED JAC chased the early pace,
raced two deep near the quarter pole and got up for the place position late. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH was coaxed along from the inside and kept on to the wire
while racing four deep in the stretch run. SWEET TALIA raced near the back of the pack early, was five wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in
the drive. LITTLE BIT OF THAT showed good early foot to the early pace while racing two wide and weakened in the drive. ITALIAN DRESSING raced off
the early pace, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
