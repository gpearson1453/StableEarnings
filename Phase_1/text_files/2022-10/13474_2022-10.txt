CROOKHAVEN LASS knocked into rival start, settled off the dueling trio along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, swung four wide into the
stretch and blew on by under urging. SHEILA'S CHARLIE bumped hard at the start, found a good spot stalking the trio of leaders on the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn and loomed large entering the stretch, ran into traffic trouble and had to steady entering the stretch, found room in upper stretch and
rallied to be a tough luck second. DORITA'S LEMON vied three wide for the lead under a loose rein, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in
contention, could not fend off closing rivals and saved show. AM YISRAEL CHAI broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied for lead inside of two rivals,
continued to contest pace along the inside, entered stretch in the lead and weakened under pressure the final sixteenth. QUEEN VERRAZANO away well,
vied between rivals on the backstretch, continued contesting pace on the turn, lost ground late on the turn, rebid along the inside and had to take up when
rallying rival took her path approaching the sixteenth pole.
