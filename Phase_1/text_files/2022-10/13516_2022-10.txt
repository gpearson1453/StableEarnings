JETTIN PEGASUS unhurried early, closed willingly four wide through the far turn, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew off under strong
handling. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD stalked the early pace, surged three wide into the far turn, gained a narrow lead, set the pace into the stretch then
was no match for the winner. QUEEN HIGH slow early, had a mild late rally in the five path. MISSION GIRL had sped from the start, loomed boldly four wide
into the second turn, had speed into the stretch then weakened. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE never far back, offered a mild bid between horses into the far turn
then came up empty. MOBIL CHIC was no threat. LA ROSA close up, was through after a half. LUCKY PENNY ROSE was outrun. ARTIES CRYPTONITE
pressed the pace along the inside for nearly five furlongs, checked when in tight and dropped out of it. SUSHI Q made the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace two wide, checked inside rivals past the three furlong marker then stopped. RUNLIKEJACKIEO pressed the pace three wide, checked when
in tight into the far turn and lost momentum. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF RUNLIKEJACKIEO LODGED A CLAIM
OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE FURLONG MARKER, AFTER REVIEW THE
STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
