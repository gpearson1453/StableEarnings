Footnotes
BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) moved clear and shifted in to dictate the pace while under a moderate hold early, was allowed to go and asked for a bit more in upper
stretch, responded and held well. HIT THE POINT broke a half-step slowly then angled in, saved ground on the first turn, swung seven wide into the stretch,
gained more than others to get up for place late. HELL BENT brushed the inner foe very lightly at the start, moved forward to stalk the pace three wide,
asked coming the five-sixteenths, kept on evenly and lost place late. KIDDIE HOLIDAY shifted in two wide early settling mid-pack, moved out about the
five-sixteenths, came into the stretch five wide and kicked on mildly but needed more. H C HOLIDAY brushed the outside rival very lightly at the start,
settled in the two path off the pace, moved out a bit leaving the first turn, went three then four wide on the far turn coming five deep into upper stretch, made
no bid. DOWNLOAD was very lightly brushed from both sides at the start to no ill effect, raced outside three wide off the pace in the early going, moved out
from four to five wide on the far turn outside a rival and six wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. COPINSAY tracked in behind just off
the eventual winner, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
DOINGGOODTROUBLE settled in mid pack outside at the half, rallied three wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to be five wide for the drive, bid
outside at the furlong marker and edged away in the final sixteenth. ELIOT NESS chased the pace inside entering the turn, angled just off the fence for the
stretch bid, battled between foes at the eighth pole and could not match strides with the winner late. MORE THAN HAPPY travelled near the back of the
field in the early stages, angled out four wide two furlongs to the finish, continued to tip out for the stretch run in the eight path in upper stretch and closed
well to be a non threatening third. FOUR BOUNCE was roused while near the rear midpoint on the turn, raced for home in the seven path and showed some
good interest through the stretch to get up for a minor placing. TWICE AS SMART rated mid pack on the rail at the half, took closer order to the pacesetters
inside running in the turn, shifted out to be three wide at the top of the stretch and was one paced through the lane. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN tugged his
way to contend for the lead three wide midway on the turn, was in the mix in upper stretch four wide and stalled for the stretch drive. TARADAR tracked the
frontrunner with rivals on either side into the turn, was asked for more run at the quarter pole, offered little response and faded through the lane. SIR
GRAYVENSCROFT trailed the field inside at the half, saved ground creeping closer on the turn, began to put in a mild run on the fence in upper stretch but
was steadied off a stopping rival a sixteenth from home and was a non factor to the line. BLUES POWER broke sharp to control the pace in the beginning,
continued to travel up front on the turn, was collared on the fence with an eighth remaining and backed away inside through the field the final sixteenth.
SPIGETINMTZABALLS tracked the leader in third down the backside, was asked for more to keep up between foes three furlongs from the line, faltered
throughout the turn and was not persevered with to the finish line.

Footnotes
MISS BRENTWOOD pressed the early pace from inside, edged to take command by the seven-sixteenths racing just off the rail, moved clear turning for
home and was asked for run, extended the advantage and held well. LIVIN ON LUV tracked in behind early, switched out and was three wide near the
quarter pole while being put to urging and within striking distance, could make no headway and chased the winner home while clearly second best.
KIMONO KATE raced off the pace two to three wide through the turn, kept on for show honors. FRAC TALES set the early tempo while pressed inside by
the eventual winner, chased three then four wide on the turn, moved out a further path in upper stretch and ran on. AQUA LUNA was toward the rear early
racing off the inside, went three to four wide on the turn and ran on in the stretch. JAB was four to five wide on the turn and in range coming to the quarter
pole but weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
HALFINTHEWRAPPER broke sharp setting the early fractions, was well rationed up front through the turn, opened up on her rivals in upper stretch and won
comfortably in the end. INTO TOURING broke with the field and was allowed to settle at the back in the beginning, rallied four wide three furlongs from the
finish, continued to run on angling outwards to the six path for the drive and found her best stride late to close in and capture place. ARRA GO WAN tracked
on the rail into the turn, was shuffled back a touch five sixteenths from the finish, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole, angled just outside chasing the
winner at the eighth pole and gave way late losing second money. TRADING BAY hopped at the break, waited behind foes through the turn, began to rally
five wide for the drive, lost her path nearing the furlong marker and was steadied briefly, regrouped outside in deep stretch and finished up well just missing
out on the show award. ARTFUL BALLERINA stalked mid pack all alone three eighths to the wire, took closer order racing five wide turning for home and
levelled out in deep stretch losing out on a minor share just before the line. EVER SO D'WILD settled near the rear in the early stages, trailed the pack at
the quarter pole and angled outside in the seven path to finish up passing tiring horses in deep stretch. TAVALINE made a bold three wide move around
foes entering the turn, loomed four wide at the top of the stretch and retreated at the furlong marker. MO TOURING tracked behind the winner through the
turn, was asked for more at the five sixteenths marker and faltered between horses in upper stretch. OL' BLONDIE tracked the frontrunner outside at the
half, was in range contesting between rivals two furlongs from the wire and had little to give for the finish.

Footnotes
FISH MOONEY shifted in settling in about the three path toward the rear early, advanced inside foes on the far turn and came out leaving that bid, bid five
wide taking the lead at the three-sixteenths, was clear in mid-stretch and held a rival at bay. IL MALOCCHIO stalked three to four wide, asked for run at the
quarter pole while floating out six deep turning for home, could make no headway on the winner but was second best. BUTTERED TOAST broke a half step
slowly and settled at the back two to four wide on the first turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and improved position. STREGA was forwardly-positioned
inside into the first turn, switched outside the leader at the six and one-half, pressed up the backstretch from outside, bid three wide coming to the quarter
pole, had no extra for the drive. LUZ DE LA LUNA raced off the pace in the two path early, moved out four to five wide up the backstretch, swung six deep
turning for home, failed to rally. SILVER DAHLIA moved forward outside a rival into the first turn, was clear and moved in a bit leaving that bend setting the
pace, was headed past the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
COLLECT DATTT settled near the back of the field into the turn, began to rally eight wide coming out of the quarter pole for the drive, found another gear
when switching leads at the sixteenth pole and closed strongly late to get up for the win. COLLECTIVELY tracked between foes at the half, engaged for the
lead just outside three furlongs from home, took command at the quarter pole, opened up on the field in mid stretch and just missed at the wire. SPEED
TRAP broke slow and trailed in the beginning, began to rally four wide entering the turn, continued outside passing foes while widest in the ten path at the
top of the stretch, closed well down the lane and bested the rest while a non threatening third. JUST ON TIME broke with the field but had little early foot
and was situated near the back in the early stages, commenced a run three wide into the turn, ran on in the five path turning for home, found a seam at the
eighth pole and finished up well to be involved for the minors in the end. O WOW stalked between horses in the middle of the pack running through the turn,
was roused at the top of the stretch and finished up evenly to the finish line. WORST BEHAVIOUR pressed the pace early on the rail, offered a mild bid four
wide turning for home, fought on stubbornly between foes until the sixteenth pole and tired late while on the wrong lead. SECRETS GALORE waited on the
the rail in the middle of the pack on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and showed some interest inside running to the wire. MRS. C was ridden for
more through the turn, trailed the field at the top of the lane and passed tired horses in final eighth. MISS JESSEL steadied briefly after the start, stalked
midfield in the early stages, offered a brief run seven wide in upper stretch to be in the mix and weakened between rivals the last eighth. GATHERING
STORM settled in mid pack travelling three wide down the backside, was asked for more on the turn and could not get involved through the stretch. VELIKIY
broke out at the start, recovered to lead at the half mile pole, was collared outside with two furlongs to run and stopped on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
A GAME was urged at the break and moved forward up in behind rivals near inside, tracked from that vantage point, had room at the rail and bid in
mid-stretch taking the lead past the furlong marker, held from a rallying SECRETARYOFTHENILE, who shifted in early, saved ground early on the turn, was
asked for run about the five-sixteenths but lacked room for a bit near the quarter pole while coming off the inside, found room navigating from between rivals
three to four wide in upper stretch, rallied but was too late. GAYELETTE settled off the pace racing outside about three wide into the turn, swung six deep
and gained steadily in the stretch. I'M INTO MISCHIEF bumped with a rival at the start but moved forward inside to set take the lead and set the pace, came
out a bit turning for home, was outkicked. WARWOMAN stalked going three wide on the turn and a bit wider into upper stretch, failed to rally. DRAMATIC
FASHION settled at the rear, came out four wide turning for home, moved back in and passed tiring rivals inside. GIO MARIA pressed the pace from
outside, came up empty. MARALINGA bumped with a rival at the start, swung six wide into the stretch, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
WHO SAYS tracked behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, angled out to be three wide for her bid turning for home, engaged for the lead at the
furlong marker outside and battled to the wire getting the better part of the close photo at the line. BEQUIA hounded the pacesetter down the backstretch,
took command just outside midpoint on the far turn, braced for the outside challenge from the winner in mid stretch, fought on determinedly to the wire and
unfortunately lost the bob at the wire in a hard fought lost. FRENCH FRANC (FR) tracked two wide in the second flight behind the engaging leaders when
the running started at the five sixteenths pole, loomed three wide at the quarter pole and ran on well through the stretch but need more to threaten the top
two at the wire. UMNEYAAT was situated near the back three wide into the first turn, began to offer a run four wide midpoint on the far turn, shifted out six
wide in upper stretch and showed some late interest to get up for a small share in the end. JOLENE JOLENE settled on the rail near the rear at the half,
stalked inside in the third flight into the far turn, was asked for more at the top of the stretch and need more to be in the hunt at the finish. TENPENNY NAIL
trailed the field in the beginning, continued to see them all down the backside and could not get involved for the drive to the line. GAV'S DREAM GIRL broke
sharp to lead through the early stages, was collared three eighths from the finish, offered little resistance on the rail through the turn and stopped on the
fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK tracked the pacesetter from inside, had room from that juncture in the stretch, bid at the eighth pole, was soon clear and held off a rival
under moderate urging. BEYOND MYBUDGET broke outwardly just a bit, pursued the pace from between runners to the three-eighths, came out past the
five-sixteenths, was five wide at the top of the stretch, kept on with good late energy but was only second best. IMAGERY broke out just a bit, raced outside
foes early, dropped back and moved in a bit going three to four wide through much of the turn, swung six deep and finished with late interest. MARIE
MACKAY quickly moved clear and shifted in to set the pace, came out a bit turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. BEAT THE SYSTEM pursued the
pace three to four wide, weakened. MOQADAMA (IRE) was outpaced early, came out five wide turning for home, had no rally.

Footnotes
AMI'S LINK trailed the field in the early stages, began to rally circling around runners midpoint on the far turn, was widest in the eight path for the stretch
drive and was full of run outside to get up the last few jumps before the wire. FLAT OUT VIXEN hopped at the break but recovered nicely to stalk mid pack
on the rail into the backstretch, waited inside early in the far turn, crept up the fence at the quarter pole, rallied between runners at the furlong marker in the
two path, took command at the sixteenth pole and could not hold the closing winner nearing the line. BELLA NINA took control from the onset, set the
fractions down the backstretch, was collared outside in mid stretch and fought on well enough to be a clear third at the finish. TEXT ME UP tracked the
frontrunner on the rail in the second flight at the half, could not keep pace while inside with the leaders through the turn, found a little bit more in upper
stretch and finished up with intent to get a small share in the end. PHIL IN ECHO saved ground from the onset, slipped up the fence two furlongs to the
finish, angled out to the four path for the drive, was steadied in mid stretch between rivals and could not recover in time to threaten for a better placing.
MACHISIMA tracked the leader in the second flight racing three wide outside, chased the frontrunner into the far turn, took closer order at the quarter
marker and stalled between foes in mid stretch. MOONLIGHT RAIN settled near the back of the pack in the beginning stages, was roused between rivals
entering the far turn, could not close on the leaders in upper stretch and ran evenly to the finish. LIL'S TURN was shuffled back on the rail to trail through the
far turn, angled out to the four path for the drive and passed weakening runners in the final eighth. BLU SKY SUNRISE travelled four wide into the first turn,
continued to be outside runners at the half, put in a brief run four wide on the far turn and had nothing left in the tank turning for home. ENDORPHIN RUSH
chased the early pace just off the fence down the backside, began to weaken between rivals three furlongs from the finish and had nothing to give to make
an impact in the late stages of the race. SAN NICOLA STAR travelled in mid field at the half between runners, was asked through the far turn and offered
little for the drive through the stretch.
