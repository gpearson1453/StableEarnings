Footnotes
BADGER GAL chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued spying leader on the turn, entered stretch in the three path, dueled with leader until the
final sixteenth and edged clear in final yards under a strong ride. NORTH DAWN hard sent to clear rivals on the backstretch, continued clear entering the
turn, held a half length advantage at top of the stretch, fought gamely in the lane until weakening in the final sixteenth in a game effort. DORITA'S LEMON
stalked pacesetters two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane widest and easily bested rest in the lane. QUEEN
VERRAZANO settled off the pace on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in the two path and lacked needed rally to improve. MY
SWEET MARY stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn in range, began to lose ground throughout the turn and failed to have anything
in the lane. MY BELLA CHICK saved ground on the backstretch, continued along the inside heading into turn, rival in front of her began to back up and
caused MY BELL CHICK to take up and lose ground, failed to rebid and had no impact in the lane after the trouble.
