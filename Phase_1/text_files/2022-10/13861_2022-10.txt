pressure at the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. GOSSIPING stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through later yards for second. TINAS SHINING STAR settled off the rail, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path, then flattened the final furlong. PRETTY SPECTACULAR ducked in at the break then
stalked the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the
lane. BOCA BIRDIE was squeezed leaving the gate and raced well back, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and could only improve her position.

SHANGHAI CANDY settled off the pace in the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily improved in the three path of the far turn, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch and edged clear the final yards. MONGOLIAN HERO accelerated to the front while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and drew clear of Ricardito past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and
reluctantly ceded. LUFTY'S KISSES settled inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, got up for
third mid-stretch and finished well. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT settled in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close
off the rail on the far turn but flattened in the lane. RICARDITO stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back at the five
sixteenths and faded on the far turn. SNOW CANDY hopped at the break then settled off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole and weakened
widest on the far turn. FEISTY KITTEN was not a factor.

AMIDSHIPS was hustled clear toward the three eighths pole, ran near the rail on the turn then steadily handled in the lane. MANHATTAN WEAVE stumbled
at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. DRINKWITHTHESTARS
gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, lugged in under right hand encouragement through the upper stretch and finished evenly when straightened away.
HOPPING HENRY chased the pace then steadied off the rail past the quarter pole, recovered stride midway on the turn, checked in tight at the rail off the
inside flank of Drinkwiththestars through the upper stretch, altered course from the sixteenth pole but flattened stride. REMYS GUNSMOKE chased outside,
rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. WARRIOR'S ESTATE and FOREVER TAKES TIME were not factors. The Stewards reviewed a
claim of foul against the rider of Drinkwiththestars for interference through the upper stretch, lodged by the rider of Hopping Henry, and disqualified the
former to fourth place.

MARZ EXPRESS stalked two deep then challenged into the backstretch, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, took the nod past the
eighth pole and lasted well under steady handling. STRONG WILLED settled just off the pace four wide the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
ran in the three path of the far turn, eased outward into the lane and dug in under steady handling to get up for second the final stride. KEEP ON SPURRIN
rated a short lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Marz Express leaving the half mile pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met
at even terms midway through the turn, dug in gamely through the stretch but was nipped from second the final stride. LUCKY BLONDE steadied at the start
then saved ground, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, withdrew from her rail position and altered course midway on the far turn, left the
turn in the five path and made a strong outside bid through the lane. JUBA'S PARADE raced boxed between horses three wide on the first turn, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole, race at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. IMPRESSIONISM settled back saving ground
on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but flattened in the lane. LIGHTNIN RUNNER raced in tight
between horses on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened in the lane. MARMO MOON

Footnotes
AWESOME INCENTIVE settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the
head of the lane, then dug in determinedly to edge out the stretch effort of SAKARI, who bobbled at the break then saved ground on the first turn, eased out
into the backstretch and bid past the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn and dug in a close stretch factor. DYLADDIE settled off the rail on
the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, challenged toward the three eighths pole, took a slim lead two deep approaching the quarter but
was caught toward the head of the lane and flattened later yards. MISS COREY saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn in the four path, left the turn outside and passed rivals. TOUGH ONE contested the early pace two deep then took the nod into the backstretch,
came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back into the lane and weakened. I B
NASTY rounded the opening turn in the three path, left the turn outside and bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole, then flattened in the three path of the
far turn. NOBODY'S SECRET bobbled at the break, took a brief early lead then settled inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened into the
far turn. EXCUSES EXCUSES broke through the gate prior the start, closed to the lead approaching the three quarter pole and contested the early pace,
was met into the backstretch, gave chase from the half mile pole but gave way leaving the three eighths.
