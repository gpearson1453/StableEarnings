Footnotes
LOVE TO ZOOM broke in and made contact with Carnival Lucky then took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five
sixteenths pole, extended her lead at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert to draw off in the lane. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET broke outward and made
contact with CARNIVAL LUCKY then saved ground on the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
ran in the four path of the far turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take second later yards. The latter was jostled leaving the gate and settled off the
rail the first turn, bid leaving the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. REVEIRS MINUTE rounded
the opening turn in the five and six paths then stalked into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then
flattened inside the eighth pole. HOW IS SHE saved ground.

Footnotes
BENNY THE BOOK stalked off the rail then challenged at even terms into the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn,
but dug in under determined stretch handling to regain the edge in late yards. LOVE MACHINE stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide toward the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn but was met in late yards and
reluctantly ceded. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. GREYSHOTT came away a bit awkwardly and settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the lane. BOBBYS CASE LOAD set the early pace inside, was met into
the backstretch and gave chase at mostly even terms from that point, but, steadied in tight and brushed the rail past the five sixteenths pole and faded
through the far turn. After an inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the riders of both Benny The Book and Love Machine, for alleged interference
past the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Bobbys Case Load, the Stewards found no cause for change.

STRONG FIBER pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took a slim lead leaving the eighth pole and dug in
determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game stretch effort of DRINKWITHTHESTARS, who set a pressured pace through the backstretch and
contested the edge two deep on the turn, ceded the advantage leaving the eighth pole but continued a game stretch factor. HOPPING HENRY chased
through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out into the lane and finished well. WARRIOR'S ESTATE gave chase, raced in the three path
on the turn, eased to the outside into the lane but showed little more. SO COURAGEOUS gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened in the
lane.

SOMMER VELVET stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn, drifted a bit leaving
the turn but dueled for the lead approaching mid-stretch, raced clear at the sixteenth pole and held well under steady handling. HEIDI T settled back off the
rail the first turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, eased outward through the upper stretch and came along to take
second the final yards. POLISHED GEM rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met and dueled at even terms
nearest the rail on the far turn, dropped back toward mid-stretch and flattened later yards. MIDNIGHT REGRET entered the opening turn in the five path but
moved to the inside midway through the turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and ran evenly through the
lane. WALK A FINE LINE settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the three path of the far
turn. DEVILISH AFFAIR was slow getting into stride and saved early ground well back, eased outward into the backstretch, showed little response and
rounded the far turn about the four path.

DETERMINED TRUTH bobbled leaving the gate then tapered in to stalk two deep, challenged and took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled
clear approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. LADY CINCO DE MAYO rated a short early
lead, was met nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled close from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter pole, dug in through the stretch and
held well for second. VILLAREGGIA settled close inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly
in the lane. MERCI ROAD was bumped at the start and settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened
at the rail on the far turn. OVERCOOKED ducked out leaving the gate and made contact with both Decisive Cause and Merci Road then saved ground on
the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened in the three path of the far turn. TAPPING SOUTH was not a factor. DARE
ME settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. CAST NO STONES drifted
to the five path into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DECISIVE CAUSE was bumped then pinched back at the start, bore
out on the first turn, was eased leaving the turn and walked off post race.
