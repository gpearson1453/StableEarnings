Footnotes
SOLID GOLD BAR pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead into the lane, responded when
challenged by LODE THE GOLD with a sixteenth to run and held gamely to the wire. LODE THE GOLD set a pressured pace while racing three-wide,
stayed on in the drive, offered a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, could not get by the winner but finished willingly. WISKEY CROWN chased the leaders while
racing five-wide throughout and finished well in the drive. KICK IT lagged throughout.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE IDEA sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with little need of urging. SWEET RIVER
BAINES was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to
gain the place. MR PAYTIENCE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. CLAVICHORD chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. BRICKBAT lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
OUR IRIS ROSE was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and held GEMSTONE GAL
safe late. GEMSTONE GAL pressed the pace while racing four-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter and again in mid-stretch and finished well when
straightened away. ELDORADO DREAM chased the leaders while racing four-wide, was carried out by GEMSTONE GAL nearing the quarter, checked
when that rival drifted out in mid-stretch and failed to gain in the drive. QUATRO was forwardly placed from the inside, reached a striking position
approaching the stretch and lacked the needed closing response. GUARDING ELK CAMP showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
failed to threaten. GRAN MANNA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
EVIL TEMPTATION stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, angled out further in mid-stretch, wore down GABRIELLA WHO in the final yards and was
going away late. GABRIELLA WHO pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run but could not match strides
with the winner late. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to gain
on the top pair late. BERNICE WHO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and showed some late run. CYNICAL GIRL was void of early speed,
raced six-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. OUR ISLAND GIRL set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final
furlong. CLOSING TIME CUTIE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. JASMINE WHO was void of early foot,
saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. SHAMEONNATALIE showed brief speed and weakened. CURL was off a
step slow, moved up quickly to race just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the lane and weakened in the drive.
