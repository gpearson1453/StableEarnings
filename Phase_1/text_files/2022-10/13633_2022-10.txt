DOUBLE ADVANTAGE vied for the lead from the three then the two path to the turn, continued in the two path with a clear lead into the lane, raced in the
two path into the lane then opened up inside the eighth pole to widen to the wire. COMPLEX JUSTICE pressed the early pace from along the inside into the
turn, continued along the rail through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more outside the eighth pole but was no match for the winner through the
final sixteenth. BLUEMOON JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the the two
others then weakened inside the eighth pole. SHIPSHAPE was in the two path through the turn while trailing, came off the rail further into the lane and
moved up while not a factor. SEMINOLE JUSTICE raced close up early, settled back into the turn and never was a menace. HERE COMES TREY raced
along the inside through the turn and steadily faded.

MUSIC TO MY EARS pressed the pace from the three path and two wide through mid-turn, gained the lead in late turn, continued with a short lead into the
lane while entering from the three path, dropped closer to the inside while straightening, slowly extended the advantage to the eighth pole and widened
through the final eighth while being kept to the task. JOYFUL HEART settled off the pace early, moved up along the rail through the turn, bid into the lane
while close to the rail but was no match for the winner while finishing well clear of the others. SHAPE OF YOU set the pace from the two path through
mid-turn, chased the top two into the lane and faded. KITTENS ADAIR was never a factor while along the inside. KIDYOUNOT raced in the three to the two
path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a response.

Footnotes
READY FOR MORE was in the two path through the turn, angled into the six path into the lane, gained momentum through the lane from the six or seven
path and was up in time. WHERE'S MOE was away very quickly to clear for the lead at once, dueled for the lead into the turn, continued to duel for the top
spot through the turn, dispatched of challenger into the lane and was joined by another soon after, dueled with that one through the final eighth, gamely held
a short lead in deep stretch then was caught from the outside by the winner near the wire. PABLO'S SUN was in the three path through the turn, bid into the
lane from the four path, nearly had the lead inside the eighth pole then could not finish it up while turning in a good effort. SMOOTH TALKING MAN was in
the two path through the turn and moved up through the final eighth while not a threat. COPPER HARBOR chased the pace from the three or four path
through the turn, went with the winner into the lane, could not keep up with that one after straightening and finished evenly. PURSUANT was along the
inside through the turn and never was a factor. JUST A NOTION dueled for the lead along the inside through the turn then faded through the lane.
HICKORY BILL was outrun while in the four to the three path through the turn.

Footnotes
AEROBALLISTIC chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn, gained a clear lead into the lane from the three path, widened to the
eighth pole then held while under intermittent right-handed urging to the wire. SUDDEN SHIFT tracked the pace along the inside through the turn and into
the lane, moved closest to the winner outside the eighth pole and settled for second best. AMICABLE saved ground through the turns, came off the rail to
pass tiring rival into the lane and was clear for the show spot while not a threat. BELLA'S PRAYER was in the four path through the far turn, bid in late turn
and into the lane then flattened out inside the eighth pole. CIELO BLU was in the three path through the turns when never far back, came into the lane from
the five path and tired. NO PROOF was in the two path through the turns then tired in the lane. KINGOFTHERAINBOW set the pace while under pressure in
the far turn then gave way after entering the lane.

OMIXOCHITL pressed the pace outside of the leader, settled, then bid at the eighth pole and was clear under steady handling. POLKA POLENTA was clear
early but couldn't hold off the winner. TIMELESS ROSE stalked the pace in the three path, saved ground around the far turn, bid in the stretch but couldn't
close late. CHEROKEE SONG raced in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then had no late bid. DISCREET KITTY had a mild late bid inside.
KNEESNHIPS and LINDALEVESOLTA (ARG) was not a factor. FONSSAGRIVES stalked the early pace before fading.

Footnotes
SOLAR POWER chased the pace from the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the pacesetter,
inched up to that one just inside the eighth pole, dueled past the sixteenth pole and edged up late. NATURAL HARBOR set the pace from the two path
through mid-turn, vied with another into the lane, dispatched that one and was joined by the winner soon after, dueled with that one until late and could not
keep up while clearly second best. MOGUL CRACK chased the early pace while along the inside through mid-turn, moved to duel with the runner-up into
the lane, could not keep up with that one but stayed on well to be best of the rest. FROG TOWN saved ground through the turn and moved up through the
lane while off the inside. GO MAMBO raced close up early while three wide into the turn, continued to chase the pace into the lane then weakened. G T
FIVE HUNDRED was in the three path through the turn, moved closer to the rail through the lane and never was a serious factor. SATURN BOY raced five
wide into the turn, chased the pace while still in the five path and tired in the lane. SMALL SAILOR was in the four to the three path through the turn and was
empty. BORN FLAWLESS was outrun while in the two path through the turn and into the lane.
