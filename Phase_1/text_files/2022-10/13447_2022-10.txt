Footnotes
BOSSY SOUL stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter in
upper stretch, was kept to task through deep stretch and held in a drive at the end. GRIGORO was unhurried in the early going, came five wide into the
backstretch run, improved position four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the drive, finished well and was up for second in the final strides. DEL MAR
FLASH settled off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, maintained that path to the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was
outkicked in the final stages but held safely for third in the end. NICOLE GRACE was unhurried, raced two to three wide to the second turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch, was not able to catch the leaders in the drive but showed good late interest. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was sent to the early lead, set
decent fractions while prompted to the second turn, was caught in upper stretch, chased the winner to mid-stretch and faded late. SILK ROAD SALLY was
forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace to the second turn from an inside path, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the end. FANTASTIC
SECRET raced close to the solid early fractions, stayed within aim of the pacesetter to the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) raced close to the moderate early pace while under a tight hold to the backstretch run, was under restraint to the three-furlong
marker, overtook BELLEO'S MUSIC midway through the turn, took command into the drive and pulled away through the lane as much the best. INFINITE
LOVE was unhurried early on, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide on the second turn, was no match for the winner in
the stretch run but stayed on well late to be well clear of the rest for second. BIG ATTRACTION bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed,
saved ground to the second turn, was not able to impact the top pair but passed tired rivals in the stretch run to secure third. SHE'S A BIT SASSY rated just
off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals to the second turn, gained ground nearing the top of the lane, could not sustain that run in the drive and
flattened out in the late going. KOKO'S MOM showed early speed and raced close to the moderate fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run,
stalked the pace to the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way late. BELLEO'S MUSIC was sent to the early lead, set modest
fractions while prompted to the second turn, was overtaken by the winner midway through the far turn, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ROSE saved ground while racing in the second flight early on, advanced along the backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the top of
the lane, vied for the lead in mid-stretch and found more in the final sixteenth to draw clear late. BENSON was hustled to get to the early lead, cleared the
field into the first turn and set moderate fractions through the second turn, was confronted in upper stretch, could not keep pace with NORTHERN ROSE in
the final sixteenth but held well at the end for second. ALL was away alertly and tracked the pacesetter through the early stages, prompted the pace to the
second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and just held for third. FOGGY BOTTOM settled three wide off of the early
fractions, maintained position to the second turn, slipped to the inside turning for home, finished well in the final furlong and just missed for third on the wire.
ARISTEIA lunged at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle, gained ground three wide on the second turn, came within aim in mid-stretch, was
not able to sustain her bid in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. ALESHA hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried,
saved ground to the second turn, was unable to impact the leaders late but did offer a mild late bid. TYCHE AWAITS YOU stalked the decent early fractions,
lost position along the backstretch run, was asked for run on the far turn and was not a factor in the stretch run. KITTYBE QUICK was forwardly placed in
the early stages, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, came four wide into the second turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SACRED RIDER was sent leaving the break and established the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was
challenged by RESPECT THE HUSTLE on the far turn, repelled that foe in upper stretch, extended the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew away in
the end. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was prominently placed heading into the first turn, prompted the pace through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the
quarter marker to challenge for the lead, was turned away in that effort leaving the second turn, was no match for the winner late but held for second in a
blanket finish for the minor awards. J T'S WATCH stalked the reasonable early fractions, saved ground to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was
outkicked in the final stages and just missed for second at the end while holding for third. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) settled four wide off of the early pace, came
three wide along the second turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, improved position in the drive, lacked the needed late response but just missed for third
on the line. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY came in tight nearing the first turn, was shuffled back along the first turn and trailed into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the second turn, came three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. STALKING SHADOW
settled off of the early pace, maintained position to the second turn and did not offer a late rally. SENSEMAKER stumbled at the start, the rider lost an iron
for a stride then recovered to show early speed, stalked the decent pace to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, lost position in upper
stretch and faded late.

Footnotes
LOVE LOST stalked the early pace, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased MATCHLESS to mid-stretch, closed determinedly to
overtake that rival in deep stretch and edged away late in a good debut. MATCHLESS was away in good order and showed early speed to dispute the pace
to the turn, pressed the pace to the quarter marker, took command into the drive and edged away into mid-stretch, could not hold off LOVE LOST in deep
stretch but was well clear of the rest for second. MY YAMMY LADY was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position three wide nearing
the quarter marker, was no match for the top pair in the late stages but passed tired rivals to secure third at the end. JAZZY LOVE chased the early
fractions, came two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. JERSEY STAR showed speed and contested the
early pace, lost position on the turn and faded in the stretch run. SASSY TINKERBELL broke in the air and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn,
improved position in upper stretch but was not able to threaten late. CAUSEWAY GIRL broke slowly, chased from the rail through the turn and tired in the
drive. DANZING ROAD broke alertly and showed good early speed to contest the pace, set the pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper
stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
DERRYGOOLIN took back off of the early pace and tracked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, made a steady gain on the pacesetter and
confronted that rival nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, extended the lead in mid-stretch, held foes at bay in deep stretch and dug in
late to secure the win. VINCERO GRANDE saved ground into the first turn while forwardly placed, advanced two wide on the far turn, was steered three
wide into the lane, gained ground in mid-stretch, was held at bay through the late stages and held for second in the final strides. VRONSKY FEINT rated off
of the solid early fractions, raced in the second flight while just off of the rail to the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, came in tight and lacked
room in mid-stretch, found room late and was outkicked in the final sixteenth, while holding for third at the end. DISTORTED QUEEN hesitated at the start
then was bumped leaving the break and spotted the field early on, lagged through the early stages, improved position three wide on the far turn, swung five
wide into upper stretch, continued to gain ground through the lane and challenged for the minor awards in the end. SKY MAKER made contact with
DISTORTED QUEEN leaving the break, was allowed to settle, kept a two wide path to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch but did not
produce a late rally. EMILY SMILES stalked the early pace from the second flight, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the
second turn, was asked for run nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the drive. MISS BELLA showed early speed and dictated terms to the first turn,
set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted on the far turn, was overtaken nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
IMAGINARY broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set a fast pace while on a clear lead through the turn, was hand urged to mid-stretch, shied from the
crop after a few reminders in deep stretch and switched leads close to home but held safely in the end in a solid debut. MASTERY KAT was a bit slow into
stride early on, improved position four wide on the turn, made a steady advance in upper stretch, closed well late and challenged the winner in the final
sixteenth, could not reel in IMAGINARY in the final strides but was clear of the rest for second. OH ANGEL lost her path at the start but recovered to show
speed to the turn, improved position three wide midway through the bend, chased IMAGINARY to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages but held for
third in the final strides. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, came in tight along the rail nearing the half-mile marker, lost
position on the turn, swung three wide nearing the quarter marker, came five wide into upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and just missed for
third at the end. JUST A LITTLE LUCK was forwardly placed into the turn, tracked the pace from an inside path to the top of the stretch, lost position nearing
the furlong marker and did not produce a late rally. ULTIMATE DIVA chased the pace from the second flight, lost ground on the turn, was not able to impact
the leaders in the lane but offered a mild late rally. STANDFORGRIT showed early speed and chased the pacesetter to the turn, maintained position to the
quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. IRISH SONG LEADER chased the quick pace, gained ground three wide nearing
the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the drive and gave way in the final stages. NOSHEWONT lunged at the start and was away slowly, settled
toward the rear came three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive and was not able to threaten late. FREED BY MAGIC was away
slowly, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
POLACCO showed good early speed and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the lead
nearing the quarter pole, drew off to mid-stretch, was tiring in the final sixteenth, came under pressure late but held on to prevail. STRAUS'S PLACE was
unhurried early on, saved ground through the backstretch run, was roused midway through the far turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, swung four
wide into the drive, closed fast in the final stages to pressure the winner but could not reel him in in the end and was second best. LOVE OF THE SPORT
stalked the solid fractions from a ground saving path, lost position on the far turn, rallied in the final stages and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding
for third in the end. STAY LIT was allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, swung five wide into upper stretch and found his best stride late.
TOM'S MOON lacked early speed, came four wide into the backstretch run, swung widest leaving the second turn to be six wide in upper stretch, was
unable to threaten in the final stages but improved position late. FROMAJACKTOAKING stalked the early pace from the second flight, moved up nearing the
half-mile marker, came three wide along the far turn while within range, could not keep pace in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. MESA EMPIRE tracked
the quick fractions through the backstretch run, chased POLACCO along the second turn, could not respond when that rival drew off leaving the quarter
marker and gave way in the final furlong. LOVER BOY TOM settled three wide off of the early pace, lost position nearing the second turn, dropped back in
upper stretch and was unable to threaten in the late stages.

Footnotes
VANTAGE POINT sent to the front from the outside post where he was challenged for the early lead by TAM'S TIME, took over when that one pulled away
from a potential duel, set what appeared to be comfortable fractions through the first time while repelling two early challenges from SYNC, was asked to pick
it up passing the seven-sixteenth pole, responded by opening up a clear advantage through the far turn and finished with determination under a vigorous
hand ride and intermittent urging to prevail. KAZAN (IRE) trailed the field through the first turn, came out a bit wide, was encouraged to stay close to the
pack past the finish line for the first time and remained under a steady hand ride to the top of the stretch, responded to steady pressure to wear down
CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE for second in a good effort. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE reserved early, was four-wide on the first turn, three-wide on the second turn,
made some steady progress towards the front in the run down the backstretch, launched a strong bid from the three-furlong marker while still racing wide
and ran on well but was outfinished in the final stages. ENGRAM had no early speed, kept to the rail while well behind the field to the far turn, swung out a
little wide for the stretch and kept to task to pick off some of the fading foes. HAPI HAPI was not pressed for speed out of the gate, moved up with the pack
while under a tight hold to get close to the pacesetter after a half-mile while racing between horses, continued that way around the clubhouse turn, found
himself within a length of the lead while still under restraint, was finally let loose passing the nine-sixteenth pole, appeared to need some running room into
the final turn, was unable to quicken when able, lost some ground and was going one-paced to the wire. TAM'S TIME was hustled out of the gate to gain
position, ceded the lead to VANTANGE POINT, stayed to the inside while always close, started to lose some ground on the back stretch run, attempted to
keep up when the pace picked up with a half mile to go but was unable to do so and ran on somewhat evenly to the wire. SYNC broke with the pack but
reserved off the early leaders through the first turn, exchanged light bumps with CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE entering the stretch for the first time, moved up
while three wide to challenge for the lead passing the finish line the first time, continued wide around the clubhouse turn, moved up to challenge for the lead
once again passing the eleven-sixteenths pole, had that challenge rebuked, remained in striking position to the far turn then started to fall back through the
field as the pace quickened.
