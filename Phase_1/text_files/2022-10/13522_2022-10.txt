Footnotes
MOR VICTORY broke a step slow, moved up down the backside, came around the turn four wide, made an outside bid down the lane and drove clear
before the wire. FOUR O SIX CREED pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, finished willingly and was outfinished late for the win. AWESOME
CAJUN challenged near the front end in the beginning, eased back, made a late gain and got up for third. STEP ON IT pressed the pace, saved ground and
got caught late for the show. BRITE OUTLOOK sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, steadied down the stretch, getting in
tight quarters and was done. BUCK'S GLORY raced evenly near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and was never a factor. QUIET AS
MIDNIGHT lacked early speed and was never a threat. NERKY ROSE always raced near the back and trailed.

Footnotes
WILD MALLORY broke sharp, quickly pulled away, led throughout, proved much the best and won easily, while setting a new track record. ITSNOTMYJOB
raced within contention in the early part, followed the winner to the wire, proving no match, but was best of others. ROARING QUINN raced near the middle
of the field, moved up, was a clear third, while proving no match for the top two. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
SUMMERTIME BANDIT raced within striking distance in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, faded and was no factor late. GEE GEE void of early
speed and was never close. KNIGHTS SWORD always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
CYCLONE SORORITY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, while dueling with MOMENT TO DREAM, pulled away and proved much the
best. FOR REAL ALICE raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SUFFRAGETTE
unhurried in the early part, came around the final turn four wide, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. SILVER SIREN
void of early speed and passed tired ones. MOMENT TO DREAM dueled for the early advantage, saved ground and faded. GILDED APPLE lacked early
speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a threat.

QUOTABELLE dueled on the front end, pulled away around the turn and proved much the best. SHESABEAUTYDANCER vied for the early lead, made a
late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but outfinished EXPECT A DANCER for second. EXPECT A DANCER showed early speed, saved ground
around the turn, steadied, was outfinished for second, but held on for show. KANCANCUTIE raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and
lacked a late kick. TYPO lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. PSALM PRAYER showed early speed, dropped
back and was no threat late. CALIFORNIA CALI lacked early speed and was never close. CINCO DE MAYO trailed throughout and showed little. THE
JOCKEY OF #1 EXPECT A DANCER LODGED A CLAIM AGAINST #3 SHESABEAUTYDANCER FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN. AFTER

GRAND PRIORITY raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, took the advantage around the final turn and proved the best down the lane, holding
off SPEEDY G for the win. SPEEDY G raced within contention, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. BODE'S LIGHT
lacked early speed, racing evenly near the back, made a late wide bid and got up for the show. SMOKY TOPAZ raced near the middle of the pack, made a
mild bid and was outfinished for third. DEALMEINBUD steadied around the first turn, getting to close to rival and passed tired ones late. WEDINGTON went
to the front, drove clear and faded on the inside. PAYNT BATTLE pressed the early pace and was finished early. MY BOOK void of early speed, moved up
to the middle of the pack, dropped back and was no threat late.

Footnotes
GRIEF unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, angled inside down the home stretch, made a late rail bid and finished well. WISE ANCHOR
dueled on the front end, saved ground, took the advantage down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner late. COMMANDER SCOTT raced within
striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside, made a late bid and was outfinished by the top two. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN unhurried,
racing near the back, came around the second turn five wide, made a late gain, but was no factor. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF raced evenly near the back in
the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, moved up, but was no factor. TOO MUCH BOURBON pressed the early pace, was finished early, while
racing wide down the final stretch and proved no factor. YOUR TIME'S COMING always raced near the back and was outrun. AND FIFTY dueled on the
front end and dropped back.

Footnotes
AWESOME ARCH vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and won under steady urging. CHICKIETOWN STAR dueled on the front end,
forwardly placed throughout, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but held on for place. MAYWON lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied
from the outside and finished willingly. DON'T LOOK ETHEL showed early speed, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. WITH GRACE lacked early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. MO DIXIE DIVA challenged for the early lead, raced four wide around the turn and faded. HOT PATOOTIE
flashed early speed, weakened on the inside around the turn and was no threat late. SECRET MOMENT void of early speed and was never close.
SEEMYVALENTINE raced near the back and was never a factor.
