Footnotes
BAT FLIP came away in good order and went straight to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage in the two path, responded well when set down
into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. KALIK was taken in hand early, went three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the
place. FIGHTERTOWN saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path around the far turn, shifted three wide while
asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the drive, swapped back to his inside lead inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while able
to get the show. AMERICAN HUSTLE moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under solid restraint, moved closer with a half-mile to
run, raced inside on the far turn, was roused in the two path at the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response. SCAT TU TAP was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far
turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and weakened. FARADAY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
went around the first turn in the two path, moved closer with a half-mile to run, raced inside to the two path on the final turn, dropped in from behind horses
in upper stretch and failed to threaten. PLEASE BABY moved in while taken in hand leaving the chute, was reserved on the inside, saved ground through
the far turn and failed to respond. WISECRAKEN was coaxed early then taken in hand, dropped from the five path to the three path early on the first turn,
dropped back entering the backstretch, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn and came up empty. BROTHER SHOWTYME angled in
early, came back out to be four wide around the first turn, moved closer with a half-mile to run, went four then five wide on the far turn and was no factor. IN
SPADES stood in the gate and was off around seven to eighth lengths behind the front, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, went three wide
on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and also was no factor.

Footnotes
MYRISKYAFFAIR coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to prevail. ENSEMBLE (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit from near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in a
blanket finish behind the winner. UNRULY JULIE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran
on to procure the show honors. LISHEEN coaxed from the start, tracked the leader along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. EVER SUMMER coaxed from the gate, tracked the front just off the inside in closest aim, came
under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide for home and kept on under a drive to the finish but was out-finished in the late stages.
RHOMBIQUE just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered
up a belated bid but made no headway. BROADWAY BOOGIE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took
the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. YOUENS coaxed from the start, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ANYWHO was well placed down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn, dropped to the rail under a right-handed crop at the quarter-pole,
chased into the final furlong, gained to take the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. DON'T TELL AMY was bumped soundly while
off a bit slow, raced off the pace under urging, went three then four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, gained outside in the drive and
finished willingly for the place. RISK FREE was bumped lightly in the hindquarters at the start, showed speed then was taken in hand when the leader
crossed in front, moved up to stalk that foe on the outside, took the lead with seven-sixteenths to run, shook clear in the three path later on that bend, was
asked for her best in the four path into upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and weakened but was clear for the show. KAYLEIGH'S
PRIDE was bumped hard between foes at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, dropped
in inside the three-sixteenths and tired. GINETTES ON FIRE went to the front then dropped in, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths and capitulated. REIGN OF THUNDER was hustled from the start then urged along off the
pace, dropped back fast late on the backstretch and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. LA GROTTE stumbled inward severely at the
start, bumped hard with a foe to the inside and nearly unseated the rider, spotted the front many lengths and was eased but walked off.

under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) saved ground in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at he five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show honors latching on
the top pair as they hit the wire. REGAL SPEAKER tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and kept on under a drive to preserve the last major share. QUIET OUT EAST coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the end. BARLEEWON coaxed from the start, settled just off the

Footnotes
RUN CURTIS RUN got bumped at the start by TOO MANY TWIZZLERS due to pressure from OUTLAW KID, then got bumped again from GROOMS ALL
BIZNESS due to pressure from JUST JEREMY and was squeezed back in tandem with TOO MANY TWIZZLERS conceding four lengths to the front,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch briefly before tucking to the two path following the tuck of SOSUA SUMMER directly in front, chased
two then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a
good kick to issue a challenge through the final furlong rolling by the leader just inside seventy yards to run, then edged away to the finish to prevail.
GROOMS ALL BIZNESS got bumped at the start in a chain of bumps due to pressure from JUST JEREMY, chased two to three wide just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to challenge a furlong out and took command near the sixteenth
marker, then got collared just inside seventy yards to go and was along safe for the place honors. OUTLAW KID broke out at the start bumping TOO MANY
TWIZZLERS into RUN CURTIS RUN, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. JUST JEREMY broke in at the start beginning a chain of bumps down through TOO MANY TWIZZLERS, led
briefly before prompting the pace of THAT'S RIGHT from the outside in the two path, got shaken off three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to come again a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. THAT'S RIGHT established the
front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe, shook off that rival at the
three-eighths, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and then a trio and was collared near the sixteenth
marker before weakening in the late going. LEGENDS CAN'T DIE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TOO MANY TWIZZLERS got bumped at the start by OUTLAW KID breaking outwards and in turn
bumped RUN CURTIS RUN, then got bumped by that outside rival due to pressure coming inwards begun by JUST JEREMY and got pinched back in
concert with RUN CURTIS RUN conceding four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. SOSUA SUMMER chased four paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path with
nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and came up empty. SURPRISE BOSS bobbled at the break and
was bumped by JUST JEREMY commencing a chain of bumps down through to OUTLAW KID, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide for home and weakened in the stretch.

rallied in the final furlong and closed well to get up late. MR BREADWINNER was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace between horses, dropped back
near the half-mile pole, chased in the two path early on the turn then shifted four wide at the three-eighths, gained to take the lead into upper stretch then
shook clear, drifted out some into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. WILL E SUTTON settled
on the outside, was roused while three to five wide around the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path and finished willingly for the show. JAKE ROCKS
contested the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path around on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. DOCTOR LOVE was
taken up while in tight at the start, raced well back in the field under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
improved position but just missed the superfecta. MOTION TO STRIKE brushed with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied
along the rail on the turn and tired. SPECTATORLESS stumbled at the start then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, went four wide on the turn
and was no factor. MERCHANTS OF COOL brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and
came up empty. EXXTOP settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

led to the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken while able to get the place. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. AMANDA'S FOLLY
chased the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong and weakened. FOLLOW

three wide on the turn and was no factor. LA CHANCE broke out at the start, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.
