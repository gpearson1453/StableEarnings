turn and into the lane, and kept on late for show. ELLIE'S LIL MAN pressed while two wide, was ridden from three wide into the stretch, but flattened. RIP
THORN prompted the pace from the four path but backed up heading into the far turn. OFFICER APPEAL hopped at the start, chased from the three path
but was done early.

from the three path, cut the corner into the stretch, and ran on for place. SUPER WILDCAT stalked from the six path, was ridden from the five path into the
stretch, and kept on for show. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION promtped the pace from inside, shifted out to the three path under coaxing around the turn, but
flattened. DON'T EATTHE APPLE broke through the gate, then hopped at the start, was behind, drifted out going into the turn, and was no threat.
MINNETONKA rated from the five path but was empty going into the stretch. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT was wellback in the three path, but got floated out going

Footnotes
IMPRESSIONISM rated in the four path early, moved up and took over around the far turn, opened up into the stretch and held gamely. MARMO MOON
raced from wellback in the five path, swung out to the six path into the lane, and rallied late for place. AMELIA'S DREAM stalked in the three path, was
ridden in the five path going into the stretch, but finished evenly to show. VAN HOOK led from three wide early but faded around the far turn. APPEALING
ROAD tracked from the four path but was empty going into the stretch. BEST VIRGINIA prompted the pace from inside but gave way into the far turn.
AWESOME MOON pressed between rivals early but was done after a half. VIESTE broke a step slow and trailed throughout.
