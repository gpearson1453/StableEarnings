Footnotes
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS rated off of the early pace, chased three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, closed fast inside of the furlong marker,
overtook the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke alertly and dueled through solid early fractions, shook
free in upper stretch, could not hold off the quickly oncoming winner in deep stretch but held well in the end to be second best. MARQUE IT UP showed
early speed and engaged with LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH to carve out quick fractions through the turn, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, gave way in
the final stages and held for show late. HUNTERS GHOST chased the solid early fractions from the rail, gained ground in upper stretch while maintaining an
inside position, could not sustain that run in deep stretch and weakened. SYNC lacked early speed and made a mild late rally. DEFENSE WINS stumbled at
the start and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn, gained ground in mid-stretch but was not a late factor.

Footnotes
GOOD TIME DOLLY settled off of the early pace, was roused nearing the half-mile marker to contest the pacesetter, took command into the far turn, drew
clear into mid-stretch and was kept to task in the late stages. DR WYSONG settled three wide off of the early pace, advanced approaching the half-mile
marker, raced in pursuit of GOOD TIME DOLLY into the drive, could not make headway on the winner in deep stretch and held safely for place in the end.
MALIBU JEWEL contested the early lead into the first turn then stalked the quick pace through the backstretch run, maintained a two wide path to the far
turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive and was clear for show late. HALF HOPING was shuffled back while in tight quarters at the start, was
unhurried through the early stages while racing in the second flight, made a three wide bid into upper stretch, could not sustain that bid in the late going and
weakened. CLASS CODE was allowed to settle, was roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not go on with that run in the drive and flattened
out in deep stretch. MISS MENSA was unhurried, came three wide into the backstretch run, shifted to the inside on the second turn and was not a late
factor. STAND IN YOUR LOVE disputed the early pace, took command on the backstretch run and drew clear nearing the half-mile marker, was overtaken
entering the second turn, stopped leaving the quarter marker, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power. REINA DE REYES was
hustled to contest the early lead, ceded the lead along the backstretch run, dropped back on the far turn, was eased through the late stages and walked off
under her own power.

Footnotes
SECRETLY PARANOIDE was sent to contest the fast early fractions, dueled to the quarter marker with TIMBERLAKE GAGE, shook free of that foe in
upper stretch and found more in deep stretch to edge away late. DESERT SMOKE rated off of the fast early pace, came three wide along the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in the end but was second best. LAKER JET stalked the early
pace from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the final stages and held safely for show. TIMBERLAKE GAGE
broke alertly and was sent to dispute the early pace, dueled through fast fractions to the quarter marker, lost position nearing mid-stretch and weakened in
the final stages. TEASPOON OF PEPPER chased from the inside, improved position in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. HYPHY showed early
speed and disputed the pace to the turn, vied for the lead while three wide nearing the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and faded late.
MERGIE TROID chased from the rear early on, came in tight nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun to upper stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
GET'EM TIGER broke alertly and showed good early speed, contested the solid early fractions to the quarter marker, battled with COWLITZ to mid-stretch,
shook free in the final stages and was kept to task late to prevail. SILK ROAD SALLY was allowed to settle, gained ground four wide on the turn, ran evenly
to mid-stretch, found her best stride late, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch but was best of the rest. COWLITZ was sent to contest the quick early
pace, dueled through solid fractions to the quarter marker, battled with the winner to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and held for show
in the final strides. BEAU ROCKS tracked the quick early pace from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch, could not sustain that bid through the final
sixteenth and gave way late. SHOUT IT OUT chased the pace from the second flight, swung widest into the drive and lacked a late rally. GLITTER LAKE
tracked the solid early fractions, came four wide into upper stretch, chased to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL chased
from the rear, lost position two wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
INDIANERA was well placed in the early stages, tracked the pace two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the drive, made a steady bid through
the final furlong and surged in the final strides to prevail. MASK OFF was away in good order and contested the moderate fractions to the quarter marker,
chased DR. FLASH DANCER to upper stretch, was outfinished in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for place. DR. FLASH DANCER showed early
speed and dueled through moderate early fractions, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was overtaken inside of the furlong marker and weakened late,
while clear in the end for show. OUR VALLEY raced close up to the moderate pace, dispute the fractions while two wide between foes on the turn, was
outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. INSTIGATE lacked early speed, swung widest into the drive and was not a late threat. ONE BROAD
STREET chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and tired in the stretch run. ALEX'S DREAM was devoid of early speed and was not a factor.

SUGAR BEETS was forwardly placed early on, came three wide into the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong
marker and was up in the final strides to prevail. HANS GRUBER was bothered at the start but recovered nicely and attended to the decent early fractions,
kept pressure on the pacesetter to the quarter marker, vied for the lead in mid-stretch, matched strides with SUGAR BEETS in deep stretch and just missed
for the win, while holding for place at the end. CANYON CREST broke awkwardly, came out at the start and bothered foes in a chain reaction, settled three
wide in the early stages, came two wide to the quarter marker, mounted a bold late rally in the drive and was up for show in the final strides. BLAME IT ON
KITTY settled off of the early solid pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to
mid-stretch, was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for show. WILL IS CHILL was unhurried in the early going, came four wide along the far turn,
closed willingly in the stretch run and just missed for show. LEMON ZINGER was sent to the early lead, set solid prompted fractions to the quarter marker,
met the bid of HANS GRUBER to mid-stretch, was not able to keep pace in deep stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. WILLY THE COBBLER
hopped at the start then was impeded leaving the break, saved ground while allowed to settle early on, gained ground in the final furlong but lacked the
needed late response. FULL DRAW was bothered at the start, settled off of the pace while racing on the inside, came three wide on the far turn, chased the
leaders to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CANYON CREST FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM EIGHTH FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE.

Footnotes
WARM SUMMER took back off of the fast early pace, tracked the quick fractions four wide on the turn, chased GAYLES EVENING to the furlong marker,
overtook that foe in deep stretch and edged away to prove best in the end. GAYLES EVENING was away a step slowly and was hustled to the early lead,
dueled through fast fractions to the turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, was kept to task into mid-stretch, was overtaken by WARM SUMMER in
deep stretch but held well late to be second best. DO YOU HEAR THAT raced close to the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, lost position in
upper stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and held safely for third in the end. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN chased the fast pace two wide through the turn
and offered a mild late rally. FOCUS FIRST was away in good order and showed good early speed while contesting the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing
the quarter marker and gave way in the drive. KRISTI'S TIGER was allowed to settle, advanced outside of rivals on the turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch and could not threaten in the late stages. TAKE A LEAP lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. SWIFT NONNI
hopped at the start and was away slowly, chased three wide through the turn and tired in the late going.

SHANGHAI MIST broke alertly, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear to mid-stretch and was kept to task in the final stages. SUE
ETTAS GHOST settled in the second flight early on, lost position along the backstretch run, came in tight and lacked room while three wide on the far turn,
emerged at the top of the lane to chase SHANGHAI MIST to deep stretch, could not reel the winner in late but was second best in the end. BANDON
BRIDGE away a bit slowly and was unhurried in the early going, improved position five wide on the far turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive and
was well clear of the rest for third. WETHERLY came three wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run to be close up to the pace, tracked
the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and weakened late. LADY COMMISH was allowed to settle, saved ground along the
backstretch run, came three wide into the second turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, was not able to threaten the leaders in the final stages and passed
tiring rivals in the end. DASHING DEMI came four wide into the first turn, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, stalked the pace four wide to the
top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. SWEET MEG lacked early speed, trailed to the quarter marker, swung six
wide into upper stretch and was not a factor. LEAD ACTRESS stalked the solid early fractions, lost position nearing the half-mile marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and tired late. LONSDALEITE was prominent into the first turn, prompted the solid pace through the backstretch run, lost ground while three
wide on the second turn and tired readily in the drive.

OBVIOUS was away in good order, stalked, then joined a speed duel down the backstretch, pulled away from the pack with SHORT RIB on the turn and
dueled with that foe for the length of the stretch, finally pulling away from that stubborn rival in the final yards. SHORT RIB broke best and was outside of a
three horse speed duel to the turn, was joined to the outside by OBVIOUS and fought that one gamely through the final quarter and gave way grudgingly in
the last few jumps. LIBERTY LIBERTY tracked the leaders from the inside position, awaited some racing room on the turn and finished with some interest
while never a threat to the top pair. GREGS CITY ZIP broke well and was in the inside of a three horse duel down the backstretch, was put into a hard drive
from the quarter pole and kept on well to the finish line. OLYMPIC SILVER was part of the chasing group early, was shuffled back a bit, launched a bid on
the turn, was five-wide into the stretch and loomed a threat but switched leads repeatedly and flattened out. ALPHABETICAL broke alertly and was keen to
go on but was taken under a hold, stayed to the outside while making up ground on the field through the turn, emerged from the stretch within striking
distance but lacked a response in the final stages. BALLROOM HUSTLER broke alertly and was in part of a quartet chasing the early speed, dropped back
a bit entering the turn, then appeared to clip the heels of BUEN CHICO, stumbled and recovered, but was unable to make up the lost ground. BUEN CHICO
was with the leading pack down the backstretch while between horses, started to lose ground on the turn, and finished one paced to the wire. J C
EXPRESS was slow to begin, chased the field through the turn, managed to make up some ground with an inside run but flattened out badly in the final
furlong. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE broke in a tangle at the start, spotted the field several lengths and was never a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING BALLROOM HUSTLER NEARING THE QUARTER POLE. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT THE
RUNNER CAME IN TIGHT, ATTEMPTED TO SPLIT RIVALS, CLIPPED HEELS AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN TROUBLE ON THE TURN.
