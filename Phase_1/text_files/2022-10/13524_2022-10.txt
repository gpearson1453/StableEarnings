MISS LAUREN rated close from the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths, drew clear inside the
eighth pole and held well under steady stretch handling. HOOK THE CHAIN saved ground close to the pace on the opening turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but couldn't improve in the lane. CEDAR RUN'S FIRE took the lead two deep leaving the three quarter pole
and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths, remained close nearest the rail on the far turn
but weakened in the lane. VIEDMA saved ground on the first turn, bid past the three eighths pole but weakened losing ground on the far turn. DIVA GAL
rounded the opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far
turn. CURVE APPEAL stalked inside from the three quarter pole, eased out nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response.

lane to take over late yards and raced clear under the wire. SING A LULLABYE set a pressured pace inside, contested the turn near the rail but was caught
flattening in later yards. LET'S DO THIS chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened. CASTLE TOY chased through the backstretch, raced two
deep on the turn and weakened in the lane. ISLE BE THERE was slow getting into stride and raced well back from early contention, ran at the rail into the
turn, angled out leaving the turn and could only close the gap.

TRINGALE closed to the front while angling in near the three quarter pole and rated the pace, dug in to the challenges of POSITIVE PHIL and PROTA
nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. POSITIVE PHIL stalked the
earlier pace in the four path, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but couldn't threaten in the lane. WALK THE
BANK saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride.
KING NEKIA steadied shortly after the break, rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in
the three path and weakened in the lane. LOST IN MANHATTAN settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn in the four path and finished evenly; widest. PROTA stalked in the three path the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled
between horses from that point, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane.

AUBURN MILL moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. JAMMIN JIMTOWN settled back in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn and
finished well while gaining on the winner. MOTI saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but
flattened inside the eighth pole. NORTHERN RIDGE saved ground off the pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadied lacking room toward
the five sixteenths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MY CANDY BIZ settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR rounded the first turn about the five path, left the second turn
outside and showed little response. WATERLOO ROSE rounded the opening turn about the four path and was through after five eighths.

MALIBU BILLY stalked off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase leaving he three eighths pole, took the nod three wide toward the head of the lane and
dug in determinedly to edge out the game stretch effort of ISLAND D'LITE, who stalked the pace, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and took a slim
lead between horses at the five sixteenths, was met at the rail leaving the far turn and dueled gamely before reluctantly ceding. TREJO took the lead
nearing the three quarter pole and rated the early pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths, was met at the rail at the five sixteenths and
flattened stride on the far turn. GABRIEL'S WING rounded the first turn about the five path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close two deep, but
lost ground and weakened nearing the eighth pole. TAKE AIM rounded the first turn about the three path then bid only mildly from the seven sixteenths pole.
TO THE TOP showed little response through the backstretch. TIZNOW TIME saved ground and was through early. MONEYFORNOTHING hesitated then
ducked outward and lost his rider leaving the gate.
