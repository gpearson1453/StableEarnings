FAST VISION (FR) was well rated throughout, closed on the outside and drew clear late to prove best, driving. LJAY (IRE) was allowed to settle from
between rivals, made a bid on the far turn to draw clear leaving the turn, then dueled over the last fence but could not go with the winner late, second best.
SHAKA vied for the lead on the inside and weakened late, bested rest. HURTGEN FOREST vied for the lead on the outside and tired the final quarter of a
mile. SEMPRE MEDICI (FR) was settled early and tired. WEST NEWTON (GB) was reserved early and failed to respond and left the course late.

PLEASECALLMEBACK was settled back with the winner for the first circuit, then made steady advance on the second circuit, made a bid and was clear
leaving the last fence but was caught in deep stretch, good effort. THREE O ONE set an unchallenged pace, then was headed over the last fence and
faded, held show award. NEW APPOINTMENT (IRE) was reserved early, made a steady advance on the second circuit and then was slowly gaining late to
just miss the show award. SALAMANCA SCHOOL (FR) stalked the pace and weakened, bested rest. CRITICIZE lacked a serious rally. EVE'S CITY chased
the pace between rivals and then tired, left course. SEB'S WELCOME (FR) chased the pace on the outside and then tired on the backstretch on the second
