Footnotes
GET NONE chased inside early, began to angle out past the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, rallied, vied outside of KANFU and ultimately
prevailed. KANFU tracked the leader three wide early, bid outside her past the half, pressed outside of BOBBIE TOO TOO around the turn, floated four wide
into upper stretch, kept on while vying inside of GET NONE but was outfinished by that foe. ORNERY ANGEL settled toward the rear inside of APRIL'S
GEM early, continued patiently in the three path on the turn, swung out four wide into the lane and began to improve, angled out further in upper stretch for
room, found his best in the final furlong and gained to the finish. APRIL'S GEM was keen behind horses while racing toward the rear on the back straight,
chased while saving ground around the turn, raced inside into the lane, began to rally under a drive in upper stretch, shifted outside of LUVIN BULLIES past
midstretch, kept on willingly but was outkicked for the show. LUVIN BULLIES tracked the pace inside of AND ISLES, continued to save ground around the
turn, rallied up the inside in upper stretch, took the lead near the three sixteenths, led to the sixteenth mark, and flattened inside late. BOBBIE TOO TOO
was very reluctant to load and anxious in the gate, broke sharply and was sent to the lead, set a pressured pace while saving ground around the turn,
carried a narrow lead into upper stretch, was headed by LUVIN BULLIES past the three sixteenths and weakened. AND ISLES tracked the leader between
horses, came into the lane still in range between horses, but emptied out from midstretch. KHOZYS CROWN chased outside of GET NONE early, chased
three wide around the turn, was driven six wide into the lane and weakened. MIDSHIP LADY settled near the rear down the backstretch and in the two path
on the turn, was pushed along near the five sixteenths, but lacked the needed response. SILVER POM POM settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on
the turn, angled inward in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CONSUELA was settled outside foes in the last flight in the opening stages, commenced a steady rally three wide racing into the turn, angled
out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady, late bid to just edge RUNAWAY A. TRAIN on the wire under firm handling. The late broke
readily, was rated stalking just off the first flight racing to the turn, advanced three deep to challenge for command near midstretch, gained the advantage
between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. IRISH HALO was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, was fanned three deep
entering the lane gathering momentum, angled in sharply midstretch advancing to challenge inside foes when presented an opening but was just outkicked.
JITTERS, urged disputing the pace along the inside through the backstretch into the turn, dueled into upper stretch, drifted out under pressure in late stages
and weakened nearing the wire. HOOSIER GOLD CASE settled inside foes in the last flight early, saved ground to upper stretch, was caught in close
quarters momentarily midstretch and lacked the needed late response. MINI DRESS was urged pressing the pace outside a rival from the outset, dueled for
command to midstretch, then gave out while being carried out leaving the sixteenth marker. ZENCHUA SKY angled inwards tracking the leaders from just
out of striking distance racing to the turn, faded between foes into the stretch, was cut off, then steadied off IRISH HALO nearing midstretch and quickly
emptied out.

Footnotes
W W CANDY settled at the rear, was nudged along while saving ground on the turn, came into the lane positioned two wide, angled back toward the rail at
the head of the stretch, rallied up the inside, engaged inside the leading pair midstretch and outfinished TETSU in the final sixteenth. TETSU tracked the
leading foursome early, began to improve in the four path past the three eighths, came four wide into the lane, kicked on in earnest near the three eighths,
engaged outside the leading line, but was outfinished by W W CANDY in the final sixteenth. BRING ME A CHECK was sent for pace, pressed outside
SCRUTINIZER from the five eighths, vied between horses from the nine sixteenths into the turn, vied two wide around the bend and into the lane, raced
three wide through midstretch, was no match for W W CANDY or TETSU past the sixteenth but got the bob for third. SCRUTINIZER led inside early, took
pressure from BRING ME A CHECK from near the five eighths, vied inside that foe around the turn and into upper stretch, had no answer to W W CANDY
and TETSU from the sixteenth, continued to vie with BRING ME A CHECK, and lost the nod for show. FIRST MASAMUNE tracked the leading pair early,
engaged three wide between horses with the leading flight near the nine sixteenths, was put in tight past the half and took back out of the leading flight,
chased in the two path around the bend, came into the lane two wide between horses and lacked the needed stretch kick. MEDAL OF FACT leapt at the
start, advanced to chase outside of FIRST MASAMUNE early, attended the pace four wide from the nine sixteenths, came in and put FIRST MASAMUNE in
tight past the half, tracked the leading pair three wide around the bend and into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch and flattened.

Footnotes
JUST A WONDER broke readily, vied for command between foes into the turn, edged forward nearing midstretch, shifted inwards under pressure but
maintained a safe advantage under firm handling. SHE'S WANDAFUL was settled last along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the bend,
briefly awaited an opening in close quarters nearing midstretch, then tipped just off the inside to split foes and edge a rival for the place honors at the wire.
CHROME ATTACK was settled between foes just off the second flight, angled inwards nearing the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch to split foes
three deep gaining striking distance late but lacked the needed final kick. STACK SHACK, off slowly, raced off the leaders four wide into the bend, was
caught five wide in upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
racing into the bend, shifted off the inside in the lane but had no closing bid. FROST WARRIOR tracked the leaders three wide between foes in the opening
stages but faded nearing upper stretch. HONEY BELLA was urged four wide pursuing the leaders into the turn and gave way in that path racing into upper
stretch. HEAVENLY SCENT, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace into the turn, dueled to upper stretch and emptied out in late stages.
FIRST KITTEN vied with the leaders three wide between foes into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT soon cleared, continued uncontested down the back straight and in the two path around the far turn, was pushed along in upper
stretch and driven mildly midstretch, and continued to gradually increase his advantage. FUTURE VISION chased three wide on the first turn, chased
outside of OFF TO THE BEACH down the back straight, inched up inside of BLOOMING GARDEN into the far turn, raced on the rail with the tracking flight,
could not reel BOURBON DELIGHT in into the lane but chased on clearly best of the rest. MADELYNS HEAT settled toward the rear, inched up to race
behind the chasing flight along the backstretch, was pushed along and improved in the three path around the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane,
and chased on willingly for the show. DARE GOES DA DEVIL bumped with HIGH LIFE AGAIN in the opening strides, tracked the leader two wide through
the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, raced three wide with the tracking flight into the far turn as FUTURE VISION joined to the inside of the flight,
swung five wide into the lane, was outkicked by FUTURE VISION into the stretch, and chased on mildly while drifting out. MAIDEN ROCK settled at the
rear, continued at the rear in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. BLOOMING GARDEN broke sharp,
tracked the leader while racing inside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL, raced between horses in the tracking flight into the far turn, and flattened out from the
three eighths. OFF TO THE BEACH chased inside of FUTURE VISION, began to flatten out from the half, saved ground through the far turn while losing
position, and had no more inside in the lane. HIGH LIFE AGAIN bumped with DARE GOES DA DEVIL in the opening strides, settled near the rear, made a
brief bid in the three path when pushed along near the three eighths, was driven two wide in upper stretch and proved empty.

Footnotes
RICHIES GREAT GIRL was urged pursuing the leaders outside a rival in the opening stages, tipped three wide entering the bend while moving to striking
position, dueled for command between foes in that path past midstretch and edged forward in time under steady handling. CASHABLE angled inwards
racing just off the leaders in the opening stages, switched out four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to strike the front midstretch but couldn't put the
winner away. SHARP HERO tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing into the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and continued
willingly in that path to close the gap on the leaders while narrowly prevailing for a share on the wire. PLUS CHIC, forwardly placed stalking just off the
pacesetter in the opening stages, angled inside on the turn, came through inside foes to challenge for command when presented an opening in upper
stretch but was just outkicked. COVENANT LADY, unhurried while angling inside in the opening stages, saved ground on the turn, shifted out racing past
midstretch and continued to make mild progress four wide between foes. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow
advantage along the inside into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way in late stages. OFF RAMP, a bit slow into stride, tipped off the inside
entering the lane and displayed some belated interest between foes nearing the wire. MY GOLDEN DAY broke slowly, settled outside foes early and never
gained contention. GIRL NAMED PATSY, off a step slowly, settled inside early, swung six wide entering the lane but made no impression.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR was sent for pace and soon cleared, held a diminishing but still clear lead while saving ground around the far turn, kicked away from the
field into upper stretch, opened up further when driven near the three sixteenths, and went further clear while hand ridden into the final furlong. KIMBERLY
FRANCES settled at the rear of the main group between horses around the first turn, continued near the rear down the back straight, rallied in the five path
around the far turn, swung into the lane five wide, sustained her bid under a drive, and got up for the place late. FLATOUTANDFOXY chased behind the
tracking flight around the first turn, tracked the leading pair two wide down the back straight, tracked three wide around the far turn, was driven while angling
inside in upper stretch, proved no match for SHE'S A BIG STAR, chased on nonetheless under a drive, but was caught for the place. WEEKEND PASS
soon trailed, took gradually closer order down the back straight, continued to trail in the three to four path around the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and angled out further under a drive, and offered a belated outside rally. HER GOLD MINE was extremely fractious in the gate, tracked the pace two
wide through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader down the back straight, was nudged along into the far turn and offered a two wide bid, raced in range
approaching the quarter pole, but could not match SHE'S A BIG STAR into the stretch and flattened out. SIMPLY FAST raced toward the rear of the main
group outside of PRESENT OF HERO early, continued near the rear down the back straight, was pushed along in the five to six path on the far turn, swung
seven wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick. NOFANSINTHESTANDS raced three wide at the rear of the main group through the first turn, began
to inch forward three wide into the back straight, bid into the turn and improved position in the four path on the bend, and failed to sustain her bid three wide
in the lane. DARING DAMSEL settled at the rear of the main group inside on the first turn, continued toward the rear down the back straight, steadied past
the five eighths behind PRESENT OF HERO, raced in the four to five path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the lane and had no rally. PRESENT OF
HERO chased well behind the leading foursome early, continued to chase midfield down the back straight as the field took closer order, was pushed along
in the two to three path around the far turn, and came up empty inside in the lane. SATIATE tracked inside around the first turn, settled back to chase the
leading pair inside of FLATOUTANDFOXY down the back straight, stopped near the seven sixteenths, was driven inside in upper stretch but had no
response and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
RIDE RICHIE RIDE was prompted to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the bend, steadily advanced in that path on the turn,
took over racing past the quarter mile marker, forged clear into the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. AWESOME FAMILY tracked off the second
flight between foes in the opening stages, gained position three wide between foes on the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to prove best of the others. IMPERIAL MOMENT, unhurried four wide dropping off the second flight in the opening stages, was
prompted in pursuit of the leaders outside rivals racing into the turn, then continued evenly between foes through the stretch while prevailing for a share.
FIXICO was settled in hand in the opening stages, shifted out three deep gaining position between foes on the turn, lost some momentum when racing in
close quarters entering the lane, then shifted out in late stages while lacking the needed final kick. SIR ACEALOT tracked off the second flight racing four
wide into the turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and offered no rally. RUBY'S RED DEVIL broke slowly, raced last to upper stretch and
passed only tiring rivals. AGAVE KID, urged along the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight in the opening quarter, steadily faded racing
into the turn. PITAMAN was urged pressing the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, then between foes into the turn, gave way after a half. CHOPPER
broke sharply, was urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn and gave way abruptly into upper stretch. THREE TIME CHARMER WAS
FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, NECESSITATING HIS LATE SCRATCH.
