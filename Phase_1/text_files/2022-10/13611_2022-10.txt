Footnotes
SAN COSTANTINO well placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. MY
BOY BLUE tracked the pace, stalked that one through the turn, bid outside gaining a short lead into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the
winner and held the place. BAHAMIAN PARK mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show.
WORLD OF FOOLS mid pack and inside, angled out and held position through the turn, came four and five wide into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. FREE FLAYME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. LEGIO broke
sharply from the gate and dropped back quickly, moved up three and four wide through the turn, then drifted in and improved position in the lane. SCIENCE
TO WIN mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. HOUSE LIGHTS well placed and inside,
faded through the turn. EL ZOPILOTE showed little. LUPI was never involved.

SAKETUMI mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, lugged in and drew off late. SACHMO

late and held the place. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
drifted in and lacked the needed late kick. SKYDIVING allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, came widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals for
a share. T REX mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. FIGHTIN
PHIL stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. PAID THE PREACHER set the
pace on the inside, shook clear through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF YOUMUSTBEA

Footnotes
LISA MARIE mid pack, gained position inside through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off
and was kept to the task. C J 'S CAT FIVE sprinted away from the field soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then stayed on to
be clearly best of the rest. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS tracked the pace, angled out and moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide
outside the leader into the stretch and flattened out. CEETA well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, drifted in and faded. THE X FACTOR allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. TWO TIMES LUCKY
was never involved.
