Footnotes
GETALOADOFTHIS showed the best early speed along the inside from the outset to take a clear lead into the turn steadily increased the margin and was
never seriously challenged. ITS A DEAL chased the pace in the two path and was able to come on to get second. CHERUBIM had the perfect rail trip
saving all the ground got into contention at the head of the stretch but could not sustain the run through the stretch. DRYSPELL raced three wide the entire
race and could not make up ground. ALL SHACKED UP chased the pace and was closest to the leader turning for home but gave way in the lane. JACK
WITH SEVEN raced along the inside towards the back of the pack and could not make up ground. EL DIABLO GRANDE raced five to six wide in the middle
of the pack but faded in the stretch. ZCAT'S CHATAIN lost his path shortly after the start dropped back and was not a factor.

TIZ WONDERFULLY showed the best early speed and opened up on the field quickly took a short breather on the turn but responded when asked at the
head of the stretch and held the margin to the wire. REMARKABLE CHARM made a three wide bid on the turn to get into contention and was close to the
pacesetter turning for home but never could go on by. PORSUMSUGARONME raced along the inside and could not make up the needed ground. T. P.
RIGHT LANE was up close to the pace for the first quarter then dropped back along the inside and passed a tired foe in the stretch. ULTRA CORDIAL broke
alertly but raced four wide throughout the entire race and tired in the final furlong.

CRUZ'N OLLIE was up close to the pace while in the two hole put the head in front at the top of the lane and drew clear through the stretch. J P'S WEST
ACRES was hustled to the lead after breaking in the middle of the pack was challenged on the outside from the outset but tired in the stretch and just held
second. LAST CALL LEROY made a three wide move on the turn was gaining through the stretch and was just a nose short of second at the wire. TAPPIN'
THE BLING was last for much of the race swung wide through the lane and made a mild bid for a minor share. DOCS CARO CAT was up close to the pace
along the inside but tired through the stretch. ROYAL OUTLAW chased in the middle of the pack but had nothing for the stretch run.

LUCYS MAJOR MIRCLE showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail opened a good lead into the turn and then took a breather was able to
pull away again through the stretch to win rather easily. BARTSTER chased the pace in the two path came close to the leader at the head of the stretch but
was no match for that one through the lane but was clearly second best. YOU'RE MY ROCK raced along the inside and made a late run through the stretch
and was up for third while never a threat to the top two. BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY raced six wide for much of the race and was caught in the final jumps for
third. RAMOS was well off the pace for much of the race and passed a tired foe in the stretch. CHIEF RULES was up close for the first quarter then quickly
dropped back after that and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR showed good early speed in the two path was challenged every step of the way but dug in gamely and edged clear through the
stretch. HYPER DRIVE had a ground saving trip along the rail on the turn and moved through along the inside through the stretch and was up for second in
the final yards. BURGAMEISTER was away in the middle of the pack made a big move along the inside approaching the turn and was able to get through
along the inside to challenge came off the rail a bit through the stretch and was caught for second in the final yards. PRAIRIE SQUALL was hung at least
three wide the entire race and could not match strides through the stretch and faded. WE MISS GENO was up close early in the two path dropped back
going into the turn came to the outside for the stretch run but could not make up ground. HOLY MUCHACHO raced wide for much of the race and never
mounted a rally. BUD MINISTER raced along the inside for much of the race and was never a factor. MY TRUE REWARD was off a step slow to trail in the
early stages raced along the inside and was never a serious factor. GIMME SPACE was wide coming out of the chute onto the main track while well back
and was never a factor.
