Footnotes
ENGLISH PAINTER stalked three wide, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied three wide turning for home, put a head in front in upper stretch, then
battled heads apart racing outside of SPY NOVEL, dueled with that rival in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed at the wire. SPY NOVEL was a bit
reluctant to load, vied inside for the lead, shook free entering the far turn, raced off the inside entering the stretch, shifted about at the top of the lane, then
dug in gamely inside of ENGLISH PAINTER, dueled with that rival to the wire and just missed. BALLINDINE hopped and was off a bit slow, raced off the
pace inside, moved up four wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside in the stretch. SECRETARY OF WAR stalked between rivals, advanced between
horses on the far turn, steadied lacking room at the top of the stretch, then weakened on the rail. LET IT FLOW JOE tracked on the inside, chased on the far
turn and faded. BEAR'S CORRECT vied two wide for the lead, chased on the far turn and faded. HIGHLY UNLIKELY trailed early on the inside and did not
factor. LUCID raced three wide early, settled off the pace and dropped far back.

DIANE'S COMET set the pace on the inside, dueled with REAL WILD SOLUTION on the far turn, battled back inside of that rival at the top of the stretch,
regained command, drew clear in midstretch and held well under urging. MAGIC SURPRISE raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far
turn, rallied inside in the stretch run and finished well for second. SMART RED raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, advanced at the
quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and got up for the show spot. LET'S CELEBRATE raced off the pace with an inside trip,
advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly on the rail. KAREN'S CATITA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far
turn, bid turning for home, then weakened. LUNA'S TREASURE stalked outside a rival, bid three wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. REAL
WILD SOLUTION tracked on the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with the winner, put a head in front, dug in to midstretch and gave way in
the final sixteenth. UNMARKED MONEY broke inward bumping a rival at the start, then outrun. NONNA PATRIZIA stalked two wide, chased on the far turn
and gave way. PRETTY SPECTACULAR lunged and was off slowly, raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way.
