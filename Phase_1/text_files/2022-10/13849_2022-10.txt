Footnotes
BIRTH OF COOL got crowded between foes early, unhurried in the beginning and tucked to the inside at the back, angled out on the far turn and ranged up
four deep into the stretch, rallied widest and reached the front in upper stretch and drove clear. THE KEY IS UNITY got put in tight along the rail early then
dropped back off the pace, moved out and went between foes on the backstretch, coaxed two wide into the lane, tipped out and bid three deep in upper
stretch but got outkicked by the winner. ATTENZIONE bumped twice with inner rival and checked early, moved into range two then three wide, went three
deep around the far turn and into the stretch, bid four deep in the lane but faltered in the furlong grounds. BALDORO steadied behind the leader and
switched to the outside, went up to apply pressure, dueled around the far turn, took over leaving that bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened.
BATUKHAN (IRE) bumped with ATTENZIONE two times between foes early then started to pull, settled off the pace in the two path, raced a bit off the rail
around the far turn, two wide into the stretch and could not rally. BIG BROTHER was keen while trying to be rated early on, stalked the leaders inside a pair
of rivals into the far turn, tipped off the rail and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY broke out then came back in early, took control and crossed to the
inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, lost command into the stretch and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SHADY EMPIRE broke a hair slow but quickly went up to duel for command outside HIDETHELOOT, disposed of that rival past the three-eighths pole, put
to right handed urging in upper stretch and held safely. SONIC BREES stalked near the inside early on, went between rivals in the two path chasing around
the bend, stayed within striking distance through the drive and finished willingly for second. BUTKUS trailed five wide into the turn, advanced outside rivals
and exited the bend four wide, chased the winner from outside through the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick. PARTY TOWN stalked the pace
outside rivals to the turn, traveled three deep then three wide through the bend, chased between rivals in the stretch and failed to produce a bid.
CATBERNAY tracked the speed outside rivals up the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and came up empty. HIDETHELOOT coaxed to the front
from inside and dueled with SHADY EMPIRE, failed to keep up with the winner with three furlongs left to run, dropped back to last around the bend and
tired.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S KID was off slow to begin, chased outside a rival out of range leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail around the bend, tipped out and rallied
between the top pair with a furlong remaining, quickly took over and drew clear. SPANISH CHANNEL stalked off the inside, traveled three deep around the
turn, moved out in the lane, finished well from outside but had to settle for second best. R GIRL'S WERTH IT raced in range along the rail into the turn,
tipped two wide leaving the bend, challenged from outside and took over in upper stretch while drifting out and proved no match for the top pair in the final
sixteenth. EYES FOR GOLD bobbled crossing over the dirt, chased on the inside then steered out leaving the bend, lugged out with a furlong left to run and
kept on to earn a minor award. UNWRITTEN CODE showed early speed and moved clear, inched away around the bend on the inside, lost command in
upper stretch and weakened. BACK ON THE STREET hopped and brushed the gate at the start, bobbled crossing over the dirt and lagged behind after,
trailed on the inside through the turn, angled out in the lane and failed to menace. GALARINA broke clear then dropped back early, went two wide through
the turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to make an impact. WRONG TURN CUPID showed early speed and bobbled crossing the dirt, was up close
outside the pacesetter early on, took the turn two wide while losing positions and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DORIS MAE sped clear and crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, continued clear under left handed urging through the lane and stayed strong to the
wire. TECUMSEH CAROLINE bobbled a bit at the start but gained a good stalking position from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped out in the lane
and kept on determinedly while unable to reach the winner. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY brushed leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit from the two path but
lacked late kick when called upon in the lane. OAT MILK LATTE trailed two wide into the turn, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch, gained a minor
award but failed to threaten the top trio. MARK FOR LATER was off slow and broke out, moved into range from outside up the backstretch, rounded the
bend four the three wide and faded in the lane. ADAM'S CREED broke out and brushed rival, chased three then four wide around the turn and had little left
for the drive.

HALFBARBERBINGIE dropped back to last and moved to the inside, steered out on the far turn and exited the far turn four wide, moved out further at top of
the stretch, rallied from outside and inhaled the runner-up to get up in closing moments. ARREST steadied or took back early, settled on the inside, tipped
out on the far turn and challenged three deep at the quarter pole, took over entering the stretch, cleared with a furlong left to run but got run down by the
winner. ONCOMING unhurried in the beginning while three deep, went two then three wide around the far turn, moved in the lane and held the show.
BRAVESTONE was closest in pursuit through the early stages, closed in and bid between rivals at the quarter pole, dueled into and upper stretch, then
flattened in the late stages. HOODLUM got crowded between rivals early, traveled three deep off the pace on the first turn, moved into the two path then
angled out and raced five wide into the lane, six deep in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BARNFIELD raced along the inside off the pace, saved ground
to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane then angled back to the inside and improved position. IF ID TOLD YOU settled in the two path early, three
deep on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, found traffic behind a rival in upper stretch, shifted inward and lacked room in late stages. HOOP
DREAM settled in the two path between rivals, remained two wide through the far turn, urged through the lane but lacked room late. TOFINO BAY rider had
his left rein broke at the start but still took control early and was able to be guided to the inside with use of the bridle, opened up a comfortable lead around
the clubhouse turn and showed the way up the backstretch, held a diminishing lead around the far turn and was collared by a pair of rivals at the quarter
pole, relinquished command shortly after, then faded in the stretch while not persevered with.

Footnotes
BIZZY GAL got bumped and had to steady early, chased four deep into the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, reeled in the leader past the eight pole
and kicked clear to win going away. FUNKHOUSER drifted in a bit early and bothered inner rivals, cleared and crossed over into the two path, moved to the
rail around the bend and was roused late on the turn, offered no resistance to the winner past the eight pole and stayed on to hold the place. THE REIGN
SONG was floated in and bumped rival early, closest in pursuit four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and lacked a bid in the
stretch run. SMILING PRINCESS got brushed and crowded between rivals early, chased between into the turn, three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
SMOKIN AMELIA drifted out and brushed SMILING PRINCESS early, chased along the rail through the turn and weakened. IT'S SAUL RIGHT stumbled
leaving the gate, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was not a factor. SMOKEM FOR YOU chased three deep to the turn, lost ground around the bend,
went wo wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THE GREAT HAYNES turned his head and came away a step slow, moved into range under a hold, went two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the
lane, took over with a furlong to go, put away inner rival and held over the late charge from TRUE PATRIOT in the closing moments. TRUE PATRIOT
tracked along the inside, eased out around the bend and came three wide into the stretch, steered out further in the lane and was gaining from outside to
the wire. QUEEN MOLOTOV stumbled slightly at the start, chased on the inside then moved to the two path around the turn, between foes leaving the bend,
bid inside the leaders in the stretch but got outkicked in the late stages. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA raced up close from outside, pressed into the turn then took a
short lead, cleared past the quarter pole, lost command at the eight pole and flattened between rivals. EXACTLY WENDY bobbled a bit at the start, dropped
back and trailed early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished with a mild response to improve. QUEEN OF POMPEII settled
off the pace outside rivals, took the turn three then four wide and weakened. ENSLEYS DREAM set the pace up the backstretch, pressured from outside
into the turn, lost command to D'S LOVELY SOPHIA and could not keep up with that rival past the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. LILLY BABE
chased three deep early, two wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN FORD step to the front quickly and moved into the two path, showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail to the stretch, responded
when challenged in the final furlong and held gamely. MAYNARD tracked four wide on the first turn, took aim three wide on the far turn, bid outside
MONGOLIAN FORD midstretch but lacked the final punch. SIPPIN N KISSIN bumped in the beginning, ran up on the heels of the leader in the two path on
the first turn then stalked between, chased along the rail through the far turn, put to right and left handed urging in the lane and could not summon the
needed late kick. ECONOMICAL rated three deep early, took aim two wide through the far turn, chased between foes in the lane and finished evenly.
STATE OF THE UNION stalked the pace from inside early, spun three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. SOCAL RED chased five wide into the
clubhouse turn then angled to the three path, raced outside a rival near the back in the middle stages, came four wide into the lane and lacked further
response. GRANADA FLAVOR brushed shortly after the start, dropped back and tucked inside, trailed into the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and
never threatened. GUEST CHECK bumped leaving the gate, chased two wide early, trailed on the inside into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) stalked the pace on the inside, waited for room behind the leader on the far turn and upper stretch, gained a clear path
approaching the eighth pole, surged to the front and won clear. AGREETODISAGREE reserved in the early going, swung out leaving the far turn and raced
widest in the stretch, closed well through the final furlong and edged GILLIAN ELIZABETH for the place honors. GILLIAN ELIZABETH bumped in the
beginning, settled two wide then moved inside, angled out in the stretch, rallied and missed the place. EMERALD LAKE broke in, started to pull and became
rank early, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside the leader on the far turn, took over briefly midstretch but was no match for the top trio late.
SPEED LANE pulled early three then two wide, raced outside a rival in the middle stages then got shuffled between foes into the far turn, ran three wide
around the second bend, tipped out in the lane, got bumped at the eight pole and could not rally. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) got forced in leaving the gate, pulled
clear on the inside then became rank on the backstretch while setting the pace clear of the others, challenged from outside with a quarter mile left to run,
clung to a short lead at the eight pole, then weakened in the final furlong. BARRISTER'S RIDE broke a step slow on the outside, dropped back and angled
into the two path, was on the moved three deep into and on the far turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, got forced out and bumped rival at the eight
pole and weakened. GLENALL (IRE) tracked three wide early then moved into the two path for the far turn, traveled between foes around the bend and
failed to threaten in the drive. FORTUNATA TENSIO bumped leaving the gate then sprinted to the front, drifted wide around the clubhouse turn, raced near
