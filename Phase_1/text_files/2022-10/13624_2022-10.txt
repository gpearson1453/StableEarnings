KATY THE CAT set the pace while being well handled on the inside, shook clear on the turn and drew out leaving the turn, then was kept to mild pressure to
prove best. LOVE IS STRONG was well placed early on the inside, then shifted out entering the backstretch to stalk the winner two wide, could not go with
that rival while staying on for the place award gamely. BONITA LASSIE was bumped at the start, rated along three wide, came into the drive three wide and
put to a drive, bumped with rival leaving the turn and had no late kick, missed place. EARLY FROST tracked the early pace two wide, then moved to the
inside on the backstretch and on the turn and weakened in the drive. DANCE A LITTLE JIG lacked a rally. BIRD TRAFFIC stopped.

KIKKERLAND was away alertly to set the pace while two wide, then shook clear leaving the turn and remained clear to prove best, driving. LAST
INVESTMENT was bumped at the start, stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, but could not get to the winner while staying on to be
second best. ACT OF VALOR was rated along the inside early, eased out midway on the turn and came three wide into the lane, angled out for aim at the
furlong marker and rallied willingly. I SAW IT ALL was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn and then offered a belated rally. DAKOTA
OUTLAW jumped a shadow nearing the five eighths marker and then was well placed on the inside and weakened on the urn. THAT'S MY BOI TOY tracked
the pace three to four wide and then was empty. ROYAL'S INVASION failed to menace. WINNERS WIN was reserved early, then was four wide on the turn
and was not a threat.

Footnotes
ELITE SPEED tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to be in range, then wore down the pacesetter late to get up in time under a
drive. HIPNOTIZADA set the pace while in the two to three path, remained clear leaving the turn but was caught late to just fail, second best. RAECHEL'S
RISK stalked the pace between rivals at the half mile marker, then chased the pace three wide on the turn, shifted out five wide and faded in the drive, held
show award. PARANOIA was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had no rally. PARTY AT PAGE'S tracked the
pace on the inside and weakened. LONG DISTANCE LOVE failed to menace. SUSIKIN stumbled at the start and rider lost the irons and trailed.

Footnotes
ESPERNSITA was well rated early, made a bid leaving the turn, split rivals by the furlong marker and kicked clear to prove best under a drive.
BOWTOTHEQUEEN tracked the pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and finished willingly to be second best. KNICKERSINATWIST stalked the
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out late, bested rest. RUNNIN REDBIRD was bumped at the start, reserved early and two wide on
the turn and had a late rally. NO EASY ANSWER set a fast pace on the inside and was headed nearing the furlong marker and weakened. SUGAR SMILE
was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally. DENALI RAE was settled three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. KNOCK OUT KID failed to
menace. DWELLER dropped back.
