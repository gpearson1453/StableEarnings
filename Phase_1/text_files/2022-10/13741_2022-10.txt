Footnotes
ANGELIC GAL led from inside, opened up while being cued from the two path into the lane, and was much the best. GLASS STAR stalked from the two
path, steadied going into the turn, was coaxed while tipping out to the three path into the stretch, but finished evenly to split place. SPRINT BREAKER rated
from inside, was ridden along while cutting the corner into the lane, and kept on from inside to split place. ANNA'S IMAGE raced from off the pace in the five
path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. KRAZYKATKOUSIN chased in the four path, was bumped going into the turn, shifted
into the two path turning into the lane, but flattened. MILK MONEY prompted the pace in the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but
faded. DIOSA FORTUNA tracked in the three path, bumped an outer foe to get to the four path going into the turn, drifted out to the seven path into the
stretch, but was empty. MY SWEET TORMENT raced from wellback in the four path, was floated out to the eight path into the lane, but was no threat.

Footnotes
OCEAN RIDE steadied along inside through the opening three-sixteenths, came through a narrow opening inside nearing the nine-sixteenths marker, took
over entering the turn, set the pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out a bit in the lane and widened under a drive.
ALMASHRIQ saved ground off the pace and rallied inside to gain the place. KUHL STAR raced off the pace four wide and stayed on for the show. SMALL
REASON stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. ACTION WARRIOR set the pace in the two path early, chased
the winner around the turn and faded in the stretch. VENEZUELA FIRST had only brief speed between rivals and retreated in the three path around the turn.

BALI MOON stalked from inside, shifted out to the three path and took the lead around the turn, opened up slightly into the lane, and held sway. AVE FENIX
rated from the five path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on down the center to get up late for place. MISCHIEF QUEEN broke out at the
start, chased from the six path, ranged up from the four path around the turn, drifted in through the stretch, and finished evenly for show. DIAMOND ROCK
tracked in the two path, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, but was one paced. PLANE JANE set the pace from inside but yielded at the top of the
stretch. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT reared up and was fractious in the gate, raced in midpack from the four path early but was empty in the stretch. NURSE JUDY

Footnotes
DEFENDED set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off while drifting out under right-handed urging. STORM broke a bit
awkwardly, advanced four wide around the turn, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch and was clearly second best. KITTY QUICK raced off the
pace three wide, appeared to try to get in repeatedly and was along for the show. MAMA MARIA pressed the winner in the three path and weakened in the
stretch. BEAUTY OF THE SEA failed to menace while racing three wide. RATIONAL KATE was in range inside and came up empty in the lane. DARLING
LUNA chased the pace two wide and retreated through the lane. OOPSIE DOOPSIE played no factor while racing four wide. ZOSTEROP was outrun inside.

LITTLE BELITA raced off the pace in the five path, ranged up from the four path around the turn to bid under coaxing into the lane, and drew clear in the
final furlong. RAISON THE GLASS tracked two wide, was ridden into the lane, drifted out through the stretch, and kept on for place. DATTTSAFANCYFOX
stalked from inside, was driven from the three path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. NO DECAF brushed the gate and chased four wide, was
floated out through the stretch, but was one paced. MI NEGRITA led from the two path early, opened up into the turn, was cued entering the lane, but
yielded. MA COCO rated from the three path, cut the corner into the stretch, but was tired. YEGUITA QUEEN prompted the pace in the three path early, but
dropped back into the turn and was empty. MONTANA JOYCE was wellback early and never menaced. BELLA SOFI was done early, eased and walked
across the line.

Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, turned for home on near even
terms, vied outside of METEORITO through the lane and inched ahead. METEORITO tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and fought on inside of the winner through the lane. BADBADBOBBY chased the pace two wide and finished evenly. HONESTO raced
three wide in midpack early, made a middle move outside, continued three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. CAPTURE MI saved
ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. TINKER TAILER set the pace inside and tired in the lane. T VILLE failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. CANYOUHEARMENOW was outrun inside. KING NATE trailed while racing two and three wide.
