Footnotes
DUB TOWN was off a bit slowly, was unhurried through the early stages, was roused three wide on the far turn, mounted a four wide bid into the lane to
confront SUNNY SPOT, dueled with that game rival to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the end. SUNNY SPOT rated off of the quick early
fractions, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was confronted by DUB TOWN in mid-stretch, gamely dueled
with that rival and was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for place. PERSEVERANCE showed early speed and dueled with KALINE
through quick fractions, took a narrow lead to the quarter marker, could not match strides with the top two in the lane and gave way in the final stages, while
well clear at the end for show. KALINE was hustled leaving the break, set quick fractions while disputing the lead with PERSEVERANCE, lost position on
the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ELEGANT SWAY raced just off of the early pace, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted JERSEY BIRD in upper stretch, found more in
the late stages and pulled away in the final sixteenth. JERSEY BIRD showed early speed, set moderate fractions through the turn, was confronted by
ELEGANT SWAY in upper stretch, met that foe's bid to mid-stretch but could not keep pace with that one in deep stretch and was second best in the end.
NIGHT CRUISER hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, chased from the rail through the turn, tipped out two wide for the drive and gave way in
the lane, while clear in the end for third. RED HARBOR came in tight in the early going and steadied in the opening furlong, chased from the rear through
the turn and tired in the stretch run.

GET'EM TIGER broke a step slowly and was hustled into early contention, pressed the solid pace through the turn, overtook the pacesetter nearing the
quarter marker, drew clear to mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up but held safely in the end. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was allowed to
settle, was steered three wide on the turn, closed well inside of the furlong grounds to put mild late pressure on the winner but could not reel that one in and
was up for second in the final strides. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY showed early speed and was up close to the solid early pace, improved position three wide
nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and was well clear of the rest for third.
KISS RIDE GOODBYE chased from the rear through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. COWLITZ was sent to contest the solid early
fractions, was overtaken by the winner along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
WICKED BLUE tracked the modest early fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run, was roused three wide between runners nearing the quarter
marker, took command into the drive, was confronted in deep stretch by CANYON CREST, drifted under firm left-handed urging in deep stretch, dueled with
the runner-up to the wire and determinedly prevailed in the end. CANYON CREST came four wide along the first turn while unhurried, improved position on
the backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally into the drive, came within aim of WICKED BLUE nearing mid-stretch, came to even terms with that foe in
deep stretch, was carried out while dueling to the wire and was gamely bested in the end, while well clear for second. RUNAWAY KRISTIN was allowed to
settle while never far back, came three wide along the second turn, rallied five wide in upper stretch, was outkicked by the top two in deep stretch but was
well clear for third in the end. MILEYS BLUECAT was away in good order, took back to track the modest early fractions, stayed within aim to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way in the final sixteenth. STREET DEMAND was sent to the early lead, dictated terms through the first
half-mile, dropped back on the far turn and tired in the stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT WICKED BLUE DRIFTED OUT IN DEEP STRETCH AND IMPEDED CANYON CREST, COSTING CANYON
CREST THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. WICKED BLUE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SHE THINKS IM CUTE was sent leaving the break and showed good early speed to the turn, increased the lead nearing the quarter marker, held foes at
bay to mid-stretch, was confronted by REALLY EASY in deep stretch, dug in in the final strides and lasted over that quickly oncoming rival. REALLY EASY
stalked the early pace, gained ground four deep on the turn, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the
win in the final strides, while besting the rest. INDIANERA chased from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished by the top pair in deep
stretch but was well clear in the end for third. OMMANEY BAY showed early speed and pressed the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and gave way in the final stages. ALEX'S DREAM lacked early speed, was unable to threaten in the drive but did mount a mild late rally. NUMMY
NUM was away slowly, chased the quick pace from the inside, was outrun in the drive and was not a late factor. TIGERINTHETANK was away slowly,
lacked early speed and did not have an impact.

Footnotes
BETITO broke alertly and showed speed to dictate terms to the turn, set quick fractions through the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and
remained clear to the wire. THAT'S BIND BABE tracked the early speed, lost position on the turn, re-rallied in upper stretch, was not able to impact the
winner in the late stages but held well in the end for second. MINOSO tracked the fast early pace, gained ground two wide on the turn, could not match
strides with the winner in upper stretch and just saved third in the final strides. QUIET CHARM stalked the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn,
came four wide into the drive, was outkicked in the stretch run and just missed for third in the final strides. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET chased the pace while
trailing through the turn, came five wide into the stretch run and did not offer a late response. MARQUE IT UP stumbled leaving the break, chased the quick
early pace, improved position on the turn, swung six wide into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LIBERTY LIBERTY bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, came two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into
upper stretch, closed with a rush through the final furlong and was up in the final strides to prevail. HILLSDALE NATION rated off of the pace while in the
second flight early on, advanced on the turn, continued that steady bid in upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch but stayed on well late
to secure the place. FIRST TIME PLAYER showed early speed and was prominent in the early going, vied for the lead three deep nearing the quarter
marker, took command and extended the lead into the drive, could not match strides with the top pair in deep stretch but held for third in the end. QUICK
TAKE was allowed to settle, mounted a two wide bid in upper stretch, came within aim in mid-stretch, was outkicked in deep stretch and was just edged for
third in the final strides. I'M NO BALLERINA broke in at the start and was away slowly, chased from the second flight, came six wide into the drive, could not
reel in the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest in the final sixteenth. ANGRY EMMY lost her path at the start and was off slowly, lacked
early speed, gained ground from a two wide path in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. MOTHERS DREAM lacked early speed, came
three wide to the quarter marker and was unable to threaten in the stretch. SUMMER PUDDING raced close to the decent early fractions, chased two wide
nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. AUNTIE BEV won the break and showed good early speed to contest the
pace, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and faded in the stretch run. COASTAL QUEEN chased the early
fractions, lost ground on the turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

MR. MASON settled in the second flight, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch, came within aim of
the leader in mid-stretch, confronted DISKO TRIBUTE inside of the furlong marker, took command in deep stretch and determinedly held sway in the end.
DISKO TRIBUTE broke alertly, raced up close to the early pace, took the lead into the drive, was asked for more in mid-stretch when confronted by MR.
MASON, was outfinished in deep stretch by the determined winner and held safely for second in the end. ETHAN'S ANIMAL was unhurried in the early
going, raced outside of rivals on the turn, rallied five wide in upper stretch, found his best stride late, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch but was up
in time to secure the show. GATOR SHINING stalked the solid early fractions, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, shifted in nearing the furlong
grounds and was outkicked in the final stages. SHARONA'S WILD BOY settled off of the quick early pace, came two wide to the quarter marker, gained
ground in the final sixteenth but could not produce the needed late response. BETT ON BLAZE bobbled at the start and was away slowly, lacked speed to
the turn, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. THATSABADBOY was bothered at the start, chased the solid pace from
the second flight, swung five wide into upper stretch and was not able a factor in the late stages. AFTER THE CANDY was asked to show early speed and
contested the quick early pace, dueled for the lead along the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. WICKLOW HILLS chased
the quick early fractions, lost position on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and was empty in the final stages.

Footnotes
DARNQUICK broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt mild late
pressure from the runner-up in deep stretch but was kept to task in the end to prevail. AWESOME DUDE chased from the second flight, raced two wide
between foes through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, mildly pressured the winner in deep stretch and was clear
of the rest for second. DIAMOND BLITZ stalked the moderate pace while outside of rivals, came five wide into upper stretch, could not match strides with
the top pair in the final stages and just held for third in the final strides. THE LITTLE H MAN stumbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the
pace from the inside, improved position in upper stretch but lacked a late rally. HANDSOME GARY tracked the early pace, came three wide on the turn,
swung five wide into upper stretch and was not a late factor. I'M CORFU showed early speed and disputed the pace to the turn, kept pressure on
DARNQUICK through the turn while that one carved moderate fractions, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
AMANOFMYSTATURE was allowed to settle within striking distance early, made a bold five-wide rally through the turn then responded well to strong
handling down the lane to wear down a stubborn SHORT RIB in the final yards. SHORT RIB broke well, was content to track the leader for the first quarter,
moved up to engage ALPHABETICAL for the lead, easily disposed of that foe past the quarter pole then was immediately challenged by others to his inside
and outside, held a short lead at the top of the stretch with all six horses spread across the track, battled on gamely to beat all but one in a solid effort.
DOUBLE THE GOLD was bothered a bit after the break by PHILOSPHER'S TONE, showed some interest in challenging the leaders but backed off from the
early speed duel down the stretch, moved out away from the rail to pass PHILOSOPHER'S TONE going into the turn and came into the stretch in good
position, finished with some interest but was never a threat to the top pair. OLYMPIC SILVER lagged early and allowed to settle into stride, was asked for
more passing the three furlong marker and responded with a nice rally through the turn while racing wide, exited the turn widest of six abreast and appeared
flatten out in the final furlong. ALPHABETICAL hustled from the break intent on getting the early lead, dueled with SHORT RIB through the turn and had
nothing left for the stretch run. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE broke in a bit and brushed lightly with DOUBLE THE GOLD, was pushed to get early position but
was outrun to the lead, remained a factor for three furlongs while saving ground but couldn't sustain the pace and tired.
