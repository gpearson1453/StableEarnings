MIRACLE pressed the pace two wide and finished second best. KISS THE RED HEAD unhurried early, found her best stride late. TITEBLUEJEANS had
good early speed, dropped back on the turn then came on again late along the rail. QUIET LADY bore out at the start, moved up four wide on the turn then
came up empty. SHANGHAI ROYALTY stumbled at the start and was no threat. HEART OF RUBY had speed into the turn then weakened. LEONA'S
PROMISE had brief speed. SWEET DREAMS LUCIA bore in at the start, settled inside, was erratic past the half mile pole and trailed.
