Footnotes
COUNTER OFFER, caught four wide racing into the first turn racing just off the first flight, eased off the leaders entering the backstretch, angled to the
inside racing into the far turn, tipped off the inside to bid between foes in upper stretch, altered course to the rail when losing his path to TIO BLAS
midstretch and continued with a solid late bid to narrowly prevail at the wire under firm handling. The latter was urged to the lead along the inside dictating
the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch, shifted out crossing the path of the eventual winner
midstretch and continued grudgingly to the end to just miss. PERFECT WAGER tracked off the first flight three deep between foes racing into the first turn,
was urged to advance in that path on the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, struck the front in that path midstretch but was outkicked
by the top pair. WILLING TO SPEED, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn between foes to upper
stretch but came up empty in the drive. GAGOOTS settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention four
wide racing through the far turn but flattened out in the drive. DRAMATIC KITTEN was rated off the first flight near the inside to the backstretch and came up
empty after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF THE WINNER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST TIO BLAS BUT THAT CLAIM WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
JOURNEYIST soon led, took pressure from SHINE DOWN to her inside past the five eighths, took the lead into the turn, came in approaching the seven
sixteenths, cleared the field while saving ground around the bend, opened up further in upper stretch and maintained her advantage under a moderate drive.
GHAALEB'S HONOR was bumped in the opening strides and took back, trailed down the back straight, took closer order in the two path from near the three
eighths, was driven three wide between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on a clear second best while drifting out a few paths late. STORMY EMPIRE
settled inside of SUMMER BELLE at the rear of the main field, continued at the rear of the main group in the three to four path on the turn, swung five wide
into the lane, and chased on mildly for show. SUMMER BELLE chased outside of STORMY EMPIRE toward the rear of the main group down the back
straight, bid in the five to six path past the three eighths, swung out toward the center of the track into the lane and continued to drift out further, and passed
outside of tiring horses late. SHINE DOWN broke out and bumped GHAALEB'S HONOR in the opening strides, was pushed along to prompt the pace inside
of JOURNEYIST past the five eighths, steadied approaching the seven sixteenths when that one came in, tracked the pace in the three path on the turn
while racing inside of SWEET FRAULEIN, was driven between horses in the lane but could not find enough in the final furlong. SWEET FRAULEIN was
forward between horses early, tracked the leading pair outside of I DON'T KNOW MARGO from the nine sixteenths, tracked the leader in the four path on
the turn, came four wide into the lane and flattened. I DON'T KNOW MARGO was forward inside early, tracked the leading pair from the nine sixteenths,
began to flatten out along the rail around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and had no more. THE JOCKEY OF SHINE DOWN CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF JOURNEYIST, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE PAST THE HALF MILE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PASTA SALAD RHONDA, caught in tight quarters just after the start, angled sharply to the rail while racing last to the first turn, steadily gained contention
inside foes after a half, tipped off the inside to split foes nearing upper stretch, angled back to the rail entering the lane, came through inside foes to
challenge for command midstretch and just edged MO SMOKING in time under strong handling. The latter, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first
turn, rated just off the first flight on the backstretch, came through inside foes on the far turn to challenge for command when presented an opening nearing
upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage midstretch, then grudgingly resisted the winner while just failing to contain that foe. IZZY'S MONSTER settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share late.
LORRAINE'S LEGACY, urged to contend four wide between foes into the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, advanced to
challenge three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. VOSTRA settled four wide in the last flight racing into the first
turn, made steady progress after a half to advance on the leaders four wide racing into the far turn, but flattened out in the drive. ANA, forwardly placed
along the inside tracking just off the leaders into the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and faded into the lane. KEEP LEFT, urged
three deep between foes contesting the lead into the first turn, forced the issue outside a rival to the far turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage midway
through the second bend and gave out in the drive. LILLY LANE, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled inwards tracking the leaders from out of
striking distance between foes to the backstretch and dropped out early. NORTHERN CHARMER ducked out at the start crossing into the path of the
eventual winner, was settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch and proved no threat. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN was hustled up the rail
disputing the lead inside foes into the first turn, dueled for command on the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE broke sharply, shook clear into the turn, set the pace in the two path around the bend, raced clear inside into the lane, and stayed
on while kept to task along the rail. MARYS LAST SONG stumbled badly out of the gate, hit the gate on the way out, trailed, took closer order into the turn,
chased in the two path around the bend, rallied along the rail into the lane, kept on under a drive and outfinished STERN for place honors. STERN attended
the pace between horses early, tracked three wide between horses on the turn, was driven in upper stretch while still three wide, drifted out, chased with
interest but was outfinished for the place. ALMAFUERTE tracked the leading line outside of KITTEN ROCKS early, tracked four wide around the turn, came
five wide into the lane, could not match APOLLO U ANYWHERE's kick into upper stretch and chased on evenly. LADY ATLANTIC chased outside foes
early, bid five wide on the turn, loomed near the five sixteenths, swung six wide into the lane, was outkicked by the pacesetter, chased on but ultimately did
not have enough late. AH LEAH raced toward the rear of the main group down the back straight, chased in the four to five path around the turn, swung out
to the eight path in upper stretch, chased under a drive, and lacked the needed late kick. KITTEN ROCKS tracked the leading line inside of ALMAFUERTE
early, chased in the three path on the turn, chased between horses in upper stretch, remained in range to midstretch and emptied out. WANNA HAVE FUN
settled near the rear early, raced at the rear in the three path on the turn, swung out six wide into the lane for the drive, and lacked the needed rally. AIKEN
TO BE attended inside of STERN early, tracked inside into the turn, raced in the two path around the bend, came two wide into the lane, and emptied out
from midstretch.

Footnotes
LATIN CASINO was urged inside rivals from the break disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shook clear racing into the turn, then held sway on a
widening margin while being kept to firm encouragement. TIME HEIST was rated off the first flight while working his way to the inside on the backstretch,
tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to prevail for the place honors. NAUGHTY ALFRED was hustled in
early stages prompting the pacesetter to the turn, proved no match nearing upper stretch and steadily faded late. D' YANK angled to the inside tracking
behind the second flight racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. LITTLE KANSAS, brushed at
the start, was held up last in the opening stages, swung out five wide racing into the stretch to gain some position late but made no real impression.
EASTER MUSIC broke inwards brushing LITTLE KANSAS, was righted to track between foes in second flight, gained some position shifting out four wide
racing into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker. PUBLIC SAFETY was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and
continued evenly into the stretch. OSCAR WINNER WALLY tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing four deep to the turn and steadily faded
into the stretch. TORIN was urged to gain a forward placing three deep pursuing the leaders into the bend but gave way early.

Footnotes
RICHIESGOTGAME chased inside early, tracked the leading pair inside of TEMPER TANTRUM, chased in range inside around the far turn, was urged
along the rail into the lane, lost an inside hole in upper stretch and altered two wide approaching the furlong mark, rallied under a drive between
READTHECLIFFNOTES and ANOTHER MYSTERY, and got up in the last several strides. ANOTHER MYSTERY raced at the inside of the rear flight early,
continued toward the rear into the back straight, waited behind the tracking flight inside horses into the far turn, angled three wide near the three eighths,
continued three wide into the lane, was driven four wide between horses past teh furlong mark, was narrowly outkicked by the winner but got up for place
late. READTHECLIFFNOTES was sent for speed, set the pace while taking a occasional prompting by POWER THROUGH early, was engaged in earnest
by that foe into the far turn, kept a narrow lead in the two path, turned POWER THROUGH away into the lane, drifted in slightly in upper stretch but
nonetheless cleared through midstretch, kept on gamely inside but could not hold off his nearest pursuers in the final jumps. TEMPER TANTRUM tracked
the leading pair outside of RICHIESGOTGAME, tracked the leading pair in the four path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane, raced in range
five wide through midstretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. POWER THROUGH was keen early while tracking outside of READTHECLIFFNOTES,
engaged outside that foe into the far turn and pressed the pace in the three path, proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane, continued in range
between horses three wide to midstretch, and flattened out late. LAND MARK DEAL settled near the rear between horses, was pushed along into the far
turn, chased at the rear of the main group in the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. YOU'RE IN COREY
tracked the leading pair outside of TEMPER TANTRUM early, floated out into the first turn and settled back three deep in the rear flight, raced a bit keenly
near the center of the track down the backstretch, stopped into the far turn and trailed home.

Footnotes
LOVE THE NEST raced five deep in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, was urged to advance three wide racing into the turn, moved to wrest
command in that path in upper stretch, then forged clear through the last furlong under firm right handed encouragement. OMAHA RED was rated inside
rivals tracking off the first flight racing into the bend, tipped out to split foes nearing midstretch and narrowly edged rivals for the place honors on the wire.
CHICKS DIG SCARS, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, proved no match
for the winner and just missed for second. NAVY SEAL was settled off the second flight outside a rival on the backstretch, angled out five wide racing
through the stretch and was just outkicked for a share. TONYS MORNING LINE settled last near the inside racing to the turn and passed some tiring rivals
late. MAGIC CASTLE, urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the lane, gave way leaving midstretch. LAUDA SPEED tracked off the
first flight between foes in the opening quarter, shifted out four wide racing through the turn and soon emptied out.

Footnotes
SOUPER FORTUNE tracked the leading line inside down the back straight, continued in the pocket along the rail on the turn, made an inside bid into the
lane, altered two wide near the three sixteenths, bulled through when driven between IRISH TUFF and CHRISTMAS PRESENT near the sixteenth, and won
going away. IRISH TUFF chased midfield early, was keen behind foes near the half, angled out and rallied four wide from near the three eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, raced in range through midstretch, separated from the rest of the field with SOUPER FORTUNE and CHRISTMAS PRESENT into
the final furlong, was outkicked by the winner but kept on well enough despite drifting out late to secure the place. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was hustled for
speed inside of NATURAL CHILL, set a pressured pace down the back straight and in the two path on the turn, maintained the lead between horses in
upper stretch, carried a diminishing lead inside foes into the final furlong, ran on willingly but was caught in the final sixteenth and lost place late. WHERE'D
THE DAY GO tracked the pace outside the leading pair early, prompted the pace three wide on the turn, came into the lane four wide in range, was
outkicked from the three sixteenths, but churned on to prove best of the rest. NATURAL CHILL broke sharply, prompted the pace outside of CHRISTMAS
PRESENT after that one sent to the lead inside, continued to press the pace between horses on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, found himself
outkicked by CHRISTMAS PRESENT in upper stretch, and weakened between horses past the furlong mark. FINAL CALL settled in second last, continued
toward the rear in the three to four path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, and offered mild improvement. ICECAP
settled toward the rear, chased in the two path on the turn, raced four wide into the lane and chased on evenly in the drive. PIRATE BIRD soon trailed,
raced toward the rear in the two to three path on the turn, swung out six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. FINE GRAYDAR chased three deep
early, continued midpack in the five path on the turn, raced five wide into the lane and came up empty. SKOL FACTOR tracked the leading line two wide
early, settled back to the chasing flight between near the five eighths, stopped between horses past the half and was allowed to trail home.
