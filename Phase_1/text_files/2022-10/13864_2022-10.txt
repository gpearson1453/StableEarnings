Footnotes
BODE LYNX stalked the pace down the backstretch, commenced his rally in the two path leaving the far turn, gained command inside OBOY in upper
stretch then pulled away under a drive. OBOY showed speed, raced well off the inner rail down the backstretch, was three wide the far turn, lost the lead in
upper stretch, weakened and held the pace. SECRET SANCTUARY , rank the first turn, gained the lead along the inner rail mid way down the backstretch,
remained along the rail and gave way through the stretch. BYRON'S GOLD , four deep the far turn, gave way. LIGHTNING LAD hugged the inner rail on the
far turn and gave way. MR. FIBONACCI was a brief factor along the inner rail. SWEET STREET , three wide the first turn, faltered on the far turn.

Footnotes
AESTHETICALLY rated close up and in the clear, moved through an opening along the rail and joined the leader with a furlong remaining, spurted clear
under a drive with a sixteenth to go then dug in to fend off GREAT IDEA. GREAT IDEA , off the pace while saving ground, eased out and advanced
between runners into the stretch, swung out past the three sixteenths and closed gamely. MOSLER SAFE , within range early while saving ground, steadied
in a tight spot mid turn, regrouped and stayed inside for the drive, came back on with interest and gained the show. SUNDAY MISCHIEF set a pressured
pace towards the inside, held the lead while off the rail in upper stretch, was hooked from his inside in mid stretch, fought on to about the sixteenth marker,
wandered outward and faded. ELEAZAR , hustled up outside rivals, quickly gained four wide heading to the five sixteenths, loomed chasing in mid stretch
then faded. MAD GENIUS forced the pace outside the leader, was floated out some past the sixteenth pole and gave way. CRIMSON ROCKET , off slow
when hopping at the break, rushed up between foes, bumped with a rival mid turn, angled out in the drive and faded. CHROME DIXIE , three to four wide,
exchanged a mild bump mid turn and came up empty. CLAUDEE BOY drafted back off the pace, circled five wide into the stretch but failed to respond.
HAMPDEN LANE was outrun.

Footnotes
REEL WELL settled off the inside, commenced a progression into the far turn, bid three deep under asking nearing the lane, took over outside rivals in
upper stretch, drifted in when clearing away under a drive in mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden through the final yards. BUNKER HILL saved ground
off the early pace, advanced into the far turn, shifted out past the three sixteenths and churned on willingly to gain the place. ZEVON stalked the leader, took
closer order into the far turn, bid between foes with a quarter to go, vied to the three sixteenths then faded late. THE LAST SCIP , keen to go early and
opened up, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a pair to his outside approaching the quarter pole, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened.
DIAL HIM UP , three wide with some run under asking into the far turn, pursued the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted in and came up empty.
SPIRITUAL GHOST saved ground, dropped back past the half and failed to generate a run.

inside in the stretch and weakened. MISS CHAMITA , never a factor, raced four deep on the turn and drifted to the six path entering the stretch. GRACE'S
SECRET , outrun, raced near the inner rail on the turn. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF bumped TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK leaving the starting gate, showed

BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) tracked inside mid turn, eased out three wide into the lane, closed in determinedly under left handed asking, took command in
deep stretch, switched over to her left lead and got the bob. TRANSLATE , squeezed back a bit soon after the break, angled in and was taken to rate,
angled four to five wide into the lane, closed nicely through the final furlong, ranged up and joined the winner in the final strides but lost the nose bob.
CLAIRE'S DARLING sped clear soon after the break and set a strong pace, raced off the rail into the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, failed to
contain the winner past the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. TIZ SUSAN ANN saved ground off the pace, eased out into the stretch, worked
between runners in mid stretch, dropped back in and kept on with interest. HELLO GRACIE , in a bit tight at the break, raced well back around the turn,
shifted in late and finished with interest. GRAND SKYLARK chased outside a rival mid turn and lacked a bid. TAK E LADY , off the pace, circled four wide
into the stretch but failed to menace. ALWAYS SOMETHING , off slowly when hopping at the break, rushed up to be the closest pursuer of the leader,
shifted in for the drive and gave way. CALYPSO GHOST was wrangled back towards the rail heading to the turn, angled out nearing the lane and failed to
threaten.

SCINTILLATING STAR prompted the pace outside SAPPHIRE BEAUTY, secured command in upper stretch, sprinted clear in mid stretch then held sway
under steady handling. VICTORIAN RIVIERA , well placed three deep on the turn, closed outside the winner. TAP N GLO saved ground on the turn, eased
off the rail in upper stretch and failed to rally. THE HAUNTED ROOM , three wide on the turn, was outrun. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY set the pace along the rail
and weakened in upper stretch. LOOKIN SPUNKY , unruly in the gate, was outrun and swung to the four path turning for home. VAN HAVEN , in the two
path chasing the pace for three furlongs, was done on the turn. THE HARPSTER trailed.

Footnotes
BARZINI sped clear early and set a rated pace off the inside, responded to firm asking past the quarter pole, drifted out nearing mid stretch, kept on under
solid right handed asking, wandered in deep stretch but was resolute to the wire. REELED IN had speed then rated just off the winner and stalked two wide
between foes, eased out under coaxing into the lane, kept on with good energy and was clear for the place. TIDEWATER , under a snug hold while saving
ground, edged up then tapped the brakes briefly mid turn, moved up towards the rail in upper stretch, worked outward through the final furlong and
continued willingly to the wire. A WESTERN YARN , inside a trio of rivals chasing the winner, stayed on past mid stretch then faded late. MISSION MAN ,
hung out four deep stalking the pace, came under a drive in upper stretch but failed to seriously kick on. ROCK CHALK lagged off the pace while saving
ground, was ridden along saving ground into the stretch but lacked a rally. WYATT RIDGELY , off the early pace, made some progress between runners
into the lane but lacked any further response. BARB'S PRIDE , sluggish away, was taken wide soon after, circled five wide under a ride into the lane then
faded. SUPERR RON edged up early, stalked three wide between rivals, failed to kick on under pressure into the stretch and weakened.

AL LOVES JOSIE showed speed, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, and opened up under brisk urging in mid stretch. HEMP , steadied lacking room
leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied. RAD PAISLEY disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened. SEVEN ON THE
ROCKS , in the two path between horses entering the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MOSE PERFECT , three deep on
the turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. BERKS , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. DR. RUSTY
RAYMOND bobbled leaving the staring gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. FRIAR TUCK , in the two path chasing the pace
around the turn, gave way. KATIE'S NOTION , three deep on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
SILVER SEA rated kindly while saving ground, moved up towards rail leaving the three sixteenths, attempted to veer out briefly when altering outside rivals
in mid stretch, corrected to close sharply under pressure, took over with about a sixteenth to go and eagerly drew out under asking. MASHUA rated
forwardly off the inside, moved up three wide into the lane, closed in to engage the leader in mid stretch, dueled on near even terms heading to the sixteenth
pole, was no match for the winner but stayed willingly for the place. PRINCESS PALMER vied outside a rival, moved clear into the lane, dug in when
confronted in mid stretch, sparred to the sixteenth pole, faded and just lasted for the show. BIZZY BIZZY chased the pace, raced three wide into the lane,
advanced between runners near the three sixteenths and churned on. POLICE WOMAN , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and gathered
steam mid turn while saving ground, angled out into the stretch and closed. SEEMS TO WHISPER , four wide stalking a contested pace, faded. NINE MAST
, wrangled back early, angled out and failed to menace. BENEDICTINESISTERS was outrun. ROO , well back early, failed to menace. ASHARA vied inside
a rival, stayed on to the head of the lane then faltered.
