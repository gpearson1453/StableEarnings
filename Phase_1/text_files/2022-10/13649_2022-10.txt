Footnotes
OBANNON moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady stretch handling to hold on well. LEG UP stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn
and dueled through the stretch for second. REY O REYES was bumped inward and into TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS leaving the gate then settled toward the
inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then steadied in tight at the rail later yards and was subsequently
outfinished for place. The latter was bumped inward and into Master Yoo leaving the gate, pinched back a stride later then saved ground on the first turn, bid
into the backstretch, improved in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SALTY J J settled close in the three path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the lane. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground racing well off the pace, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. MASTER YOO was bumped leaving the gate and raced well off
the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane.
PONTICELLO rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE
broke in and made contact with Rey O Reyes then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far
turn. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Rey O Reyes for interference leaving the gate, lodged by the rider of Tyry
Tyrannosaurus, the Stewards determined the former was not at fault.

Footnotes
CUMULONIMBUS settled back in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dueled to the
lead mid-stretch and drew clear inside the sixteenth pole. FORT ZANNA raced well back from early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
improved off the rail on the far turn, was eased to the six path leaving the turn, and finished well to take second the final yards. IRISH SAMURAI settled off
the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and dug in to take third the final yards while
outfinished for second. BALLYMENA angled to the inside approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was caught toward mid-stretch and gave way the final sixteenth. MAYSVILLE MISS stalked off the rail the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened inside the eighth pole. DALLAS broke a step
slow and rounded the opening turn in the five path, left the turn outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. WHY LEA rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. REGGAETONI ran in the
four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. PAUL'S TRICKY TALE raced well back inside. LLUVIA saved ground just off the
pace then faded through the backstretch.
