Footnotes
KEYSTONE FIELD pressed two wide, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear turning for home, felt a left handed crack entering the final
furlong to stay on task with an insurmountable margin, and was wrapped up through the late stages. TWO BY TWO tracked two to three wide, came under a
drive around the far turn in hopes of gaining, chased the clearing leader while gaining place with a quarter mile to got, then shifted to the four path entering
the lane, and failed to threaten the leader while holding place. FAN CLUB steadied when put to tight quarters along the rail in the early stages, settled off of
the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path around the far turn before swinging to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on sustained stride.
SUGOI set the pace inside of the eventual winner, but was headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. ZOOMER stalked along the inside,
but came under urging in the two path around the far turn to sustain position, but lacked a response and faded. PEEKACHO trailed in the two to four paths
and got outrun.

Footnotes
BEST SELLER vied four wide before clearing with nine sixteenths to go, maintained a clear margin around the turn, then drew off through the lane under
driving pressure while hanging on his left lead. SIMPERING SMILE tracked along the inside, tipped outside of WILDCAT GIRL turning for home, then
claimed place from that one at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead and failing to threaten the leader. WILDCAT GIRL stalked along the inside,
faded while proving no match for the clear leader turning for home, then lost place at the furlong grounds before lasting for show. SURE ENOUGH broke
slowly, laid off of the pace, split foes two wide entering the turn before tipping three wide around the bend, then fanned to the five path in upper stretch, and
stayed on. LADY ENVOY broke out, chased from midpack along the inside, and lacked a bid. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE raced in midpack two wide, but
yielded. MS. THE LAW bumped an inner rival at the start, got caught four wide while off of the pace around the turn, and failed to menace. BASILICA D
ORO lacked speed along the inside despite constant rider urging, and never got involved. THATSHOWSHEROLLS chased two wide, but faded three wide
and between horses turning for home. CONTROLLED FIRE tracked three wide, but caved in hand while taken wide entering the lane. JEFF'S JOY chased
from midpack three wide, but was done early. MORIARTY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
MAOILIN cleared off while tucking to the two path into the first turn, showed the way before meeting WATERS OF MEROM's challenge into the far turn,
dueled with that foe around that bend, clung to a very narrow margin from that foe in upper stretch, then inched ahead to a more pronounced advantage
entering the final sixteenth before shifting ground out while clearing nearing the wire. WATERS OF MEROM broke a step slow, recovered to stalk outside of
the pace setter around the first turn, moved forward to bid nearing the far turn, sparred with her inner counterpart around that bend and into upper stretch
while staying a path away, then sustained the battle through midstretch, but began to yield entering the final sixteenth, then was taken in hand when her
counterpart shifted across her path in the shadow of the wire. CARRY ON stalked along the inside, then chased the top pair while under urging around the
far turn, and was best of the rest. SINGSONG BIRD tracked along the inside while just a bit off of the rail, tipped outside of the leading pair into the far turn,
yet failed to progress despite rider encouragement around that bend, then yielded turning for home. RUNAWAY MOM laid off of the pace in the four path,
improved to midpack into the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid while hanging on her left lead. GYPSY WIFE trailed early on, then steadily improved without
threatening. ANCIENT BROWN laid off of the pace in the two path, and failed to factor. MISS SUPER SAINT never got involved. STYLISH ASH tracked
three wide, but weakened with a half mile to go. THE RIDER OF WATERS OF MEROM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MAOLIN FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE LATE STAGES; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
LUGAN KNIGHT stalked along the inside while bottled up in the pocket around the turn, came into the lane in the two path, searched for racing room behind
the leading trio through upper stretch, split those foes three wide at the three sixteenths pole as an outer CARCANO also produced a bid, vied entering the
final furlong, inched an advantage from his outer bidding counterpart soon after, and held sway. CARCANO laid off of the pace four wide, gained outside of
foes while floating five wide turning for home, produced a bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, sparred with an inner bidding LUGAN KNIGHT
entering the final furlong, but was outkicked by that foe approaching the final sixteenth, and kept on determinedly. CHANCE tracked four wide, chased under
urging around the turn before being outkicked by an outer rival turning for home, sustained stride in the six path in upper stretch, but shied while being
floated out by an inner veering foe at the furlong grounds, yet stayed on thereafter to reach show at the wire. RUNNINGFORCASH prompted the pace two
wide and from between horses, forged a narrow advantage turning for home, led before meeting a pair of outer bids nearing the furlong grounds, got
outkicked by those foes at that juncture, gave way soon after, and got nailed at the wire for show while saving fourth. SURFACE TO AIR broke a step slowly
before taking back from tight quarters between rivals at the start, laid unhurried along the inside, gained under a drive along the rail in upper stretch, altered
course to the five path in midstretch, and stayed on between horses, but missed reaching show. HINENI hopped while breaking slowly, lagged behind
around the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and improved willingly while hanging on her left lead. SUNSET TOWN pressed three wide, but
was outkicked by rivals on either side while floated four wide at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered shortly after. TIME ANDBEYOND raced far back in
the four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. EDDIE M broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped two
to three wide while attempting to inch closer turning for home, but stalled out, and tired among foes through the final furlong. DEVILS RED tracked three
wide and between horses, but faded at the three furlong pole. EMPIRE'S BEST chased two wide and between horses, but weakened while floated three
wide at the five sixteenths pole. RECON set the pace inside of a pair of sternly pressing foes into the turn, but was headed passing the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DOMINICAN PIONEER set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, shook clear at the three sixteenths pole while tipping a bit
off of the rail, then gamely held sway through the late stages. EASY TIME stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, chased the
clearing leader from the rail to gain place at the furlong grounds, and just lasted from an outer bidder at the wire. ALEX JOON rated far back two wide,
attempted a gain four wide around the far turn before shifting five wide entering the lane, stayed on with a grinding charge through midstretch before
flopping back to his left lead while being floated six wide nearing the final sixteenth, then surged outside of foes in the closing stages, but just missed
reaching place. BULLSEYE BUN tracked along the inside, swung five wide at the furlong grounds for clear sailing, and stayed on between horses.
SAMBURU (GB) tracked in midpack while tipping from the two to three path, inched closer to stalk outside of the top pair nearing the far turn, got floated
four wide entering the lane, but failed to progress while sustaining a chase, flopped back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, and flattened out
while being surpassed by outer bidders. RED HORNET tracked two wide, crept closer between horses turning for home, tipped three wide to take aim on
the leaders in upper stretch, but failed to progress among foes, and yielded in the late stages. EYES ON TARGET settled off of the pace in the two path,
shifted out before encountering traffic entering the lane, altered out to the six path in upper stretch, floated seven wide in midstretch, and failed to threaten
with a mild kick. LIGHT FURY pressed two wide while keen around the first turn, vied around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch before weakening
between horses at the furlong grounds. VIVAR laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, and lacked a bid. YAMATO broke a step
slowly, trailed, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to factor. CREED rated far back along the inside and was outrun. ENCOURAGE tracked in
midpack along the inside, was held up under restraint entering the backstretch, awaited racing room around the far turn, but came up empty.

Footnotes
CODE NAME KATE tracked four to three wide, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage coming to the final furlong, kicked clear soon after, and held
sway. SHANIAH laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer turning for home before tipping four wide in upper stretch, grinded away in pursuit of the newly
leading CODE NAME KATE approaching the final furlong, then chased that foe home while gaining place at the sixteenth pole. H. T. XENA prompted the
pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane along with an outer rival, but was outkicked by that foe approaching the final furlong, yielded soon after, yet
saved show at the wire. LOVE OF MY LIFE laid off of the pace two wide before cutting the corner, chased while tipping to the five path in midstretch, and
stayed on while one paced to miss reaching show at the wire. DAWNLAND set the pace inside of a prompting foe, then inside of pair of foes entering the
lane, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way. AFLEET ARLENE chased three to two wide, but yielded turning for home. LEGERITY broke a step
slowly, lacked speed in the three path, swung to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. CONDIMENT GIRL laid off of the pace in the two path,
but was shuffled back behind a tiring foe around he turn, and failed to get involved. ARLYNE'S CROWN stalked along the inside, but faltered while requiring
rider correction from bearing out around the turn. SHELL SHOCK trailed in the five path, then bore out entering the lane while being eased.

Footnotes
VICTORY FORMATION set the pace inside of a pressing foe, kicked away from him in upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. RELEASE
MCCRAKEN pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader while proving no match entering the lane, then maintained place thereafter.
COMMUNICATION MEMO chased the leading pair from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of RELEASE MCCRAKEN entering the lane,
threatened that foe for place in midstretch, but lacked a bid for that position. WEYHILL ROAD took a bump from an inner foe before brushing an outer rival
at the start, possibly had his hind heels clipped by that foe soon after, tracked along the inside, improved inside of foes turning for home, looked to alter
course outwardly in upper stretch before committing to a rail charge at the three sixteenths pole, but flattened out. BASELINE BEATER broke slowly before
shying from an outer troubled foe soon after the start, raced very far back in the two path, picked up stride turning for home, altered out to the six path in
upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. SPEED INSTITUTE bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside while in the two path, and
failed to factor. UNCLECHARLIESGIFT laid off of the pace two wide while in the three path, chased between horses in upper stretch, but failed to menace.
DINGMANN got caught five wide while in midpack around the turn, and failed to make an impact. SANTORINI tracked four wide, but yielded among foes
turning for home. SEAS OF NORMANDY stalked three wide and between horses, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. BARRELHOUSE lacked speed in
the four path, and tired around the turn. SCHOOLMASTER (GER) exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start, took back before clipping heels with that
foe and veering in uncontrollably soon after, then showed little.

SUNNY ONE settled off of the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn before tipping three wide in upper stretch, offered a good kick and surged
between foes at the furlong ground, sustained her charge to bid inside of the leader in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage at the wire. SCOTISH
STAR (ARG) set the pace, enjoyed an uncontested advantage down the backstretch, met a mild bid from an outer rival around the far turn, yet repelled that
foe entering the lane, drove clear while shifting out in midstretch, but was caught by an inner bidder at the wire. PRINCESS FAWZIA tracked along the
inside while under a snug hold around the first turn, took the far turn two wide before tipping outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, then stayed on to
claim show entering the final sixteenth. PERSEVERANCIA took back from tight quarters among rivals at the start, trailed, swung from the three path to the
seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly eight wide through the final furlong. ARM CANDY rated off of the pace along the inside, swung to the
five path entering the lane before floated seven wide and between horses at the furlong grounds, then stayed on. PHANTOM VISION tracked three wide,
bid for place entering the lane, changed to his correct lead at the three sixteenths pole while chasing the clear leader, then was outkicked at the furlong
grounds, and yielded. DISAPPEARING ACT laid off of the pace two wide, shfited six wide in midstretch, and lacked a bid. BELLAGAMBA (ARG) was
bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked two to three wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but yielded. CANDACE O stalked two wide, pressed the
leader around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. SARANYA laid unhurried along the inside, then between horses down the backstretch, and
never got involved. PYRAMID PRINCESS stalked along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. POCA MUCHA bumped an outer rival at the start, raced
far back two to three wide, swung six wide entering the lane and failed to factor.

Footnotes
COCKTAIL MOMENTS stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader entering the far turn and shared the blame of putting an outer rival to tight
quarters approaching the five sixteenths pole, sustained a bid for the lead along with an outer TAKE A STAND turning for home, vied with that foe entering
the lane, and drove clear of her leaving the furlong grounds. SKRATCH KAT rated at the rear two wide, tracked in the four to three path while pursuing the
leaders turning for home, but lugged in and bothered an inner VALENTINA DAY in upper stretch, kept on while hanging on her left lead, and reached place
late while requiring correction from continuing to lug in. TAKE A STAND tracked in the four path, shared the blame of putting an inner foe to tight quarters at
the five sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid three wide around the far turn along with an inner COCKTAIL MOMENTS, vied with that foe in upper stretch, but
failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, tired, and lost place late. VALENTINA DAY settled at the rear along the inside, attempted to move between
horses entering the lane, but steadied when bumped an put to tight quarters by an outer rival coming to the furlong grounds. HOODOOLAND set the pace in
the two path around the first turn, tucked to the rail before meeting a pair of bids turning for home, and weakened entering the lane. DOROTHEA stalked
outside of the leader, but wilted after being put to tight quarters with five sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
QUALITY STAR settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out turning for home before swinging five wide entering the lane, offered a good kick to blow
past the leaders approaching the furlong grounds, and drew clear. ENGLISH TREASURE saved ground in midpack, steadied behind traffic in upper stretch,
altered four wide at the furlong grounds after the eventual winner kicked away, and stayed on to reach place late. MESAORIA stalked along the inside,
tipped three wide entering the lane, bid along with an outer rival, but was outkicked by that foe entering the final furlong, yielded, and lost place late. SUCH
SOUNDS tracked two wide, was coaxed along nearing the far turn, floated four wide while chasing in upper stretch, and gave way. ARROBLUE rated at the
rear along the inside, swung seven wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. TIFFANY'S MO vied two wide, but weakened between horses in midstretch.
TIANA laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then faded turning for home. BROADBAND lacked speed three wide, came into the lane six wide,
and yielded. HEDY LAMARR set the pace, but was headed in upper stretch and weakened at the furlong grounds. RED BEE was bumped by rivals on both
sides at the start, and got outrun. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.
