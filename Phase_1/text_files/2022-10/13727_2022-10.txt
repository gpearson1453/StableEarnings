the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. JOHNNY SWISH broke a step slow then gave chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn then dug in through
the stretch to maintain second. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail then outfinished in a later duel for second. ABOUT
TO RAGE chased outside, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. DINNER BELL pressured the early pace, raced in the three path of
the turn then weakened in the lane. PETE THE BEAST pressured the early pace but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened in the four path of
the turn.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN LILLY took a quick lead and moved inward to rate the pace just off the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn, widened under steady handling to late stretch then taken in hand nearing the wire. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE stalked the early pace inside,
eased out and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. SOME IS NINE came away a
bit awkwardly and rounded the opening turn in the five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and
came along for third later yards. LOOKIN BACK settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response
and ran at the rail on the far turn. CASTLE OF CAYLEE rounded the first turn in the four path and was never a factor. SPUNKY ALI CAT rounded the first
turn in the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. SARAH BELLUM showed little response.

Footnotes
BIG RINNE stalked the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the nod two deep past the quarter, drew clear into the lane and held
well under steady handling. SURE WOULD FOREST rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms
from the five sixteenths but gave up the nod at the rail leaving the quarter pole and steadied into the lane, though, came back to finish evenly. TOP HAT
TREASON settled close off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BOATSWAIN
settled close about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. SEEDS OF
TIME saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened off the rail on the far turn. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced
well back saving early ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response. JAMMIN STILL broke a step slow, raced wide on the
first turn and never factored. MYSTERY BANK stalked the earlier pace about the four path then faded through the backstretch.

GOT YOUR NUMBER set the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. MERCI ROAD
chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn and settled for second best while gaining mildly late. SHUTUPN'KISSME chased, rounded the turn two deep while
between horses and dueled through the stretch for third. TRAVEL GIRL chased through the backstretch, raced three wide on the turn then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. CAN I GET AN AMEN chased outside, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. THELADYISTRUE
became a bit edgy just as the gate opened and was unprepared for the break.

Footnotes
SILVER RULES chased through the backstretch and took the lead at the rail approaching the quarter pole, ran clear into the turn, was hand ridden from the
head of the lane then taken in hand later yards. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE chased, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch, dug in from
the eighth pole and dueled for second later yards. PHILMARY CASTLE chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch then
outfinished for second later yards. WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. MICHEAUX pressured
the pace through the backstretch but dropped back toward the quarter pole, ran near the rail on the turn then weakened the final furlong. KEY TO THE
CASTLE saved ground. VALUED ENERGY contested the pace with a slim lead most of the backstretch, but was caught approaching the quarter pole and
weakened wide on the turn. OUR ITSY BITSY saved ground.
