Footnotes
STORMING LADY settled off the pace, waited for room around the turn then swung four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top trio and proved best in
deep stretch. READY JET GO climbed a bit between rivals tracking up the backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn, bid along the fence in the drive, took a
short lead in midstretch but was bested by the winner. CAPSTONE GIRL was off slow to start, moved into range from inside, shifted to the two path around
the bend, drew alongside the leader at the top of the stretch, gained command at the eight pole but was soon overtaken in midstretch and could not kick on
with the top pair late. MISS FIA reared at the start and lagged behind early, saved ground through the turn and came off the rail into the stretch, kept trying
down the lane and earned minor award. FULMINATE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, lost command with a furlong
remaining and weakened in deep stretch. NEVER FOR MONEY came away slow from inside then moved up and was closest in pursuit outside the
pacesetter early on, coaxed two then three wide around the bend and weakened. PISTACHIO PRINCESS stalked three deep into the turn, got floated five
leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
OVER ATTRACTED stalked three deep early, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, put away OLE SILVER around the bend, roused into the stretch and
drew away under strong handling. OLE SILVER sent for the lead from the gate, gained command and took control of the rail, set the pace under pressure to
the far turn, lost command near the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with OVER ATTRACTED around the far turn, chased along the rail to the stretch
and held the place. WHISTLER'S STYLE climbed a bit while under a hold on the inside, tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole, churned on down the
lane and was along for the show. NORTHERN GEM chased four deep into the first turn then moved into the three path, asked three wide on the far turn and
weakened. BOWL OF CHERRIES pressed the pace from outside, could not keep up with the leader near the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back to last on
the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
MY SUMMER DREAM stalked well off the inside, bid three deep or four wide at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and won going away.
WYFIRE broke slow in the beginning, jumped the track crossing back on to the turn, waited for room on the turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch and
gained the place. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) stalked off the rail then went between rivals into a tight spot entering the turn, moved out and came four wide
into the stretch and gained the show. GATOR SHINING vied four deep up the backstretch, dueled outside a rival around the turn and three wide exiting the
bend, lost command in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. KANT BEAT THE ROCK raced three deep at the back early on, came four wide into
the stretch and improved position. UNCLE JEFF pressed the pace inside three rivals, chased the top pair around the turn and into the stretch, then
weakened down the lane. BLAME GEORGE vied between foes up the backstretch, dueled along the rail and two wide into the stretch and weakened in the
stretch run. MIGHTY MATT vied three deep early on, failed to keep up and got shuffled back on the bend, came three wide into the stretch, hit HEAVEN'S
MUSIC and lost the rider near the eighth pole and walked off. HEAVEN'S MUSIC chased between early at the back, steadied a bit behind a rival and altered
to the outside early on the turn, steered back down to the rail around the bend, sustained an injury at the eighth pole, unseating the rider in the process and
was vanned off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN HEAVEN'S MUSIC AND MIGHTY MATT IN THE
STRETCH AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN KING took control early and moved to the inside on the first turn, set the pace under pressure then moved clear at the midway point, showed
the way along the inside into the stretch, challenged by OPRY in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. OPRY brushed leaving the gate, stalked near the
rail early on, inched closer up the backstretch, steadied inside the leader with three furlongs left to run, tipped out to the two path, chased through the lane
then put in a late bid with a sixteenth to go and could not get by. HOLY GHOST bumped leaving the gate, settled inside, gained around the far turn while
saving ground, summoned a mild rally in the stretch run and gained the show. KITTEN'S SPA bumped leaving the gate, went two wide around the first turn
off the pace, asked three wide between foes on the far turn and got edged for the show. ALVAARO broke a step slow then got shuffled back between rivals
and began to pull, was boxed in near the three-eighths pole, found a clear path around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally. LEPRINO
brushed outer rival, chased two then three wide on the first turn, lost ground on the backstretch, asked three wide around the far turn and weakened.
COMRADERY (IRE) dueled briefly from inside then ceded control and switched outside the leader, went up to apply pressure leaving the clubhouse turn,
lost touch at the midway point, chased three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. PROUD PEDRO (FR) bobbled leaving the
gate, raced three deep at the back into the first turn, traveled four deep on the backstretch, angled down to the rail on the far turn and failed to menace.
PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) stumbled and brushed at the start, raced outside a rival off the pace, went three deep into the far turn, exited that bend two wide
and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BLACK STORM settled inside, coaxed with three furlongs remaining then had to pause when coming up on a tight spot, tipped out a to a clear path leaving
the bend, rallied inside the leader and took over midstretch and drove clear. CAJUN TREASURE broke well then tracked in range off the rail, rounded the
bend three then four wide, rallied outside the leader but was no match for BLACK STORM in deep stretch. EL DIABLO ROJO raced at the back well off the
rail, went between rivals and bumped four wide into the turn, continued in the four path into the lane, moved out further in upper stretch and was along for
the show. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE bumped with EL DIABLO ROJO while running five wide into the turn, remained wide into the drive and kept on to round out
the superfecta. NEW EAGLE asked early but dropped back off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, angled inward in the stretch and failed to
threaten. RECKONING DAY steadied off heels early, angled out and went up challenge into the turn, took over at the three furlong marker, put away inner
rival around the bend, led into the final furlong but was overtaken midstretch and weakened late. DEVOTED TO YOU chased two then three wide on the
turn and flattened in the lane. SHARP WARNING chased three wide off the pace into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and failed to make an
impact. RUSTY CAGE stepped to the front early, cleared inner rivals and crossed over near the half-mile pole, lost command at the three-eighths pole,
could no keep up with the leader around the bend and gave way. FORT BRIDGER was up close early on the inside, chased the top pair into the turn,
dropped back around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
ZE'BUL traveled near the back early on, went two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, moved out further and closed well to overhaul the
runner-up in the closing moments. RANSOMWARE traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, entered the turn two wide, ranged up four deep exiting the
bend, brushed with inner rival in upper stretch while taking a short lead, battled down the lane and got caught late by the winner. REXFORD chased on the
inside into the turn, tipped out and bid three deep, brushed with RANSOMWARE in upper stretch, fought on from inside and got outkicked by the top pair.
MIDNIGHT TAXES came in at the start, drifted out and bumped rival early then went up to challenge for command, dueled into and around the turn and held
a short lead into the lane, came off the rail at the top of the stretch and weakened. MOBE TOWN chased off the rail then moved to the rail for the turn,
waited behind the leaders past the quarter pole, gained a clear path in upper stretch but failed to find the needed response. CARVER hit the gate and
bobbled a bit at the start, stalked off the rail then moved down to the two path, steered to the rail on the turn then tipped out and lacked room behind rivals
path the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and could not rally after gaining a clear path. CLOONEY was off slow to begin, traveled near the back
on the inside into the turn, tipped out and failed to menace. JAM SESSION got bumped from inside early then dueled for command up the backstretch,
fought two wide through the turn, then faded in the stretch run. LOW EXPECTATIONS was off slow to begin, came out crossing the dirt, took the turn two
wide then moved out further and made no impact. SEABOARD broke a step slow and shifted in at the start, saved ground through the turn and had little left
for the drive.
