Footnotes
AGITARE (IRE) checked early on the inside, then pulled his way up the inside to stalk the pace while being hard to handle, finally settled down and stalked
the pacesetter, exchanged bumps with that rival in upper stretch, then drew away in the final furlong to prove much the best. BASSO set the pace while
racing off the inside and was well handled, drifted out leaving the turn and entering the stretch, then shifted in and bumped with the winner, then could not
go with that rival and drifted slightly while staying on for the place award. CROSS BORDER was allowed to settle while three to four wide, then finished
willingly late to just miss the place award. MYSTICAL MAN was allowed to settle while two to three wide but lacked the needed rally. FEARSOME (GB) was
reserved early and had no rally while saving ground. SUMMER SILENCE was settled back early three wide and then passed the tiring rivals. CLINT
MAROON (GB) was reserved early three wide and lacked a rally. OCEANS MAP was settled back early and failed to respond. BELLARMINE HALL stalked
the early pace, then chased the pace and tired. ROYNE was void of early speed and was not a threat. CLUBBING stalked the early pace and then chased
the pace and tired. ABSAM was reserved three to four wide and stopped. SMALL HOPE chased the early pace and stopped, eased, walked off. EAGERLY
showed little and was eased, walked off.
