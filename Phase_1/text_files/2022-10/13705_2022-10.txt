Footnotes
STRAWBERRY TREAT was off a step slow and broke inward, chased the pace three wide, shifted out by the furlong marker and closed well to win going
away late, driving. NEON SIGN dueled for the lead outside, then made a three wide bid by the furlong marker and led by the sixteenth marker, but faded
late, second best. SIR SMOAK dueled for the lead and made a inside bid leaving the turn but faded the final furlong. DR GREENTHUMB chased the early
pace and was roused on the turn and had no rally while raving green. CHIEF BULLET was off slowly and broke outwardly, failed to menace.

SIR REX broke out and bumped DEBIT CARD at the start, then was guided to the outside to stalk the pace four wide, remained in range on the turn, made
a four wide bid leaving the turn and hit the front leaving the furlong marker and drew away to prove much the best, driving. DEBIT CARD was bumped at the
start, dueled for the lead two wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn but could not go with the winner in the final furlong, second best. BOBBY'S
CANDY rushed up the inside to duel for the lead while saving ground and weakened the final furlong, bested rest. KAZ MUNNINGS tracked the pace five
wide and was four wide on the turn and weakened. KAZTHAROS prompted the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MS STRONG HEART was away alertly to set the pace while in the two path, was well handled throughout, roused leaving the turn and shook clear by the
furlong marker, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under mild urging. SWAN POINT was rated along on the inside to the quarter pole,
shifted out and made a five wide bid leaving the turn, finished willingly to gain the place award. FAIRY DREAMS stalked the winner three wide throughout,
made a four wide bid leaving the turn and needed more, lost the place award late. QUEEN ROSEMARY was well placed on the inside and lacked the
needed stretch bid on the inside, bested rest. MELODIA was settled back early, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally. OUR JESSICA JOAN
tracked the pace three wide, then was between rivals on the turn and weakened. GLOSSY MADRINA was settled four wide and was three wide on the turn
and tired.

GRAB THE GOLD set a pressured pace two wide, made a bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, then drew out in the drive to prove much the
best under right handed crop urging. COAST TO COAST was settled early and saved ground on the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane,
finished willingly to be clearly second best. EQUAL JUSTICE pressed the early pace on the inside, then was taken off the pace on the turn and shifted out
by the five sixteenths, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. THE BEST CANDY was taken back early, void of any speed,
came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. CLASSY SOLUTION tracked the pace three wide and then was three to four wide on the turn and
weakened. CALCULATED THINKIN lacked a rally. BINKSTER chased the pace and was four to five wide on the turn and was empty.

DOLLARIZATION was well placed early on the inside, then made a bid between rivals nearing the quarter pole, then slowly edged clear to prove3 best
under a drive. UNCLE BUDDY set the pace and then dueled for the lead on the inside leaving the turn, stayed on gamely but was out kicked by the winner,
second best. TRIBAL NOTION chased the pace and was four wide on the turn, shifted in by the three sixteenths marker and then was up for the show
award. JUMPMASTER tracked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the lane, lost show award late. BEYOND THE BEND
was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from between rivals, then checked in tight by the three eighths marker, swung out four wide leaving the turn, then
shifted back in and was empty. The jockey on BEYOND THE BEND claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference around the three eighths
marker, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the foul was disallowed and the race left as is.
