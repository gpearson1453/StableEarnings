Footnotes
RELEASE THE GENIE stalked the pace of BIKINILESS while racing five-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied and
drew clear through the final yards. BIKINILESS set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, vied
but could not match stride late. MARKED BY A STORM settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, could not gain on the top pair in the
drive but finished with a steady bid. I GET STORMED lacked early speed, angled out sharply nearing the five-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. REBEL
RYETTE pressed the pace from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened after going a half. ALSONO'S HUNTER raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. I FORGOTTOREMEMBER pressed the pace from the inside for a half and
weakened. MISSY MIA was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. TRAVELIN LADY lacked early foot, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

YOU while racing three-wide, offered a bid in tandem with the winner in mid-stretch and gave way in the drive. JEDI WARRIOR was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a belated bid. LUCKY WITH YOU set a pressured pace from off
the rail and gave way through the final furlong. PASSED BY PAUL raced off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
GUNNERS ONE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE TIME'S RIGHT raced off the pacesetters early, moved
