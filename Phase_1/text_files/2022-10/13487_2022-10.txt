Footnotes
TWO COLOR MAP took control early, opened a huge advantage near the quarter pole and lasted tiring. SOCIAL JOE saved ground far back then finished
well to earn the place. DUBROVNIK saved ground then narrowed the gap while no serious threat. KANE chased off the pace, made a brief bid on the turn
then flattened out. SIR CUPID raced off the pace, moved very wide on the final turn. RENEE'S Z VA raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then gave
way. SETTE STELLE dropped back early and was never in contention. GO SKIPPY GO lagged far behind then passed fading rival. OSABA stopped
abruptly and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
GENGHIS stalked the pace outside then wore down the pacesetter through the final furlong. POINTER led narrowly inside rivals, shook clear on the turn
and yielded in the stretch. WHAT'S TO BLAME lacked speed, advanced inside on the turn then angled out rallying. AHSAD chased inside the pacesetters
and made a gradual late gain. THE RIGHT PATH dropped back outside, raced very wide with a mild late bid. BOURBON MISSION was urged within range
to the stretch then weakened. HORSE GREEDY chased far behind and was never a factor. MAGNETRON trailed to the stretch then caught a stopping rival.
COMPOUND IT forced the pace to the turn then gave way readily.

SHOOGER RAY TOO settled inside, rallied on the final turn, angled out in the stretch collared the pacesetters and drew off. TAX prompted the pace
outside, led briefly in the stretch and continued gamely for the place. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST set a measured pace inside, engaged in a long duel then
weakened. UNDERCOVER KITTY stalked the dueling leaders three wide then proved empty in the stretch. MT SURIBACHI hustled off the pace wide and
was finished after half a mile. GLACIER EXPRESS lagged far behind and was never in contention. FACTUM LOVE STYLE trailed throughout losing contact
with his field.

Footnotes
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON sprinted clear in the opening furlong, repelled a challenge on the turn then drew off under moderate urging. FIVE DREAMS
saved ground close up, bid into the stretch and continued willingly to easily gain the place. JALEN JOURNEY dropped far behind, moved outside on the turn
and closed well wide. BEREN broke slowest, rushed to contention, bid midway on the turn then faded. VIOLENT TURBULENCE lacked speed wide, faltered
on the turn then came again mildly. MACH TRIAL dropped far behind then caught fading pair in the stretch. GET THE W hustled just off the pace outside
and faltered. REPO ROCKS raced wide off the leaders and stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
OXANA set a pressured pace inside, shook loose from several rivals was in midstretch, stayed safe and held on. DR B raced in traffic into the far turn, split
rivals into the stretch and closed with a rush too late. FILLE D'ESPRIT forced the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. KALYPSO broke slowest,
rushed to contention then proved empty in the stretch. SHERO prompted the pace four wide to the stretch and faltered. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE moved
extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch and was no factor. CHUB WAGON dueled three wide between rivals, stopped abruptly in the stretch, was
eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS JONES ducked out at the start, stalked three wide, took over at the quarter pole and rallied. ANGELI BLU raced well behind, split foes into
the stretch and closed well. HE'SSOSUBTLE saved ground close up, faded briefly on the final turn then came again for show. TRUE DAKOTAN lacked
speed outside, moved very wide into the stretch. PORSUPUESTO hustled to a clear advantage, was collared after three quarters and faltered. LUDO
chased four wide, moved closer before half a mile then faded. TEMPESTUOUS prompted the pacesetter, vied between rivals on the final turn and stopped.
PRINCE CHAMP soundly bumped at the start, raced far back, lost contact and was eased.
