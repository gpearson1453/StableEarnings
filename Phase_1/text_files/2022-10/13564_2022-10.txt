Footnotes
MORNING CUP set the pace inside of a pressing rival, met another foe's bid turning for home, shook free of that foe in upper stretch, and held sway safely.
PINE VALLEY received a substantial bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, loomed a danger three wide into the turn, took aim outside of
the leader turning for home, ranged up nearing the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, then chased that foe home to prove second best. YOU
MAKE ME HAPPY laid forwardly placed two wide and between horses, backed out from among those rivals nearing the turn, tipped outside of them and to
the four path at the three furlong pole, ranged up outside of the leading pair nearing the lane, but only managed to chase them through the stretch. CROW'S
NEST broke a step slowly, laid at the rear along the inside, swung out to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on outside of rivals. BOURBON ON FIRE
lunged out and squarely bumped a foe at the start, then was put to crowded quarters by that rival soon after, laid off of the pace, was lightly coaxed along in
the four to five path around the turn, then lacked a bid through the lane. BEYBLADER laid at the rear two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but
lacked a rally. CELLULOID HERO tugged to an inside stalking position early on, but weakened turning for home. ROAN FOR THE ROSE prompted the
pace three wide, engaged the leader two wide and between horses into the turn, but was outmoved by his outer counterpart leaving the three furlong pole,
and yielded turning for home.

Footnotes
JERSEY PEARL pressed two wide, ranged up to the leader turning for home, bid entering the lane before being floated three wide by that foe, then gained
an advantage at the furlong grounds as an inner ADIVA produced a bid, and edged clear of that rival through the late stages. ADIVA tracked three wide,
tucked to the rail behind the leaders at the three furlong pole, forged through a rail opening in upper stretch after the leader vacated it, produced a bid inside
of a newly leading JERSEY PEARL at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay by that rival through the late stages. AFFIRMATIVE LADY was brushed by
an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, raced far back in the four path around the turn, then rallied between horses in midstretch, and sustained her
charge to reach show late. INVENTING ANNA set the pace, felt pressure from a pair of outer foes turning for home, drifted out a path entering the lane as
an outer JERSEY PEARL and an inner ADIVA took aim, then weakened between those foes at the furlong grounds. ALEXA LOU was very fractious and
tossed her rider while in the gate, needed to be backed out and cleared by the veterinarian before reloading, then lacked speed along the inside, tipped to
the four path in upper stretch, and improved. STAY FABULOUS laid in midpack two wide, but got keen behind kick-back and failed to keep pace with the
leading group nearing the turn, chased along the inside around the bend, and tied. HUMBLING was brushed by an inner foe at the start, stalked four to
three wide into the turn, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. WORK OF FICTION laid off of the pace in
the two path and never got involved. FAME STREET was outrun in the three path. CALIFORNIA BELLE was being corrected by the assistant starter when
the gates sprung, hopped into the inner part of the gate at the start, then lagged well behind the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
FEELING HAPPY stalked four wide, then three wide into the turn, ranged up turning for home bid bid entering the lane and kicked away approaching the
final furlong. BIG JAVA stalked three wide, came under a drive while tucking two wide into the turn as an outer FEELING HAPPY moved alongside, failed to
match bidding strides with that foe entering the lane, then kept on, and gained place entering the final sixteenth. DIVINE HOPE chased the leading trio from
the two path while under steady urging around the turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show late. BAYSHORE FOXES set
the pace, led from a pair of pressers turning for home, but was headed entering the lane, and gave way. SOCIAL MANDATE bumped an outer foe at the
start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SWEET BEAUTY trailed around the turn and never got involved. MRS. NUSHI chased two wide and
from between horses, was asked for run in midpack in the three path around the turn, but weakened through the lane while hanging on her left lead.
JUMAKAN BOURBON broke a step slowly while being bumped by an inner rival, took the turn in the four path while void of early speed, and tired.

Footnotes
HURRICANE J dueled for the lead inside of TAP IN FORMATION, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, drew away shortly after, and held sway via
driving pressure through the late stages. PROVE RIGHT trailed, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied to gain place approaching the final sixteenth.
WESTERN GHENT tracked four wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, and kept on to gain show shortly after. TAP IN
FORMATION took a bump from an outer rival after breaking half a beat slowly, recovered to duel for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, and weakened. JEREMY'S JET bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed the embattled leading pair from the outside, but
yielded entering the lane, and tired between horses in the final furlong. GOLD LUCK tracked along the inside, inched closer behind the leaders turning for
home, but failed to sustain a bid, and faded through the final furlong.

EMBRACE rated off of the pace four wide, took the turn in the five path, steadily picked up stride while shifting to the nine path and outside of the leading
group in midstretch, then offered a good late kick to reel in the embattled leading pair nearing the wire. BEN DIESEL pressed the leading trio from the five
path around the turn, vied with GULFSTREAM WAY entering the final furlong, sparred with that foe as a pair of outer rivals closed in in the late stages, and
got outkicked in the shadow of the wire before prevailing over his inner counterpart for place. GULFSTREAM WAY vied three wide and between horses
while taking the turn in the four path, disposed of inner rivals in upper stretch as an outer BEN DIESEL persisted as a danger, battled with that bidding foe
through the final furlong, tenaciously clung to an advantage entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished late and lost the place duel via a desperate
photo. SEAL BEACH laid off of the pace three wide, swung to the eight path entering the lane, rallied with a steady, yet grinding, charge as an outer
EMBRACE rallied alongside in the final furlong, ranged up to the top pair in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by his outer oncharging counterpart, and
hung for minor placings. OSBOURNE tracked in midpack five wide and outside of foes, tipped to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked a true kick to
produce a bid, and was outkicked by outer rivals in the late stages. BUTTON BOY tracked in the two to three path around the turn, shifted to the six path
entering the lane whilst inside of OSBOURNE, but lacked a kick between rivals. HIPPODROME laid off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the three
path, then chased behind the leaders without menacing. ST ANDREWS steadied out of tight quarters among rivals early on, raced far back along the inside
while a bit off of the rail, and made little impact. CARAMELITO tracked along the inside, faded turning for home, altered course three wide in midstretch, and
surpassed tiring rivals. IMPLEMENTATION rushed to set a sternly pressured pace inside of a trio of hounding foes, then weakened in upper stretch. ZAP
MOTION vied for the lead two wide and between horses while taking the turn in the three path, and weakened in upper stretch. MALIBU MIKE trailed in the
four path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAL set the pace while well in hand in the two path as an outer GEAR JOCKEY pursued, drifted to the four path entering the lane to float that foe
wider, swiftly shook free of that foe once straightened, responded readily to a right handed shoulder tap in upper stretch causing him to quickly spurt away,
then held sway safely from a host of chasers through the final furlong. OCEANIC settled off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch,
picked up stride while tipping to the eight path and outside of rivals approaching midstretch, then offered a good late kick to reach place at the wire.
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS stalked two wide before tucking behind the leading pair at the three furlong pole, bid for place inside of GEAR JOCKEY in upper
stretch after the leader kicked away, sparred for that position while hanging on his left lead, changed leads and edged away from his outer counterpart
entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed for place by an outer oncharging foe at the wire. BAD BEAT BRIAN bobbled at the start while still breaking
towards the front, tracked along the inside, chased from the four path in upper stretch, tipped to the six path and outside of the place-dueling pair in
midstretch, then stayed on, but was outkicked late, and reached a dead-heat for fourth at the wire. GEAR JOCKEY pressed the eventual winner from the
outside while kept in the three path by that rival around the turn, got floated to the five path while failing to keep pace entering the lane, dueled with an inner
rival for place thereafter, but weakened between horses in the late stages. CHARCOAL laid off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. ALL IN SYNC
trailed, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to factor. COUNTY FINAL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CADAMOSTO (IRE) tracked in
midpack three to two wide, and yielded between horses entering the lane.

SLAMMED set the pace inside of a pressing HAPPY SOUL, then drew off entering the lane, widened under moderate hand urging, and was put to wraps in
the late stages. HAPPY SOUL broke out, pressed the pace setter from the outside, but quickly failed ot keep pace entering the lane, gave way while
hanging on her left lead through midstretch, changed over while meeting JOYFUL CADENCE's bid for place a sixteenth from home, and fended that foe off
to the wire. JOYFUL CADENCE stalked three wide, chased while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but hung. LI'L
TOOTSIE tracked three to four wide, yet refused repeated rider encouragement to change leads through the lane, and lacked a rally. CLUB CAR laid off of
the pace along the inside while a bit off of the rail, and failed to factor. SCONSIN laid off of the pace in the four to five path, then lacked a rally while hanging
on her left lead through the lane. LIBERTY M D trailed three wide, came into the lane in the five path, and made little impact. PALM COTTAGE stalked
along the inside, but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
IN ITALIAN (GB) bobbled a bit at the start while still breaking with the field, moved to the fore in the early going, built a clear margin into the first turn,
managed her loose lead in the two path down the backstretch, inched away from chasing foes in upper stretch, and held stoutly from her pursuing
stablemate through the late stages. REGAL GLORY tracked in the two path, then in the three path around the far turn before tipping to the four path and
outside of the main group entering the lane, rallied to take aim on her clear stablemate in the final furlong, but failed to threaten that foe late while proving
second bet. PRINCESS GRACE rated off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the three path in upper stretch while chasing, stayed on in pursuit of a tiring
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) for show in the late stages, and reeled in that rival at the wire. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) stalked outside of the pace
setter while in the three path, failed to apply pressure to her leading stablemate down the backstretch, inched closer to that foe turning for home in hopes of
producing a bid, but failed to sustain that charge, yielded between horses in upper stretch, gave way through the final furlong, and was caught at the wire for
show. MARKET RUMOR was outrun. VIGILANTES WAY stalked inside, but faded in midstretch.

Footnotes
FORTE tracked along the inside while in the two path, tipped four wide into the far turn, steadily inched closer under strong urging turning for home to bid for
the lead outside of LOGGINS entering the lane, sparked a duel in the process, forged a very narrow margin while shifting in to spar with his inner
counterpart, brushed that foe while putting him to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole, then was corrected from leaning on that rival leaving that station, and
held. LOGGINS vied for the lead inside of pair of vying rivals, led into the far turn, inched clear with five sixteenths to got, dug in to resist FORTE's bid
entering the lane, fought on after getting headed in upper stretch, battled gamely while being put to tight quarters by that foe in the final furlong, took a brush
at the sixteenth pole, then tenaciously sustained the war through the late stages, but just missed. RED ROUTE ONE rated far back two wide, gained four
wide around the far turn, shifted inwardly nearing the lane and put LOST ARK to tight quarters in the process, then sustained a rail rally through the final
furlong to reach show at the wire. INSTANT COFFEE laid off of the pace along the inside, gained in the four path and between horses around the far turn,
sustained his rally to bid for show in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an inner rival for that position. NEWGATE vied three wide, chased a leading
LOGGINS around the far turn, then was outkicked for place entering the lane, and gave way. LOST ARK was bumped and pinched back between horses in
the early stages, raced far back along the inside, got outmoved by an outer rival while tipping three wide nearing the lane, then checked when put to tight
quarters entering it before rallying willingly between horses. TWO PHIL'S was brushed four to five wide around the first turn, chased the main group from the
three path around the far turn, and tired. HONED trailed, altered course four wide turning for home, and stayed on. FUNTASTIC AGAIN raced off of the
pace in the three to five paths, and failed to factor. FROSTED DEPARTURE stalked along the inside, chased from the rail around the far turn, but folded in
upper stretch. POWERFUL broke a step slowly and never got involved while three wide. BOURBON BASH vied for the lead two wide and between horse,
but wilted with five sixteenths to go. CARMEL ROAD stalked five to four wide around the first turn, but weakened nearing the far turn, then eased through
the final furlong. GOOD HEART tracked three to two wide, but faded along the inside of CARMEL ROAD around the far turn, and was eased through the
lane. THE RIDER OF LOGGINS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FORTE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, BUT THE
OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

ANNAPOLIS stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clear leader while inside of rivals in upper stretch, kicked on to bid at the furlong grounds, gained
an advantage leaving that juncture, drove clear soon after, and held sway safely from a host of pursuers late. IVAR (BRZ) settled off of the pace three to two
wide around the first turn, swung from the three path to the six path in upper stretch, floated further out in midstretch before producing a good late kick in the
final furlong, bid for place among rivals nearing the wire, and just reached that position. ORDER OF AUSTRALIA (IRE) broke slowly but avoided trouble by
doing so, tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn before tipping four wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase a
bidding ANNAPOLIS through midstretch, gained place entering the final sixteenth, but was caught on the wire by an outer foe for that position. SET PIECE
(GB) trailed along the inside, altered course to the eight path in midstretch to be outside of the leading group, changed leads while rallying well through the
final furlong, but missed reaching place. CASA CREED tracked in midpack three to four wide, inched closer five wide in upper stretch, but leveled off
between horses in the final sixteenth. MASEN (GB) set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin entering the backstretch, managed a loose lead into
the far turn, but was headed by a bidding rival at the furlong grounds, and weakened. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke out and bumped a foe at the start,
tracked two wide, tucked after failing to match strides with an inner rival nearing the lane, and lacked a bidq. ATONE stalked two wide, then chased the
leader in upper stretch before yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. SANTIN was void of early speed in the three to two path around the first turn,
swung to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to rally. GRAY'S FABLE was sandwiched between horses soon after the start, raced far back in the
two to three paths, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and never got involved. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN tracked three wide, but faded between
horses entering the lane.

CALL ME FAST stalked four wide, bid for the lead outside of CAPE TRAFALGAR while in the three path at the three furlong pole, assumed command
turning for home, and drew off. CAPE TRAFALGAR set the pace three to two wide, but proved no match for an outer bidder turning for home, gave way, yet
held place. ANDY CANT laid off of the pace along the inside, then gained show from outer foes in upper stretch. REWIRE stumbled badly and fell to his face
at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to menace. OLD POINT lagged behind, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on
willingly. NASHOBA'S JOY chased in midpack three wide, was driven in the four path around the turn, but lacked a response, and tired. VERITABLE
chased from the two to three path, and tired between horses. PERUVIAN LUCKY failed to factor. MONJID vied along the inside, but weakened at the three
furlong pole.
