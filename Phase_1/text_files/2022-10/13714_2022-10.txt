Footnotes
MAGIC IN ME stalked from the three path the first turn, took aim leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran down Miss Corey to take over two deep just
inside the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was kept alert through the stretch. GOSSIPING rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the
three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, took second a furlong away and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MISS
COREY stalked two deep on the first turn and took the lead nearing the half mile pole, was pressured at the three eighths, gave up the lead past the quarter
and flattened in the lane. MOONLIGHT MISS saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and
could only improve her position in the four path of the far turn. AWESOME INCENTIVE rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. RAVIOLI MAMA came through the first turn in the four path, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then weakened. After running loose in the post parade, FEEL THE GLORY took the
lead inside nearing the three quarter pole and set the early pace, but was caught toward the half mile pole and faded through the backstretch.

mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on. CHINA CAT saved ground close to the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on
the far turn and came between horses past the sixteenth pole to duel for second. LADY MACHO became a bit anxious in the gate and was steadied shortly
after the start, settled close in the three path of the opening turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came
along to take third later yards. MISS WILD rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail
on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. MARKETABILITY rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn outside,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride. TALKTHETALK bobbled at the break and rounded the first
