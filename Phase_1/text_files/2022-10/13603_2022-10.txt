Footnotes
OUR SOUTHERN GIRL pressed the pace of RATIONAL D' ORO while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
drew off through the lane with complete authority. OUR SOARING ANGEL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn,
reached a striking position into the lane but failed to gain on the winner in the drive. BYE BYE JILL was off a step slow then was forwardly placed from the
inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. RATIONAL D'ORO set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half. MARILYN
MONEYROLL raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally.

NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN stalked the pace of REMEMBER SIXTYTWO while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened
a clear margin and held off the closing SMARTSREALGOOD to prevail. SMARTSREALGOOD was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out
with a furlong to run and was gaining on the winner late. REMEMBER SIXTYTWO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way
after going a half. CLUE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. DANJERUS STORM lacked early speed, raced
between rivals through the back-stretch, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SLEEPY EYES reared at the start and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
KIRBY DERBY pressed the pace of CANYON DEL ORO while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and was
taken on by BARBIERE with a furlong to run, vied with that foe and gamely held to the wire. BARBIERE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside,
angled out approaching the stretch, reached the winner with a furlong to run but could not get by that foe in the drive. CANYON DEL ORO sprinted clear at
once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and gave way through the final
furlong. GATLING GOLD was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. CEBOLLA raced four-wide through both
turns, lacked early foot and did not menace. HIT A NOTE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. ATTILA'S
FLAG was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
ATTILA THE STAR stalked the pace of the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down BITTEN in the closing
yards. BITTEN set a pressured pace while racing five-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and gave way grudgingly to the winner late.
WHO'S ON THE RUN settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. NO HUDDLE pressed the pace of
BITTEN while being carried six-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. EIGHT MAKAR showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the lane and passed tiring foes late. TAB ME OUT was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
GOBLIN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. WHISKEY THERAPY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
AXEL STEEL disputed the pace from between foes, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off through the final yards. BIG EVENT lagged
early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) chased the leaders
while racing five-wide and gave way gradually in the drive. SILVER KID pressed the pace from between rivals while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a
bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way in the drive. MIDNIGHT SPLIT was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually gave way.
BLUEGRASS FAITH settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. BAYRON raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. CAUCUS RULES raced off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and did not
menace. RUNNINGINTHERAIN showed brief speed from the inside and weakened. TRY TO CAPTURE pressed the pace from between foes, moved
four-wide through the turn and weakened.
