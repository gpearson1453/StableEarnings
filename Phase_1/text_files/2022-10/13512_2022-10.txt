CAPE HEDGE stalked the pace three wide, took over midway on the final turn and drew off under mild pressure. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then
offered some late energy to gain the place. VICTORY IS OURS set a pressured pace inside to the final turn and faltered. CURLIN LANE prompted the
leader for five furlongs and gave way readily. AYE chased off the pace wide and stopped abruptly.

COLD WALKER eased back to the outside early, moved swiftly to the front midway on the turn and pulled away driving then coasted home late. LATE CALL
settled near the inside, advanced on the turn and was easily second best. DOCTOR DOOM chased three wide, was asked for run on the turn then proved
empty. ENFORCER set a clear pace inside, was collared near the five sixteenths pole and faltered. VERBIER raced four wide down the backstretch and
lacked a response. DRUNKEN BRIDGE no factor from the outset, moved inside on the turn and lacked a bid. STRAWBERRY CONE chased extremely
wide in the opening quarter and gave way.

BURANO controlled the pace inside, repelled a challenge near midstretch and edged away again in the final furlong. IRIE EMPRESS saved ground close up
to the stretch, angled out, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. SEAHORSE D'ORO chased wide down the backstretch, made a brief bid on the
final turn and faded. KISSES FOR EMILY stalked the winner outside and began fading on the final turn. POOR NO MORE dropped back after the start and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MISS PEPPINA forced the pace outside, took over at the three eighths pole and stayed clear while kept to a drive. CHARITY STRIPE settled at the back of
the field, advanced inside, angled out on the final turn and rallied. LEAN ON E chased off the pace wide, made a brief bid on the final turn then weakened.
LULA'S ROADRUNNER lacked speed, moved very wide on the final turn then flattened out. SUMMARY JUDGMENT stalked the dueling leaders and began
retreating on the final turn. JULIET'S MUSIC hustled to the front inside and stopped after half a mile.
