Footnotes
LARK settled at the rear inside, continued patiently into the back straight, took closer order approaching the far turn while still at the rear of the field, rallied
inside past the three eighths, tipped two wide under a drive in upper stretch, battled outside of STORM'S REFLECTION and wore that foe down in the end.
STORM'S REFLECTION was a bit keen early, set the pace while clear through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was briefly engaged by
GLASSATO to his outside into the turn, cleared in the two path again, carried the lead into the lane, kept on under a drive as LARK bore down outside of
him, kept on gamely but was just caught in the end. KING ZION chased the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, raced between horses in the tracking
flight down the backstretch and edged closer to STORM'S REFLECTION, tracked three wide around the far turn, proved no match for the top two in upper
stretch and chased on mildly as best of the rest. OPTION broke awkwardly and took back hard, raced two wide in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn,
began to inch forward two wide near the seven eighths, joined the tracking flight three wide into the back straight, raced four wide in range around the far
turn, and weakened in the lane. GLASSATO tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, raced at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch
while edging closer to the leader, bid outside of STORM'S REFLECTION into the far turn but was soon rebuffed, began to fade two wide past the three
eighths, continued to weaken in the lane and was eased late.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE IRONY was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn
advancing to challenge between foes and wrested the advantage at the wire under firm handling. LORING PARK tracked off the first flight along the inside
to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch advancing to challenge, gained a narrow advantage late and contested the issue grudgingly to the
wire. RAVE ON sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled inside foes past midstretch but yielded to
the top pair late. DELFT BLUE tracked off the second flight outside foes, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly in late stages.
COMING UP ACES settled well off the pace to the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. TWO
COOKIE RULE, forwardly placed three wide in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but quickly came up empty.
MON AMI FUZZIE settled last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. SOUPER FORTUNE, forwardly placed between foes racing to the backstretch,
angled inside after a half while being eased off the pacesetter and soon gave way. BETTER THINK TWICE made brief pursuit of the leaders outside foes to
the first turn and gave way early.

Footnotes
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS chased outside of KNIEVEL early, tracked outside of that foe into the back straight, was relegated to the back of a compact field
near the five eighths as FEEDING FRENZY inched forward, made a four-wide circling run into the far turn, led near the three eighths, drifted out in upper
stretch but never relinquished the lead, and edged further clear in the final furlong. KNIEVEL chased inside of ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS around the
clubhouse turn, tracked the leading line in the pocket down the backstretch, was joined inside by FEEDING FRENZY past the five eighths, raced between
horses into the far turn and was urged near the three eighths, kept on inside of ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, briefly loomed midstretch but proved second
best. FEEDING FRENZY popped open the gate before the race but was held in place by the gate crew, was bumped by COPPER CROSSING in the
opening strides, settled at the rear of a compact field early, began to inch forward near the five eighths inside, chased along the rail around the bend, and
chased on mildly for show. FUTURE VISION set a pressured pace inside, cleared briefly into the far turn, set the pace in the two path until being headed by
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS near the three eighths, attended inside the new leader from there, was driven inside in upper stretch and flattened.
EGOMANIAC attended the pace outside of FUTURE VISION, continued to attend between horses down the back straight, raced three wide between horses
in the tracking flight into the far turn, flattened in the two path around that bend and was no further threat in the lane. COPPER CROSSING broke outward,
raced three wide into the clubhouse turn, advanced to join the leading flight three wide past the seven eighths, attended the pace three wide down the
backstretch and four wide into the second, flattened out in the three to four path around the far turn and continued to fade in the lane.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER was rated off the second flight racing into the turn, angled five wide midstretch and produced a solid late response to wrest a narrow
advantage in time under firm handling. IAN GLASS tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to
bid for command between foes in late stages but couldn't match the winner while sharing the place honors on the wire. RACE DRIVER tracked off the first
flight outside IAN GLASS racing into the turn, was fanned four wide in the stretch while being prompted to advance but was outkicked by the winner while
finishing on even terms with a rival for second. SMOKIN RICHIE sped sharply to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command on the turn into
upper stretch while briefly gaining a narrow advantage but weakened late. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE), off last, was urged to terms prompting the
pacesetter into the turn, dueled to midstretch and gave way in late stages. THE CONNECTOR settled along the inside in early stages, saved ground to
upper stretch but lacked a closing bid. GRAY ATTEMPT was settled last in early stages, was urged to advance between foes nearing the turn, checked off
rivals approaching the three furlong marker, then bore out on the turn while losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
JACK VAN BERG raced three wide with the leading line early, pressed outside of BOOM FIVE THOUSAND past the five eighths, took a narrow lead
approaching the half mile mark, opened up in the two to three path on the turn, carried a clear lead into the lane, and kept on well clear under a drive from
midstretch. FIRERY TALE settled toward the rear, began improving while saving ground around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, sustained his rally
and got up for place. DARK HEDGES chased the leading line early, was joined by AWESOME FAMILY and TALE OF THE NILE past the five eighths,
chased the leading pair in the four path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the leader, chased on but lost the place late.
AWESOME FAMILY raced between horses with the leading line early, settled back to track the leading pair near the five eighths, chased between horses in
the five path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, and chased on evenly in the lane. TALE OF THE NILE raced four wide with the leading line
early, settled back to track the leading pair past the five eighths, chased in the six path on the turn, briefly angled in approaching the quarter but angled back
out six wide into the lane, and ultimately lacked the needed kick. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND was sent for speed inside, disputed the pace inside of JACK
VAN BERG until being headed approaching the half, tracked in the three path on the turn, and flattened out between horses from upper stretch. DOM
CAETANO (ARG) settled back well behind the main group, drifted out in upper stretch and did not rally. DR. FORMAN was unprepared at the start, broke
awkwardly, trailed, and never regained touch with the field.

Footnotes
SIMPLE LOGIC was firmly rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, continued inside foes pulling a bit awaiting an opening nearing
upper stretch, tipped out entering the lane, then surged inside POWER THROUGH to gain even terms with that foe on the wire to share the win under firm
handling. The latter broke readily, raced in touch attending a rival's pace under light reserve to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn, edged
clear midstretch, then drifted out in late stages but held grudgingly to the end to finish on even terms for the win. VITALE tracked off the first flight along the
inside from the outset to the far turn and continued evenly in late stages to prevail for a share. TUFF ATTACK was urged setting the pace along the inside
from the outset to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. EMPTY HOLSTER tracked off the second flight
between foes to the far turn and continued evenly in late stages while gaining some position. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN hesitated at the start, was settled
along the inside racing to the far turn, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and gained some position while making no real impression.
KINGSBURRY ATTACK angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the leaders between foes racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the
lane. SUPRISE CAT tracked off the second flight outside foes, was caught four wide racing through the far turn and offered no rally. BUREAU settled in the
last flight racing off the inside to the backstretch and offered no rally. DEORA STORE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight for six furlong and gave
way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MACHINEGUNPREACHER was bumped by THE BLACK STRAT in the opening strides, settled at the rear, edged closer down the back straight, took
closer order in the five path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied, struck the front midstretch and cleared driving. SEMINOLE BEACH tracked
the pace outside of THE BLACK STRAT early, bid in tandem with that foe into the far turn, vied three wide around that bend, poked his head in front near
the five sixteenths, continued to vie in upper stretch, was outkicked into the final furlong, chased on willingly and came back for the place. PINEDALE settled
near the rear inside, continued at the inside of the rear flight in the two path on the far turn, was driven up the inside in upper stretch, rallied, loomed
midstretch but was outkicked by MACHINEGUNPREACHER, brushed with CO CONSPIRATOR, chased on but just missed the place. CO CONSPIRATOR
set the pace inside, was engaged by THE BLACK STRAT and SEMINOLE BEACH into the far turn, vied with them into the bend, was headed near the five
sixteenths but continued to battle between horses into the lane, brushed with PINEDALE midstretch and flattened out late. JUSTICE ONCE raced two wide
near the rear around the clubhouse turn, raced between horses in the rear flight past the five eighths, continued toward the rear in the three path on the far
turn, came three wide into the lane and then drifted a bit further out, and chased on mildly. AHEADOFTHEGAME raced three wide into the clubhouse turn,
chased midfield, improved mildly in the five path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane, chased on but was ultimately outfinished. ZARMAE
raced three wide near the rear, was a bit keen to midfield past the five eighths, was pushed along while saving ground on the far turn and emptied out in the
lane. THE BLACK STRAT was bumped by JUSTICE ONCE in the opening strides and bumped into MACHINEGUNPREACHER as a result, tracked inside
early, tracked the leader inside of SEMINOLE BEACH down the back straight, bid into the second turn and vied between horses in the three path, and but
emptied out from upper stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET CONFUSION broke slowly, was switched well outside in the opening stages while being prompted to contention, steadily advanced four wide into
the bend and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage from COOKIN ROSES in time under firm handling. The latter broke sharply, forced the
pace outside a rival in the three path racing to the bend, went clear nearing upper stretch, held sway to late stages but couldn't fend off the winner.
COUGER tracked the leaders three deep between foes dropping off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch and
continued willingly late to close the gap on the top pair. RANK AND FILE tracked off the second flight four wide on the backstretch, dropped back entering
the turn, then made some belated progress outside foes. FLYING BUSINESS tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight, advanced in that
path to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but flattened out midstretch. INDAWIN, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages while dropping out
last, angled to the eight path in upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. FIRST SQUADRON, forwardly placed between
rivals stalking just off the first flight racing to the turn, continued between foes to the lane, shifted in entering the stretch and steadily faded. QUEEN'S
MISSION was urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way after a half. GODSGIFT tracked off the first flight inside foes
racing to the turn but faded early.
