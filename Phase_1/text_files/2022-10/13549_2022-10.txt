Footnotes
TICKLE HER TOE settled in mid pack three wide down the backstretch, circled foes travelling four wide to bid at the quarter pole, battled outside through
the stretch and began to inch away late for the victory. CREEMORE tracked between rivals at the half, engaged for the lead with runners on either side two
furlongs out, dueled through the lane for the top spot and gave way way grudgingly the last sixteenth. TIZ BIZNESS was away alertly to lead, continued to
set the pace on the turn, was headed outside by the top two finishers at the quarter pole, could not quicken with the outside challengers in upper stretch but
held on gamely for the show money. CALL ME BROOKE travelled in mid pack between foes early on, waited behind a wall of contesting frontrunners two
furlongs out, roused when had a clear path at the top of the lane and showed some late energy to just miss for the show award. TOTALLY IN CHARGE
broke in at the start and was slow into stride, trailed the field entering the stretch and angled out widest turning for home to offer a good finish while running
a bit green to the wire. HONEYS DIAMOND stalked in mid pack on the rail through the turn, was ridden inside to keep up at the quarter pole marker and
little response was given for the stretch run. ASHWICKEN rated near the back of the pack in the beginning, took closer order to be in range at the top of the
stretch while angling out to the six path and offered little for the drive to the finish line. SUSPICIOUS pressed the pace on the rail throughout the turn, began
to weaken inside in upper stretch and retreated on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
A GAL FOR T J bumped with the inner then outer then again with the inner rival at the start, switched out heading up the backstretch, advanced five wide on
the turn, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, kicked clear and held safe. ASHLEE'S RING chased inside, came out about the quarter pole entering the
top of the stretch three wide then tipping out further, secured the place while no real threat to the winner. FERDA settled off the pace, switched off the
inside, was three wide at the quarter pole, ran on to get up for show honors. CHROME'S ANGEL bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace two to
three wide, took the lead at the quarter pole, was overtaken in upper stretch and had no extra late while losing a placing. SEATTLE TRUST shifted in early,
went three wide on the turn racing off the pace, asked for more midway on that bend, angled seven wide into upper stretch and ran on. DIOSA CATRINA
chased from outside, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally. CELTIC REVIVAL exchanged a couple bumps at the start but recovered to set the pace
inside facing outside pressure, came up empty. FLAT OUT ANGEL was ridden from the start but lacking speed, swung eight wide into the stretch and was
never near enough to threaten. ONE LAST FLING chased three wide between rivals into the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
COLTONS DREAM set all the fractions up front on the rail, put away the early pace contenders through the turn, braced for the outside challenge at the top
of the stretch and determinedly held on in the last eighth to earn a hard fought victory. PRINCE SUSSEX was taken back off the contesting pace trio
entering the turn, quickly advanced around runners to bid at the top of the stretch in the five path and was gaining steadily until mid stretch while on the
wrong lead through to the wire. DROP A CARIBOU tracked inside just behind the dueling front trio with three eighths remaining, was asked to go forward
midway on the turn and finished up well enough to be a distant third while besting of the rest. BULLET SPEED pressed the pace between horses on the
turn, was in the mix at the top of the stretch but could not find another gear for the drive and faded late to lose the show award near the line. TWICE AS
SMART tracked on the rail mid field running on the turn, was roused while angling out for the drive in the five path and could only offer an even finish
through the stretch. UNSPEAKABLE was away poorly to trail, could only recover mildly through the turn and passed tiring runners down the lane. RAPID
RELOAD engaged for the front while running three wide on the turn, began to weaken between rivals at the quarter pole and stopped with an eighth left to
run. SPIGETINMTZABALLS settled near the rear down the backside, was encouraged to go on through the turn, had no finish to give at the top of the
stretch and was not a presence in the late stages.

Footnotes
LOADED VIXEN was quickly clear to set the pace racing off the inside, put to urging at the top of the stretch, held sway under steady handling. KNOW
HOW (GB) tracked in behind the aforementioned, switched outside that one at the top of the stretch and chased the winner home without making any
headway. NICOLE'S SONG was a bit fractious behind the gate, advanced outside five wide then was forced wider nearing the quarter pole, came into upper
stretch about eight or nine deep, kept on to get up for show honors. LETS RUN TWO broke inwardly, switched out early up the backstretch bumping and in
turn getting bumped by a rival about the nine-sixteenths, angled out further from three to five wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked for third.
NORTHERN PASSAGE broke inwardly, chased from inside, ran on evenly. CARPE HORSESHOE raced up close outside runners four wide into the turn,
lacked the needed late kick. KHOZZY VALINTINE was away slowly, switched out heading up the backstretch, was bumped into a rival then back into the
first foe about the nine-sixteenths and steadied slightly at that juncture, moved out into the turn then tipped out eleven wide in upper stretch. SNEAKY
REBEL was mid-pack three wide into the turn, lacked room in behind runners five to six deep in the stretch and was not persevered with. CLIFF'S HEAD
exchanged some bumps while outside about the nine-sixteenths racing toward the rear, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. BABY FADE
pursued the pace three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
GALVASTON rated back off the contesting front foursome going into the turn, waited behind the frontrunners at the five sixteenths marker, angled off the
tiring pace leaders in the six path at the quarter pole and rallied to take command at the furlong marker to win going away at the end. WHERE'S NEAL
broke inwards to start, circled the field travelling strongly while five wide at the three eighths pole, took command briefly at the top of the stretch but could
not hold off the late closing challenge from the winner at the furlong marker all the while on the wrong lead through the stretch. HIDDEN HONOR settled
near the rear down the backstretch, weaved his way through traffic inside in upper stretch, found clear running room not until the furlong marker and was
found his best stride late to close well for third. SILENT RISK rated kindly behind the contesting frontrunners into the turn, slipped up the fence at the two
furlong marker and showed some late interest to get up for the minors at the line. SOUPER RUSH battled for the lead inside with multiple runners through
the turn, put away the speed challengers turning for home, dug in gamely but was collared by the outside closers with an eighth to run and wilted in the final
sixteenth. GALWAY WATERS was part of the early speed battle racing three wide on the turn, began to fade between foes at the quarter marker and tired
while drifting in with an eighth to go. LOVE THE GAME was steadied briefly leaving the chute, trailed the pack at the half, angled out widest for the stretch
run and passed fading rivals down the lane. WOOD BE WILD dueled for the lead in the two path for a half, tired while in tight between horses at the quarter
pole and was empty for the drive to the line. DISSECTOLOGIST was squeezed at the start, settled near the back at the half and could not make an
impression running through to the wire. BIG WARDEN contested four wide for the early lead down the backstretch, continued to be the widest frontrunner
through the turn, stopped with two furlongs to go and was not persevered with to the finish.

Footnotes
FOREST BUZZ quickly moved clear to set the pace while switching off the rail, asked in upper stretch and drew off under continued steady urging. GUNGI
stalked from outside, went mostly three wide on the turn, held the place from between runners. SENSING HOLIDAY settled just off the chasing group,
advanced outside those four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to narrowly miss second. STUBBORN STREAK moved forward inside to chase the
winner, kept on inside rivals but was outfinished for the minor awards. ONE MORE RING tracked from between runners, dropped back two to three wide on
the turn when in a bit tight entering that bend, shifted five wide in upper stretch, needed more. UNXPECTED TIGER shifted in racing near but off the rail
mid-pack, came into upper stretch three wide and ran on evenly. MAGIC GAMBLE came in a bit at the break and then in the gap, saved ground before
shifting five wide, was never near enough to threaten. RARE DISCOVERY broke outwardly and then corrected inward when in a bit tight, urged along but
lacking speed, saved ground to no avail. KINZHAL was ridden along racing well off the leader and off the inside, tired.

Footnotes
PRICELESS WILL was between foes mid pack on the turn waiting for clear run, angled out for room in the six path for the drive and found his best stride
late to close well outside to get up at the shadow of the wire. THE GREAT OZ ducked inwards at the gap causing the rider to briefly lose his inside iron,
recovered to trail the field down the backstretch, advanced inside on the turn, waited behind foes on the rail at the top of the lane and finally had clear room
on the fence in mid stretch while full of run to just miss for the win at the wire. SOUPER CLASSY showed early speed to battle up front racing three wide,
took command in upper stretch, fought on stubbornly between rivals until the furlong marker giving away to the closers and held well for third winning the
show photo. MAAKWA put his head in front of the engaging speed trio entering the turn, opened up briefly at the five sixteenths pole, was headed outside
two furlongs from home, battled on until the furlong marker and gave way to the top two finishers in deep stretch. FOUR ACES HIGH waited on the rail for
room behind the frontrunners two furlongs to the wire, had a seam in the three path at the top of the stretch and could not find more to be competitive in
deep stretch. SAIL AT SUNRISE tracked just behind the early pace three eighths remaining, was roused three wide midpoint on the turn, contended four
wide turning for home and stalled at the eighth pole. COMMANDER JOE broke in at the start, settled near the back at the half, was steadied briefly nearing
the quarter pole and was not a factor running to the wire. MAD DOG N JOE was part of the early speed duel with runners on either side, began to weaken
midway on the turn and had nothing left for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
REGAL INTENT was quickly clear to dictate terms shifting nearer inside, faced mild pressure leaving the backstretch, was once again clear turning for home
while coming out a bit, drifted out a bit further but held under steady handling. PRINCE OF THIEVES settled off the pace under light rating, went three to
four wide on the turn, came out eight wide in upper stretch for room, was put to stout urging and gained steadily but too late. POINT TO THE STARS shifted
in late up the backstretch, saved ground on the early part of the turn coming out three wide about the five-sixteenths, angled out further to be six deep past
the quarter pole looking for room, kicked on well but needed more. JUSTIN'S WAY stalked four wide, was in a bit tight near the half and lost some ground,
came out widest to be eleven deep in upper stretch and ran on with moderate late interest. GRAND ALLIANCE angled in early settling well back, moved
nearer the rail late on the turn, ran on to improve position. RACING IN THE RAIN brushed with a rival lightly at the start, chased the leader from off the
inside in the two to three path, angled seven deep turning for home, went evenly in the lane. EXCEED brushed with a foe at the start, was in tight racing in
the two path about the five- and one-half, dropped back a bit, shifted nine wide in upper stretch and ran on. DOCTOR WU brushed with a foe at the break,
raced off the leaders early, came out a few paths from the fence late on the turn, ran on mildly. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ brushed with a foe at the start,
chased early then edged closer to press three wide leaving the backstretch, came up empty. ADELAIDE COURT stalked the pace four wide, faded.
BATTLE OF YORKTOWN raced mid-division five wide into the turn, floated ten wide into the stretch, was never a threat. HALLANVAARA was a bit
awkward into stride and never near enough to threaten. ROMANTIC GAMBLE raced mid-pack three wide into the turn, tired.
