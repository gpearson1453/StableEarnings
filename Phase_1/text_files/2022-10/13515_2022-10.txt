Footnotes
RAYMOND was settled in the early going, raced two wide on the backstretch into the far turn, made a bid three wide in the stretch and proved best in the
end. MISTER K set a pressured pace from the inside, was in a long drive and gamely dug in but held the place safe. IM THE MACHINE was stalking the
pace while inside into the turn, was trying to moved out rivals but was blocked behind the leaders at the quarter pole, was forced to checked off heels then
angled out to be four wide in late stretch and no menace. HEROIC SONG pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive but faltered in
late stretch. BRICK TOWN chased the early pace while three wide into the turn, made a bid then gave way in the stretch drive. ELDON'S SAMURAI was
inside and saving ground on the turn and was no threat. WHO'S BIG DADDY was outrun.

Footnotes
JORDAN had good early speed to set the pace, drew off turning for home and led throughout to be much the best. GRACIE'S KITTEN chased the early
pace while inside, made a bid but was no match for the winner in late stretch. RIOBELLA was saving ground on the turn, rallied then moved out to be two
wide in upper stretch and was no threat in the end. WINEHOUSE was pinched back at the start then settled inside, made a bid and angled out to be four
wide but was no menace. MARY LIZ chased the early pace while two wide, was used up then gave way. GOLD MEMORIES chased the early pace while
three wide, was hard used then gave way. WESTLAND raced four wide on the turn and was no threat. GOTOTHEWINDOW was bumped at the start then
raced three wide on the turn and was no threat. FLASHY GAIL broke out and bumped very hard then was settled, raced two wide on the turn and was
forced steadied behind heels then stopped.
