I'LL FINISH dueled from inside, was roused from the two path into the lane, opened slightly in upper stretch, and held on gamely. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS
stalked from five wide, was cued from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. WHISKEYONHISLIPS pressed from three wide, was coaxed from
the four path into the lane, and hung but held on for show. ACTION DREAM tracked four wide, swung out to the eight path into the lane, but finished evenly.
SOVEREIGN OF SPEED dueled for the lead between foes, but backed up going into the lane, and was one paced. NEGLIGENCE chased from inside but
flattened down the stretch. CAMPTOWN RACES rated from the five path but was never a threat. AUTHENTIC HEART trailed throughout in the four path.

HOPE IN HIM set the pace from inside, was cued from the three path into the the stretch, and held sway. LOST A LEGEND tracked in the three path, was
coaxed from the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. BANKER'S HOURS chased in the four path, was ridden along while swinging out to the six
path into the lane, and kept on for show. CANDENZA had his head turned at the start, raced from wellback in the three path, was short room in upper
stretch, and stayed on. JOYFUL SURPRISE stalked in the two path, was driven from the four path into the lane, but was one paced. WAR FEATHER raced
in midpack from inside, cut the corner going into the lane, but faded. ON JET HEIR stumbled at the start, was unhurried from the three path but was no
factor. LAST SECOND LOUIE trailed into the stretch from the two path and was no threat. TRINNI SUMMER rated from inside but was no menace.

Footnotes
MEHLEK was pinched back at the start, raced off the pace two wide, swung four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed outside and was up near the
sixteenth pole and inched ahead of a stubborn foe. SHANKAR saved ground in midpack, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, took over near the
quarter pole, briefly cleared but was unable to resist the winner near the sixteenth pole. MISTER ABARRIO was bumped at the start, raced two wide in
midpack, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths marker and rallied outside for the show. TUMIGA was bumped on both sides at the start, raced off the
pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. NIKKI NOOTS was bumped after the start, saved ground and never threatened.
GERARD chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. SMOOTH RICO dueled in the four path around the first turn, drew clear nearing the
far turn, set the pace along the rail around the far turn and retreated through the lane. ANTILLEAN failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
ZONAL was soundly bumped after the start, set the early pace in the two path and retreated two wide around the far turn. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY played no
factor while racing three and four wide. GRAND ROCK tracked the pace two wide and was done after a half. BOURBON CLEARANCE was bumped on
both sides and forced to check soon after the start and trailed throughout. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF MISTER ABARRIO AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

HARDSPUN WOMAN rated while two wide, was ridden from the six path into the lane, drifted out throughout the stretch, and drew off late. NOVELERA
raced from wellback in the two path, was roused from the eight path into the stretch, got floated out through the lane, and ran on for place. FIRST GOLD
raced in midfield from the three path, was cued while five wide around the far turn, bid into the stretch, and kept on for show. HOT BODE raced in midpack
inside, was hustled three wide around far turn, but finished evenly. DANCIN DEE tracked in the three path, was coaxed four wide around the far turn, but
flattened lane. MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) stalked in the two path, was cued from three wide rounding the far turn, but was one paced in the stretch. HOTTER
THAN JULY prompted the pace from the four path but faded in the stretch. SEMIRAMIS chased from inside but never threatened. CENTSATIONAL GRACE
was held up from the four path but never factored. BLAME THE VETS dueled for the lead from inside but yielded around the far turn. TWIN CAUSE dueled
from the three path but gave way around the far turn. ATOMIC ROSE trailed throughout from the four path. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION WAS HELD
INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN OF THE TOP TWO FINISHERS ALLEDGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, HARDSPUN WOMAN WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT THROUGH THE STRETCH COSTING NOVELERA A FAIR CHANCE TO GET BY.

Footnotes
HAY HAY PAULA settled off the early pace, edged closer two wide around the turn, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and powered clear under a drive.
CHITIENNE saved ground in range, took the lead inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole and was second best. VELOCE BELLA
set the pace in the two path, yielded in upper stretch and held well enough to preserve the show. TALKIN TIPSY pressed the pace in the three path and
weakened in the drive. THELASTBULLETSMINE failed to menace while racing three wide. AUNT NADINE was in tight and steadied nearing the turn, raced
four wide around the turn and never threatened. THE GREAT KATH tracked the pace four wide and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR prompted the pace from the four path, bid from the three path rounding the turn, opened up from the five path into the lane, and kept
clear. GRAINGER COUNTY stalked in the two path, was coaxed from the seven path into the stretch, and ran on for place. CELESTIAL GLAZE trailed from
the two path early, shifted out to the six path into the turn, was hustled into the lane, and kept on for show. PRIVET MOON led from the two path but faded
going into the stretch. SENSEI LAWRENCE rated from inside but was one paced through the stretch. SPEARGUN tracked from the three path, was ridden
from the five path into the stretch, but was tired. DEL GRIFFITH chased from the four path but was empty going into the lane.

around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, edged ahead leaving the eighth pole and just lasted. SURROGATE raced off the pace four and five
wide, closed outside and just missed. TEPPER stalked the pace four wide around the first turn, edged closer three wide between foes down the backstretch,
bid two wide between around the far turn, led midway around the bend but was outfinished in the lane. JAN'S GIRL was very rank through the opening
quarter, bumped BUCKTOWN early on the first turn, raced up close two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole
and flattened out a bit late. R ADMIRAL pressed the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the far turn, angled in to set the pace along the rail around much
of the far turn and weakened through the lane. BUCKTOWN was bumped early on the first turn, raced three and four wide and never threatened. CALZONE
chased the pace two and three wide and retreated around the far turn. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES played no factor while racing four and five wide. ANDY
