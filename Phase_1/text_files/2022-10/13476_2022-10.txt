pulled away in the stretch and finished ridden out. TURFY raced four wide around the first turn, lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four wide into
the lane and got up late for place. MAKABIM rated off the early pace then launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and
got edged for place. IRISH VALOR tracked the pace up the backstretch, came under a ride two to three wide around the far turn, failed to kick on under
pressure and offered no late bid. DEANOS CAPE stalked the pace along the inside, weakened around the far turn and continued to fade through the lane.

BROADWAY PETE was well placed sitting just off the top pair of embattled leaders, tracked rivals around the turn then given cue three wide heading into
the lane, gathered strong momentum under a drive and kicked clear in the final furlong. MYSTERY MAN dueled for the early lead racing outside of DRILLS
LIL MAN, shook free midway around the turn, widened advantage under pressure in upper stretch then yielded in late stages, got overtaken by the winner
and just lasted for place. MAHOMES was reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the turn, launched an inside bid at the head of the lane, finished
with good response and just missed place. DRILL'S LI'L MAN vied inside of MYSTERY MAN up the backstretch, could not match strides midway around the
turn and retreated in the lane.

BET YOU A BEER stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, gained command turning for home, held clear a
furlong out then just lasted under a driving finish. APOLLO BAY rated near midpack in early stages, picked up the pace entering the far turn, swung three
wide into the lane, stayed on determinedly and closed on the winner in final strides. CAMPS BAY raced off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn,
tipped two wide for the drive and gained a share. WILLTOBELUCKY settled off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and
improved position without threatening. COLORFUL NATIVE set the pace up the backstretch and led the way into the far turn, got collared turning for home
and faded. COOL CAT CHARLIE tracked the pace up the backstretch then came up empty around the far turn. PINSON came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
DAAHERS BULLY vied along the inside in early stage and continued to duel around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, stayed on determinedly
under pressure, dueled with TAP THE BRAKES in final strides and just lasted. TAP THE BRAKES raced in range near midpack up the backstretch, crept
closer along the outside late on the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, roused forward to challenge DAAHERS BULLY in final stages, dug in gamely
and just missed. DISCREET INVASION saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained a bid along the inside and prevailed for a
share. NASTY EXAGGERATOR vied three wide for the early lead, battled on around then turn, failed to match strides at the head of the lane and gave way.
IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn, swung wider for the drive and needed more for late impact. GINGER
RULES settled off the early pace, was ridden along four to five wide into the lane, shifted inside in upper stretch and failed to threaten. TAKE ME UP
BRADY tracked the top trio in early stages, waited for a clear path around the turn and into upper stretch then got clear, roused forward two wide, briefly
gained closer contention then gave way. MAFIA DON raced in the back, hustled up along the outside entering the lane and failed to respond.
ITSALLABOUTYOU vied two wide up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then faded in the lane.
