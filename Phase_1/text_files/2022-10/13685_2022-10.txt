Footnotes
MISSAWLET rated in the clear past the five eighths, advanced to the inside of a rival mid way on the final turn, angled out and advanced five wide into the
lane, rolled past the embattled leaders leaving the three sixteenths, kicked away under a drive then relaxed in the final yards. SCENIC VIEW rated in range
while saving ground, edged up past the half mile marker, was under asking chasing past the five sixteenths, slipped through and threatened inside foes
nearing mid stretch, kept on willingly to get the place but was no match for the winner. EARLEY ROSE stalked off the inside, raced between rivals leaving
the far turn, edged closer four wide between foes into the lane then kept on with effort. SWEET SENSATION broke a bit slow, settled off the pace while
saving some ground, swung out six wide for room leaving the three sixteenths and had belated interest. BLAME THE IRISH , three deep early, moved
closer past the five sixteenths, shifted out wider for the drive but needed more in the final furlong. GHOSTLY NIGHT , off the pace and towards the inside,
eased out into the lane, made a mild run between foes then flattened out. YIRA tracked the pace, bid two wide outside the leader after five furlongs, dueled
on near even terms in upper stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. HEART LIGHT saved ground and lacked a bid. MI YAYIS pulled her way
forward and took command past the wire the first time, cleared off and set the pace inside, took pressure from the three eighths, battled into the lane then
tired with a furlong remaining. MAMBA QUEEN stalked three wide, faltered around the final turn and was eased through the drive.

ALBERTANO , patiently handled down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide when commencing his rally turning for home,
closed steadily outside CAMP PENDELTON and took command inside the sixteenth pole. CAMP PENDLETON , three wide chasing the pace around the
turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. SPITBALL , clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail and
weakened the final furlong. MAMAIGOTTHIS , fanned five wide turning for home, lugged in near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. OUR HOISTED
MAST , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in upper stretch. ROYAL CRUSADER hugged the inner rail around the turn and
retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
WICKED PRANKSTER grabbed command at once, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away a threat past the five sixteenths, spurted away under a
drive in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. CRISPER settled off the pace while saving ground, gathered momentum near the quarter pole, swung
out four wide for the drive, closed gamely but had his rally fall just short. TOM HAGEN stalked three wide, took closer order under pressure past the five
sixteenths, gave hard chase from there then gave way grudgingly. ALIFEROUS settled and raced in the clear into the far turn, dropped in nearing mid
stretch, shifted back out and had belated action. SEARCH FOR TRUTH rated close while saving ground, edged up near the half, was under a hearty ride
pursuing past the five sixteenths, failed to make inroads past the three sixteenths and faded. WISH ME HOME stalked the winner two wide, was under a
hustling ride leaving the five sixteenths and faded. ROCKET ONE lagged back while saving ground, angled out in upper stretch and failed to pose a threat.
SWING LOW lacked speed, swung out in the drive and had mild late interest. CELTIC SEA , rank at the break, raced three wide early, made a mild run in
upper stretch and flattened out. IN EFFECT lagged back, angled four wide in upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SEICHE lacked speed, swung wide leaving the turn, was seven deep in upper stretch, advanced in the eight path in mid stretch and was up late. MAGIC
MULE saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, moved to the three path in upper stretch, split horses to gain the lead near the eighth pole and gave
way grudgingly. OUR LUCKY MAN hugged the inner rail through the stretch, advanced nicely to the eighth pole and flattened out. CRITICAL THREAT ,
swung wide turning for home, failed to sustain his bid between horses. JELLY NOUGAT disputed the pace outside PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH and faded in the
drive. FRIENDLY FELLA chased the pace, angled out four wide leaving the turn and weakened. JUDGE DAVIS stalked the pace, floated to the five path
turning for home and faltered. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH saved ground around the turn disputing the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
ANILEATE settled off the pace, gathered steam five wide leaving the far turn, quickly gained into the lane, sustained under right handed asking, took over
outside three rivals nearing mid stretch and drew clear. SELF ASSURED rated between foes near the half mile marker, advanced four wide and to the
inside of the winner leaving the three eighths, dropped towards the fence continuing progression near the quarter pole, came back out, bid between foes to
challenge in mid stretch and continued on with good energy. CALL ME VIVIAN settled towards the inside, waited near the far turn, angled out, advanced
four wide past the three eighths, angled in entering the lane, shifted back out for the final furlong and churned on. LADY MOSLER vied outside a rival then
moved clear heading to the far turn, dropped in and met a bid near the five sixteenths, battled to about mid stretch then weakened late. THE SWEATY FOX
edged up outside rivals heading to the first turn and tracked three wide, bid two wide outside the leader near the five sixteenths, dueled and gained a slim
lead soon into the lane, fought on between foes leaving the three sixteenths then gave way. AMARETTO SOUR saved ground, checked nearing the quarter
pole, angled out in upper stretch but failed to make an impact. FORETELL , four wide, moved up to spy the duelers leaving the three eighths, gave hard
pursuit into the lane and weakened. BRZINA vied inside, ceded to LADY MOSLER past the half mile marker, stayed on to about the three eighths and tired.
FANCY SCEPTER , between rivals, faded. ROO , three to four wide stalking the early pace, retreated leaving the far turn.
