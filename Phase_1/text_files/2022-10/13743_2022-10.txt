Footnotes
CURLIN'S MALIBU stalked from the three path then crept closer passing the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms three wide at the quarter, took the
lead leaving the eighth pole and was mildly hand ridden to draw away. POLITICAL DECISION veered out leaving the gate and rated a short lead inside, was
met at the three eighths pole and dug in to repel Got Floffy from that point, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught past the
eighth pole and settled for second. SCHOOLYARD BULLY saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, got up
for third later yards and finished well. GOLD GUY settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
in the three path but proved empty down the lane. GOT FLOFFY stalked two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and raced close on the far turn,
but weakened inside the eighth pole. BELMULLET came away rank then rated close, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail
on the far turn.

was kept sharp to mid-stretch then taken in hand later yards. INDIANA RED settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, took second toward the quarter pole but was no match in the lane. POINT OF GRACE raced well off the pace in the four path the first
turn, picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third mid-stretch. GHOST ON A MISSION
rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase passing the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and passed a rival late. URBAN WARRIOR
stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. BATTLE

backstretch and showed little response. LUNAR IMAGE saved ground. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS stalked the early pace three wide then faded readily
through the backstretch.

Footnotes
AIR ON FIRE took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, was urged away from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
maintained under steady stretch handling. FINAL SAY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and closed the gap at the rail on
the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. SUBJECT TO CHANGE was reluctant to load then tapered in to stalk the early pace off the rail,
gave chase into the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. TIZ AUCTION TIME saved ground, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SUNMAN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. AMEN CORNER settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened in the lane. ROCK FILE and SOUTHERN SAVIOUR were not factors.
SONDE ST BLUES rounded the opening turn about the four path and left the turn outside, faded through the backstretch and was eased the final quarter
mile.
