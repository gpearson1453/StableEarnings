Footnotes
PHENOM quickly took control in the beginning, set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn and widened under right handed urging
and steady handling late. REBEL GIRL stalked between rivals then two wide into the turn, got put in a bit tight between near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
out in the stretch and rallied for second. INFINITE EMPIRE turned his head and bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, settled inside, found traffic behind
a rival early on the bend then tipped out to the two path, had to pause again entering the stretch, angled out into the clear and rallied alongside REBEL
GIRL to gain the show. SIDE BY SIDE was closest in pursuit from the two path to the stretch and flattened in the lane. ALBAYAADER (IRE) hit the gate then
bumped inner rival at the start, got crowded between foes early, drifted out and bumped rival after crossing the dirt then checked past the five-eighths pole,
went three wide into the turn, swung out into the lane and could not rally. SINNERS SAINTS stalked the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch
and lacked further response. HAYLEY LEVADE chased four deep into and around the bend and into the stretch and faded down the lane. SADDLE UP
JESSIE got bumped from inside after crossing the dirt, chased three deep into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
GEEZER broke well then took a stalking position outside a rival, closed in two to three wide outside the leader around the turn, drew alongside at the top of
the stretch, took over quickly and cleared nearing the eight pole, then drew off when flagged with the whip and hand urging. FLAME RIDER stumbled badly
and bumped hard with inner rival at the start, recovered quickly and went up to clear the field, showed the way in the two path around the bend but held a
diminishing lead into the stretch, failed to offer much resistance to GEEZER outside the eighth pole but stayed on to to prove second best. OTRO MAS was
off slow from outside, chased outside rivals out of range, inched closer three wide on the turn, failed to kick on when called upon but managed to hold the
show. LET HIM DO chased the lone leader up the backstretch, rounded the turn two then three wide and could not rally. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY away
quickly then ceded control to FLAME RIDER, stalked on the inside into and around the turn and weakened in the lane. WARRENS WORLD tracked on the
inside out of range, saved ground to the stretch and faded. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE bumped hard leaving the gate, became a bit rank and was taken out
wide into the clear, lagged behind four wide around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER reserved in the two path at the back, angled to the inside on the far turn, slipped through a tight spot while brushing with SWEET
TALKED outside the eighth pole, rallied to the front with a sixteenth to go and gamely prevailed. CHEERFUL CHARM stalked on the inside then moved to
the two path, got boxed in through the far turn, steered out into the clear in upper stretch, closed well but was too late. CONSTERNATION (IRE) took up
early then stalked in the two path outside a rival, went three wide around the far turn, bid five deep in the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SWEET
TALKED broke a step slow then moved inside while allowed to settle, moved into range up the backstretch, brushed with the winner in upper stretch while
commencing a bid, fought between in the final furlong and got edged for the show. FRAZZLED was keen early while dueling for command outside a rival,
moved clear around the clubhouse turn and steered inside, led clear into the final eighth, was overtaken outside the sixteenth pole and flattened. NOBLE
HEARTED broke a step slow, went three then two wide around the first turn, asked right handed three then four wide on the far turn, moved out further at
the top of the lane and weakened. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) dueled from inside early then chased FRAZZLED around the clubhouse turn, given her cue with
three furlongs remaining, entered the lane two wide, tipped out and put in a mild bid four deep but weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
SWEET HEIDELBERG broke out and bumped rival, showed early speed and drifted a bit early on the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit of the leader to
the far turn, engaged that rival from outside around the bend, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, disposed of PARCO easily and drew off under a drive
then coasted in late. PARCO sent for the lead early and went up to take control from SWEET HEIDELBERG on the first turn, showed the way up the
backstretch, challenged by the winner around the far turn, lost command at the top of the stretch and stayed on to prove second best. BALI DANCER
tracked two to three wide around the first turn, three deep up the backstretch and far turn, drifted to the inside in the lane and finished a clear third. KITTEN
CALLS chased the speed from inside throughout and weakened down the lane. BABY'S DREAM tracked two wide then between rivals to the stretch and
also weakened in the drive. SHEZ OUR ARCH chased four wide or four deep in the early going, dropped back around the far turn and tired. SISTER'S
REVENGE got bumped and lost her path at the start, checked inside BABY'S DREAM at the seven-eighths pole, traveled near the back on the inside
around the far turn and was not a factor. I GIVE UP broke out, chased five wide around the clubhouse turn, remained wide to the second bend, angled down
to the two path while weakening and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TAMING THE TIGRESS reserved in the early going, traveled two wide into the turn, moved down to the rail then swung widest into the lane, closed fast
from the middle portion of the track and drove clear late. BIG BEAUTY broke a step slow, traveled between rivals in the two path into the turn, angled out
and came four wide into the stretch, rallied through the lane but was outclosed by the winner. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE tracked between rivals then in the two
path, had to be corrected the rider midway around the turn, angled down to the inside, tipped out past the eighth pole and finished well but was outkicked by
the top pair. BABY KRISTEN cleared early and crossed over to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, led clear into the final furlong then clung to a short
lead with a sixteenth to go and yielded late. SUNSHINE BABE was off slow to begin, settled on the inside, got put in tight on the rail near the quarter pole,
tipped out in deep stretch and kept on to the wire. AVERY BLUE tracked three deep in the early going, spun three wide into the lane and could not produce
a bid. O'NEILL'S LEGACY stalked the pace from inside into and around the turn, moved out at the top of the stretch and weakened. ESSENTIAL
BUSINESS settled off the pace, traveled three deep then dropped back to last on the turn, moved into the two path and was not a factor. EVERLYS GIRL
stalked outside a rival and two wide around the turn, asked in the lane but faded out of contention.

FORT WARREN sped to the front from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, met the challenge from JOHANNES on the turn, asked left handed into the
lane, maintained a short lead into the final furlong, put away JOHANNES midstretch but was soon engaged by SPUN INTENDED in the final sixteenth and
held gamely to the line. SPUN INTENDED broke a step slow, sat at the back widest up the backstretch, was on the move five wide into the turn, took aim
three wide into the stretch, drew challenged FORT WARREN in the final sixteenth but could not get by. JOHANNES brushed leaving the gate, was closest
in pursuit in the two path into the turn, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, kept the pressure on to midstretch but faltered in the final sixteenth.
TEXTHELEGEND chased on the inside into the turn, angled out with a quarter mile left to run and failed to threaten. GENIUS JIMMY sat off the pace early
on, traveled three wide between rivals into the turn, moved down to the two path then angled out and came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
MR FISK chased three wide into the turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch and faded. HABEAS broke well then settled outside rivals, lost ground four wide

Footnotes
GALLOVIE (GB) away quickly in the beginning, stalked the top trio to the turn, ranged up four wide then bid outside the leader in the two path leaving the
turn, took over at the three-sixteenths pole and kicked clear in upper stretch, then held safely in the final sixteenth. FLAT OUT JOY broke a step slow,
settled off the pace, was on the move three then four deep around the bend, rallied in the lane but had to settle for second best. INVINCIBELLA (GB) was
off a bit slow to begin, settled inside, moved closer from the rail through the turn, tipped out in the stretch but flattened in the late stages. DRAW ME hopped
at the start and dropped far back, angled down to the inside, saved ground through the turn, steered out in the stretch and put in a mild late rally for a minor
award. A NEW PEACE got sandwiched between rivals and checked back early, raced along the inside then tipped off the rail but lacked room behind rivals
past the quarter pole, angled to the inside at the top of the stretch, tipped back off the rail and improved position. BLUSHING (FR) vied for the lead inside a
pair of rivals then inched ahead leaving the backstretch, cleared the outside pair around the bend, challenged nearing the stretch and lost command at the
three-sixteenths pole, then weakened down the lane. TRICKLE IN came in and bumped rival early, tracked off the rail out of range, took the turn four then
five wide, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch and weakened. CORUSCATION broke a step slow then went up to vie three deep for command, failed
to keep pace and chased the leader around the turn, got put in tight between rivals past the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and faded.
EQUILOVE (IRE) vied between rivals up the backstretch, chased the leader two wide around the turn and gave way. ANNIE GRAHAM got bumped from
outside early, tracked out of range in the early stages, got shuffled between rivals at the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
PIONEERING PAPA settled early then moved into range leaving the backstretch, bid three wide late on the turn, dueled while taking a short lead at the
eighth pole and gamely prevailed. SAWASDEE stalked the pacesetter from outside early, engaged the leader nearing the turn, took over at the
three-eighths pole, put away inner foe past the quarter pole but was challenged by PIONEERING PAPA immediately after, responded well but lost
command with a furlong left to run, fought back from inside through the late stages but came up a bit short in the end. SO I'M TOLD stalked two to three
wide, lacked a bid in the stretch run but churned on to hold third. DIVINE FEMININE chased between rivals and shuffled a mild shuffle past the
nine-sixteenths pole, went two to three wide around the bend, tipped out in the lane and improved position while failed to threaten. FIREMAN DAN lacked
early speed, trailed off the inside, came five wide into the stretch, moved out further and improved position. HEY JASPER chased along the inside, tipped
out with a furlong to go but could not rally. SAYERS set the pace up the backstretch, pressured from outside into the turn, lost command with three furlongs
left to run, could not keep up past the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. WINK AND A DREAM traveled along the inside near the back and never
responded. STAYIN' OUT LATE sat off the pace in the early stages, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. COME ON COME ON came
away slow from outside, chased off the pace wide up the backstretch, entered the lane four wide and weakened.

SECRETS TOLD pressed the pace from between early, fought in the two path through the turn outside the leader, reached the front midstretch, put away

moved down to the inside around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, surged late outside the winner but ran out of time. WOODBINE WAY settled at the
back early, checked between rivals into the stretch, swung out wide in upper stretch, closed fast and gained the show. TOM'S BEAUTY became fractious in
the gate, broke in and came away last, moved into range on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in the lane but needed to find more late.
BABY STEPS set the pace inside rivals up the backstretch, held a short lead over SECRETS TOLD around the bend into the stretch, relinquished the lead
outside the sixteenth pole and weakened late. AAS DE FAUST (GB) settled on the inside near the back, lacked room behind a rival at the quarter pole,
remained along the fence into the drive, came off the rail and kept on while unable to threaten. SHES'A PERFECTLADY took a bumped from outside in the
beginning, raced off the pace outside a rival into the turn, went two to three wide around the bend, angled out in the drive and needed to find more late.
BLEU BALLON raced in range four deep to the turn, chased wide to the stretch, moved out in the lane and weakened. SOARING SKY (IRE) broke in and

Footnotes
ANGEL NADESHIKO sped to the front along the inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch and far turn, put away WITH THIS VOW in upper
stretch and held well under right handed encouragement. ANACAPA raced in range four then three wide around the first turn, given her cue at the
five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the lane, pursued the winner through the final furlong and gained late nearing the wire. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH
bobbled leaving the gate, brushed with inner rival while five wide into the first turn, angled down to the three path around the bend, stayed off the rail and
came four wide into the drive and finished willingly to earn the show honors. REINECKE stalked three wide into the turn then lost her path and altered
inward, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a bid in the stretch run. WITH THIS VOW stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced up close three wide
on the first turn while in hand, pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch and far turn, lost contact with the leader in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. TAYET chased four then three wide early, took the second turn two then three wide and failed to respond when called upon. GOLD
DRAGON QUEEN broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, brushed outer rival four wide into the first turn, angled down to the two path around the
bend, took the second turn three then four wide and lacked a rally. AQUA JULIA broke a step slow, became a bit rank on the first turn near the inside, came
up empty into the stretch, eased to the wire and walked off.
