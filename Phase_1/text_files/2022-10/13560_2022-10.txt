BILLS SMOKN BULLET broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the
final turn, collared the pacesetter soon after entering the lane, and finished determinedly three wide in deep stretch to get the better of a stubborn KHAIKY'S
COMMAND. KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the rail in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while proving clearly second best. RACING RIVER settled off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner
a share. FINDING WAYS pressed the pace two wide entering the first turn, before taking a tracking trip one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
continued two wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. JUVEE TOO unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied two
wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

OSTRACIZE was off a step slow, but raced up to tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the
backside, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn while awaiting room, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to be up in the
final strides. JUST MAKE BELIEVE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ICE BREAKER through the stretch the first time, continued to
force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and just failed to last. ICE BREAKER away well and
vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late. ARCH PRINCE was away awkwardly and trailed the field through the stretch the first time, continued to
bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. SLEW'S DA
BOSS broke sharply and stalked the leaders one out from the rail through the lane the first time, continued from a stalking trip in the run down the backside
and into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response over the final furlong.

Footnotes
BACK SHACK tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, assumed command
leaving the turn, and drew clear late to prove best. ARUNDEL CASTLE away well, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide for the drive, and closed steadily to get up
for the place in the final strides. SWANGIN away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backside, rallied along the inside, checked
briefly midway through the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. UNION MAN settled off the early pace while saving ground along the
inside entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. CAIRO CRUSADER settled off
the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but needed more late when called upon while finishing two
out from the rail in the drive. ELLAMEISTER lagged well off the early pace while racing three out from the rail in the run down the backside, dropped to the
inside approaching the final turn to commence her bid, but needed more late while finishing from along the rail in the stretch drive. GROOVIN' IS BAK broke
sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong. DESIRED OUTCOME lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn,
but needed more when called upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of SWANGIN lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of BACK SHACK for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was
made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
AT ATTENTION stalked the leaders from along the inside through the stretch the first time, before tapping on the breaks while racing up on heels entering
the second turn, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted off the rail to
collar the pacesetter leaving the turn, and was all out to fend off a resilient AROLLERCOASTER ride in the final strides to prevail .
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace through the second
turn and in the run down the backstretch, continued to show the way into the final turn, was collared leaving the turn, but battled gamely one out from the rail
in the drive to just miss . STAY FANTASTIC away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing just out from the rail through the stretch the
first time, began to gain ground on the leaders in the run to the final turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share . PAY MY WAY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch,
commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive. UNCHARACTERISTIC stalked the
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. REGAL RIOT away alertly and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail through the stretch the first
time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
ANAAMY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, assumed command
leaving the turn, and held STRIKING VALUE safely at bay late to prove best. STRIKING VALUE unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the
first turn, began to advance midway down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, angled three wide leaving to turn to loom a
danger, and finished three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. GWEN away well and bumped with TEXAS HUMOR in the run away from the
gate, held a stalking trip into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the
drive. BE LIKE ME settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from well back entering the final
turn, but finished with late interest while seven wide in the stretch drive. LIVING SKY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late going. TEXAS HUMOR broke sharply and dueled for the lead
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of LIVING SKY in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was
overtaken leaving the turn, and weakened in the late stages. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of LIVING SKY
lodged a claim of foul against the rider of ANAAMY for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and
no change was made to the original order of finish.
