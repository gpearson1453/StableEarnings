Footnotes
GRACIE DIAMOND vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear around the final turn and was kept to the task. LADY DREAMER unhurried in the
beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. VOODOO MISTRESS
challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late kick and proved no match for the top two. CHAMPLEVE lacked early
speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid and was outfinished for show. ETERNAL LIGHT void of early speed and was never a factor.
SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW showed early speed, had an outside trip and faded. WHERE'S THE PUMPS always raced near the back and showed little.
VISUAL MOON raced near the back and was outrun.

DIABLO CAT vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, angled out down the stretch and got up late. PAPA BRO dueled on the front end, drove
clear and was caught late for the win. NOSBOR lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide bid, finished willingly, while being
outfinished. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. HOT ARTIE broke poorly, racing in the back and passed tired
ones late. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR pressed the early pace and faded. INVINCIBILITY raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. FLUFFPOINT
challenged on the front end, saved ground around the final turn, checked, getting in tight quarters and was done.

Footnotes
FAREWELL TIME went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. G DON'T KNOW unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the turn,
entered the stretch wide, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LION HEART LEGEND raced within contention, came
around the turn on the outside, made a bid, lacked a late kick and was a clear third. BOSTON REPO pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
weakened. BUNKIE'S SONG raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside and was no factor. DONNA'S COURT void of early speed
and showed little. SR. CLARKY always raced near the back and was outrun. I'M A SPECIAL STAR showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
LOTS OF GOLD bumped start, vied for the lead, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. BECCA'S BOUQUET raced within contention, forwardly
placed throughout, made a wide bid and finished willingly. RACHIE RACH showed early speed, saved ground around the turn, raced close throughout, but
couldn't match strides with the top two. PRAYERS SAVED raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and was outfinished for show. ZEATRICAL
bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. GILDED APPLE void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor.
ACHANCETOWIN broke poorly, raced in the back and finished evenly. BOURN lacked early speed and was never close. D L'S GIRL always raced the back
and was outrun. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

JAYS HOLIDAY unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, racing four wide, entered the stretch wide, pulled away and was ridden out.
LUCK OF THE STARS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. KATS PICK void of early,
trailing the field in the beginning, made a late wide rally and was a clear third. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
lacked a finish. KOOFI lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. WILD T RANGER raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
COLE'S SENSATION void of early speed and passed tired ones. SWEET PRESENT raced near the middle of the pack, came around the final turn on the
outside and faded. OMG UR KIDDING ME showed early speed and made a steady retreat. NOT A NYKI raced within contention, came around the first turn
wide and dropped back.
