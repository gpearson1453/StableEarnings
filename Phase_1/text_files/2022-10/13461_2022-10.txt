Footnotes
KOSMONAVT attended the early pace from outside three wide, was clear heading up the backstretch, joined by outside foes approaching the far turn and
going in the two path into that bend, emerged clear in upper stretch while drifting out a bit, held sway under steady handling and vigorous hand-urging
through the final sixteenth. I'M DASHING raced off the pace into the first turn going five wide, advanced four wide and outside foes into the far turn, was
held at bay by the winner but second best. MUROMEC attended the early pace inside, continued to track from on or just off the rail in behind the leader into
the far turn, kept on in the lane. SELF INFLICTED was coaxed forward at the break to gain forward position between runners into the first turn, steadily
dropped back into the far turn despite some encouragement, moved out from three to four wide on that bend, came into upper stretch five deep and ran on.
TRINITY GOLD was away slowly and reared at the start, spotting the field about six lengths, raced at the rear off the inside, angled inside runners at the top
of the stretch and kept on with mild late interest. CRYPTIC CREED tucked in to track in behind the leaders mid-pack just off the inside, raced mostly in the
two to three path in behind and failed to rally. FIFTH SEASON was under restraint and a bit rank early racing outside five wide on the first turn, continued
outside foes toward the rear five to six wide thereafter and failed to threaten. FIRST SPRING pursued from outside three to four wide early, advanced into
the far turn to make a mild and brief bid between runners but could not sustain the effort and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN broke inwards to start, rated well inside in mid pack at the half, waited patiently while tracking rivals through the turn, found running
room in the four path at the top of the stretch and when asked drew off nicely at the furlong marker winning comfortably in the end. PRIMORDIAL FEAR
bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to lead soon after the start, tracked the frontrunner just outside throughout the turn, took closer order in upper
stretch to contend and finished on end through the stretch to be the best of the rest at the line. CHAIRMAN FOX tracked the early speed inside at the half,
put in a bid at the top of the stretch to briefly have his nose in front but was soon headed by the winner and could not hold off the outside closers at the
eighth pole. VELOCITO stalked outside foes near the back in the beginning, was asked midpoint on the turn racing three wide, responded well enough to
put in a stretch rally for the the minors getting up for fourth late. UNCOMPROMISING broke sharp but was headstrong early to take the lead, fought the rider
still entering the turn on the front, was collared at the quarter pole racing on the rail and tired inside at the furlong marker. MIA'S MAJESTY was reined back
to settle near the rear in the beginning, roused in the two path through the turn and had little to offer behind foes in the late stages. FREE CAT broke out at
the start to trail early, saved ground through the turn and could not get involved inside for the run to the wire. MAHOGONY WILDCAT travelled four wide
outside of foes down the backside and continued that path through the turn, loomed into contention at the quarter pole and stopped in the eight path at the
top of the lane.

Footnotes
RACE FOR PINKS stalked just off the leader, went three wide on the turn, engaged that runner at the top of the stretch, dueled till late before inching away
under stout urging. HANDCARVED was urged clear at the break shifting in to the two path to set the pace, was challenged at the top of the stretch, dueled
and kept on gamely but was outfinished by the winner while getting the nod for place. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) stalked just off the pace, went four wide on the
turn beginning to advance, loomed a threat making a bid and drawing nearly even with the leader in mid-stretch but needed more. MASTER SPY tracked
inside in behind the leaders, kept on evenly. CALL MY BANKER settled inside of the pace, came off the rail about the three-eighths, moved out further in the
stretch and ran on. BLUE MAX pursued while off the pace from between runners two to three wide into the turn, came out five to six wide at the top of the
stretch, drifted out a bit in the lane and ran on. DOWNLOAD lacked early speed, shifted in leaving the backstretch to the two path while trailing, angled six
wide at the top of the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. BOUND LUCKY chased from outside a rival three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally
for the drive.

Footnotes
CHEEKY PINT was all alone in a nice stalking position in mid pack at the half, took closer order to the leaders racing outside into the far turn, cruised to the
lead at the top of the stretch and drew off at the furlong marker. BELLA NINA crept closer to the frontrunners while navigating between rivals three furlongs
from home, was ridden to keep up to the winner turning for home and chased in vain down the stretch to be a clear second best. GLOVANNA was situated
near the rear running into the far turn, angled outside off fading horses at the quarter pole and found her best stride late rallying in mid stretch to close well
for third. CRUMLIN TIME broke sharp to be on top into the first turn, opened up marginally on the chasers into the final turn, was collared by the winner two
furlongs from home and faded inside mid stretch holding on for the minors. CALL HER JOEY trailed the field while saving ground in the beginning stages of
the race, started to pick it up outside of runners midpoint on the far turn and showed some late interest to pass tired foes in mid stretch. UNDER THE EYE
tracked inside off the frontrunners mid point in the race, was shuffled back while on the fence into the far turn and could only offer an even effort between
rivals running through the stretch. SAVVY'S SISTER tracked the pacesetters on the outside at the half mile marker, was ridden to keep up with the leaders
on the far turn and had little to offer for the drive to the finish. STORMY SUZIE travelled near the back of the field running down the backside, could not get
involved through the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. ANITA GRIGIO settled near the back in the early stages, offered a brief run outside foes
running four wide into the far turn and weakened between rivals in uppers stretch. CAPOEIRA pressed the early pace into the first turn, continued to keep
the leader in her sights between foes at the half, gave way at the three eighths marker and retreated between foes at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TWISTER ALERT settled mid-pack three to four wide outside, advanced leaving the turn coming five wide into upper stretch and taking the lead, kicked
clear and was kept to the task. GAMBLE'S SILVER wasn't away as quickly as others but settled in behind tracking in the two path, shifted four wide into the
stretch, ran on well to be second best. LOADED QUESTION settled early, raced widest on the turn going four to five deep and coming six wide into upper
stretch, ran on to be best of the rest. FOREST B stalked just off the leaders from outside, advanced to make a brief bid three wide coming to the quarter
pole, had no extra for the drive. STERLING SPEED lacked early speed racing inside, came out in the stretch and improved position. LOIS LEN pressed
from outside then between runners on the turn, weakened in the stretch. OHEAVENS bobbled ever so slightly at the break but was soon in front to set the
pace inside facing outside pressure, gave way.

FOREVER DIXIE was allowed to settle outside near the back in the early stages, advanced three wide patiently on the turn, was encouraged to go on in
upper stretch and was full of run late to comfortably win at the wire while being wrapped up. RENEGADE REBEL pressed the early pace, dueled just
outside on the turn for the lead, took control midway down the stretch but could not find more late to hold off the closing winner. STOLEN tracked the
frontrunners racing four wide on the turn, loomed into contention turning for home and finished up well enough to be a non threatening third at the wire. AHA
MOMENT took command leaving the chute, was headed at the three furlong marker outside and battled until upper stretch, faded on the rail at the eighth
pole and lost third money nearing the finish. BRITISH CROWN could see the field down the backstretch, angled outside to the six path for the drive and
finished up with some good energy at the line. RAVELLO BEAUTY was off a bit slow, settled between foes near the back at the half, took closer order to the
field into the turn and could not find another gear to be involved to the finish. CRUMLIN BEAST was in the mix tracking the leaders at the five sixteenths
pole, ridden to go after the frontrunners at the top of the stretch and weakened between horses at the furlong marker. OUR LIBERTY BELLE was in range
racing mid pack between foes through the turn and could not offer anything for the drive to the finish. CENTENARY settled near the back of the field in the
early stages, was asked entering upper stretch and could not be a presence running to the line. WAR'S END KISS tracked just behind the pacesetters mid
point on the turn, was roused at the quarter pole and backed away on the rail in mid stretch.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S KAT was coaxed forward at the start inside rivals but off the rail to contest the pace, edged clear about the five-sixteenths, drifted out a bit in
mid-stretch and held while being kept to the task. SILENT SKY was lightly bumped at the start, chased just off the leaders, shifted in about the
nine-sixteenths, advanced two to three wide on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch, chased the winner home making no headway and held another
rival for the place. KATCHY NAME angled in early settling off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, ran on but
couldn't get past a rival for second. OUR FLAG FLYING settled while moving to the two path early, went three wide on the turn advancing past rivals, kept
on in the lane. HOLIDAY WITH AMY broke a bit awkwardly then settled well back, swung seven deep into the stretch and ran on mildly. FLOWERS 'N
BERRIES was forwardly-placed early pursuing the pace, dropped back nearing the half, went four to six wide on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch.
FAST'N SEXY pressed the pace four wide into the turn, weakened in the stretch. DOMER ALLURE broke a step slowly, was unhurried early, came out
seven wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. STUFF shifted in saving ground on the turn, failed to rally. I'M A BOURBON GIRL bumped a rival lightly
at the start, chased from outside five wide under encouragement, came up empty. BEYLA BE GOOD vied three wide early, was done at the three-eighths
and faded.

Footnotes
SARATOGA VISION was near the back of the field early on, took closer order to the pack at the quarter pole, rallied in the six path at the top of the stretch,
gained control at the furlong marker between horses and dug in stubbornly late to hold off the closing challenger at the finish. SILENT CAUSEWAY was
allowed to settle at the back to trail the field until the stretch run, angled out to be the widest runner in the seventh path for the drive, was gaining steadily
under left handed urging in deep stretch and just could not get to the winner nearing the line. MS VANCOUGAR waited behind the frontrunners on the rail
through the turn, looked for room in upper stretch, found a seam midpoint down the lane and battled on the rail in deep stretch only to finish just short of the
winner in a gritty performance. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE hounded the pacesetter through the early parts of the race, assumed command briefly turning for
home between rivals and could not find another gear and finished evenly in deep stretch for a minor share. KEYFLOWER (FR) tracked just outside in the
second flight on the turn, was ridden while in the hunt at the top of the stretch racing five wide and stalled with an eighth remaining. AMALFI SKY set all the
early fractions, was collared at the top of the stretch, offered little resistance for the drive and stopped inside at the furlong marker.

LOYALTY attended the pace inside but off the fence, put a head in front outside the three-eighths then moved clear by the five-sixteenths, came into upper
stretch with a sizeable advantage and asked for more, held safe. SOUPER HOITY TOITY settled off the pace inside, checked on heels at the quarter pole,
altered outside a rival at that juncture, was gaining but too late. JOIN THE DANCE set the early tempo from outside, continued close up four wide on the
turn, had no extra for the drive. PHAROAH'S SONG settled off the leaders, went three wide on the turn, needed more. HOLLYWOOD WALK was close up
early, moved forward to force the issue three wide and between rivals at the nine-sixteenths, began to drop back on the turn while drifting toward the rail,
tired.

Footnotes
SILVESTRI (FR) chased the leaders while three wide, advanced four wide late on the turn and drove to the front at the quarter pole, kept to her task by the
rider late. GAMBLING CAT chased along the inside, was on hold on the turn, angled out upper stretch and moved into second, holding off a rival stubbornly
for that spot. KITTEN'S ROMANCE sat midpack while two to three wide, followed the winner into the stretch and loomed boldly outside that one, but couldn't
match her energy and was outgamed for the place. LADYWEARSTHERING led from the gate to the quarter pole when headed by the winner and was only
able to hold on to a minor share. SPIDER BELLE settled off the pace, rallied three to seven wide midturn to the stretch, lugged in at the quarter pole but
straightened out quickly to best the balance. EPHRATA (GB) in midpack and along the inside, angled out in upper stretch and brushed with a rival at the
quarter pole, dipped back to the fence and inched up without threatening late. GUILEFUL trailed, was fanned out into the eight path turning for home and
passed a few stragglers late. I HAVE AN IDEA stalked the leader, bid inside the winner turning for home but could not match that one's energy and
retreated from midstretch. URBAN settled off the pace and never reached contention.
