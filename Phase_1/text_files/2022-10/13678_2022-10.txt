inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE just off the inside in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DUDE N

drive running on to secure the show honors. TAKE ME TO JIMMY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LIFE AT SEA just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. FIRE BARON chased along the inside early on, tipped out
three then four wide near the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired foes.

Footnotes
LIAR'S POKER tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong coming in and bumping the hindquarters of GENERAL BANKER near the sixteenth marker in an attempt to spin that rival outwards,
seized command inside that station and carried his main rival inwards to the finish to prevail. GENERAL BANKER just off the inside in closest aim of the
leader, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was bumped in the
hindquarters by LIAR'S POKER nearing the sixteenth marker, got headed inside that station and was carried in in the late going while well clear for the
place honors. STOW ON THE WOLD showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
got collared nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. BOBBY THE TANK tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. DRAKE'S PASSAGE just off the inside just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SOCIAL SIDEKICK chased along the
inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered no response. ZAPRUDER two to three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SOUNDS SPOOKY two to three wide in pursuit
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. METAMORPHOSES just off the inside near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing inside at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide for home and made no impact. EXALTED ONE forwardly placed
three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. MICHAEL LEIS chased three to four wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out and made no impact. SUPER SALVATORE chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S WISDOM came in awkwardly to the inside with his initial step, displayed no ill effects and settled into stride, was three then two wide on the
clubhouse bend, sat within range in the two path thereafter being rated along, flashed some interest a few jumps short of the quarter pole, was given his cue
getting worked towards the four path during the initial stages of the stretch run, crept up to the outermost of a threesome vying for the lead with a furlong
ground, mustered up good determination to grind his way to the front in deep stretch and edge clear. TRUANCY away well, checked coming up to the
beginning of the first turn as THEREISASTORMBREWIN was tucking along the inside route, immediately tipped into the two path and went on to stalk that
opponent, rider holding something in reserve, appeared to poke a head in front in the general area of the quarter pole, got set down, was narrowly in front
being pressed hard by a pair of foes to the outside in midstretch, reluctantly released the lead inside the sixteenth pole, held on well to procure the place.
SIX PERCENT four to three wide on the first turn, was more in the three path afterwards forwardly placed, continued along on the same scenario for over
three-quarters, was cued up late on the second bend, settled in upper stretch and went after the lead in earnest, put up a fight between rivals from mildlane
to the sixteenth pole before weakening. SIMPLY saved ground until the quarter pole, got driven five wide into the lane, rallied for the last major check.
TROUBLESHOOTER raced three wide on both turns, came up empty when asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole. THERISASTORMBREWIN broke on
top, glided over to the rail by the clubhouse turn, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the second place finisher, yielded when put to the test at the
quarter pole and steadily backed away. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES strung at or near three path to the quarter pole, gave way. WILD BANKER loosely
pocketed, folded.

ACTIVIST INVESTING (GB) broke in at the start bumping HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP, raced just off the inside through the first turn settled in mid pack,
tipped three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing when advancing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a good kick to overthrow the leader inside the final seventy yards in tandem with SCRAMBLE and traded
a brush with that rival to his inside and was just up in the final strides coming inwards slightly at the end. SCRAMBLE led early on along the inside before
racing just off the inside through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, settled tracking that rival three then two wide coming under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on with good energy to the finish displacing the leader in concert with the
aforementioned foe just inside seventy yards to the finish, traded a brush with that rival and was carried inwards very slightly late and missed at the wire.
CLUBHOUSE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way just off the inside briefly before tucking inside through the first turn, settled in
hand just off the inside down the backstretch and into a comfortable rhythm, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole as rivals got busy in behind,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair and was
collared just inside seventy yards to the finish, ran on safe for the show honors. WIDERIGHT got bumped at the start by DECANTED, who recovered
inwards from a bobble, tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and kept on to the finish. DECANTED bobbled at the break recovering inwards to bump the aforementioned foe, raced just off the inside through the
first turn before tracking the front three then four wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and made progress, swung
five wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive missing for the last major share and was out-finished by the top ones. ROYAL VELVET broke in at the
start bumping FULL COVERAGE, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch and made no late headway. AMERICAN RAIDER just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP broke a half a beat slow and was bumped by ACTIVIST
INVESTING, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made
no impact. SUMMER BEE just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. FULL COVERAGE got bumped at the start by ROYAL VELVET breaking inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch, bobbled in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and strode a bit awkward while eased home to the finish.
