Footnotes
WESTERN TROUBLE came in after the break and tracked the leading trio inside on or just off the rail, moved out five wide in upper stretch to take aim,
struck the lead past the furlong marker and kicked clear. MARTEN RIVER moved forward inside to contest the early pace, was clear early on the turn, came
out four wide heading into upper stretch, was soon challenged and outkicked but kept on to save the place. ALICIA'S KID stalked three wide outside the
eventual winner just off the leading trio, moved out in upper stretch and kept on for show honors. WENJACK saved ground inside and improved position.
GOLDMINE CAT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace four then five wide on the turn, swung eight deep into upper stretch and finished with late
interest. STRIKING HEIR raced mid-pack two to three wide on and went evenly. PRINCE SUSSEX was bumped into a rival at the start, vied outside three
wide, drifted out in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TALL WATER was in tight and steadied after the start, raced toward the back two to three
wide, ran on mildly. EXECUTIVE SIGHT came out a bit at the start, raced at the back, was never a threat. JUST JIMMY bumped the outside rival at the
start, vied between runners briefly in the early going, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CONFUSING broke sharp to take command from the outside down the backstretch, was unchallenged up front through the turn, opened up on the field with
three sixteenths to go and was kept to the task late to win comfortably. MORSTACHY'S settled near the rear in the early stages, angled out widest for the
drive in the eight path at the top of the lane, closed in vain for the win but finished up well to best the rest. ROCK BULLET was taken back at the start to trail,
saved ground inside on the turn, shifted out to the four path turning for home, rallied mid stretch six wide between runners and closed well to get up for third
at the wire. GUNS N' ROJAS was travelling near the back of the pack down the backside, advanced four wide outside rivals three furlongs to the finish,
offered a bid seven wide in upper stretch and stalled in the final sixteenth to hold for a minor share. TODAY tracked the winner three wide outside in the
beginning, was urged to keep up with rivals on either side at the quarter pole and faded in mid stretch. PASSIONPLATE was shuffled back while inside on
the turn to trail the field at the top of the lane and found some interest late to pass tiring challengers in the final sixteenth. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE veered
out sharply at the break, advanced around foes four wide on the turn, was in range for a share six wide at the top of the stretch and tired at the furlong
marker. QUIET VISTA improved position between horses through the turn, contended five wide two furlongs to the finish and was empty for the stretch
drive. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN rated in mid pack between horses through the turn, put in a brief run at the quarter pole to be in the mix for a minor share
and faltered at the furlong marker. HEMLO GOLD settled mid pack on the rail running on the turn, was roused on the fence at the top of the stretch and
could not get involved for the stretch drive. IT'S TRUE chased the pace on the rail in the beginning, tracked the loose winner inside through the turn and
retreated on the fence with three sixteenths remaining.

Footnotes
STEP FORWARD stalked off the early pace, bid two to three wide and inside rivals on the turn, was clear by mid-stretch, kept to the task and held safe.
LAST DAWN tracked in behind inside under light rating tactics, was blocked at the half and taken hold of slightly, switched out soon after for room but
having lost several lengths on the new leaders, came into upper stretch five to six wide, gained steadily but too late while drifting in. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI
settled off the pace, raced outside four then five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep, gained show honors. JACK settled mid-division, bid
three to four wide and between runners late on the turn, evened out by mid-stretch. CURE IN REACH settled off the leader, bid outside in tandem with two
other foes going four to five wide on the turn, had no late kick for the drive. HE'S GOT SOUL angled in early, was never able to mount a challenge.
MAHOGONY WILDCAT set the pace in the clear, gave way. QUICK RELOAD got away about three to four lengths slowly, switched out and moved up three
wide, tired.

Footnotes
GOZILLA tracked on the rail behind the engaging frontrunners down the backside, assumed command four wide while well in hand at the top of the stretch
and drew off when asked at the furlong marker. HEAT MERCHANT advanced nicely up the rail entering the turn, lugged out while throwing his head briefly
three eighths to the finish, regrouped up the fence midpoint on the turn and finished up well inside down the lane to be a clear second. AIM FOR THE SKY
was hustled early to chase the leader outside down the backstretch, took control briefly midpoint on the turn, was headed by the winner turning for home
and had just enough left to hold late for the show award. EXCEED was void of early speed and trailed in the beginning, rallied up the fence through the turn,
shifted just outside off a tiring runner at the eighth pole and finished with good energy just missing getting up for third money. MR NARCISSISTIC was
situated near the back alone in the early stages, rallied between horses five sixteenths from the wire, raced five wide while in range for a small share at the
top of the stretch and levelled off in the final sixteenth to be on the fringes. RACING IN THE RAIN settled close to the back of the pack early on, angled out
widest turning for home in the seven path for the stretch effort and could only finish up evenly to the wire. DRAGON'S KEY trailed the field going into the
turn, angled out for the drive five wide in upper stretch and passed tired competitors the final sixteenth. CEREBRO tracked the pacesetters in the two path
into the turn, was ridden to keep up with the leaders at the quarter pole, little effort was given and backed away between challengers with an eighth
remaining. JACKIE'S PRIDE settled in the middle of the field through the backstretch, waited behind rivals turning for home, shifted off fading horses five
wide at the furlong marker and could not make an impact late. WOOD BE WILD rated between foes mid pack at the half, was urged three wide nearing the
quarter marker and offered little response. CONFIDENT N ELITE showed good speed early to lead inside, was collared outside midway on the turn and
stopped on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MY GIRL SKY tracked in behind racing just off the rail, moved out a bit further late on the turn while taking closer order, came into upper stretch four wide,
struck the lead past the furlong marker, kicked clear and held well under steady handling. SOUPER FLASHY broke in just a bit, raced mid-pack outside
going four then five wide on the turn, shifted inside the aforementioned rival in late stretch to hook up with WELL ACTUALLY and outfinished that rival for
second. WELL ACTUALLY set the pace racing off the rail with rivals pressing or in range, moved clear turning for home, had no extra and lost place late.
TALK TO YA LATER settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was gaining inside but too late. SACRED DANCER stumbled at the start, switched out
and moved up between runners, swung seven wide into the stretch and had some good late effort. PLEASURE'S GOLD stalked up close three to four wide
on the turn, when asked for more turning for home had no response and faded. KEEP IT NEAT hopped slightly and was away a step slowly, settled outside
at the rear, swung six to seven wide, was never near enough to threaten. ALLPAIDUP steadied slightly soon after the start when in tight quarters, went two
to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. INDIAN MUSIC was forced in a bit at the start, stalked or pressed outside three wide, weakened.

Footnotes
NEWPORT AGENT broke sharp to lead in the beginning, surrendered the front briefly through the first turn, regained the lead into the backstretch, was
urged at the quarter pole, quickly opened up on the field at the top of the lane and was kept to the task late to be unchallenged at the wire. TOUR OF DUTY
stalked four wide into the first turn, continued to be outside tracking in mid pack at the half, rallied four wide at the quarter marker and closed belatedly
turning for home to get up for place in deep stretch. OCTOBER FROST was allowed to settle inside near the back in the early stages, made an early move
five wide three eighths to the finish, was in contention three wide in upper stretch and finished well on the fence the last furlong to get up for the show
award. EAGLE CHIEF sat behind the early leaders between foes down the backside, was scrubbed on chasing the loose winner on the far turn, stalled in
the final sixteenth and had to settle for a minor role losing some positions very late. CREDIT RIVER trailed the field until the quarter marker, angled outside
five wide to rally at the top of the stretch and showed interest late to pass faltering rivals the last furlong. QUIET INTENT tracked on the fence behind the
early frontrunners with a half remaining, was asked for more on the far turn inside, shifted just outside for the stretch run at the top of the lane and finished
up evenly in the late stages. JUST START ME UP settled near the back of the field racing down the backstretch, offered a mild rally in the three path into
the far turn and could not get involved through the stretch. FINDING FREEDOM travelled four wide into the first turn, tracked behind the pacesetters four
wide into the far turn, was roused between challengers midpoint on the final turn and was empty in upper stretch. MORE THAN A DANCE pressed the early
pace on the rail at the half, was ridden to go after the winner midpoint on the far turn inside and faltered on the fence at the eighth pole. NONNO'S LITTLE
BOY tracked between runners in the second flight down the backside, could not keep pace with the field on the far turn and had nothing to show in the drive
to the line.

Footnotes
BANFF settled toward the rear early, saved ground early on the turn racing inside, was gradually guided out to enter the top of the stretch six deep, engaged
the leader at the sixteenth pole, just got up at the wire under steady handling. HUNT MASTER stalked the pace from outside, went three then four wide on
the turn, came into upper stretch a bit wider, bid at the furlong marker, had a narrow lead while dueling and just failed to last. UNCLE JOE stalked from two
to three wide into and on the turn, came out wider turning for home, was in a bit tight as the leader drifted out near mid-stretch, kept on between runners for
show. FULL SCREEN settled off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six to seven deep, ran on mildly but missed show
honors. GIANT TEDDY moved clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, drifted out in the stretch, weakened. BOSSY HOLIDAY saved ground and ran on
evenly. SILENT RUNNER raced off the inside part of the course and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BET was away slowly on the inside after the break, recovered nicely to track mid pack just off the fence at the half, was asked for run five sixteenths from
home, had clear run at the top of the lane eight wide and was full of run to the wire to get up late between rivals. POT COMMITTED settled near the back
down the backstretch, started to rally up the fence three furlongs from home, angled out at the quarter marker, shifted out for the drive nine wide and closed
well to be second best at the line. BARTICA rated in third on the rail into the first turn, advanced inside at the three eighths pole, slipped up the fence two
furlongs from the finish to lead at the top of the stretch and gave way to the top two rivals in the final sixteenth still holding onto the show placing in the end.
DUSTY'S CHANCE tracked between foes in middle of the pack through the backside, took closer order racing three wide with a quarter to run, was in the
mix five wide for the stretch run and needed more late to threaten for the top placings. ANSELMO broke inwards at the start, had a good tracking position
behind the early leaders at the half, bid for the top spot four wide turning for home and levelled off in deep stretch to settle on the fringes. WILLIAM'S
CAUSE chased the early pace, forced the issue inside three furlongs remaining on the rail, briefly had the lead at the quarter pole, was engaged by multiple
runners at the top of the stretch and weakened at the furlong marker. UNBRIDLED INFERNO threw his head at the break, offered a mild run outside
challengers on the far turn, was floated ten wide in upper stretch and could not get involved afterwards. BEAUFORT settled near the back in the beginning,
trailed the pack five furlongs from the finish and could only pass stopping horses in the late stages. MR. COMMISH broke outwards at the start, stalked mid
pack four wide outside at the half, was urged midway on the final turn and retreated in upper stretch. FREE CAT broke sharp to be loose on the lead into the
first turn, continued to dictate the pace down the backside, was collared by runners on either side at the quarter pole, had nothing left to offer turning for
home and stopped in mid stretch. MISTER MAX was squeezed at the start and trailed early, lost contact with the field on the far turn and galloped through
the stretch to the wire.
