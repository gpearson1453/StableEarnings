THE JUDGE AND JURY led narrowly in three pronged duel, faded briefly then came again after a race-long battle in a determined effort. A DANGEROUS
GUY battled between rivals throughout and continued gamely to the wire. TOPS THE CHART prompted the pace three wide, edged ahead to midstretch
and continued willingly. BODE O trailed far behind then narrowed the gap with a gradual stretch gain. NATAVALLI'S KNIGHT well placed behind trio of
duelers but lacked a rally. HIT ME I'M LUCKY dropped back inside and gave way readily.

JACKIE THE JOKER reserved early, split rivals advancing on the turn then drew away while kept to her task. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO chased the loose
pacesetter four wide, faded on the turn then came again to gain place. DISTORTED VIEW hustled to a clear lead, was collared into the stretch and
weakened. ET'S MOON MAIDEN showed speed along the inside, bid briefly closer on the turn then faltered. MINING CHROME dropped well behind then
passed fading rivals in the stretch. DATE NIGHT KISSES dropped back early and lacked a response. CAJUN COUSIN broke alertly and raced close up
then stopped after half a mile.

MOONCHILD rated inside off the leaders, bid three wide on the final turn, moved briefly clear, lost the advantage briefly in the stretch then came again
gamely. PURRFECT MISTRESS hustled to the front inside, vied through the final turn, gained short lead but was outfinished. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT
prompted the pace outside, came wide into the stretch, loomed a threat again but could not get by the top pair. PLIANTLEA settled off the pace near the
inside and faltered on the final turn. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE lacked speed racing wide and stopped abruptly.

OUT DANCING pursued the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch then remained safe under steady encouragement. CARROLL GIRL saved ground
to the stretch, angled out, loomed a threat but was outfinished. CHRONOLOGY hustled to the front inside, moved clear, was collared into the lane and
continued willingly. COLLIN'S GREY LADY raced off the pace between rivals and lacked a solid rally. ARGENTINA GIRL was urged just off the leaders four
wide and came up empty in the stretch. OUR UPTOWN GIRL steered wide in the opening quarter and stopped abruptly in the stretch.
