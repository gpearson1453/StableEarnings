TOQUETHER (IRE) struck the off side stall at the start and came under brief coaxing, chased along the inside from just off the pace, got set down angled
four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had LEMON BOMB tip out from in behind a trio nearing the eighth pole, got nudged and bumped
repeatedly by that rival creating a seam for herself, absorbed the bumps fighting on gamely to the finish and was just up to score on the wire. LEMON
BOMB two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the
turn and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied behind foes and tipped out nearing the eighth pole nudging and bumping the aforementioned foe out to
create a lane under a left handed crop, continued under a left handed crop continuing to bump TOQUETHER through to near the finish and just missed
getting bested by a whisker on the line. EVERY TIME coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under pressure from a pair
through the latter portion of the turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat clinging stubbornly to command until caught
in the final strides to the finish. LOVE TANK tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well through to the finish and missed for it all at the end. TAP IT UP four then three wide
in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. WILL BE FAMOUS chased three
to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. EIN GEDI (IRE) broke out at the start bumping
BELLA MICHELLE, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to pressure the front through the latter portion of the turn and got set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in between foes and weakened in the late going. NIGHTSABER (GB) chased three wide patiently
handled until let out spinning from the two path into upper stretch, then offered no response. BELLA MICHELLE bumped at the start by EIN GEDI, chased
just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MARIA FROM MIAMI got steadied at the
start, chased four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LADY EMPIRE coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside, faded midway on the turn and went two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

DOT'S DOLLAR was bumped soundly at the start and had the rider knocked off balance, recovered in the saddle then strode to the front, dictated terms in
the two path around the turn, responded well when shaken up in the four path into the stretch, drew off under a mild hand-ride into the final furlong and
proved much the best under very light encouragement to win handily. FUNNY JOKE broke in then bumped soundly with the winner and was last to
commence, settled at the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, was roused just inside the five-sixteenths, paused off heels while guided
six wide into upper stretch, leveled out inside the three-sixteenths, moved in inside the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place.
INEVTABL CONECTION pressed the pace on the inside of the leader then dropped back before the half-mile pole, shifted from the rail to the three path
early on the turn, chased the winner five wide into upper stretch and tired. MOVING PICTURES moved out while off the pace, dropped back near the
half-mile pole, went around the turn in the three path, moved to the rail outside the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
SMOKIE EYES angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead briefly near the half-mile pole then regained the advantage,
scampered clear when set down into the stretch, drew off under the crop into the final furlong, remained under the crop into the final sixteenth then was
placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. SWEETEST PRINCESS went three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, was
roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BERNING HONOR bumped
hard with a rival at the start, was taken under a strong hold early, saved ground around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, came under urging
between foes in the two path on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead to the furlong marker then swapped to the
proper lead and improved for the show. MIM broke out at the start, established a forward position early, remained out in the four path around the first turn,
prompted the pace while racing with her head-cocked to the outside while well off the fence, briefly held an advantage around the half-mile pole, vied in the
two path while asked on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. BERNT AGAIN broke out at the start, went three wide on the turns,
came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HERE WE GO AGAIN was taken up while tight against the rail leaving the chute, moved
out down the initial straightaway, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. MAP
was taken in hand while forwardly placed early, rounded the first turn in the two to three path, was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back inside on
the far turn and came up empty. SWEET BLUSH was reluctant to load, bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up, swerved out
leaving the chute, angled in down the opening straightaway, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, moved from the
two path to the four path around the final turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and was no factor. LUNA LOCA went three to four wide on the turns and
also was no factor. SARAH'S DIALED IN was reluctant to load, settled on the inside, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, dropped back along the
rail on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and capitulated. IN GOOD TROUBLE navigated the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was
urged inside on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. JOEY THE FISH broke out and bumped hard with a foe then was
taken up, saved ground on the first turn, moved out under urging on the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and also faltered then was eased but
walked off.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER away to the front, settled in hand forwardly placed in the two path as JALEN JOURNEY showed the way to his inside, got given a notch and
advanced to steadily gain on that leader taking command near the three-eighths marker while remaining patiently handled, had rivals in behind and
alongside get busy through the latter portion of the turn and remained on hold taking the inside route into upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to
go to a light drive and quickly drew off to the sixteenth pole, then got geared down inside that station to prevail comfortably at the finish. EASTERN BAY
chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on
well clear of the rest to be along second best. DRAFTED four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch, weakened to the finish while along for the show honors. SOUTHERN DISTRICT chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the
turn, angled four wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact. JALEN JOURNEY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand
along the inside, came under pressure with half a mile to go and got placed to urging near the seven-sixteenths as the eventual winner ranged up to the
outside, yielded the front with three furlongs to run, cut the corner into upper stretch under a drive and weakened to the end.

Footnotes
AMERICAN APPLE was taken in hand while showing speed then rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path around the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, made a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the lead, responded well under threat from the runner-up in the final furlong and held gamely
under a right-handed crop. REDIFINED settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch,
closed well to make an outside bid into the final furlong, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place. DANSE MACABRE settled
off the pace, saved ground on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths just off heels, was given her cue in the two path at the quarter-pole, followed the winner
past the three-sixteenths, chased that foe to the wire and finished with good courage for the show. DONTLOOKBACKATALL brushed the inside of the gate
at the start, was taken in hand early while inside of a foe and hugging the rail, settled just off the heels of an opponent, was held up off heels while saving
ground around the turn, shifted four wide while still behind horses at the quarter-pole, moved out for clear room at the three-sixteenths, held a good striking
position under a drive into the final furlong but lacked the needed response and flattened out. PERSONAL PURSUIT bumped hard twice with a foe at the
start then was taken up and slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, raced near the rear, went around the turn in the two path, steadied behind
horses coming to the quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved position. SWEETLOU'SGOTACES bumped hard twice with an opponent
at the start and was slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, settled near the back, went three wide on the turn, came between horses at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOW LOVELY settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused
three wide at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. LITTLE LINZEE broke out and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the
inside of an opponent, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. FLEETFOOTED was hustled to the front, set
the pace while inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. SWEET HARMONY broke in then was corrected
by the rider, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and tired. ATOMIC GIRL was bumped at the start, settled on the outside,
moved in late on the backstretch, went three then four wide around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS settled in the two path, tipped to the three path late on the second turn, settled outside down the backstretch, ranged up in the three
path around the final turn, made an outside bid while set down in upper stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear coming to the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady handling. BYE BYE MELVIN went straight to the front, opened up a clear advantage along the rail, was
challenged on the far turn then asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive outside the furlong marker, fought on with the winner until
outside the sixteenth-pole then proved no match while gamely holding the place. ASTRONAUT followed the leader in the two path, tracked that foe down
the backstretch, issued a challenge on the final turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled between foes into the final furlong and also
proved no match for the winner while just able to hold the show. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) was reserved while inside to the two path, came under urging
around the final turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then quickly tipped further out, chased outside while remaining on his inside lead to the wire and just
missed the show. SOLDIER RISING (GB) was unhurried at the rear in the two path, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased the leaders under a
drive into the final furlong, steadied while lacking room at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the show. ADHAMO (IRE) broke a bit slow,
settled comfortably on the inside, moved up late on the backstretch, was roused on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the
needed response. GUFO settled on the outside in the three to four path without the benefit of the cover, came under urging with three furlongs to run, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally.

SKYLANDER got bumped at the start in a chain of bumping begun by CASH IN A FLASH breaking inwards, chased two then three wide, came under
coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and tucked back to the two path before commencing a strong bid angling four wide into upper stretch, took over
command straightened away into upper stretch, went clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. FROMANOTHAMUTHA five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while well clear of the rest to be along second best. STORIED FELLA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. CASH IN A FLASH broke in at the start bumping SLOW
DECISION into WIN FOR GOLD and in turn that rival into SKYLANDER, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. WIN FOR GOLD got bumped and pinched between foes at the start due to pressure
from the aforementioned foe, came under hustling and advanced to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and was overhauled by the eventual winner straightened away into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. SLOW DECISION got
bumped solidly at the start by CASH IN A FLASH and in turn bumped WIN FOR GOLD into SKYLANDER, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two
path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. MAXIM MOMENT broke in at
the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S A MIA was reserved in the two to three path, moved forward while between foes on the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get
the lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear outside the furlong marker, raced under a strong hand-ride into the final forty yards then was eased up with a
safe advantage. NEW GINYA ducked in at the start and was last to commence, saved ground while reserved towards the rear, was held up under strong
restraint around the far turn then steadied near the five-sixteenths, came off the rail while roused at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch, shifted
further out nearing the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place. SARATOGA CHROME went around the first turn in the two path, was
rated just off the pace, traveled two wide while let out on the far turn, paused off heels at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved
out, pursued the winner into the final furlong, kept on well to the wire and secured the show. JUST OK IS NOT OK tracked the pace on the outside in the
three path, made a bid when asked on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.
RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA tucked into the two path entering the first turn, was reserved towards the back, raced between foes in the two path on the far turn,
shifted four wide into the stretch, was forced out nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. FORTY SMOOTH went to the front, showed
the way on the inside while in hand, was asked under threat coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. TAPPLE CIDER
was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out under a drive in the stretch and failed to rally. LADY OF THOROTON tossed her
head while becoming very rank under steadying restraint early, continued keen in the two then three path around the first turn, was reserved outside down
the backstretch, moved from the three path to the five path on the far turn, raced just off heels at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. LA VICTORIA went
four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
MOULY established the front just after the start coming in slightly to fill the space left void by LACEY UNDERALL, showed the way in hand along the inside
patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. OAK
LOVES A FIGHT chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on
to secure the place honors. GUIDANCE just off the inside near the rear of the field, saved ground throughout coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. JOCOSITY tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. HONOR STAR just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. MUCHO MAMA MIA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled
seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. LEMON RED got bumped at the start by BOURBON DIVISION, who broke inwards, chased three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN chased two to three wide, tipped out four wide put to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. DATS A SUPERSTAR forwardly placed two to three wide in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and folded. LACEY UNDERALL lunged at the break getting away at
the rear of the field and was forced to briefly steady when MOULY came in slightly to take over the vacant space, saved ground at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. BOURBON DIVERSION broke in at the start
bumping LEMON RED, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home
to the finish.
