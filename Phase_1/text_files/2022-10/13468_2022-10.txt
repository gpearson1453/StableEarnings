Footnotes
MORE BUBBLY broke alertly and established the early lead, set quick fractions while pressed through the turn, drifted out a bit nearing the top of the lane,
took a narrow advantage to mid-stretch, was kept to task through the late stages and gamely prevailed in the final strides. MEET THE SHERIFF showed
speed and stalked the early fractions, came in tight a bit through the turn while along the rail, vied for the lead in upper stretch, kept pressure on MORE
BUBBLY into the final furlong but could not get by that game winner in the end and was second best. EVENEREVENWORSE showed early speed, raced
close to the pace to the turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, was outkicked late and held for third. SIERRA MELODY
chased the pace and made a mild late rally in the drive. WHOA BUDDY broke out a the start, tracked the speed two deep through the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. THEYREMINISCEOVERU bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased three wide on the turn,
swung five wide into the stretch and did not produce a late rally. SATANTA chased from the rear, saved ground to the top of the stretch and was not a late
factor.

Footnotes
STANFORD BAY broke alertly and showed early speed, set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead in mid-stretch and proved best in the final
sixteenth. HAY JUAN was forwardly placed early on, gained ground two then three wide on the turn, chased his stablemate to mid-stretch and was
outfinished late, while holding for second in the final strides. AYRTON SENNA chased from the rear to the turn, steadied while in tight quarters entering the
bend, angled out in upper stretch, found his best stride late and rallied to secure third. NIGHT PROOF was hustled to be close to the early pace, maintained
position through the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and just missed for third. FASCINATED rated off of the
early speed, lost ground while along the rail on the turn, lacked room nearing the top of the lane, was asked for run in upper stretch after finding racing room
but did not offer a late rally. THUNDER OF ZION was off a step slowly, chased the early pace, checked in tight quarters entering the turn, improved position
two wide nearing the top of the lane, was not able to threaten late but did produce a mild late rally.

Footnotes
TRULY FABULOUS settled off of the quick early fractions, angled off of the rail nearing the top of the lane, closed determinedly in the drive, drifted out while
gaining ground in the final sixteenth and was up in the final strides to secure the win. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE broke alertly and showed good early speed,
set quick fractions through the turn, drew clear and extended the lead into mid-stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth, was caught in the final strides for the
win and was well clear of the rest for second. BIG CHICK bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early speed while saving ground,
improved position in upper stretch, was no match for the top two in the final stages but was clear for third in the end. JUMPING JILL FLASH showed early
speed and tracked the solid early pace, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. MISS
FLAWLESS (FR) was slow into stride and lagged through the early going, raced off of the rail through the turn, trailed into upper stretch, showed good late
interest but was not a factor. GARDEES WORLD chased the early pace, could not match strides on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the
late going.

Footnotes
SAFE COMBINATION was well placed in the early stages, stalked the reasonable pace from a two wide path, slipped to the inside on the far turn, lost
ground in upper stretch, closed determinedly in the final stages, came within aim in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. ROARING TIGER
broke alertly and showed early speed, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear along the far turn, had a long lead to mid-stretch, was tiring
in the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from SAFE COMBINATION, could not hold that one off in the end and was nailed for the win, while holding safely for
second. HANS GRUBER was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, was roused four wide nearing the top of the lane, finished well in the late
stages and was unable to reel in the top pair but was clear for third in the end. WILL IS CHILL broke a bit awkwardly then was shuffled leaving the start and
settled at the rear early on, was unhurried to the second turn, swung widest into the drive, was unable to impact the leaders in the end but showed good late
interest. QUE SERA SIR RALPH came four wide along the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced along the backstretch run, stalked the pace three
wide on the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faded in the drive. MY LITTLE TAYLOR came in tight on the run into the first turn and
steadied nearing the seven-furlong marker, stalked the pace into the backstretch run, lost position nearing the half-mile pole, lacked a response on the
second turn and gave way late. BROKEN FINGER showed early speed and attended to the early pace while three deep, prompted the fractions through the
backstretch run, lost position four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MURPHYS TIGER tracked the early speed, was roused three deep nearing the quarter marker, came to even terms with ALMANERA and battled with that
foe to mid-stretch, took a narrow advantage to the final sixteenth, was kept to task late and just lasted over quickly oncoming rivals. BOBBY'S ALIBI rated
off of the early pace, came two wide to the quarter marker, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed with a rush in deep stretch and just missed for
the win, while earning the nod for second. GERLACH'S was unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the quarter marker, closed fast inside of the
furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and just missed for the win and place and was clear of the rest for third. ALMANERA (IRE) was hard sent
leaving the break and showed good early speed, felt pressure nearing the quarter marker, met the bid of MURPHYS TIGER leaving the turn and battled with
that one to mid-stretch, could not match strides in the drive and yielded in the late going. CHIEF JACKSON was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked
the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

WITH THIS VOW was well placed in the early stages, tracked the quick pace through the backstretch run, came within aim while three deep nearing the top
of the lane, advanced to vie for the lead in mid-stretch, took command in the late stages and kicked clear in the end. STOIC LUNA was allowed to settle,
came three wide on the second turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, was not able to reel in the winner in deep stretch but finished well to secure second.
MOMMA MOCCA settled off of the quick pace, improved position three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final
stages for second but was clear of the rest for third in the end. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide to the second turn,
came in tight in upper stretch, found racing room and gained ground in mid-stretch but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. NAVY QUEEN threw her head at
the start and was away slowly, lacked speed through the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, was not able to threaten in the drive and passed
tiring foes late. PROOF OF JAZZ engaged with STARSHIP ENDEAVOR soon after the break and disputed quick fractions with that rival, dueled on the front
end to the second turn, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. ROSE PRINCESS was forwardly placed early on,
tracked the quick fractions through the backstretch run, could not keep pace on the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR was
away in good order, dueled through fast fractions with PROOF OF JAZZ, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION showed early speed and tracked the quick pace, was roused two wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive,
was kept to task through deep stretch and won in a drive in a good debut. STRUT ON LOUIE was forwardly placed in the early going, gained ground three
wide nearing the quarter marker, chased the winner to mid-stretch, was outkicked late and held for second in the final strides. RACHEL'S COACH was
bumped at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the quick pace two wide, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the drive and was clear
for third at the end. ITS THIEVERY broke in at the start, lacked speed to the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, gained ground in mid-stretch and
finished evenly in the final stages. HOT ROD JIMMY was away a bit awkwardly as the rider lost balance in the first strides out of the gate, was unhurried
early on, came two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into upper stretch, improved position in the late stages but did not produce a late kick.
LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO chased the quick pace from the second flight and did not threaten in the drive. ZACCHEUS broke alertly and showed good early
speed, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch, chased that one to mid-stretch and gave way in the
final stages. UPDRAFT was shut off at the start and took up soon after the break, spotted the field in the opening stages, trailed to the top of the stretch and
was not a factor. ZHIVAGO broke in a tangle and was away a bit slowly, raced from midpack while not far back through the turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
THE LONNA RANGER showed early speed and tracked the pace to the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the second turn, came three wide to the top
of the lane, headed BIG BROTHER in mid-stretch, dueled with that game foe to the wire and determinedly prevailed in the end. BIG BROTHER settled three
wide off of the early fractions, loomed inside nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was confronted by THE LONNA RANGER inside of
the furlong marker, dueled gamely to the wire, was bested in the final strides and was well clear of the rest for second. LOOKOUT POINT was allowed to
settle, improved position in upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up for third in the final strides. RING GENERAL was forwardly placed in
the early going, stalked the pace while saving ground to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was not able to produce a late kick and was just edged
for third in the final strides. TEX HANLEY settled off of the early pace, maintained a two wide path to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, re-rallied in the drive and was outkicked in the final stages. RIO KING was shuffled back at the start and was off a step slowly, saved all of the
ground to the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. RESERVENOTMET showed early speed and stalked the solid fractions, lost position on the
second turn and gave way in the stretch run. MASK OFF was sent to the early lead and cleared the field into the first turn, set decent fractions through the
backstretch run, was caught in upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker and faded in the late going. COUSIN MARK rated four wide off of the early pace,
improved position along the backstretch run, lost ground four wide on the second turn, could not sustain his run in the stretch and flattened out late.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS was crowded at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried while three wide early on, came four then five wide on the far turn and
did not threaten in the stretch run. MANY AMBITIONS lacked early speed, could not keep pace on the far turn and was not a factor.

DANCE LADY stalked the quick early fractions, advanced along the backstretch run, was roused two wide nearing the top of the lane, took command into
the drive, drew clear into mid-stretch and pulled away in the late stages. SASSY EINSTEIN was allowed to settle, improved position on the backstretch run,
slipped to the inside along the far turn, advanced in upper stretch, was not able to reel in the winner in deep stretch but stayed on well late to be second
best. MOONSHINE CAT bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the opening half-mile, saved ground to midway through the far turn,
swung five wide into upper stretch, finished well in deep stretch and secured third in the final stages. SHANGHAI MIST was hustled to get to the early lead,
set quick fractions through the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter marker, could not hold off DANCE LADY leaving the second turn, chased the
winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the late going. LIGHT UP was pinched back at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground to the
second turn, improved position in upper stretch, came in tight inside of the furlong marker and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. CONNIE'S PROMISE
was sent to show early speed, attended to the solid pace through the backstretch run, could not keep pace on the far turn, chased to mid-stretch and
weakened in the late stages. LAST INNING raced in the second flight early on while rating off of the quick pace, moved outside of rivals along the
backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally on the far turn, could not sustain that run and flattened out in the drive. LADY COMMISH saved ground while
settling off of the early pace, dropped back on the far turn and was not a factor. FRONT OF LINE (GB) was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the
pace three wide through the backstretch, lost position three then two wide on the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and faltered in the final furlong.

EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT saved ground early on while unhurried, maintained a rail trip to the second turn, mounted a five wide rally in upper stretch, came
within aim in mid-stretch, offered a good late kick in deep stretch to take command and edged away in the final strides. SUPERMAZEL was allowed to
settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, loomed three wide nearing the top of the lane, continued that advance into upper stretch, was outkicked in
the drive by the winner but stayed on well late to be second best. TUSKEGEE CAT was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set moderate
fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, dueled with PARTY FOUL to mid-stretch, could not match strides
with the top two in deep stretch and just held for third on the line. PLAISIR was a bit rank early on while just off of the pace, settled along the backstretch
run, re-rallied on the far turn while two wide, vied for the lead in mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and just missed on the wire for third. TABLE
FOR TWO broke in a tangle and was off slowly, lacked early speed through the backstretch run, advanced five wide on the far turn, finished evenly in the
drive and just missed for third in the final strides. BIG SPIN was allowed to settle, lost position four wide on the far turn and was not a factor in the stretch
run. LEN'S LUCK settled off of the early pace, was never far back while racing in the second flight, came two wide along the far turn and did not offer a late
response. PARTY FOUL showed early speed and attended to the moderate fractions, prompted the pace to the quarter marker, dueled with TUSKEGEE
CAT to mid-stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages. PEACE TOUR raced up close to the early pace, lost ground
on the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC STRIKE was away in good order, tracked the pacesetter to the turn, was asked to go after the leader approaching the quarter pole, drew even
exiting the turn and drew off under a brisk hand ride. ANGEL'S ADVOCATE broke well and easily gained the lead, appeared to be going comfortably
through the turn, met a challenge from ATLANTIC STRIKE at top of the stretch but was outfinished, though kept on well to hold second. A DIME FOR ME
got away from the gate a step slowly, had to steady a bit when KITTY'S CANDY took her path, thereafter made steady progress towards the leaders on the
backstretch run, saved some ground around the turn, appeared a threat at the top of the stretch but flattened out a bit, still running on well enough to
outgame MY LEGAL BET for the show. MY LEGAL BET broke out at the start, straightened and quickly established a three-wide stalking position, made a
strong bid to challenge passing the 1/4 but couldn't sustain and was outfinished for third. KITTY'S CANDY broke in a bit at the start and bumped with
ATLANTIC STRIKE, then took the path of A DIME FOR ME, settled near the back of the pack while in the 3-4 path, was under a steady hand ride from the
three-furlong marker but never found another gear and finished somewhat evenly to the wire. PERSUASIVE LIPS was bumped at the start by ANGEL'S
ADVOCATE, lacked much early speed from that point, was under heavy pressure past the halfway marker but was never a threat and was not persevered
with late. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN fell to the back of the pack after the break, was asked for more speed passing the seven-sixteenths pole but was unable
to muster a rally.
