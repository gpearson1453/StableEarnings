Footnotes
SIGNATOR bobbled at the break slightly and was bumped by CRUPI who recovered inwards from a stumble, conceded three to four lengths to the front
before coming under brief light coaxing to advance three wide down the backstretch to be just off the pace, tucked to the two path through the turn and
came under coaxing just outside the quarter pole angling in to take the inside route into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, then
drew clear under a light drive before being geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish. WEEKEND TIZZY bobbled at the break for the initial two to
three strides before regaining his footing to vie briefly inside a pair of rivals, established sole command and showed the way settled in hand just off the
inside under some pressure from TABEGUACHE to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat, swung three wide into upper
stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to run, proved no match for the top one while running on to safely preserve the place honors. CRUPI stumbled at
the start recovering inwards into SIGNATOR, chased three wide down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. MINDTAP five wide
in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. INFLATIONARY vied briefly
early on before settling four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got pushed along with five-sixteenths to go, went five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. TABEGUACHE vied briefly early on before easing off to prompt the pace of WEEKEND TIZZY to the outside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and was shaken off straightened away, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
SIGHT UNSEEN brushed from both sides from the gate, settled into a stalking role, moved up to contest for the lead as the field headed for end of the
backstretch, took over and slid onto the inside route shortly past the half mile pole, continued on the front feeling some pressure from the outside, shifted
into the two path when put to a vigorous hand ride stepping onto the top of the lane, kicked away to a comfortable advantage during the ensuing furlong,
then held sway while kept busy. MAKART checked after making some contact with the winner in the shadow of the starting gate, went on to take up the
chase at the back of the back, pulling on the right side, raced towards the three path on the turn, angled a couple of paths wider for the stretch drive, failed
to keep pace with the top one but won the fight for the place. SINFUL DANCER assumed a forward position after stumbling at the start, pressed the issue,
initially three wide then from the two path by the five-sixteenths pole, was moved out in the direction of the four path for the beginning of the stretch run, got
outfinished. SECRET SANCTUARY off the rail, pursued the pace two wide on the turn, gave way. TUESDAY'S CHILD brushed at the start, set the pace
from along the inside until approaching the half mile pole, offered little resistance when the top one drew up alongside in the general area of that station,
backed away steadily thereafter.

SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY away in good order, took up position along the inside route, rated well while tracking the front runners, moved up after
entering the far turn into a tighter fit from the pocket, got cued up for heading for the head of the stretch, attained a clear seam in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths marker when LAUGHING BOY shifted into the two path under a hard drive, unleashed a bold bid, narrowing striking the top with a furlong
to go, vied on near even terms with the second place finisher for most of the way home thereafter, dug in to prevail. KINETIC SKY three wide on both turns,
kept watch with the pacesetter within striking range, tipped four wide into the lane and got set down, closed the gap, was the outermost of a threesome on
near even terms with each other after completing the run through the furlong grounds, fought heads apart with the top one from just beyond the eighth pole
onward, wound up denied. TWO THIRTY FIVE underwent a two pursuit to the the quarter pole racing towards the rear, swung into the lane, chipped away
at the deficit, drifted out slightly in the late stages, grabbed the show award. GIRL DAD stalked the pace from path two, bid for command approaching the
quarter pole, failed to take over then weakened. LAUGHING BOY established control in short order, went over the rail prior to reaching the top of the
clubhouse bend, came under pressure during the opening stages of the stretch drive succumbed.

INTERPOLATE prompted the leader three then two wide from the outside, got set down spinning three wide for home, seized command straightened away
and edged away under a drive kept to task. ROYAL POPPY broke out at the start bumping LOOKINFORBARGAINS in tandem with DIVINE CROSS,
showed the way in hand along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths facing some pressure from the aforementioned foe, spun just off the inside
for home, yielded the front straightened away and ran on clear of the rest to be along second best. SPUN SPECIAL broke in at the start and was corrected,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened in
the late stages. DIVINE CROSS broke in at the start bumping LOOKINFORBARGAINS in concert with ROYAL POPPY, strode green early on and was
tipped out seven to eight paths off the inside, went four wide through the turn and then seven wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish.
LOOKINFORBARGAINS got bumped between foes at the start, chased just off the inside climbing a bit green early on until tucked inside through the turn,
swung three to four wide for home and passed tired rivals. MATERIAL WITNESS coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. AZARIA four paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide and suffered a catastrophic injury nearing the three-eighths marker, buckling and losing the rider as a
result, remained upright pulling herself up in distress and was attended to by veterinarian and subsequently euthanized on track. There was a Stewards'

quarter pole before being set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive kept to task. GEOMETRIQUE chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while improving position to
secure the place honors. MISCREANT chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages. TEMERITY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
IRONIC LADY broke out at the start, chased four then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. BELLESHAZZA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and folded. SINGALONG chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping out three then four wide placed to coaxing midway on the
