Footnotes
LUCKY FREEDOM broke awkwardly, raced off the early pace, moved up four wide past the quarter pole, surged late and just got up under strong
encouragement. FAIRVIEW was off slowly, moved up along the inside around the far turn along the inside, continued a rail bid in the drive and finished
gamely to the wire. SAENGER STAR checked at the start, raced near the back of the pack early on after the troubled beginning, made an advance through
the far turn from the outside of rivals, made a wide bid in the drive and rallied gamely to the wire. LADY LANCER was bumped at the start, sent along to set
the early pace from the inside, had a clear lead through the upper stretch and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. GO NIKKI GO was bumped at the
start, raced two deep near the quarter pole, angled five wide and made a late gain. CULPA BLANCO pressed the pace from the outside and weakened late.
JIMMYDABOOK vied for the early lead while racing between rivals and faltered in the stretch run.

COCO SHELL settled off the early going, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished strongly to be clear late under steady handling. THE GRAYT
PUMPKIN raced off the early going, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole and rallied for the place position while racing four deep. DART stalked
the pace, hard ridden through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. IN DETAIL chased the early pace while
racing three wide down the backstretch, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. Z'S SO GOOD was coaxed along early from the
outside of rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MOON SIGN stumbled at the break, raced at the back of the pack early, angled seven wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a rally. EXCALIBRATE crossed over from the outside to set the early pace and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LITTLE VIC nice clean start from the inside, dueled along the rail around the turn, fought off outside rival in deep stretch, went clear late under a drive.
RADICAL RIGHT slow into stride, raced well off the early pace and along the inside, shifted off rail and split rivals leaving the quarter pole, stayed outside
for clear run, surged past the furlong marker, up late for the place. SPIKEZONE outside dueling early, locked in battle around the turn, could not keep pace
with winner in deep stretch, stayed around for the show money. A DANGEROUS GUY raced off the duel and along the inside, saved ground around the
turn, when asked leaving the quarter pole, bumped with outside rival, even strides through the wire. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE tracked the leaders after the
start, between runner into the turn, faded through the stretch. EPIC LUCK slow into stride, never a threat.
