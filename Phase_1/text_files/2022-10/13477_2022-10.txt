gained the lead entering the stretch, vied with inside rivals into the final furlong, drifted in and bumped with BOLTS BABE midstretch and held gamely.
DASH AWAY was off slow to begin, pulled a bit on the clubhouse turn a bit off the rail, made it through a tight spot between rivals entering the stretch,
brushed with LA PEER then rallied rallied five deep late and gained the place. LA PEER got bumped and stumbled leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack on
the inside, brushed with DASH AWAY near the eighth pole, altered out then altered back inside, rallied between late and missed the place. JENNIFER'S
D'LIGHT sped to the front and angled to the inside, set the pace with BOLTS BABE alongside, vied with rivals with a quarter mile left to run, lost command
into the stretch, fought back from inside and stayed on gamely to the line. BOLTS BABE pressed the pace from outside, bid between rivals at the quarter
pole, had the rider lose his whip in upper stretch, bumped with the winner midstretch and got outkicked late. FOURTH STREET broke out and bumped rival,
pulled along the rail into the first turn, stalked on the inside, tipped out on the far turn, angled out further in the stretch and failed to produce a bid. THREE
STRANDS steadied between rivals early, tracked outside a rival in mid-pack, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and weakened. SAKURA
FLAVOR (IRE) was off slow to begin, trailed two wide then three wide into the lane and was not a factor. HARD BUT SMART hesitated and spotted the field
several lengths, traveled three wide near the back early, took the second turn two wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MICKY FROM WEXFORD dueled outside NICE GUY CLAY to the turn, put away that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, showed the way two wide into the
stretch and was kept to task under right handed urging and steady handling late. NICE GUY CLAY dueled inside the winner to the turn, could not keep pace
with five-sixteenths left to run, tipped out and chased off the rail into the stretch, followed MICKY FROM WEXFORD through the final furlong and was clearly
second best. KATTATH checked behind steadying rival early then began to climb, was taken out into the clear trailing the field, went four wide into the turn,
moved to the three path then steered back out with a quarter mile remaining, showed a mild response and was along for the show. CONSTANT CONFLICT
stumbled leaving the gate, chased three deep then between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. DUTCH BUS steadied
between rivals early, chased two wide then angled to the rail entering the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to rally. TROUBADOUR chased four
deep early, three deep on the turn, remained wide into the stretch and flattened out. PIONEERING PAPA chased on the inside out of range, got shuffled
back by DUTCH BUS entering the turn and tired.

Footnotes
AMI PLEASE broke well and came out a bit then became rank early, set the pace on the inside under pressure, cleared on the far turn, met the challenge
from ANACARO entering the lane, battled head to head through the stretch run and held gamely. ANACARO got forced out and bumped rival early, tracked
three then two wide on the first turn, loomed three wide with a quarter mile left to run, drew alongside AMI PLEASE entering the stretch, battled down the
lane and could not get by. DIVINELY BOLT got forced out early, raced outside a rival near the back, traveled two wide on the far turn then tipped out leaving
the bend and took aim at the top pair, failed to summon the needed response but finished a clear third. TEA N CONVERSATION got forced out early, trailed
two wide early on, traveled three wide on the far turn and passed tired rivals. ROSE ROSE ROSE was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside off the
pace, waited for room on the far turn then tipped out near the quarter pole, came two wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. THREAD COUNT broke a
step slow, lugged out shortly after, pressed the pace in hand outside the leader, lost contact on the far turn and chased two wide into the stretch and faded.
SPANISH DESTINY got forced out and bumped rival early, stalked two wide then moved inside, asked right handed leaving the far turn and faded. HALF
NELSON raced up close outside the top pair four then three wide early, continued three deep up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

MIDNIGHT MEMORIES stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, chased the leaders off the rail then went up between foes three deep into the backstretch,
took a short lead at the five-eighths pole, lost command at the half-mile pole but continued to vie three deep to the far turn, battled through the far turn and
into the stretch three wide, regained the lead under right handed urging in upper stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and drew away. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE
prompted the pace from outside then vied between foes up the backstretch, took a short lead at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch, could not
kick on with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to secure the place. EMPIRE HOUSE broke well then was taken in hand, was a bit keen on the first
turn and moved to the two path, continued to give chase two wide through the far turn, steered out in the lane and failed to get up for second. SOOTHSAY
bumped with MIDNIGHT MEMORIES at the start, went up to take the lead then vied along the inside, battled through the far turn, fought to upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. SAMURAI CHARM was prominent early three deep into the turn then went four deep into the backstretch, lost touch with
the leaders near the half-mile marker, chased four wide around the second bend, was no match in upper stretch and eased through the final furlong and
walked off.

Footnotes
SPEED BOAT BEACH hopped slightly at the start then was forwardly placed early outside the pacesetter, drew alongside nearing the quarter pole, took
over into the stretch, then drew clear from HELLADIC under right and left handed encouragement. HELLADIC sped to the front while drifting in up the
backstretch, challenged by SPEED BOAT BEACH nearing the quarter pole, relinquished command entering the stretch, stayed on through the lane and held
the place. AH JEEZ was off slow to begin, settled on the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, tipped out and rallied between foes late to gain the show
honors. MAS RAPIDO (GB) was off a bit slow in the beginning, tracked along the rail into the turn, tipped out nearing the quarter pole, put in a mild late bid
and got edged for the show. WOUND UP was off slow to begin, dropped back and angled inside, got blocked when running up behind AH JEEZ near the
three-sixteenths pole, tipped out then altered out at the eighth pole and finished willingly. STRAIGHTEN UP raced up close near the inside then had his path
taken and steadied at the half-mile pole, chased two wide through the turn and faded. ARMAN broke slow, sat off the pace outside a rival, went between
rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, moved out in the drive and lacked a rally. FLAME RIDER was off slow to start, traveled in mid-pack outside a rival early on,
raced three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the lane. TALTARIATE dropped back off the pace, trailed off the rail around the bend and
failed to menace.

CE CE got bumped from inside at the start, stalked the top trio off the rail, bid four deep around the bend, gained the lead and moved into the three path
leaving the turn, drew away under hand urging and held safely under a tap of right handed encouragement late. UNDER THE STARS got knocked into
outside rival at the start, prompted the pace from between rivals, kept the pressure on through the turn then chased CE CE into the stretch, finished
determinedly in the final furlong and whittle the gap on the winner late. TEDDY'S BARINO broke out and bumped UNDER THE STARS, set the pace inside
a pair of rivals, maintained command through the turn, was overtaken entering the stretch, flattened to third, bled and walked into the van following the race.
SCENIC MASTERPIECE stumbled and broke out in the beginning, attended the pace outside the top pair early, remained three wide through the turn, then
weakened down the lane. COVER VERSION was off a bit slow to begin, lagged behind to the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S CODE hopped at the start then went up to duel outside SMILE FOR GLORY for command, inched ahead into the turn, cleared approaching the
quarter pole, urged left handed then held safely when flagged with the right handed crop. ORTH trailed into and around the turn, cut the corner into the
stretch, tipped out and split foes midstretch and finished well to keep gaining on the winner to the wire. EXCLAMATION got bumped from outside at the
start, chased the leading pair on the inside into the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, lacked a late bid and held the show. SYNNIN AND WINNIN
raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, two to three wide around the turn, got floated out a bit nearing the eight pole and missed the show. SMILE FOR
GLORY dueled for the lead to the turn, lost touch with the winner nearing the quarter pole, then flattened along the inside in the late stages. STREET
HUMOR threw his head, broke in and hit the gate then bumped inner rival, traveled three deep near the back, came four wide into the lane and was not a
factor. BAG'S GOLD raced off the pace, traveled between rivals then two wide into the lane and failed to menace. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK raced erratically
in the early stages then chased off the rail or outside a rival out of range, moved closer through the turn, drifted out nearing the eight pole and weakened.
MEMORANDUM was off a bit slow, raced on the inside near the back, tipped out at the top of the stretch, bobbled at the eight pole and was not persevered
with late. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF STREET HUMOR AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND
IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
DRAMATIZER settled inside, angled three wide leaving the far turn, moved out further in upper stretch, rallied five deep and proved best late. SIXTEEN
ARCHES (IRE) chased three deep then tipped out at the top of the stretch, bid four deep in the lane and got outkicked by the winner. CLADDAGH CURE
dropped back to last on the inside, trailed two wide into the stretch, steered out and launched a late bid and missed the place. ALMOST A FACTOR rated
three deep early, vied three deep on the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, led into the final furlong, clung to a narrow advantage entering deep stretch
and yielded late. BELLE CHERIE bumped leaving the gate, was forced to steady first time in the stretch, stalked between rivals and tugged a bit on the
backstretch, lacked room in the lane and gained a clear path when it was too late. BIG MAMA SUE broke a step slow and brushed leaving the gate, traveled
two wide off the pace then between foes, raced in tight past the quarter pole, entered the lane four wide, moved out further and kept on in the furlong
grounds. GET ON THE BUS showed early speed, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, held command to
the quarter pole then was overtaken, fought to the sixteenth pole and flattened. DENDERA was keen early pressing the pace while in hand, coaxed along at
the five-sixteenths pole, fought between to the sixteenth marker and flattened out. BARRISTER'S RIDE unhurried in the beginning, raced outside rivals then
got floated out to the four path entering the first turn then moved out five wide, traveled three deep into the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and
could not rally. EMERALD LAKE away quickly then became extremely rank when trying to rate first time in the stretch and clubhouse turn, settled into a
stalking position on the inside, lacked room in the lane and was not persevered with late. AAS DE FAUST (GB) bumped leaving the gate, checked along the
inside and rank first time in the stretch, drifted to the three path entering the first turn, pulled up alongside the leaders on the backstretch, dropped back on
the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and had little left.
