Footnotes
RUNWAY MAGIC vied for the lead outside of AMERICAN PURE, dueled with that foe through the lane, battled gamely while getting brushed late, then
prevailed via a head-bob. AMERICAN PURE was hustled out of the gates to set the pace inside of a vying RUNWAY MAGIC, sparred gamely with that foe
through the lane, came out and brushed him in the final sixteenth, then lost the nod on the wire. LEBLON took a bump from an outer rival at the start,
tracked in the four path, pursued the leaders under urging around the turn, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over at
the sixteenth pole, and chased the embattled leaders home to prove best of the rest. SOROS lunged in and bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed the
top pair three wide, but gave way turning for home. READY PURSUIT chased along the inside and faded. PRIMER DIMER was outrun.

Footnotes
ARISTOCRACY took a mild nudge from an inner foe soon after the start, set the pace inside of a vying HAROLD'S CLOUD, sparred with that foe around the
turn, held gamely in the long duel through the lane, and lasted to the wire. HAROLD'S CLOUD vied two wide, dueled around the turn, sustained the long
battle while not quite drawing even terms with his inner counterpart's, then failed to reel him in late. ONCE UPON A DREAM stalked three wide, was roused
entering the turn to pursue the embattled pair, then chased them home while not threatening, and lasted from an outer rival for show. DARIO laid off of the
pace in the two to three path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and rallied through the final furlong to miss reaching show. LEOLA tracked
in midpack along the inside, split foes two wide through a narrow seam approaching the five sixteenths pole, then ran on while failing to menace from the
rail. FURTHER EVIDENCE lacked speed in the three to four paths around the turn, moved forward between horses turning for home before fanning seven
wide entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. NO EASY DAYS bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but faltered passing the
three furlong pole, steadied while getting surpassed and put to tight quarters along the rail at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. FIRST CLASS
HARLOW broke a step slowly, trailed around the turn, then improved three wide and between horses at the furlong grounds. RATE CONFIRMATION
tracked two to three wide, failed to progress while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, but weakened.
SOUTHERN CRUSH saved ground far back, altered two wide and outside of a troubled NO EASY DAYS at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to make an
impact while hanging on his left lead. LUCKY'S SECRET bobbled a bit while bumping an inner rival at the start, brushed an outer rival in the aftermath, then
chased from midpack four wide, and faded while floating six wide entering the lane. IDRATHERBEBLESSED lacked speed while caught five wide around
the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TREPAT vied for the lead two wide, gained an advantage approaching the lane, and kicked clear in upper stretch. O'CONNER SUNSET rushed after a
flat-footed beginning to set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that foe turning for home, and was second best. DOC BALLARD was being
straightened by the assistant starter when the gates opened and came out slow, raced far back in the three path, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach show in the late stages. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL broke a step slowly and was slow into gear in the
opening stages, shifted outside of a foe leaving the chute, rushed forward down the backstretch to a four wide tracking position nearing the turn, tucked
three wide while chasing at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to menace while hanging on his left lead through the lane, and faltered. ULUMALU saved
ground off of the pace, tipped three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to menace. ATTILA THE DUN was slow early on and lagged behind the field
along with another foe early on, then surpassed tiring rivals. CHELONIAN stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the turn, then tired through
the lane. RIVER BOY stalked three wide, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. MARTINI SHOT lacked speed in the two path, and
weakened.

Footnotes
GIANNA'S GIFT set a clear pace, remained in hand as a pair of foes narrowed her margin around the far turn, then tired through the final furlong as an outer
TELLMEONASUNDAY menaced, yet desperately lasted to the wire. TELLMEONASUNDAY stalked two wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn,
closed in on that tiring rival in the final furlong while failing to switch leads, bid in the final sixteenth, but hung. TILTINGATWINDMILLS stalked along the
inside, but lacked a bid. MAGICAL PEAPOD tracked two to three wide, but gave way entering the lane. JOY OF TREASURE saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail. JULIAISON raced at the rear three wide early on, and was outrun. SPEIGHTFUL CHARGE lacked speed two wide, and tired.

Footnotes
STREET READY set the pace from the outset, raced along the inside down the backstretch and far turn, was in the two path into the lane, widened a bit
near the eighth pole and held way in the final stages. KING VEGA (GB) was steadied into the first turn from the inside, raced along the rail early on, stayed
near the rail into the lane, made a bid down the lane from the inside and was up for place in the final stages. SPANISH KINGDOM tracked the pace early,
was in the three path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but missed place in the final stages. VINTAGE PRINT raced back early on, was in the three
path into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in the stretch run. DARK SHIFT (GB) was bothered at the start and raced unhurried early on, was
in the two path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch drive. SKYRO stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch run. JAIS'S SOLITUDE was bumped at the start and never a threat. PERFECT SPEIGHTY was in the four path into the lane and never a factor.
BE HERE was bumped around at the start and raced evenly throughout. DECISION MAKER showed little. NATURAL POWER (IRE) came in at the start
and was through after a half. NEWSWORTHY was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane.

HAPPY IS A CHOICE vied for the lead early on two wide, took over command near the five sixteenths pole, was in the three path into the lane and drew off
late in the stretch under a steady drive. ZED chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in
the stretch but was no match for the winner in the late stages. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL was a tad slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the three
path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. BOLT FORTY FIVE set the pace early from the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane and faltered in
the stretch drive. MORE THAN FIVE raced back early on, was on the inside along the turn, in the two path into the lane and improved position down the
lane. LET IT RIDE CLYDE was never a factor. GREAT BARRIER was never a threat. THE MOTTO was done early. YACHT ROCK (IRE) was through after
a half from the inside. TIME THE MARKET chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and faded down the lane. GO LITTLE ROCKSTAR was
always outrun.

TEMPLE CITY TERROR raced back early on, was in the four path along the final turn, swept past foes at the top of the lane, cleared the field nearing the
eighth pole and widened in the final stages. LUCK MONEY was a tad slow at the break, chased the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane while
making a bid but was no match for the winner in the late stages. SISTER OTOOLE was reserved early on, altered out into the five path in the upper stretch,
made a bid down the lane but flattened out late in the stretch run. COASTANA tracked the pace early on from the inside, stayed near the rail throughout and
weakened late in the stretch drive. FLYING FORTRESS dueled early along the inside, backed off down the backstretch, was inhaled in the upper stretch
and faded late in the drive. MIA MARTINA was unhurried early on, raced in the four path along the final turn, fanned into the seven path entering the lane
and moved up late in the stretch run. CORE VALUES was never a threat. BESIDE HERSELF dueled early on while two wide, cleared the field along the
backstretch, was on the inside into the lane and gave way down the lane. STAND TALL chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and empty
late in the stretch drive. GO BIG BLUE NATION was never a factor. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE QUARTER TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CLOUDY saved ground in midpack, tipped outside of the leader to take aim passing the three sixteenths pole, bid in the final furlong, gained an advantage a
sixteenth from home, and edged away. IAN GLASS vied along the inside, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught entering the final sixteenth. EVAN
SING settled in the three path, swung to the nine path approaching midstretch, and rallied willingly. AGENT PETER GRAVES bobbled and bumped an outer
rival at the start, stalked behind the leading pair from the two path tipped outside of the entering the lane, but failed to bid while hanging on her left lead, and
weakened through the final furlong. SANCTIFIED laid off of the pace along the inside, darted five wide while altering course outside of rivals leaving the
three sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick. CALL ME MIDNIGHT broke a step slowly, took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, waned to the six path
in upper stretch, but had no rally. OF THE MOMENT failed to menace in midpack three wide. CASANOVA KITTEN tracked in the three path and between
horses, floated four wide entering the lane, but tired. PURE PANIC was pinched back between horses just after the start, trailed along the inside, and made
little impact. GALLANT GUY tracked four wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, and gave way. DREAMER'S DISEASE vied for the lead two wide, but
failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart entering the lane, and faltered between horses at the three sixteenths pole. LYRICAL POET bumped an inner
rival while breaking on top, but was intentionally wrangled back off of the pace, retreated to midpack two wide approaching the turn, then continued to
weaken among foes through the bend.
