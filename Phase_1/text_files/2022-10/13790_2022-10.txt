Footnotes
WICKED INTENT was fractious in the gate, raced unhurried down the backstretch and into the far turn while along the inside, stayed along the rail into the
lane, got through near the eighth pole, tipped into the two path nearing the sixteenth pole when reeling in the leader, quickly cleared and widened to the
end. DECREE OF LOVE vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn, repelled the dueling challenger into the lane and cleared, was no match for
the winner inside the sixteenth pole and stayed on to be second best. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the
three path on the far turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while gaining energy late. BEL ARIA vied for the lead while two wide from the
outset into the lane then could not keep up. BIA BOLT RUNNER chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, angled into the lane from the three
path and weakened inside the eighth pole. TOO CROWDED was in the three path through the far turn and lacked a bid. QUICK CONVERSATION raced in
the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the three path and weakened while floating to the rail. BICKERMENTS was in the two or three
path through the far turn and never was a factor. GRAN CHEMIN chased the pace from the two path into the backstretch then steadily faded.

Footnotes
MARINA'S GOLD stalked the pace in the three path, rallied late five wide and was in time under mild urging. VIEWERS DISCRETION stalked the pace
inside, bid at the quarter pole, went clear and was caught at the wire. ALEATORY was clear early, led inside, then drifted out late and was caught. SEIVER
raced in the two path, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't close late. SAKONNA was off awkwardly, raced in the two path and bid late inside. MISS
MATCHMAKER raced in the four path and lacked a late bid. LAYLA'S SONG pressed the pace outside of the leader, then faded. JOEZINE lunged at the
start, was eased and was vanned home.

three-eighths pole and gained the place late. DEEP DISH dueled outside of a foe and yielded in the stretch. BOURBON BUNS hopped at the start, then
raced inside. DIAMONDS N DENIM dueled inside of a foe before giving way in the stretch. GIFT WRAPPED saved ground before fading.
