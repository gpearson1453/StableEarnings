Footnotes
WELL ACTUALLY battled outside through the turn for the lead, put that pace rival away at the top of the stretch and dug in stubbornly to hold off the closing
challenger late to hold on for the win. SWEET BOMBOLINI had a good trip settling on the rail just behind the engaging frontrunners through the turn, split
foes at the three sixteenth pole, was gaining steadily on the winner through the stretch and just lost out for the victory at the line. FOXY DIVA tracked mid
pack inside at the half, tipped out in the seven path with a quarter to go and finished up well closing belatedly to get up for a clear third. GENEVA contested
for the lead inside through the turn, gave way to the winner at the top of the stretch and ran well enough the last eighth on the fence to hold for a minor
share. TRILLING SONG broke a bit slow on the start, hustled up the rail to sit behind the early frontrunners entering the turn, was shuffled back inside at the
half mile marker, shifted out to be six wide for the drive and could not be a factor to the wire. HARD ROCK WARRIOR lacked early speed and trailed down
the backside, angled widest in the eight path at the top of the lane and could only pass tiring rivals through the stretch. TUDOR PEAK put in an early move
travelling four wide outside of foes at the half, was in contention between horses in mid stretch and stalled with an eighth remaining. REES settled near the
rear in the beginning, was last at the top of the stretch, had little to offer for the drive and could not get involved running to the wire. FOREST VIXEN put in a
mild run racing three wide between foes mid point on the turn, loomed in the four path at the top of the stretch and stopped at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ORBALINE settled at the rear, moved five wide outside rivals past the half, took the lead by the quarter pole, drew clear in the stretch and was kept to the
task. PINO IN A PURSE tracked in behind between runners, switched out four to five wide midway on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep, was
second best. D'S SOUL had the early lead then ceded it to another rival content to press early, lost ground on the turn, switched outside foes in mid-stretch,
kept on to get up for show over BOSSALINA, who took closer order into the turn racing four wide, ran on and was outfinished for third. SEA ANNA DREAM
tracked in behind along the inside, was not a threat. NICE COMPANY moved forward inside to set the pace, came off the rail turning for home, turned up
empty.

Footnotes
GABBY SQUARED was bumped at the break and trailed the field in the early stages, started to rally weaving her way through traffic in upper stretch, found
clear running room splitting foes at the furlong marker and punched through while on the wrong lead to get up late for the win. BILLYJANE was reined back
to track the early speedsters into the turn, took closer order angling out to the six path for the drive, took command briefly at the eighth pole and could not
find more to hold off the closing winner late. DANGER settled in mid pack racing three wide through the turn, was in range of the leaders at the top of the
stretch, split foes inside rallying at the eighth pole to be involved up front and tailed off nearing the wire costing her second at the line. DANCE RHYTHMS
tracked on the rail in mid pack throughout the turn, had to wait to angle off a fading rival in upper stretch and showed some interest in the late stages to get
up for a small award at the finish. GREEN GABLES chased the early speed on the turn, assumed command at the three sixteenths marker, began to give
way with an eighth to run and faltered the final sixteenth. SPARKLE SAMMY hopped and broke inwards at the start, rallied three wide midway on the turn,
angled out to be seven wide contending turning for home and stalled at the furlong marker. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD was bumped at the break, settled near
the back down the backside, was roused four wide on the turn, shifted outwards to the eight path at the top of the stretch and was empty for the drive.
PRINCESS HALIME broke out when the gates opened, quickly recovered to lead through the turn, was collared in upper stretch and weakened on the fence
with an eighth to go. FEDALIA advanced up the rail at the half mile marker, had nothing to offer inside with three sixteenths to run and tired the last eighth.

Footnotes
BABY MO lacked early speed but soon steadily advanced between runners late up the backstretch, found room three wide and between at the top of the
stretch, engaged the leader in mid-stretch, dueled outside that one and edged past late under steady urging. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND dueled inside a rival
on or just off the rail into the turn, dispatched that one at the top of the stretch but was soon joined by another foe, moved out to engage with that one, kept
on gamely but was outfinished. TAPITURE WAY stalked the leading pair, went four then five wide on the turn, was no match for the top two. MIA'S
AUTHORITY raced outside off the leaders four to five wide on the turn, shifted in once in upper stretch and improved position. MY GIRL HOOTER shifted in
to head into the turn two to three wide, ran on evenly. THESKYISTHELIMIT got away about three lengths slow, settled at the rear, angled eight wide into
upper stretch and ran on. SHELLY THE ROCKET dueled outside three wide drifting four wide into upper stretch, came up empty. SHISHKA was unable to
threaten while racing near the inside. STUNNING RIVERS swung nine wide into the stretch, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART battled inside for the lead at the half, began to put away her pace rival at the quarter pole, opened up on the field at the furlong
marker and cruised home to win comfortably in the end. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO was bumped at the break, settled in mid pack three wide on the turn,
advanced four wide to contend at the two furlong marker and closed belatedly to be a non threatening second at the wire. SILENT DIVA broke outwards at
the start, stalked near the rear down the backstretch, rallied five wide between runners at the top of the lane and contested for the place award in mid
stretch before giving away while holding onto third money late. MY GIRL GABBY tracked the dueling leaders four wide on the turn, loomed into contention at
the quarter pole, chased the winner in vain until the furlong marker and stalled in the final sixteenth. PANIC SWITCH settled at the back in the beginning,
was asked for run around the turn, rallied four wide two furlongs to the finish and showed some energy late just missing out in a photo for the minors.
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was brushed by an inside foe at the start, recovered to battle outside for the top spot at the half, gave way between challengers at
the quarter pole and faltered through the lane. SUNSHINE GIRL had good tracking position behind the early pacesetters with three eighths to go, lost
ground to the field on the turn and had little to give for the stretch run. SPARKLING SILVER was ridden inside of horses to keep up with the field mid point
through the turn and retreated on the fence in mid stretch to be a non factor at the line. QUEEN'S IMAGE trailed the field and could never get involved.
SAMETIMENEXTYEAR was roused into the turn to keep inside position, steadied on the rail at the five sixteenths marker and was not persevered with
through the lane.

Footnotes
TAQUANYAH stalked in behind, asked for a bit more midway on the turn while moving out from three to four wide, drifted in a touch in upper stretch, struck
the lead outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SILVER BULLET LADY was urged at the break, set the pace from outside, dueled with an inside foe to
the turn, dispatched that one, met the challenge from an outside rival, edged to be just clear in upper stretch then was engaged by the winner, dueled briefly
but was no match. HENRY'S GAMBLE settled outside toward the back, moved out from three to five wide coming to the quarter pole, captured show
honors. FIRST ROUND PICK tracked in behind, went two wide on the turn, kept on to get the nod for the minor award. SWINGING MANDY stalked the
leading pair early from outside, bid three wide coming past the quarter pole under urging, evened out in the lane. DIXIE MORNING raced toward the back
inside, came out five wide turning for home, went evenly and made no bids. AMERICAN GAMBLE moved forward inside to press the pace, dueled while
never getting in front, came up empty.

Footnotes
MY FINAL TRICK was roused after the start to get the lead, continued to set the fractions on the turn, drew off when asked at the top of the stretch and won
comfortably at the wire. EVER SO D'WILD tracked just outside in the second flight down the backside, took closer order to the leaders at the quarter pole
and found another gear in deep stretch to get up for place nearing the finish. SILENT GUROO broke sharp to lead early, was taken a hold of while inside
nearing the half, angled outside off the fence at the three furlong marker, chased the winner in vain through the turn and faded late losing the place award
close to the finish. FRERET broke outwards to begin, advanced up the rail early on the turn, had to wait briefly inside nearing the quarter pole to angle off a
tiring runner and finished up with interest between runners. TAKE IT EASY was situated near the back down the backside, offered a mild run three wide two
furlongs from home and levelled out the final eighth. ONEZY'S DREAM settled near the back in the early stages, was roused four wide in upper stretch and
passed a straggler through the lane. MI TORMENTA was taken back after the break to trail and was never a presence afterwards. GIMBALA stumbled at
the start, recovered and rushed up to be near the front, gave way at the quarter pole and backed through the field on the fence down the lane. RIDERS

Footnotes
FIVE DAYS IN MAY angled in early, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, swung nine deep into upper stretch, put to a drive and edged
past approaching the sixteenth pole then held well. TOUCH OF ROUGE was allowed to settle toward the rear, advanced inside foes early on the turn,
moved out a couple paths, was held up in behind at the quarter pole, blocked briefly in upper stretch, found room between at that juncture but was
outfinished. MIDNIGHT MEADOW stalked from outside, bid four then five wide taking the lead at the top of the stretch but was outfinished. SPEAK
ENGLISH stalked from just off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. ROYAL CITY REIGN tracked in behind racing off the inside, shifted ten
wide through the stretch and kept on late. GORMLEY GIRL was ridden along midway on the turn going three wide on that bend and off the leaders, kept on
evenly. SOMEONE ELSE vied outside two to three wide then inside a foe turning for home while drifting out a bit, faltered and faded. WAKE UP MAGGIE
raced off the pace three then four wide on the turn, swung ten deep into upper stretch, failed to rally. ASHA IRONBORN vied inside, gave way.
