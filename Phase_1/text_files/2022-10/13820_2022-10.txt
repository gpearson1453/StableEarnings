Footnotes
TRIBAL QUEEN came away in good order, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three path around the turn, shook clear while four wide into
upper stretch, responded well under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead when put to a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole, switched back to the proper lead while still under the crop in the final strides and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. LEXI'S
SPIRIT broke in at the start, chased the early pace, became rank into the kickback nearing the five-eighths, remained rank under restraint past the half-mile
pole, drafted in the two path while leveling out some around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then tipped to the outside at the three-sixteenths,
pursued the winner under a drive to the wire and clearly secured the place. GEYSER ROAD hit the inside of the gate and was off a bit slow, raced well off
the pace under urging, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured the show. QUARREL chased the
pace on the inside of a rival, raced in the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened. EMBRACE ME broke a bit slow, was
urged along on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went three then four wide around the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up
empty. INDYAN PENNY broke in and a step slow, was urged along while last but one, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. LADY
CARAGGIO (IRE) came away in front, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn and faded. INFLUENTIALOUS chased the
pace on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and retreated. ROMANCE PELUSA stumbled at the start and was off slow, angled in at the rear,
moved out near the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the three path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SCILLY CAY broke out then drifted out while hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe while well off the rail, vied in the two path on the turn, was
asked while moving clear inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when roused for more into upper stretch, drew off while given one tap of a down-turned
whip inside the three-sixteenths, powered away under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. EVEN
THUNDER broke out then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD dropped back between horses then angled to the inside,
saved ground under urging around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MUSICAL
AMERICA was forced out at the start, settled on the far outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch
and capitulated. PRAYER BOOK was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went around the turn in the two to three
path and trailed.

Footnotes
UMBRIA pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path around the turn, gained the lead passing the five-sixteenths, shook clear in
the three path into the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead while extending the advantage under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched back
to the proper lead inside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. BRUNATE dropped back while taken in hand early then moved
to the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and was second best. READY
TO MARCH angled in while going to the front, showed the way under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, dropped
back into the stretch and weakened but earned the show. BOX OF JOE raced well back in the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, drifted
out inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. R BOY CHEEKUM chased the pace, dropped back near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn
and tired. BINGO JOHN was last to commence, moved out early then was sent hard, raced on the outside while hard ridden, went three then four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OUR AMERICAN STAR dropped back and showed no speed, went two then three wide under
urging on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MISTER LARRY moved up between foes then raced just off the pace, dropped
back in the two path while lugging out some under extra left-rein pressure on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SWEET WILLEMINA was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, came off the rail into upper
stretch, dueled inside of the winner to the wire and gamely held a share of victory. SELF ISOLATION stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the three path
around the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and shared the victory. TAP THE FAITH was rated while
tugging keenly at the bit, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide under urging outside the five-sixteenths, gained outside under a drive into
the final furlong, loomed a threat to the top two into the final sixteenth but finished evenly and settled for the show. FAR AWAY LOVE (ARG) was well
placed just off the pace, chased inside around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive and lacked the needed kick. ITS COLD IN DEHERE
settled just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and came up empty. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled off
the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, raced between foes passing the three-sixteenths and tired. HALO CITY was slow into
stride then angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was carried out by the winner in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe to the wire and missed
while well clear for the place. LIFETIME OF CHANCE broke out and bumped with an opponent, chased inside through the turn, shifted four wide into upper
stretch and weakened while best of the rest. BINGOOD TO KNOWYA was bumped at the start and forced out, brushed with another foe early, took an
awkward stride into the kickback near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. LEFTEMBEHIND broke a bit slow then
was taken up in tight between foes then dropped back, spotted the front several lengths, raced well off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn and
improved position to just miss the superfecta. INSPECTOR broke out and bumped hard with a foe, jostled with a rival early, was urged along off the pace,
rounded most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MAX FOSTER was urged along on the
outside, went four then three wide on the turn and also failed to respond. SCREEN DOOR was forced out at the start then checked while pinched back
between horses, spotted the front several lengths, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch, angled out
near the furlong marker and was no factor. TWO CHUCKLES was fractious in the gate, broke a half-step slow, was urged along on the outside, moved in
late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. PLAYINGWITHMATCHES broke in and bumped hard with a foe, jostled with that
same foe early, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
THIN WHITE DUKE bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while settling off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, tipped
further out for room inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. PRIME FACTOR moved out while
settling towards the front, was asked while three then four wide on the turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, took the advantage inside the
furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. SEVEN SCENTS bumped with foes on both sides at the start then was
taken up while pinched back, spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, gained behind a wall of horses under light
coaxing into the final furlong, lacked sufficient room to mount the needed charge at that juncture, was roused while finally finding clear room between horses
at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show in a tough trip. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was urged along off the pace, steadied leaving the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into upper stretch, pursued the vanguard in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the show while able to
get the last spot in the superfecta. TURN OF EVENTS was coaxed along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and finished willingly but just missed the superfecta. KOBE TOUGH tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path around the turn,
gained a short advantage in upper stretch, lost the lead to the runner-up inside the furlong marker and was out-kicked. RUNNINGWSCISSORS angled in
while going to the front, set the pace with a clear advantage, was challenged on the outside while in the two path around the turn, lost the lead in upper
stretch and weakened. NOBLE EMOTION was well placed just off the pace, raced inside to the two path around the turn, chased behind horses in upper
stretch, was taken in hand while faltering in the final furlong and capitulated. BATTLE STATION was coaxed along on the outside, went three to four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FAUCI bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the
turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

KNOW IT ALL AUDREY disputed the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down
into upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. MIA BEA STAR moved out while void of speed, went three wide on the
turn, gained into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. CHAYSENBRYN moved out while climbing a bit towards the rear, was urged five wide on
the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. RACING COLORS steadied briefly while taken in hand early, settled off the pace, was
roused while saving ground on the turn and came up empty. I'M NERVOUS NOW raced just off the pace down the backstretch, chased three then four wide
on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated. SISTER SUPREAM contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
dropped back outside the quarter-pole and faded. RAFFINITY tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four then five
wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
MIGHTY ATLAS showed speed then tracked on the outside, made a bid while five then four wide on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch and held under
steady urging. PROVISION broke out and bumped hard with a foe, contested the pace on the inside of opponents, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
lead before the five-sixteenths, came out behind the winner into upper stretch, kept on well to the wire and safely secured the place. WYNN GIANT was
hustled from the gate, dropped back under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn and improved for the show. ATLANTA'S ACUNA bumped with a
foe after the start, contested the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and tired. TONY O lost his footing at the start then bumped with foes on
both sides, climbed a bit early, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. THETHRILLOFVICTORY moved out
while urged along, chased in the two path around the turn and tired. ROYAL FOX HILLS bumped with a rival after the start, went three wide on the turn and
was no factor. AULA broke in at the start, was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. BARRY THE BUILDER bumped
hard with a rival at the start, contested the pace between horses, chased three then four wide on the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch and
faltered.
