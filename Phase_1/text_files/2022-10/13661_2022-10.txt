GOLDEN DECISION raced in the four path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid approaching the half mile pole, raced in the
three path from there, was carried wide into the stretch and dueled gamely down the lane to get up late. FROSTED INDIAN led the way on the inside
through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around the far turn, drifted wide entering the stretch and battled gamely to the wire to just miss.
COMEDIC TIMING raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. COLONIST raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. KOKO STAR pressed the pace from the three path through the opening half mile,
began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
TUSKEGEE AIRMEN tracked four wide around the first turn, moved up between runners headed into the second turn, shifted inside under a vigorous ride
midway around the far turn, under an all out drive leaving the furlong marker, went clear in deep stretch. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE dueled along the inside,
stayed locked in the tussle around the far turn, shook off outside foe heading for home, could not hold off late rush from inside rival, clear second under the
wire. RICCIO saved ground around the first turn, rated off the pace and along the inside, shuffled back nearing the three eights pole, regrouped and shifted
out seven deep through the stretch, gaining late. DATAMAN veered out soon after the start, four wide tracking around the first turn, three wide pursuit
second turn, no late kick. SALOON took part in the early duel, outside position when sent after the lead leaving the quarter pole, faded through the stretch.
MEAN TWEETS slow to get into stride, never a threat. THERE WERE TWO CLAIMS OF FOUL IN THIS RACE, RIDER OF RICCIO, CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF TUSKEGEE AIRMEN FOR INTERFERINCE NEARING THE THREE EIGHTS POLE, STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS
INSUFICENT EVIDENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE. THE TRAINER OF MEAN TWEETS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RICCIO FOR
INTERFERIANCE NEARING THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS NO FOUL COMMITTED AND THE ORDER OF
FINISH REMAINED AS IS.
