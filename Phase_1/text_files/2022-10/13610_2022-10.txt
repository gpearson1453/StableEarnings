ICY STORM was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted out, made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole, then had a long drive with
HELOSTHISMARBLES and prevailed late under a drive in a gutsy score. HELOSTHISMARBLES was well rated early, made a four wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, then had a long drive with the winner while on the inside but was outfinished to just miss, good effort. KAZ SUGAR BANK was rated along
early, saved ground on the turn and angled out in the furlong grounds and finished willingly to gain the show award. STAY HYDRATED set the pace on the
inside and then vied for the lead by the quarter pole on the inside and weakened. A T M AWESOME tracked the pace three wide and tired. BOURBON
CURRENCY was reserved early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. ECONOMIC POWER was off a step slow, then advanced four
wide on the first turn, made a three wide bid on the far turn and tired. UNION LEADER was off a step slow and never factored.

SAW THE LIGHT tracked the pace four wide, came into the lane four wide, then had a late surge the final sixteenth to get up in time, driving. AMAZINGMAE
prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear leaving the turn, remained clear by the sixteenth marker but had nothing left
and was nailed on the wire. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY set a pressured pace on the inside and faded in the lane, bested rest. RIPPA chased the pace two
wide and came three wide into the lane and had no kick. MS KAYS COWGIRL was bumped at the start, reserved early, came five wide into the lane and
had no rally. GOLD DOLL chased the pace on the inside and weakened. MISS JUNEBUG was fractious in the gate, checked leaving the chute and was not
a factor.
