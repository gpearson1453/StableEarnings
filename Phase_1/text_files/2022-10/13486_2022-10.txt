SILVER STICK STAIR away alertly set the pace under measured handling through the turn drawing off in upper stretch being ridden out. DE PURA
SANGRE stalked the pace while saving ground being dispatched by the winner in upper stretch angling to the three path holding up for place. YO YO MON
well back early lagged through the turn coming five wide in upper stretch eliciting a modest rally from mid track. NATIVE VALLEY veered out bumping at the
break, saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly on the rail. CANELITA chased early wavering on the turn giving way from the eighth pole.

TILL THEN in tight checked briefly at the break, sat back to the far turn mounting a bid there circling out surging past all drawing off down the lane while full
of run. LEVANTO (ARG) gained on the backside moving evenly through the far turn finding best stride late along the inside. BIG FALCON ROCKET gained
on the backside pressing on the far turn being overpowered from the outside mid turn chasing to upper stretch proving no match there weakening late. RY'S
REVENGE dropped back early playing no factor. SAINT SCOTTY stalked the early pace fading on the far turn. TRIBULATION hustled clear was reeled in to
the far turn wilting down the stretch.
