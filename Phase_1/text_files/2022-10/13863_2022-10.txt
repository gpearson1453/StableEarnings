Footnotes
JOAN'S WAY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, tucked after an inner foe faltered at the three furlong pole as the battle continued with her
outer counterpart, then disposed of that rival in upper stretch, drew off, and remained clear after flopping back to her left lead nearing the final sixteenth.
ALSANAH chased the dueling trio from the inside, gained show while tipping to the three path and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, shifted further
out in upper stretch, and ran on to catch a tiring rival for place in the late stages. TOTO'SRUBYSLIPPERS dueled for the lead three wide, then two wide
after passing the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, weakened while hanging on her left lead through the
final furlong, then lost place approaching the wire. AVARIE chased two wide, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and tired. TRUST FUND BABY
was fractious in the starting gates while waiting for others to load, then lagged behind into the turn, saved ground, then improved along the rail while hanging
on her left lead. PACIFIC GROVE stumbled at the start and never got involved. JAMS TOP SHELF dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but readily
gave way at with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
SURCHARGE tracked four wide, grinded away through the lane, floated five wide while producing a bid entering the final sixteenth, and forged an
advantage late. BIG JAVA brushed an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, chased those embattled foes from between horses through
midstretch, crept closer in the final furlong to produce a bid among rivals while four wide entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by his outer bidding
counterpart. DALLAS VOLUNTEER chased from midpack along the inside while under steady urging, shifted off of the rail while pursuing the top pair on his
left lead in midstretch, slipped through tight quarters among rivals three wide entering the final sixteenth, and gained show late. VERY WEALTHY pressed
two wide, vied around the turn, dueled through the lane with a very narrow advantage, but was outkicked by a trio of foes outer foes in the final sixteenth.
BAYSHORE FOXES set the pace inside of a pressing rival, sparred with that foe around the turn, sustained the duel through midstretch, but was overhauled
by outer rivals in the late stages. FORTUNE BOUND broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and
chased the leading group while minorly closing the gap. WICKED WONDER tracked in midpack in the five path around the turn, got floated to the six path
while not progressing in upper stretch, and failed to menace. CANDY KICK broke a step slowly while being bumped by rivals on both sides, took the turn in
the five to six path while very far back, and failed to factor. MA CHERIE was off a step slowly while bumping an outer rival at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
LE DA VIDA (CHI) took a bump from an inner foe at the start, rated at the rear four wide, pursued a bidding MARIAH'S PRINCESS into the far turn, tracked
that foe around the bend, then took aim outside of her in upper stretch, ranged up in the final furlong while hanging on her left lead to gain an advantage
entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. MARIAH'S PRINCESS tracked three wide, swept past foes four wide entering the far turn to strike the front with
five sixteenths to go, tucked two wide entering the lane as an inner WILL'S SECRET fought on, turned away that rival in the final furlong as an outer LE DA
VIDA (CHI) loomed large, and got outkicked by that foe at the sixteenth pole. WILL'S SECRET bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the
pace, slipped inside of rivals into the far turn to press an outer newly leading MARIAH'S PRINCESS around that bend, but flattened out approaching the
final sixteenth. BYE BYE BERTIE stalked in the two path, shifted outside of the leading pair down the backstretch, but was outmoved by an outer foe into
the far turn, chased three wide and between horses around that bend, and yielded turning for home. ENVOUTANTE laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, then along the inside around the far turn, and was no factor. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) set the pace inside of a pressing foe while tucking to
the rail around the first turn, cleared nearing the far turn, but was headed by bidders on both sides with five sixteenths to go, and weakened. LADY
VALENTINE pressed two wide while in the four to three path around the first turn, vied entering the backstretch, but weakened between horses entering the
far turn.

Footnotes
MY KENTUCKY GIRL shook her head about moments before the stalls opened and came out a beat slow, laid off of the pace two wide, gained inside of
faltering foes turning for home before tipping back two wide in upper stretch, closed in quickly on the top pair approaching the furlong grounds, drove past
those rivals from the inside leaving that station, and kicked away with a good finish. OLGA ISABEL set the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path
entering the lane as an outer MERCY WARREN presented a bid, clung to a margin before repelling that foe at the furlong grounds, but was swiftly outkicked
by an inner bidding rival passing that juncture, and was second best. FEELING HAPPY trailed two wide, shifted out in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly
in the center of the track through the final furlong to achieve show approaching the wire. HYPERSPORT stalked along the inside, but failed to progress
despite urging turning for home, and gave way through the final furlong. MERCY WARREN pressed the leader from the outside while kept in the three path
into the turn by that rival, ranged up while floated out approaching the lane, drifted to the six path while bidding entering it, vied while not quite even terms
with her inner counterpart through upper stretch, then was turned away at the furlong grounds, and yielded. BRAGANZA broke a step slowly, chased in the
four path and between horses around the turn, then tired through the lane. FINE FAMILY broke slowly, saved ground far back, but to no avail. AUNT
NAUGHTY tracked five wide, but faded turning for home. GINA stalked two wide, but faded at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
GENERAL JIM tracked along the inside, improved to stalk from the pocket nearing the far turn, easily tipped outside of the pace setter entering the lane to
take aim, bid in upper stretch, and spurted away with a quick turn of foot at the furlong grounds. DISDAINFUL (IRE) broke a step slowly before being
crowded between horses at the start, rated in midpack in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, pursued from behind the bidding eventual winner
in upper stretch, also smoothly tipped two wide at the furlong grounds while chasing that clearing foe, and reached place a sixteenth from home. OUR
DREAM RYE'D saved ground while trailing early on, swung six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly to threaten place in the late stages, but was
kept at bay for that position. OSCAR AWARD laid unhurried along the inside, slipped inside of a troubled foe nearing the backstretch, saved ground before
tipping two wide and between horses turning for home, checked mildly and irrelevantly behind foes at the three sixteenths pole, then kept on among rivals
through the final furlong. OTAGO stalked behind the clear leader before tipping outside of him entering the backstretch, pressed lightly around the far turn
while between horses, but was floated three wide entering the lane while getting outkicked, chased through upper stretch, and gave way at the furlong
grounds. RARIFIED FLAIR tracked two wide and between horses, shifted five wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. MENDEL'S SECRET pulled clear
approaching the first turn, set the pace while rank under a hold around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, showed the way around the far
turn before being confronted by the eventual winner in upper stretch, proved no match approaching the final furlong, and weakened on his left lead. IN
GOD'S TIME stalked two to three wide around the first turn, then floated four wide entering the lane before giving way between horses.
BLAMETHEGOODTIMES lacked speed three wide, retreated to trail the field at the nine sixteenths pole, and made little impact thereafter. FASTBYTE
broke slowly, rated far back two wide into the first turn, but bolted to the seven path to avoid a troubled foe nearing the backstretch, got caught four wide
while off of the pace around the far turn, then got floated seven wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. STEELE MONEY was wrangled back after
breaking prominently, laid off of the pace along the inside into the first turn, but steadied out of tight quarters leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole, then made
little impact two wide. HOUSED broke a step slowly before mildly shying from an inner foe at the start, tracked three wide, but faded around the far turn
before shying again from an inner rival entering the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER CHOW set the pace, showed the way uncontested in the two path around the turn, met meager bids from a pair of outer rivals turning for home,
shook free of them entering the lane before shifting out to the four path, and held sway through the final furlong. BOURBON BASH was last away while off
half a step slowly, tracked from the five to path into the turn while outside of the top pair, attempted a bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the
leader in upper stretch, and proved second best. RAISE CAIN chased along the inside, yielded around the turn to trail the field turning for home, yet
regained stride in the three to four paths through the lane, and came again to reach show in the closing stages. SIR LANCELOT prompted the pace along
the inside early on, but shifted out and bumped QUICK HAMMER at the eleven sixteenths pole causing that foe to be pinched between rivals, moved
forward to stalk outside of the lead and from the three path, attempted a bid between horses turning for home, but tired while shifting inwardly in upper
stretch. QUICK HAMMER was pinched and steadied between horses leaving the eleven sixteenths pole causing him to trail, took the turn three wide before
fanning to the seven path entering the lane, but made little impact. JEREMY'S JET was herded into an inner rival by an outer foe at the eleven sixteenths
pole, chased from the four path and between horses soon after, but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
POWER SEEKER was void of early speed, took the turn in the three path before swinging out seven wide approaching midstretch, then rallied outside of
foes as the pace collapsed in the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. ATLANTIC DANCER settled off of the pace in the two path,
shifted six wide in upper stretch, stayed on to bid outside of the tiring leader entering the final sixteenth along with an outer foe, and got outkicked in the late
stages. LUPO'S LEGACY sparred three wide around the turn, led in the five path entering the lane, inched clear approaching the furlong grounds, but was
bested by a pair of outer bidders leaving the sixteenth pole. MAMZOOJ nudged the outer part of the gate when leaving it, tracked along the inside, chased
while mildly grinding away in the two to three paths through midstretch, then improved three wide and between horses entering the final sixteenth.
PLAUSIBLE DENILE chased along the inside, gradually shifted four wide approaching midstretch while continually brushing an outer foe, but lacked a bid in
the final furlong. ARROGATES SPIRIT broke a step slow, tracked the trio of leaders two wide, came into the lane in the four path, chased while getting
brushed by an inner foe five wide approaching midstretch, and yielded between horses. MONTAUK POINT dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart entering the lane, fought on through upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds.
ICEATUDE raced far back in the four path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. HE'S A ANGEL chased in midpack three wide, but
tired in the six path entering the lane. PRICING POWER broke a beat slowly, yet rushed to duel for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but was headed at the
five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch. BOCO showed liltle.

Footnotes
BALNIKHOV (IRE) rated far back along the inside, patiently came into the lane behind traffic, shifted three wide and between horses in upper stretch,
weaved through before finding clear sailing six wide entering the final furlong, surged in pursuit of a leading WIT in the final sixteenth, and reeled in that foe
in the shadow of the wire. WIT tracked two wide, tipped five wide in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, but failed to kick away while
shifting ground inwardly entering the final sixteenth, and was caught late. AXTHELM stalked along the inside, searched for racing room off of the rail
entering the lane, but dedicated to a rail charge in upper stretch, grinded to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer WIT at that juncture,
and fought on. PORTFOLIO COMPANY settled far back two wide, tipped four to six wide in upper stretch, and chased rallying foes while staying on. PLAY
ACTION PASS stalked three wide, vied four wide in upper stretch, but flopped back to his left lead while getting outkicked at the furlong grounds, then was
herded in slightly while yielding between horses. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY set the pace, led from a pair of bidders while in the two path in upper stretch, but
was swallowed up at the furlong grounds. FORT WASHINGTON broke slowly, trailed before swinging to the eight path in upper stretch, and improved.
DOUBLE CLUTCH tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to bid. WOW WHATA SUMMER broke a step slowly, saved ground off of
the pace, moved two wide turning for home, but shifted ground outwardly while getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, and lacked a rally.
READY TO PURRFORM saved ground in midpack, but failed to progress before fading through the final furlong. FUERTEVENTURA pressed two wide, vied
three wide and between horses in upper stretch, but weakened entering the final sixteenth. STOLEN BASE laid off of the pace three wide, and faded.

Footnotes
WEST WILL POWER set the pace in the three path while being kept honest by a pair of outer foes around the first turn, intentionally moved away from
those rivals with eleven sixteenths to go, showed the way via a loose margin while in hand around the far turn, then was set down to sustain his advantage
in upper stretch, and edged further away through the final furlong while being driven home. FULSOME broke a beat slowly, trailed in the two path, crept
closer under steady urging around the far turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to reel in a tiring rival for place in the closing stages.
LAST SAMURAI bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter while in the four path and inside of another foe around the first turn,
chased the clear pace setter from the three path around the far turn before tucking to the rail turning for home, then sustained place through midstretch
while tiring, but was caught approaching the wire. KING FURY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair while kept in the
five path, then chased the clear leader from the four path around the far turn before weakening entering the lane. FIRST CAPTAIN laid off of the pace in the
four path, but came under a drive at the half mile pole, and failed to respond while tiring around the far turn.

Footnotes
MINER'S QUEEN stalked along the inside, easily slipped inside of the leader in upper stretch, and drove clear at the furlong grounds. VIOLENZA laid off of
the pace two wide and between horses, then grinded away along the rail through the lane to claim place at the sixteenth marker. SARA MIA sat reserved in
the four path, shifted five wide in midstretch, and offered a late rally to gain show at the wire. SPICY MARG set the pace in the two path, allowed the
eventual winner up the rail in upper stretch, and yielded at the furlong grounds. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) was timid to gain early forward position inside of
rivals after breaking a beat slowly, tracked along the inside, shifted two to four wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. LEMOS CUNHA saved ground
towards the back, and improved. AMBASSADOR LUNA stalked two wide, but yielded in upper stretch. NEW BOSS tracked two to three wide before being
floated five wide entering the lane, and faded. CHEETARA (CHI) lacked speed in the three to four paths, came into the lane five wide, and gave way.
