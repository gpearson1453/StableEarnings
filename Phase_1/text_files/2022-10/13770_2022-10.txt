drew off under urging. EAU CLAIRE raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, went four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the lane and earned
the place spot. KAZACHAN tracked close up on the inside, waited for room while saving ground on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, lacked a
winning bid and finished evenly for third. SILVER SPRINTER raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, went four wide at the quarter
pole and bested the others. SMART BUCK raced three wide early, stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn and tired. LINEAR THINKING (IRE)
