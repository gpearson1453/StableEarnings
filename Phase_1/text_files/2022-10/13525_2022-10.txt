Footnotes
FLAMAND set the pace while near the inside at once, remained clear into the lane, inched up a bit more inside the eighth pole well roused right-handed
then geared down late when safe. SASSY AND BOLD chased the pace from the two path through mid-turn, was shuffled back as others made their runs
wide, angled from the two to the six path while entering the lane then outfinished the others while clear for the place spot. CARLOTUK settled off the pace
while off the inside, bid five wide into the lane, was a serious contender once straightened but needed more the final eighth. WORLD UNITE was in the
three of four path through the turn and into the lane, well positioned in upper lane then lacked the closing response. BLUSHING BELLE pressed the pace
two wide through the turn, lost contact with the winner in late turn and tired through the lane. PACHANGA LOCA tracked the pace along the inside through
the turn then steadily faded through the lane. WHAT CAN I SAY chased the pace three wide through the turn and was empty after turning into the lane.

Footnotes
GUARD chased the pace from the three or four path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, bid from the four path into the lane, gained a clear lead with
an eighth to go then had to duel with the runner-up the last fifty yards to just stay. BULLBRIAR saved ground throughout, cut the corner into the lane, quickly
moved to the winner, dueled with that one late and just missed. AMAZING JUSTICE was in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the
six path with momentum and moved up to gain the show spot while not a threat to the top two. BOLD BIZNESS set the pace while near the inside through
the turn and into the lane then gave way after straightening in the lane. ROOKWOOD was in the three or four path through the far turn when never far back
then lacked a closing response. SHOTGUN JOE chased the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid with the winner into the lane then faltered from
between rivals after straightening. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY steadily faded while along the inside. EVEN MONEY trailed throughout while in the two path
through the turns.

hold. MACADAMIA (FR) raced in the three path through the turns when in mid-pack, was asked for more in late turn, angled into the six path for the drive
and was closing in. VIEWERS DISCRETION was unhurried while near the inside, gained momentum after straightening in the lane and continued with
energy to the wire. GUN MOLL chased the winner from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path, had aim on the after
straightening then flattened out inside the eighth pole. APPLE EVER AFTER was in the four path through the far turn, angled into the eight path for the drive
and moved up while not a threat. AZAMANA EMPIRE was along the inside through the turns and into the lane and moved up while never threatening.
QUICK ROMANCE chased the pace from the two path into the far turn then weakened in the drive. STRIKINGLY chased the pace from the four path
through the far turn, was well spotted in late turn then was empty in the lane. JACKIE'S LOVE pressed the chased the pace from the two path, dropped out

Footnotes
CLASSIC MAX vied for the lead from the two path through the turn and into the lane, shook clear when straightening then was kept to the task. TUFFER
THAN TUFF was off alertly then settled in to chase the dueling leaders through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive and was slowly gaining on the
top one. MANUELITO was unhurried while off the pace through the turn, gained momentum after straightening in the lane then gained ground through the
final eighth while moving through traffic. CIELO AZUL raced in the three path through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and offered a mild gain
from mid-track. HE'S A WARRIOR raced evenly while near the inside. GOOD SUGAR was never a menace while in the three to the two path through the
turn. BANDIDO DE AMORES was never a factor while in the two to the four path through the turn and finishing in the six path at the wire. AZZARO STEEL
never a threat along the inside. ORO AZTECA dueled two wide through the turn and into the lane and was empty.

inside, went clear in the stretch, then couldn't hold off the winner. SELF RULE was slow to gather, raced inside, bid at the five-eighths pole, was blocked
and then came again late. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF vied between foes, then yielded late. HE'S A ANGEL pressed the pace in the three path, then yielded in
the stretch. STROKE OF MIDNIGHT raced five wide and then had a belated bid. DOM GERVASIO saved ground to no avail. GO BALI GO stalked between
foes, racing evenly. DOUBLE DEALER raced in the five path before fading.

Footnotes
CABOOSE hustled out to lead soon after the start, cleared before the first call, continued with a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane, was
roused one time right-handed just inside the eighth pole, tapped again in the last fifty yards and was never threatened. CORONA GRANDE saved ground
through the turn and into the lane, began gaining momentum when roused in upper lane, continued along the rail to inside the eighth pole, shifted into the
three path and finished well. BUTCH'S BEST chased the pace from the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path, had aim on the top
ones then lacked a closing bid. C. J'S STORM chased the winner from the two path through the turn and into the lane, was well spotted for the drive and
needed more. JENNY'S BEIGNET raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and offered a belated gain. ROCK THE RED was never a threat
while in the three or four path through the turn and into the lane. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE chased the pacesetter from the three path through the turn then
faded through the stretch run. MYSTERY IMPACT never a factor while in the three path. SAN RONIN never menaced while near the inside. HE B READY
was done after going a half while in the two or three path. KAYS HEAVENLY STAR outrun while saving ground. ADDIE'S PEACHES trailed throughout from
the two or three path.
