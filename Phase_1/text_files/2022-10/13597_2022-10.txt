Footnotes
EGG NOG stalked the pace pressing from the half dueling on the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch holding firm under a drive. MON PARADIS gave a
prompted middle move chasing through the far turn then down the stretch a willing second best. RED PIXIE off slowly lagged to upper stretch rallying past
the others there from mid track. MY WYNTER ECHO slow early was outrun through the turn using even action to move up down the lane. SWEET
TOOTSIE LU hustled along chased through the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. NATALIA'S TEMPLE sent clear set the pace dueling on the far turn
giving way in upper stretch. YO YO MON stalked the early pace fading on the far turn. NATIVE VALLEY stalked the pace pursuing through the turn giving
way in upper stretch. INFO'S TREASURE hustled along chased to the far turn flattening out there.
