FUN COOL was hustled early, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. LINDA LOVES LACE was
unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SOMEONE ELSE was away alertly and a factor from
the inside on the turn but had no late kick. LIME stalked the leaders from the outside and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch had no response. NEW YORK COMMANDER was off the pace, showed little and had no impact.

speed, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SWEET FINALE was unhurried early and moved up on
the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FLECK settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the top of
the stretch passed tired foes. SHOW SOME SKIN was in touch and roused from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
was not a factor. REIGN BY REIN tracked the early leader but chased on the turn and was empty.

TOO LEGIT was unhurried early, roused turn, angled outside in mid stretch and drew off. PAPERBACK HERO settled off the pace, gained ground on the
turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch rallied late. WILD RIVER WOLF stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and had a bid from the
four path in mid stretch but was outfinished. ROYAL BIZ was away alertly, set the pace and had the lead in mid stretch but gave way late. YZERMAN was in
range and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. READY AT DAWN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch weakened. THELONIOUS was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

OUR SOUPER LOVE set the pace, took command on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MOHAYMEN DAY stalked
the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SMART IRENE was in touch, roused on
the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SEAQUELLE was in tight early and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven
path at the top of the stretch had no rally. BRIENNE OF TARTH was off the pace, showed little and from the three path at the top of the stretch was outrun.
RIGHT MATTERS checked early and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SEAQUELLE AGAINST BOTH
OUR SOUPER LOVE AND MOHAYMAN DAY FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH RESULTED IN MOHAYMAN DAY BEING DISQUALIFIED

the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was in range but chased on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no factor. WONNEFRAC was
away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but failed to fire.

Footnotes
SASSYWITHATTITUDE was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. DEVIL IN HER
HEART stalked the leader and forced the pace on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TERRIFIC LADY was
hustled early and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. ROAD MAP tracked the early leaders and raced evenly
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ONLY BELIEVE broke poorly and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at
the top of the stretch had no impact. BABY DRIVER was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was never a threat. DAZZLING DIVA was well back,
showed nothing, outdistanced and walked off.
