Footnotes
COSTANARMANDALEG went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the second turn and won under steady urging. COLD AS YOU pressed the
pace, followed the winner throughout, proved no match for COSTANARMANDALEG, but held on for second. BEAUX TOX within striking distance, raced
close throughout and was outfinished for second. BEAUTIFULANDWILD raced near the middle of the field, had an outside trip, made a late wide bid and
finished willingly. VENUS ISLAND lacked early speed, showed late interest, finished wide and was no factor. WHO DAT GREY pressed the early pace,
saved ground and faded. LIGHT AS A WHISPER raced evenly near the back and was no threat late. SPECTACULAR IZZY raced within striking distance,
saved ground around the final turn and dropped back. NOT ENOUGH BLING always raced in the back and showed little.

GOLDEN SMILES unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, angled out, split rivals, rallied and got up late. GREEN MONSTER raced within
striking distance, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. while putting for a game effort. WILD MALLORY sprinted to the front, drove
clear and was outfinished late by the top two. FLEW BY YOU pressed the early pace and weakened. SERIOUSLY SASSY void of early speed and was
never close. SABER QUEEN lacked early speed and was never a threat. ROARING QUINN always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
LOVERS NEVER SAY vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. RETRO RITA
went to the front, dueled throughout, saved ground, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. FIELD OF LIGHTS unhurried in the beginning,
racing near the back, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. COUSIN VICKIE lacked early speed, came around the second
turn on the outside, showed late interest, but was no factor. SHOTGUN ANNIE void of early speed, improved position, but was no threat. A. P. STYLE raced
within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn and faded. WITH GRACE pressed the early pace and dropped back. UNION GRAD always
raced near the back and was outrun. ATLANTIC BAND raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn wide and retreated to the rear.
