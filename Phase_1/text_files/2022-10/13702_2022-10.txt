Footnotes
NIGHTTIME JUSTICE set the pace while near the inside and on a clear lead, patiently handled through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more after
straightening, quickly extended the advantage to the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task to the end. OCELIA settled back along the rail through the far
turn, tipped into the two path with aim on the leader into the lane, could not threaten the top one through the lane and finished clear for the place spot.
CHINATOWN NANCY chased the pace from the three path through the far turn and into the lane then could not sustain the effort after straightening in the
lane. FEARLESS ANNA stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn then faded after turning into the lane. DANCE MONEY pulled through the
first turn, running up on rivals into the backstretch, settled back to trail and was never a factor and returned bleeding from the nostrils while being walked off.

TURBO SIX O vied for the lead from the inside for half, shook clear into the far turn, maintained a clear advantage through the turn, was asked for more at
the top of the lane, quickly widened to the eighth pole and was kept to the task to the wire. RUNAWAY IMAGE raced in the three path through the turns, bid
after mid-turn to appear a serious threat, could not go with the winner after straightening in the lane and finished well clear for the place spot.
BRENTSPENCE bid though the far turn while in the four path, appeared a threat entering the lane then flattened out inside the eighth pole. PALMER'S
PASS was never a factor while near the inside through the turns. LET'S GO JOHN never a factor while off the two path. PROTECTED AREA vied for the

Footnotes
LORD DONEGAL chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, dueled with another inside the eighth pole
then edged up late. MEANT TO BE LUCKY stalked the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, bid from the three path, inched to the lead
near the eighth pole while under pressure from the outside, dueled with the winner through the final sixteenth and was just outfinished. OH CHIC tracked the
pace from the inside through the turn, came off the rail and into the three path and was gaining to the end. FIRST STRIKE raced in mid-pack while off the
inside, gained momentum through late turn while in the three path, continued with interest inside the eighth pole and was slowly gaining to the end. AS ONE
DOES set the pace from the inside, remained on a clear lead into the lane then gave way along the rail. BALLESTEROS was in the three to the two path
through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain. AUGUSTUS BLUE was in the two path through the turn and slowly faded.
NOW AND LATER was in the three path through the turns and never factored. GUNLEATHER AL was outrun while along the inside. PACE was in the three
path through the far turn and lacked a response. STATE CHAMP was done after three-quarters while saving ground.

Footnotes
JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL bumped at the start, vied for the lead two wide from near the outset, remained heads apart into the lane, gained the lead inside the
eighth pole and edged clear late. IDAREYOUTODANCE chased the pace from the three path into the lane, entered the lane from the four path, had aim on
the top two with an eighth to go, could not gain further on the winner while gaining the place spot. TIME TO CONFESS vied for the lead along the inside
through the turn and into the lane, continued to duel with the winner inside the eighth pole then yielded in the final sixteenth. PRIME N PROPER chased the
pace while off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and lacked a closing bid. SISTER JUSTICE saved ground through
the turn and into the lane and finished evenly while not a threat. SHES MY TREASURE never a factor while near the inside. WICKED JUSTICE never a
menace while in the two path through the turn. FLASHY BELLE raced in the three path through the turn and tired.

in the four path, then gave way in the stretch. SPURT stalked the pace between foes, then gave way inside. STANDUP COMEDIENNE was bumped at the

Footnotes
PHANTOM RIDE was hit on both sides at the start, stalked the pace in the three path, bid four wide at the quarter pole and was clear late under steady
handling. RANSEUR was hard to load, dueled outside, bid at the quarter pole, then couldn't hold off the winner to be second best. FRADY broke sharply,
dueled inside and then gave way in the stretch. GRAPHENE CASSOCK was bumped on both sides at the start, raced in the three path, lacked a late bid but
improved position late. DARK CANDY came in and was bumped hard at the start, then raced evenly. MR MAJESTIC was bumped hard on both sides at the
start, then saved ground. NEW ART was off awkwardly. MOHAYMEN HOLIDAY bore out at the start, bumping a foe, then stalked the early pace inside
before giving way.
