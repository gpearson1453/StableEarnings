Footnotes
CONTROLLER was fractious in the gate prior to the start then unhurried early, closed fast through the stretch two wide, dropped to the rail inside the furlong
marker and got up in the final strides under right handed urging. LITTLE RONS ROCKET allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied in the seven path through
deep stretch and just missed getting up in time. JOHN'S WILD RIVER stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead nearing
the furlong marker, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. ANIMO ROBERTO went evenly. SOMETHING ON TAP passed tiring rivals.
HEARDITALLBEFORE pressed the early pace two wide, made the lead on the turn, set the pace into the stretch then weakened late.
UNEEDTOCOMEHOME hesitated at the start and was never involved. OKLAHOMA JOE failed to menace. FLAG RAISER set the early pace near the
inside then was used up. COSI EXPRESS trailed.

IN TROUBLED WATERS pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, took charge then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a hand
ride. RONNI'S WIND unhurried early, rallied in the three path through the stretch and finished clear for second. SWEET MOBILTEE stalked the pace into
the stretch, drifted out giving up position the finished evenly. GO GIRL failed to menace. KAT TRAX had no impact. WHISKEY DIAMOND away alertly, set
pace the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. BETTER HALF had speed from the start, inched closed along the inside through the turn then came
up empty. WILLIAMSBEACHBABE was outrun. MOBIL MEMORY settled mid pack then lacked the needed response. PRINCESS EM was never involved.
WAY OF THE WORLD was no factor.

OHIO PLAYER pressed the pace two wide, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker, dug in gamely and proved
best under strong handling. CALBOYZEKE vied for the lead three wide, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack by the winner entering the stretch and
finished determinedly while second best. REANIMATE broke in front, set the pace along the inside until mid stretch then was outfinished. CHARLEE'S
MAGIC settled mid pack and finished with good courage in the four path. SHOW SLIDING HOME was no factor. ROSCO P. COLTRANE had speed from
the start, offered a bid four wide on the turn then came up empty. MUSTANG WILLIE was no threat. BIG OHIO was outrun. DYNAMITE CLOUD had brief
speed.

please. CARMEN OHIO close up early along the inside, dropped back in the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch then came on again late
and finished second best. SO GO MY LUCEILLE pressed the pace two wide then along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished for second.
CHLOES ANGEL found her best stride late. PROPHETESS went evenly. BEEBLEGEE was no factor. HAPPY AS YOU GO failed to menace. BEST OF
YOU was outrun. SANIBEL broke in front, set a pressured pace three then two wide into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
GRAND ISLE stalked the early pace, got through along the rail to make the lead on the far turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best.
NEED TO KNOW BASIS close up from the start, rallied determinedly in the seven path through the stretch, the rider swung out his left arm with whip in
hand into SAMMY AND SHORTY on his inside through deep stretch and got up for second. SAMMY AND SHORTY stalked the pace from the four path,
moved closer oh the far turn three wide, drifted out to the six path through mid stretch was intimidated by the rider of the runner up through deep stretch and
missed hanging on for second. K KID unhurried early, loomed boldly four wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. BUCKEYE SKY had good early
speed then faded. HIDDEN ACCESS was no factor. TROJAN TALE with the second flight, surged three wide to make the lead before a half, maintained
control off the rail into the far turn then came up empty. SMOOCHER was no factor. CASUAL ATTIRE was never involved. HAPPY WICKED was outrun.
RED COMET was through after a half. EXCITEMENT pressed the early pace three then two wide and gave way on the far turn. THE STEWARDS POSTED
THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED NEED TO KNOW BASIS FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND PLACED HIM
THIRD.

BACK TO OHIO was bounced around between rivals at the start, stalked the early pace, responded with a rapid move to make the lead three wide on the
far turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while taken in hand late. SOFT TALK never far back, rallied into the stretch in the five
path and finished well clear for second. SPARKLING JEWEL stumbled at the start, checked behind rivals entering the clubhouse turn, saved ground and
finished with good courage. CHICA CHULA slow early, found her best stride late in the four path. LADY LOTTIE broke in front, set the pace into the far turn
along the inside then weakened. LADY JASPER bumped at the start and failed to menace. SERGER stalked the early pace, drifted out on the far turn and
gave way. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide into the second turn, stopped and was eased to the wire. DOMINUS
O'S ME was always outrun, stopped and also eased to the wire. FACTISIMFLASHY had speed for a half, stopped to a walk, was distanced, eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
I WANNA WIN gained a narrow lead outside before a quarter, gave up the advantage, prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, regained
command on the far turn, set the balance of the pace, drifted out to the seven path through the stretch, dug in gamely under left handed urging and proved
best while fully extended. FOREWARNED never far back, loomed boldly outside rivals through the far turn and into the stretch, drew on even terms for the
lead with the winner before the furlong marker but was denied. MO DONT NO pressed the pace two wide then along the inside into the stretch then faded.
TANTRUM close up early, dropped back to trail on the far turn, swung wide and came on again late. SAMMY'S SMILE allowed to settle, offered a mild bid
two wide before a half, had speed into the far turn then came up empty. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY drifted to the eighth path soon after the start while setting
the pace, gave up the lead briefly before a quarter, regained command soon thereafter, set a pressured pace into the far turn then gave way. HENRY MAC
well placedalong the inside, failed to respond. SILENCE was no factor. RAVEN MOON was outrun.
