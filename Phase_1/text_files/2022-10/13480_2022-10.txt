Footnotes
SILENT FAREWELL moved forward and in the clear while shifting in early to dictate terms on or just off the rail, kicked clear turning for home under urging,
held safe. AWESOME STRIKE bumped with a rival and lost the path being shuffled back at the start, kept off the inside going three to four wide on the first
turn, steadily advanced outside foes four then five wide on the far turn, finished up willingly gaining on the winner but was too late. SPRING MOUNTAIN
stalked the pace outside and four wide, was within striking distance to the end of the far turn, kept on evenly in the stretch to preserve show honors. PINK
GELATO was bumped sideways at the start then settled into stride toward the back moving in to race in the two path, began to pass rivals three wide into
the first turn moving out five wide by the quarter pole, ran on mildly. UNDER SURVEILLANCE was bumped into a rival at the start, tracked in behind two to
three wide, was held up between runners in behind heading to the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and kept on late. TUFF RAGS brushed the
inner rival at the start, raced two to three wide on the first turn off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn before moving out four deep in the stretch,
ran on evenly. TRIZMO stalked the eventual winner from just outside two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. BELENTIME saved ground inside to the
mid-stretch, was asked for more run leaving the backstretch, came out in mid-stretch and needed more to threaten. UH OH IT'S MAGIC tracked the pace
from inside, came up empty. DOMINANT DESTROYER bumped with a foe at the break and was in a bit tight consequently ending up toward the rear,
settled in that position, swung four wide into upper stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO rated mid pack running five deep on the turn, offered a bid for the lead in the five path at the top of the stretch, took command at the
furlong marker and was kept to the task late to win handily at the wire. SEA SCOUT settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, weaved his way
through traffic entering the stretch in the six path for the drive, closed belatedly the final stages getting up for the place at the finish. HONEY WON'T pressed
the pace outside for the lead on the turn, contended for the top spot between rivals at the quarter pole, could not find enough late to threaten the winner and
just missed out on holding onto the place award. SAILOR'S PASSION was allowed to settle inside in the early going, was roused at the top of the stretch on
the fence and showed some good energy on the rail through the lane to get up for a minor share. DERZKII had a nice pocket trip behind the frontrunners
through the turn, was roused while in range of the leaders at the quarter pole and could only offered an even finish to the wire. CORDUROY ROAD chased
the leaders five wide on the turn, loomed between rivals at the top of the stretch and battled inside with the winner for an eighth of a mile before stalling with
a sixteenth remaining. READY HERO was away a bit slow and trailed down the backside, was asked in upper stretch racing in the eight path and passed
some stragglers running to the wire. BAY OF RUM raced six to seven wide throughout the turn, was outside of rivals turning for home and had little left for
the finish in the stretch. STORMY SOUL broke out at the start, dueled for the lead on the turn, weakened inside at the three furlong marker, gave way in mid
stretch and was not persevered with in the last sixteenth. TRICKY MAGICIAN chased the leaders three wide on the turn, began to fade between horses
turning for home and came up empty at the furlong marker. WHERE'S ANTHONY tracked four wide off the pacesetters early, gave way between rivals
entering the stretch and was not a factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
PUDDINGONTHERITZ was lightly brushed at the break, quickly clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, extended the margin in upper stretch when put
to a drive, lugged out under a left-handed use of the crop past the furlong marker and was kept to the task late. DO THE GRIDDY tracked the eventual
winner from inside, came out past the quarter, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold second. GIVE ME MY MONEY brushed a rival at the start,
tracked between rivals two to three wide into the turn, needed more and missed the place but was best of the rest. TODAY raced off the pace, advanced
between rivals two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, ran on evenly. TRINITY PARK broke a bit awkwardly, settled off the pace near inside, angled four
wide at the quarter pole and showed mild late interest. WILD CONVERSATION raced up close inside early, weakened in the stretch. PASSIONPLATE was
off the leaders going two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. IT'S A SOUPERMOON was urged at the break but lacking speed, never factored. JOE
CHROME chased from outside four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
PRIDEOFDISTINCTION had a perfect tracking trip throughout, was situated behind the early pace setters waiting to pounce entering the stretch, angled off
the battling leaders at the furlong marker and closed resolutely outside under left handed urging to get up just at the line. MEYER tracked in the second
flight just outside on the far turn, angled outside four from the fence to take command with three sixteenths remaining and drifted out a bit in deep stretch to
be caught by the closing winner at the line. CANADIAN PHAROAH dictated the pace with a fellow inside horse until upper stretch, took command briefly at
the quarter pole, was collared in mid stretch and finished up well enough to cross the wire holding for a clear third. BURNING MAN tracked midfield just
outside racing into the far turn, offered a mild run four wide midway on the final turn, angled out to six path for the run to the finish and ran only evenly to the
line settling for a minor share. LIL BIT GANGSTA stalked mid pack on the rail with a half remaining, angled out to the five path in upper stretch but could not
gain on rivals and needed more to contend in the late stages. FULL EXTREME was allowed to be at the back in the early going, saved ground through the
backside and far turn, angled outside for the drive and passed some tiring runners down the lane. SIR SAHIB set the pace fractions pressing the lead inside
through the beginning stages of this marathon, battled on the rail turning for home, showed signs of weakening in mid stretch and faded on the fence in the
last sixteenth. LION KINGDOM trailed the field down the backstretch, was asked through the far turn and could not get involved for the drive to the finish.
JUNGLE FIGHTER settled near the rear in the early stages, was roused midpoint running on the far.

Footnotes
A THREAD OF BLUE tracked from inside just off the leading pair, angled three wide past the quarter in tandem with an outside rival, vied between that one
and the inside leader then took a narrow lead by the sixteenth pole and held under steady handling. SOUP AND SANDWICH stalked two to three wide
outside the winner just off the leaders, came out four wide past the quarter pole, fought on gamely outside but just missed. DAY TRIPPER pressed the pace
two wide, moved to the lead by the top of the stretch, was engaged by outside runners soon after, overtaken in late stretch but kept on gamely and was
simply outfinished. SCANNO settled inside mid-pack, came out five wide nearing mid-stretch and ran on but needed more. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE)
angled in early unhurriedly bringing up the rear, saved ground into upper stretch, came out and ran on mildly. ARTIE lacked early speed racing two to three
wide early, asked for some more run heading into the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and passed a couple tiring rivals. MR. DIFFLEY raced off the
pace three to four wide throughout and failed to rally. FARAWAY KITTEN set a pressured pace inside, gave way.

Footnotes
HAL tracked off the early pace duel at the half, made a bold move just outside near the quarter pole to quickly take the lead at the top of the stretch, opened
up at the furlong marker and was tiring at the line but had enough to hold for the victory. KAUKOKAIPUU was near the back in the early going, rallied four
wide circling runners nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly through the lane on his wrong lead to make it close at the wire gaining on a tired winner
late. VICTORIA'S CHIEF trailed the field down the backstretch, advanced nicely on the rail through the turn, found a seam for clear run in the three path
turning for home and split rivals at the eighth pole finishing strong to be a clear third. LIEUTENANT STAN rated behind the contesting speed duel on the
turn, could not accelerate with the winner on his outside nearing the quarter pole and finished up evenly through the stretch for a minor share at the line.
KING ELVIS was ridden while in close quarters on the turn, began to shake clear of foes two furlongs to go and finally when clear at the top of the stretch
began to pick up the bit and finished some some late interest. UNCAPTURED MOMENT raced five wide outside runners midpoint on the turn, shifted
outwards a bit more in upper stretch and passed tiring foes through the lane. HANK OLLIE was situated midfield running down the backside, was asked to
go on entering the turn and could not get in gear to reach contention turning for home. MAGIC TOMAHAWK stalked mid pack on the rail down the backside,
was roused through the turn, lost his path in mid stretch and could not be a factor late. WICKEDBLACKBULLET put in a mild run entering the turn while
racing four wide and was empty for the stretch run fading between runners. FAJARDO pressed for the front on the turn, was headed two furlongs out and
tired between rivals in mid stretch. TOWN'S WARRIOR battled inside early for the lead, was collared by the winner at the quarter pole and backed away on
the fence with an eighth to go. GLENHOLME chased the early frontrunners with three eighths to go, started to weaken midway on the turn and stopped
badly turning for home.

Footnotes
BREAKING ALONE was forced out and steadied at the start, settled at the rear, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, unleashed a strong rally to just get up
late. BANFF was lightly brushed at the start, angled in early settling in behind rivals off the pace, moved in further entering the turn to go three wide into that
bend then moving out a path later, swung seven deep into upper stretch, lugged in while moving to the lead outside the furlong marker, was outfinished but
second best. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY tucked in behind the leaders with forward position stalking three wide, came into upper stretch five deep, found room
between runners in mid- to late-stretch and kicked on well. RON'S GIZMO broke a step slowly then was allowed to settle into stride off the pace going two to
three wide on the turn, was placed in tight quarters in upper stretch then altered out seven wide in mid-stretch and finished well. NIAGARA SKYLINE
tracked in behind the leaders inside on or just off the rail, came out three wide about the five-sixteenths, steadied when in tight at the quarter pole then again
at the eighth pole, angled in at that juncture and showed good late effort but was left with too much to do. TIMESKIP broke outwardly, settled in the two to
three path toward the rear, came into upper stretch four wide, moved out nine wide for room and ran on mildly. COTTON stalked between runners early,
was forced out six wide leaving the backstretch, moved back in to continue four wide in striking distance, bid at the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort
and weakened. LAPOCHKA shifted in early, saved ground inside on the turn, was held up in behind runners leaving that bend, steadied on heels nearing
the furlong marker then again nearing the sixteenth pole, altered out and ran on. ANARCHY settled off the pace, went four wide into the turn racing outside
runners moving out six wide leaving that bend, appeared within range to threaten in upper stretch but flattened out. LA BELLEZA NEGRA bumped a rival
lightly at the start, moved forward and in to set the pace on or just off the rail, came up empty in the stretch. U S ARMY CORPS lightly bumped a rival at the
start, stalked from outside heading to the turn, was forced out seven wide entering that bend then moved back in five deep just off the lead, bid at the
quarter pole but faltered and faded in the lane. PALIO was lightly bumped at the start but gained forward position stalking outside the leader and inside foes,
veered out about five wide leaving the backstretch then moved back in to be three wide through much of the turn and making a bid at the three-eighths but
came up empty.

Footnotes
WENTRU broke slow but quickly recovered to get a good tracking position inside behind a wall of early speed runners into the turn, waited patiently through
the turn looking for a seam, found room in the two path to split foes in upper stretch and determinedly held on the last eighth for the narrow victory.
COMBATIVE made a strong move around horses midway on the turn, took command at the top of the stretch and fought on stubbornly outside to the wire
only to be outkicked nearing the finish. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS settled near the rear early, rallied four wide outside tiring runners at the five sixteenths pole,
tipped out a bit more for the drive and closed belatedly to the wire to get up for the show. DECIMATOR was off slow and trailed in the beginning, advanced
up the rail through the turn, punched his way up the fence with a sixteenth to go and got up for a small share at the line. GREEN FLEET rated mid pack
between rivals at down the backside, was shuffled back to trail at the quarter and showed some good energy late to close to be involved in a photo for the
minors. DRAGON'S BREW had good speed to be on the front end with a few outside runners entering the turn, was headed at the quarter pole, fought on
stubbornly dispatching all his pace rivals but could not find more and stalled in the final sixteenth. ANALYZER was part on the frontrunning foursome into the
turn, raced four wide around the bend, was collared two furlongs out and tired at the furlong marker. CARMENOOTZ was engaged early on in a multiple
runner race for the the lead, fought on with rivals on either side through the turn, gave way nearing the quarter pole and was empty for the run to the wire.
THOR'S ROCKET battled for the the lead with three other pace rivals in the early stages of the race, was the first of the speedsters to weaken between foes
midpoint on the turn and stopped at the top of the stretch.

SIR FOR SURE settled off the pace racing outside four to five wide, began to advance on the far turn, lugged in a bit in upper stretch then drifted out late
under left-handed urging while kicking clear. HALL OF DREAMS was taken back early and settled inside racing on or just off the rail, saved ground on the
far turn, had room to bid inside in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. LAC MACAZA steadied when in tight early, moved off the inside at that
point racing about in the two path, came into upper stretch three wide, switched outside foes and gained show honors. DANCIN IN DA'NILE stalked from
outside, raced three to four wide throughout the turns, bid at the top of the stretch while lugging in, drifted out late and lacked the needed late kick. GASTON
dueled inside a rival but just off the rail, had no extra for the drive but kept on. SHAMATEUR lacked early speed trailing the field racing just off the rail,
edged closer inside nearing the quarter pole but had no late kick. DUKE OF LOVE dueled outside a rival early, was kept wide in the three to four path up the
backstretch while attending just off the leader, steadied at the quarter pole when a rival drifted in and continued to weaken thereafter. ICE ROAD raced
mostly three to four wide, failed to rally. COLLABORATIVE moved in heading into the first bend, tracked from inside just off the leading pair, was asked to
keep up at the half but had no response and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DUKE OF
LOVE AGAINST DANCIN IN DA'NILE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SEVENTH
BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
CURLIN CANDY got a great trip sitting patiently behind the dueling pacesetters running through the turn, angled five wide off the fading co leaders in upper
stretch and determinedly fought on the final eighth for the win inching away late. JACK tracked four wide just off the contesting frontrunners into the turn,
took a brief lead turning for home and battled right to the wire with the winner giving away just in the end. SMILES FOR DAVID showed speed to be involved
on the rail through the turn, was in range inside turning for home and dug in stubbornly on the fence to win the show battle in a photo. CURE IN REACH
hopped at the break, pressed the leader three wide on the turn, was in the mix at the top of the stretch and levelled out some to lose the photo for third
money. KILLARY was asked to go on racing four wide at the three furlong marker, angled out to the six path running to the wire and finished up passing
tired horses down the lane. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was away alertly to lead between rivals into the turn, was surrounded by challengers at the five sixteenths
pole, gave way in upper stretch and stalled nearing the line. MARALINGA was situated near the back inside in the beginning, rated on the rail through the
turn, angled out to the five path for the drive and had nothing to give for the run to the wire. STRONGER TOGETHER broke out at the start, tracked mid
pack in the two path at the half, was roused three eighths from home and offered little run turning for home. STREET MAX was squeezed at the start and
trailed, could not get involved afterwards and was not a factor to the finish.

Footnotes
SEGUIMI moved forward to the lead and shifted in entering the first turn to dictate terms, raced on or just off the rail, drew clear in upper stretch and held
safe. VELOCE stumbled at the start but recovered quickly and gained position mid-pack racing outside two to three wide, advanced four to five wide on the
far turn, continued to gain steadily in the stretch but was too late. BEN LOMOND switched outside a rival early racing two wide into the first turn, moved out
further up the backstretch, went four then five wide on the far turn, battled for show and got the nod over POUND GREEN, who shifted in heading to the first
turn, tracked inside early, moved out a path up the backstretch, angled out further at the top of the stretch, ran on but was outfinished for show. TAOS (FR)
stalked just off the leaders outside three wide, continued two to three wide on the far turn just off the leader, lacked the needed late kick. JEGOS FIRE
shifted in heading to the first turn, tracked the leader inside early, switched out up the backstretch, weakened. GORGEOUS KITTEN settled toward the rear
shifting in two wide, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted a bit in the lane and was not a threat. ROBUSTO stalked two to three wide, came up empty. AM
PREPARED broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, settled at the rear, came out in the stretch, was never near enough to threaten.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST shifted in racing mid-pack, saved ground on the turns, faded.
