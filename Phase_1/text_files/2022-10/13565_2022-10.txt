BORN FOR VICTORY pressed the pace from the outside of foes, drifted inside the eighth pole and was clear while under strong handling. JEBSTER
stalked the pace from the outside, made a three wide bid nearing the five sixteenths pole to challenge Born for Victory, raced from the outside in the stretch
run and finished second best. SLOE GIN BIZ rated along early, raced two deep around the far turn, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on
willingly to the wire. SYNCOPATED settled off the early pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and moved up to improve position. JAHEZ vied for
the early lead from the inside and weakened through the stretch run. ADDY'S LADDY T N T broke awkwardly, raced off the early pace, was six to seven
wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. HINDENBURG dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. MY
SON CHRIS dwelt at the start, veered out sharply at the start, raced far back early after the troubled beginning and never was involved. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

FLAMING EAST showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and held gamely in the drive to prove best under steady pressure. ITS OVER
stalked the pace from the outside of foes while racing three deep and kept on willingly to the wire in the drive. VOTETHEMALLOUT raced off the early pace,
moved up three wide near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the stretch run and closed in well late. HAMPDEN LANE was unhurried early, raced
two wide near the five sixteenths pole, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch moved up to improve position. CLASS WIZARD dropped back to race
mid pack early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled five wide in the drive and had no late rally. BELIEVEINROCKNROLL tracked the early
leader while racing between rivals and gave way. ELEAZAR raced far back, lost ground and was eased up on in the stretch.

HANG THE MOON was rated along early, ridden just past the three eighths pole, raced three wide around the far turn and finished well to edge clear late
while near the four to five path under strong pressure. FIVECOMMATWO angled off the inside to prompt the pace from the outside of Grace and Charm,
had a clear lead near the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner to finish second best. HAMO was off slowly, raced two deep near the quarter pole,
shifted out to race six deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced along for third as was no match for the top pair. GRACE AND CHARM showed good
early speed to set the pace along the inside and gave way in the drive. MODERN SOCIETY raced off the early pace, was three to four wide around the far
turn and lacked a bid. PEP RALLY was off a step slow, raced along the inside through the far turn and had no late rally.
