Footnotes
WELSHMAN was allowed to settle for the first circuit, made a middle move on the backstretch of the second circuit, took over on the turn and drew off to
prove much the best, driving. MR. BRIDGER set the early pace while clear, then was headed by the winner and could not go with that rival while being
clearly second best. MOLLY FANTASY (GER) was allowed to settle early, steadied when rival went bad and had to leave the course on the second circuit,
made a mild bid on the turn but was no match to the top two while besting the rest. QUEENS EMPIRE (IRE) chased the early pace and made a mild middle
move and weakened. YANKEE DOODLE BOY lacked a solid rally. TELEGRAM chased the pace on the first circuit and tired. LEAR AVIA was reserved
early, then improved on the second circuit and lost the rider in the lane. TWENTY YEARS ON (GB) pulled up after the sixth fence and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ROBERT'S LUXURY set the early pace while clear, then was headed on the far turn, dug in gamely and drew clear over the last fence and remained clear
to prove best, driving. LEFT BLANK was reserved early, made a bid nearing the last fence and loomed boldly but flattened out, second best. HEY
TEACHER (GB) chased the pace and lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. HERO'S RETURN was rated along early and made a middle move to vie
for command but tired. ALWAYS COOL lacked a serious rally. FEMINISTA failed to menace. CATCHER'S MITT stalked the pace and stopped. MERKABA
was not a factor. PURRAGEOUS DYNA stopped. ROBERT'S LUXURY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND DEEMED UNPLACED FOLLOWING A
POSITIVE TEST.
