Footnotes
PRECIOUS AVARY steadied at the start, chased on the inside, moved up between rivals at the quarter pole, commenced a rally passing the furlong marker,
closed well in the two path in deep stretch and was up late to win going away. FIXED ODDS dueled outside for the lead, shook free on the turn, kicked away
in upper stretch, then weakened in the final sixteenth and held on for the place spot. FAIR AND TRUE raced off the pace inside, advanced in upper stretch,
closed belatedly in the two path and got up for third. VIOLETS SMILE was a bit reluctant to load, raced four wide early, chased two wide, came three wide
into the lane and rallied mildly outside. DELIGHTFUL AVA dueled inside for the lead, chased on the turn and faded. MEXICALI CAT was outrun.

and steadied at the half mile marker, then chased on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. SEA MONSTER raced four wide early, stalked the pace, chased
on the turn, raced between rivals in the stretch and weakened late. MOON PARTY raced three wide early, checked entering the turn, then closed belatedly
inside. TIZMET chased on the inside, steadied entering the turn, then failed to threaten. LADY SIMPATIA bobbled at the break, chased two wide between
