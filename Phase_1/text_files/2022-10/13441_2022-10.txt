Footnotes
BANTERRA was hustled from the gate, chased the leader on the outside while detached from the rest of the field, vied in the four path around the turn,
gained to take the lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear into upper stretch, was guided out inside the three-sixteenths, came under one pop of a
right-handed crop while drifting out inside the furlong marker, widened under a hand-ride while continuing to drift into the final sixteenth, shied out from
post-parade tracks late then was held together to the wire while much the best. CLOVER STREET was urged along on the inside of a rival, went around the
turn in the four path, came six wide into upper stretch and just got up for the place. PRETTY MISS KEENS was sent hard from the start, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole, drifted out while well behind that foe late
and lost the place but narrowly held the show. MISS FASHIONISTA dropped back while climbing under strong urging early, raced off the rail down the
backstretch, saved ground while moving closer on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and just missed the trifecta. VAX was urged along on the
outside, went around the turn in the five path, spun seven wide into upper stretch and came up empty. REIGN OF THUNDER drifted out and made some
contact with the outside rail while warming-up behind the gate prior to the start, was urged along at the rear then moved inward, rounded the turn in the two
path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
LA VITA SOFIA three to four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, took over narrow command at that station and floated two to three wide into upper stretch before drifting to the four path straightened away,
edged clear under a drive kept to task. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) coaxed from the gate, chased six then five paths off the inside patiently handled until set
down spinning five wide into upper stretch, ran on willingly to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. RIVER OAKS leaned in
brushing the near side stall before getting away half a beat slow at the start, raced six to seven paths off the inside before tucking three wide near the
nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
improved position showing late interest. SENORA LOCA broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals showing some late interest. JUSTIFIABLE BELLE coaxed from the gate,
dueled five paths off the inside with NYXED to her inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing with
seven-sixteenths to go, began to be shaken off just outside the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. NYXED broke in
at the start under coaxing, dueled from the four path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed at the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

BEES AND HONEY just off the inside early on, had rivals tuck over and was forced inside over the puddle laden rail, remained inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and tipped out two then three wide before angled five wide into upper stretch under a drive, rallied to issue a
challenge inside the final furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. BRATTLE HOUSE established the
front and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under
lone threat to the outside and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. HALO CITY chased three to four
wide coming under a prolonged drive from the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the final jumps to get up for
the show honors. VEGAS WEEKEND chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
FLASHNDYNAMITE broke through the gate prior to the start jogging off for a sixteenth of a mile before returning to be reloaded, chased three then two wide

when set down into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead, was given one pop of a
left-handed crop while drawing off into the final furlong, remained under urging into the final forty yards then was eased up while much the best. MOUNT UP
bumped with a rival at the start then was squeezed back in tight quarters, raced with his head held high early then settled well off the pace, saved ground
under urging on the turn, came out into the stretch and safely secured the place. CASCAIS bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, chased the
pace down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path in pursuit of the winner around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened
while well clear for the show. LIMITS OF POWER chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch
and capitulated. MAGIADORO was forced in early then dropped back while squeezed in tight quarters, went around the turn in the two path, came three

SHERIFF BIANCO coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide advancing on the front through the latter portion of the turn to take command at the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. COURAGEOOUS OH LA
forwardly placed from the start, ranged up to take narrow command near the nine-sixteenths and dueled from the three path with FENWAY to his outside,
knocked heads through the turn shaking off that foe when confronted by the top one, yielded the front and went five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive showing good determination to hold for the place honors over a trio by a nostril. STORM SHOOTER chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. BOLD JOURNEY broke a half a beat slow and lost
his lane at the start, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and went by tired foes to dead heat
for the last major share. TWO DOWN bumped at the start by WAR TERMINATOR, who broke inwards, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to dead heat with the
aforementioned foe on the wire. BOX OF JOE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made
no impact. WAR TERMINATOR broke in at the start bumping TWO DOWN, chased four wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. GOLQUIST hustled from the gate, showed brief speed showing the way three to
four wide until displaced from command near the nine-sixteenths, steadily faded and went three to four wide for home, then folded in the stretch. FENWAY
coaxed from the start, ranged up near the nine-sixteenths and dueled with COURAGEOOUS OH LA from the outside four paths off the rail, continued to
knock heads through the turn until shaken off nearing the quarter pole, went five to six wide into upper stretch and gave way.

upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, fended off the runner-up while drifting out under a hand-ride outside the

asked coming to the quarter-pole then carried six wide into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths then drifted out, was

PLEASANT PASSAGE established the front and showed the way under a rating hold just off along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two
path down the backstretch, tucked inside three furlongs from home and came under coaxing near the quarter pole when coming under some pressure from
FREE LOOK for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came out under a left handed crop bumping FREE LOOK solidly nearing the
eighth pole, dug in under threat to the finish and gamely rebuffed the challenge to prevail at the end. FREE LOOK just off the inside through the opening
bend, settled three wide in closest aim of the aforementioned foe, tucked to the two path into the far turn and began to advance on the leader with
five-sixteenths to go being given notch to work with before getting set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, latched on the top one straightened away
and had that foe come out under a left handed crop and was bumped solidly nearing the eighth pole, battled on latched on through to the finish but was
ultimately repelled to the wire. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) just off the inside through the first turn, raced three to four paths off the inside in pursuit down the
backstretch before going three then two wide through the far turn getting put to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide at the head of the stretch
and offered up a mild kick making belated headway to the finish. ALLURING ANGEL (GB) just off the inside through the first turn, tracked the front three to
four paths off the inside down the backstretch from the tail of the field, went three then two wide through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide for home and offered up a mild bid. IM JUST KIDDIN saved ground near the rear of the field, came under encouragement with
five-sixteenths remaining and angled three to four wide at the top of the stretch, then offered no response. GEORGEES SPIRIT just off the inside tracking
the front from just off the pace, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got roused taking the two path into
upper stretch, then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK broke out and bumped with a foe, moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage in the
two path around the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, was given two pops of a right-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker and
drew off under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. VOODOO ZIP was bumped hard at the start, raced between foes early then was reserved
towards the back, went around the turn in the two path, angled out while put to a drive in upper stretch then moved further out and improved to just garner
the place. YES AND YES stumbled at the start then bumped hard with a foe, pulled keenly in the early going then settled more kindly, saved ground around
the turn, was asked for his best while moving out in upper stretch and just missed the place while narrowly up for the show. ARZAK was well placed just off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while shifting three wide into upper stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened then lost the trifecta. THIN WHITE DUKE was restless in the gate, raced between foes early then settled towards the rear, went three wide on the
turn and failed to threaten. CHEWING GUM bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the turn,
chased into upper stretch, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and tired. SCUTTLEBUZZ was off slow then tossed his head,
spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. SEVEN SCENTS was a bit
keen while rated off the pace, went three wide while put to urging on the turn and came up empty. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) settled on the outside, was
urged along late on the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BLAZING SEVENS broke in at the start bumping CHAMPIONS DREAM solidly, raced six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked
quickly inwards near the half mile pole to the two path, rode the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide
into upper stretch angling outwards as GULFPORT got carried out in front by ANDIAMO A FIRENZE, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking command just outside the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. VERIFYING just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and advanced to take command nearing the eighth
pole, dug in under threat getting collared a sixteenth from home, then ran on safe for the place honors. GULFPORT forwardly placed five then four paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and advanced to apply pressure through the
latter portion of the turn, got floated out five wide into upper stretch by ANDIAMO A FIRENZE, dug in under a drive between foes and was brushed by that
same rival a furlong from home, dug in under a drive unable to match the top pair inside the final sixteenth while keeping on well clear for the show honors.
ANDIAMO A FIRENZE showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure, floated out three then four
wide into upper stretch carrying GULFPORT five wide, got collared along the inside by VERIFYING when coming out slightly to brush with GULFPORT with
an eighth to go, then weakened through to the finish. CHAMPIONS DREAM got bumped solidly at the start by BLAZING SEVENS, who broke inwards,
raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch and tired. TOP RECRUIT lost his footing at the start getting away last, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn under coaxing from midway, spun three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
