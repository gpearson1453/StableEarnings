Footnotes
PUGIN tracked inside, came out three wide nearing the quarter pole and four deep at the top of the stretch, bid and took the lead about a furlong out, was
quickly clear, held safe. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was ridden along throughout racing outside three to four wide on the turn and swinging seven deep into
upper stretch, came in a bit through the lane and gained too late. STREET LEGAL broke a step slowly, raced at the rear early, shifted to the rail to save
ground on the turn, gained late inside. DUKE OF MIAMI moved clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, faced pressure on the turn and into upper stretch
then yielded. STEEL WOOL raced off the pace inside, came out on the turn, moved out further to be four wide turning for home then out further in upper
stretch, ran on with mild interest. TOO LEGIT was kept very wide early, moved in to stalk four wide on the turn, failed to rally in the stretch. BEYOND MY
DREAMS raced mid-pack between runners, went three wide on the turn, shifted in once in late stretch and ran on. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked the pace
then took closer order three wide into the turn, bid in upper stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB broke well to lead from the onset, was unchallenged up front through the turn and drew off comfortably in upper stretch to win going
away. SENSATIONAL SARAH was away alertly to press the leader leaving the chute, rated back to track on the rail at the half, advanced nicely inside
through the turn and chased the winner in vain down the lane besting the rest. BEDAZZLE ME stalked three wide down the backstretch, was roused outside
at the top of the stretch and finished up well enough to close for third money. I'M PHANTOM was bumped on the break, pressed the leader at the half,
chased the winner throughout the turn, weakened at the three sixteenths pole and held for the minors in a spread out field. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH broke
out at the start, rated in mid pack on the rail down the backside, was asked just outside of foes midway on the turn and showed some interest finishing up
through the lane. CAUGHT AN EDGE broke inwards at the start, settled near the rear in the early stages, offered a mild run on the rail three furlongs from
home and finished up evenly on the fence. WHAT'S MY NAME was away slowly, then ducked inwards shortly thereafter, trailed the field at the half and
could not recover from the break to be a contender. INDIANA ROAD was bumped leaving the gate, travelled in mid pack just outside at the half, was ridden
to keep up entering the turn and had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
GOLDEN VISION was allowed to settle at the rear inside, came off the fence heading up the backstretch, commenced a move outside three then five wide
on the far turn, struck the lead by the sixteenth pole and held from a rallying foe. LORENA exchanged a minor light brush at the start, set the early tempo
racing inside into and on the first turn, ceded the lead early up the backstretch and tracked in behind, lacked room in behind into upper stretch, angled out at
the furlong marker, was gaining fast but too late. MITZI exchanged a minor light brush at the start, stalked the early pace two to three wide, moved to the
fore outside the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. NOVEMBER FOG switched out sometime late on the first turn, went three to four
wide on the far turn, kept on evenly. BOBBI'S LEGACY pressed the pace two to three wide, took the lead at the five-eighths, shifted in, was challenged into
the far turn, lacked the needed late kick while moving out in the stretch.

Footnotes
WAR COURT tracked just outside mid pack at the half mile marker, was asked while angling out four wide for the stretch drive and finished well outside of
foes to wear down the frontrunning leader in nearing the line. MALIBU EDGE showed good speed to lead into the first turn, dictated the pace through the
backside, was headed at the top of the stretch, quickly put away that challenger, briefly opened up in mid stretch and could not hold off the closing
stablemate nearing the wire. FINALIST chased the pace throughout, appeared to be weakening while between foes three wide at the top of the stretch and
found another gear to stubbornly resurge at the furlong marker to battle on for a clear third. BRINGER OF RAIN was allowed to settle while between rivals
near the back running down the backstretch, midpoint on the far turn was encouraged to go on and found some energy in the final sixteenth to get up up for
a small share. SOUPER COHIBA stalked on the rail through the far turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch to be in range at the eighth pole and
needed more late to figure at the finish. ROCKET JOE COPPER tracked kindly behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, waited inside while under a
good hold throughout the far turn, shifted just outside to bid for the lead turning for home and folded in the final eighth running to the line. RELIABILITY
broke out to hit the gate at the start, trailed the field into the first turn, was asked while three wide entering the far turn, angled out for run five wide at the top
of the stretch and could not make an impact. EMBRACE MY UNCLE settled near the rear at the half mile marker, was roused inside on the far turn and
could not get involved in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
RENEGADE SERENADE broke a half step slowly then settled toward the back, began to advance five then six wide on the turn coming seven deep into
upper stretch, bid outside at the three-sixteenths, drifted out while taking a larger advantage by mid-stretch, was re-engaged by an inside foe, dueled and
prevailed. THREE SONNY SIDEUP settled mid-pack, advanced four then five wide on the turn, bid between rivals at the three-sixteenths, was headed at
that juncture, drifted out and dueled inside the aforementioned late in a game effort that came up short. QUIET VISTA was bumped at the start, steadied on
heels racing in behind and just off the inside coming to the nine-sixteenths, switched out for the turn, continued to swing out nine deep turning for home, ran
on willingly to capture show honors. GUNS N' ROJAS tracked inside runners mid-pack, came out past the quarter pole, ran on evenly. PIDIN attended the
early pace inside, eased off the leader and switched out for the turn, advanced to bid and take a narrow and brief lead at the quarter pole, lacked the
needed late kick. DESANTIS was forwardly-positioned early then pursued the leaders from off the inside going about three to four wide into the turn, was
forced out seven deep at the quarter pole, ran on. CHAIRMAN LAYLA lacked early speed racing well back into the turn, passed rivals willingly in the stretch
while moving off the inside for room. MIA'S LIL ANGEL raced mid-pack two to three wide on the turn, shifted in past the quarter, was never a threat. QUIET
SPEED bumped the inner rival at the start, tracked from inside, went two to three wide on the turn, was forced out coming past the quarter pole, tried. FOUR
K FORCE set the pace racing off the inside, tired.

Footnotes
TWENTY FOUR MAMBA was allowed to settle near the back at the half, switched to the outside while rallying at the five sixteenths pole, loomed five wide
turning for home and determinedly under right handed urging closed well to get up nearing the wire. LESLIE CHOW was void of early speed and trailed
down the backstretch, continued to settle in last turning for home, angled outside at the eighth pole and found his best stride late to make it interesting at the
line. SUGAR RAY chased three wide in the early stages, battled three wide outside for the lead on the turn, put away his fellow pace rivals at the top of the
lane to lead in mid stretch, was collared by the winner the final sixteenth and tired nearing the line losing place. MR CROWLEY tracked between horses mid
pack with three eighths remaining, took closer order through the turn to be in the mix at the top of the stretch and could only offer an even finish to the wire
for a minor award. SOUPER LEGACY rated inside in the second flight of runners into the turn, was roused five sixteenths from home inside, continued to
fight on in upper stretch and passed tired runners through the lane. AIM FOR THE SKY was part of the dueling trio up front, was collared while inside at the
quarter marker and gave way on the rail in the final sixteenth. JUST JIMMY stalked in the second flight racing three wide down the backside, was ridden for
more through the turn and had little to give for the stretch run. CONSTITUTION GAL battled between runners through the turn, wilted under the pressure
with rivals on either side at the quarter pole and lost interest in the final eighth.

Footnotes
PHILIP MY DEAR angled in early, settled toward the rear, went three to four wide on the turn angling eight deep into upper stretch, took aim and rallied to
get a narrow lead past the furlong marker and edge past. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE bumped with a rival at the start, shifted in racing off the pace, saved
ground early on the turn, moved out three wide by the five-sixteenths, angled six wide at the quarter pole, bid between runners in mid-stretch but was
outfinished. BATTLE STRIKE stalked just off the leaders, advanced five then four wide on the turn, bid about the furlong marker but was outkicked.
SOONER LUNAR moved forward inside to take the lead at the seven-eighths to set the pace racing just off the rail and facing outside pressure, was
overtaken at the top of the stretch, fought on to regain a narrow lead from that foe soon after while getting brushed near the eighth pole, was outkicked by
closing foes. OPPOSITES ATTRACT had the early lead while racing quite wide, moved in while two other rivals went forward to dictate terms, went three to
four wide on the turn coming seven wide into upper stretch and ran on. GRAN SPIRITED was bumped from between rivals at the start and consequently
away slowly, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, switched out racing off the inside into the turn, swung ten wide into upper stretch, lugged in
a bit then came back out and kept on. BRITISH ARTILLERY moved forward in tandem with an inside rival, pressed outside that one three deep, took the
lead outside the quarter pole, dueled with that same inside rival who fought back, brushed that one nearing the eighth pole, weakened thereafter. BIG
RANSOM raced well off the pace going three to four wide on the turn, came out ten deep in upper stretch, was unable to threaten. COHERENCE bumped a
rival at the start, raced inside to the stretch, came out in upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. SING DIXIE tracked up close inside, dropped
back and was not persevered with from the three-sixteenths to the wire. CADFAEL was forwardly-placed six then five wide on the turn, came up empty.
COOL KISS raced forwardly mid-pack, pursued three wide into the turn, was ridden along but had no response, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON settled in mid pack alone into the turn, began to pick up rivals advancing three wide through the turn, loomed into contention outside at
the top of the lane, battled for the lead with an eighth to run and edged away in deep stretch. MACLEAN'S POSSE chased the pace after the break, was
taken back to track the frontrunners at the half, bid for the lead between foes turning for home, briefly lead in mid stretch and surrendered to the winner
nearing the wire. SWOT ANALYSIS lead from the onset, put away a pace rival exiting the turn, battled inside with another challenger in upper stretch until
the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly late. OLD CHESTNUT tracked the frontrunners inside midway on the turn, angled out to the five path for the
drive and showed some late energy to hold off multiple closers for the minor share at the finish. HAVE A SOUPER DAY was ridden to go after the leaders
three wide on the turn, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, dipped back inside to the three path at the eighth pole and finished up with interest. GOD OF
LOVE was situated near the back on the rail at the half, crept up to take closer order to the leaders on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. SALVATOR
MUNDI travelled near the back of the field running into the turn, angled inside at the top of the stretch for the drive, lost his path in mid stretch and
regrouped late to just miss for a small award. CLEAR DESTINATION settled near the back early, offered an early move four wide on the turn to be involved
two furlongs to the finish and weakened outside of foes nearing the sixteenth pole. HICKSY tracked the early pace, engaged for the lead outside at the half,
began weakened pressing for the lead at the quarter marker and retreated at the furlong pole. CONCEALED CARRY trailed down the backstretch and could
get into contention for the drive.

Footnotes
DUN DRUM settled off the pace inside on or just off the rail, came into upper stretch two to three wide, had room between foes, rallied strongly to just get up
at the wire. MASON'S GAMBLE attended the early pace inside, switched out when a rival moved clear and shifted in, went two then three wide on the far
turn taking the lead just past the quarter pole, was clear coming to mid-stretch, lugged in past the furlong marker and was caught late. AVOMAN stalked two
to three wide, angled seven wide turning for home seeking room, gained late inside a rival and got the nod for show over that one. GRANDSON raced three
wide early racing off the pace, went three to four wide on the far turn, came into upper stretch eight deep, fought for show while gaining on the leading pair
late but missed that placing. TOLD IT ALL set the early pace two to three wide, was soon overtaken, chased in behind three to four wide on the far turn,
moved out six wide in upper stretch for room, was further placed in tight later in the lane and dove inward and finished up with interest. PERFECT CRIME
raced in the two path off the pace early, steadied slightly about the five- and one-half, ran on mildly late. NOT SO QUIET raced just off the leaders three to
four wide mid-division through the first turn, launched a rally five wide and outside foes on the far turn looming a threat at the top of the stretch but could not
sustain the effort and flattened out. THERE'S NO JOE was caught five to six wide and off the leaders entering the first turn, rapidly moved outside foes late
on that bend into the backstretch, shifted in once clear to set the pace, faltered and faded in the stretch. LAST AMERICAN EXIT was caught four to five
wide on the first turn with some forward position, dropped back, drifted from four to six or seven wide on the far turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRUSH settled near the back of the field at the half, rallied inside through the turn, angled out to the six path splitting runners for the drive and
was full of run to draw off in the final sixteenth. JILL took command after the break, was pressured outside while up front through the turn, put away that
speed rival in upper stretch, was collared by the closing winner a sixteenth from home and held gamely for the place share. OHEAVENS was situated near
the back down the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn, shifted out to be seven wide turning for home and closed belatedly to be a clear third in the
end. BID ONCE chased the frontrunner three wide throughout the turn, raced in the four path at the top of the lane between rivals and ran on mildly to the
wire to hold for a small award. A MAIZE ZING DOTIE was reined back to track behind the pace trio into the far turn, had a good inside position running on
the rail through the turn, found a seam in mid stretch and could not offer a closing kick when clear down the lane. OLD SECRETS broke with the field but
could not keep up through the backside, was roused midpoint on the turn and offered little for the stretch drive. VEERY pressed for the lead on the turn with
horses on either side, began to give way three sixteenths from home in the three path and folded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
CAPE COD stalked four wide early, edged closer on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter pole, was clear in mid-stretch and held off rallying rivals. OPUS
NORTH raced off the inside in the three to four path early, began to advance on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, gained steadily but too
late. MAGNIFICENT MARIO angled in early, came out two to three wide for the second turn, swung nine wide turning for home, was left with too much to do
but finished strongly. GO TAKE CHARGE tracked from inside, came out three wide near the five-sixteenths, angled six deep in upper stretch, kicked on
midly. GUARD OF HONOUR settled mid-pack racing just off the rail, tipped out from three to five wide on the second turn, loomed a threat in upper- to
mid-stretch but flattened out. THE THUNDERER settled two to three wide at the rear early, advanced while swinging five wide into upper stretch, ran on
evenly late. REBEL FAITH was a bit fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly and a bit slowly, saved ground on the turns, failed to rally. CAPPY stalked up
close three wide, made a mild bid about the quarter pole, faltered and faded in the stretch. GRAND GIZMO set the pace inside on or just off the rail, gave
way. LADY XI failed to threaten while racing about three to four wide on the turns.
