Footnotes
TIERNA away well, led along the inside on the backstretch, continued to lead on the turn, inched away through the turn and responded well when
summoned and drew off under a drive. AM YISRAEL CHAI bumped with inside rival at the start, asked for speed and chased faster runner two wide on the
backstretch, continued to chase eventual winner on the turn, proved no match when rival was asked and finished up a well clear second. PROJECT LOGIC
came out and had to be corrected, stayed in the three path on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and kept on to stay in same position in the
lane. FOR MY BROTHER loaded into the gate slamming into the gate, continued to move about prior to the start, turned head and reared when gates
opened and lost all chance. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS bumped with outside rival at the start, settled off the pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn and never threatened.
