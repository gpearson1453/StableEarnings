Footnotes
CONATIVE lacked early speed, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the home stretch, drove clear and won under steady
urging. LEMON KICK void of early speed, made a steady gain, rallied wide down the home stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second.
WAYPOINT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. TAKEN BACK broke a step slow, racing in the rear, made a late
rail bid, but was no real threat. FLASHBURN went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and weakened. UNDERDOG was an early factor and faded.
FALCON HEAVY got in tight at the start, racing in the rear, moved up to the middle of the pack and faded. PARTY OF FIFTEEN was an early factor, racing
outside around the first turn and was finished early. PAPAWS BOY always raced near the back and showed little.

MARILYN'S MAGIC lacked early speed, moved up between rivals around the final turn, angled inside and drove clear late. TRUE RED SLEW dueled for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the winner late. ANIME DAY vied for the front end, had
an outside trip, took command around the second turn and was outfinished for second. THURSDAY MORNING raced in the middle of the pack and put forth
an even effort. CAMCORDIA raced near the middle of the pack, finished evenly and lacked a rally. MY LITTLE GUERA challenged for the early lead and
faded. AUNT JANA lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. FEDERAL COURT raced within striking distance and dropped back. T J'S SUNSHINE
lacked early speed and was never a threat. I LOVE YOU MORE hopped at the start and trailed throughout.

an outside trip and faded. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON lacked early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. JERSEY HOTTIE raced evenly
near the back and was never a threat. MS. CAJUN QUEEN had a tight start, raced in the back and showed little. WHY WAIT showed early speed and

lacked a late kick. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. KING
DEUCE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn, weakened and lacked a finish. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN void of early speed and was never a
threat. FAZIO always raced near the back and showed little. O'L RED vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.
