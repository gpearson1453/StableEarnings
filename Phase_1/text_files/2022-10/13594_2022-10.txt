Footnotes
TOP REFERENCES broke in at the start and was away a step slowly, was hustled to early contention into the first turn, engaged with ROSEBUD RYDE and
dueled with that rival through decent fractions to the second turn, took a narrow lead to mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and dug in in the
final strides to prevail. ROSEBUD RYDE was sent to contest the early pace, dueled with TOP REFERENCES through decent fractions to the second turn,
lost a bit of ground to that foe in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and could not get by the game winner in deep stretch but was best of the rest.
LIVING WITH AUTISM was forwardly placed while three wide on the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, came three then
four wide on the far turn, lost ground to the top pair in mid-stretch, drifted out several paths in deep stretch but held for show in the end.
LUVAHAPPYENDING broke out at the start and crowded VALDINIA at the start, was allowed to settle while saving ground, was asked for run in upper
stretch and lacked a late rally. VALDINI was crowded a bit at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the early going, came two to three wide on
the far turn and did not threaten in the lane.

STRAUS'S PLACE rated just off of the decent fractions, saved ground to the second turn, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the top of the lane, took
command into the drive, felt late pressure from TEE SHOT and determinedly held that one at bay in the end. TEE SHOT stalked the early pace, raced close
up to the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground three wide nearing the top of the lane, closed well in the final stages, pressured the winner in deep
stretch and could not get by the determined winner late. MADE THE TEAM was hard sent leaving the break, established the early lead along the first turn,
set solid fractions while prompted through the second turn, came under pressure in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner but stayed on well late to be
well clear for show. STAY LIT broke in at the start, settled off of the early pace, raced two wide to the far turn and did not offer a late rally. LOVER BOY
TOM was unhurried, saved ground to the top of the stretch and lacked a late response.

OUR EXPECTATION settled off of the solid early fractions, was roused three wide on the turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed with a rush
through the final stages to overtaken BIG CHEDDAR and was up in the final stride to prevail. BIG CHEDDAR broke alertly and showed good early speed,
set quick fractions to the top of the lane, drew clear to mid-stretch, could not hold off OUR EXPECTATION in deep stretch and was tagged for the win, while
besting the rest. MISO FAST was shuffled at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace to the turn, advanced from the inside on the turn,
continued that steady bid into the drive, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch but was clear for third in the end. ELUSIVE LOVE chased from the
second flight, lost ground two wide on the turn and did not produce a late rally. STAR ENTRY was away slowly and lacked speed to the turn, came three
then four wide nearing the top of the lane and finished evenly in the drive. JEDI KNIGHT was hard to load, showed good early speed and pressed the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, chased BIG CHEDDAR to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SEA DOG was sent to establish the early lead, was well handled while carving out moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing
the quarter marker by TRINIDAD, turned away that foe's bid heading to upper stretch and drew clear in the final stages. TRINIDAD rated off of the early
pace, came three wide along the first turn, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid to challenge SEA DOG nearing the
quarter marker, was turned away in that effort and lost ground into upper stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the drive but stayed on well late
to be second best. CALI CONQUEST stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle while saving ground early on, came three wide on
the second turn, was no match for the top pair in the stretch run but was an easy third in the late stages. CALCULATED SPIN was forwardly placed into the
first turn, prompted the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn and weakened in the stretch drive. MECHANT was away
a step slowly and settled just off of the early pace, made a middle move to come within aim nearing the half-mile marker, could not go on with that run on the
far turn and gave way in the stretch. SLIGHTLY DIRTY came in tight at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried while three wide in the early stages,
lost position along the backstretch run, came three wide on the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
TIZ INDY hopped at the start then threw his head leaving the break and was off a step slowly, showed early speed after recovering from the break and
established a clear lead to the turn, set quick fractions to the top of the lane, had the margin cut into in the final sixteenth but stayed clear to the wire.
POTENTE ALBA chased the loose pacesetter in the early going, came two wide to the quarter marker, was able to cut into TIZ INDY's margin but was no
match for that one late and was second best in the end. CASH LIMIT lacked early speed, chased two then three wide nearing the top of the lane, was not
able to impact the top two late but finished well in the end and was clear for third in the final stages. BALLROOM HUSTLER was shuffled back at the start,
chased two wide on the turn, made a mild late rally but was not able to threaten in the stretch drive. TOMMY SPECIAL chased from the second flight,
dropped back on the turn and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
SECRETLY PARANOIDE was prominent on the run to the turn, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker, chased TIMBERLAKE GAGE to mid-stretch,
confronted that rival in deep stretch, dueled with the game runner-up to the wire and determinedly prevailed in the end. TIMBERLAKE GAGE broke alertly
and showed good early speed to get to the front, set quick fractions through the turn, shook free of SECRETLY PARANOIDE in upper stretch, was
confronted by that foe again inside of the furlong marker, dueled to the wire and was gamely bested in the end, while holding safely for place. WICKED
SUNSET chased the pace to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well late, could not reel in the top
pair in deep stretch but was clear for show. AFTER SUNDOWN chased the early pace, steadied in tight quarters entering the turn, came four then five wide
on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, was not able to impact the leaders late but finished well in the final sixteenth. BEAU ROCKS chased from the
rear, advanced four wide on the turn, could not sustain that bid in the drive and finished evenly in the late stages. WAHASHA chased the solid pace from the
inside and lacked a late rally. MO SUGAFOOT was forwardly placed on the run to the turn, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter marker and gave way
late. JOE'S PASSION showed good early speed, tracked the quick fractions three wide through the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
JUANA GALLO was hustled to dispute the early lead, made contact with EARLY RELEASE soon after the break when that one was a bit rank, set the
contested pace to the turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive, felt late pressure from his stablemate, was fully extended in
deep stretch and gamely held on for the win. STOLEN VOTE was allowed to settle, saved ground to the top of the lane, advanced in upper stretch, was
bumped by EARLY RELEASE nearing the furlong marker, closed on his stablemate in deep stretch, was held at bay by the winner in the final strides and
was second best in the end. EARLY RELEASE showed early speed, drifted while a bit hard to place early on and made contact with JUANA GALLO,
pressed the pace three wide through the turn, bumped STOLEN VOTE nearing mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair late and gave way while
clear for third in the end. WEGOTBEERONICE chased the early fractions, lost position two then three wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
EL CAPRICHO showed early speed and chased from midpack to the turn, raced in pursuit on the turn while three then four wide, mounted a five wide rally
in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds, took command nearing the sixteenth marker and held in a drive to prevail. PROSPECT OF
RAIN chased the early pace outside of rivals, came four wide into the turn, slipped to the two path nearing the top of the lane, rallied inside in upper stretch,
vied for the lead in mid-stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the final stages and held for second in the end. LET THERE BE PEACE broke alertly and
was sent to contest the early pace, set disputed fractions through the turn, was confronted in upper stretch, met the bid of the top pair to the final sixteenth
but was outfinished in the end, while clear of the rest for show. SIX SHOTS OF T was away in good order and pressed the early pace, came three wide to
the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. MIQUEAS was unhurried early on, came three wide along the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but found his best stride late. CONSUMING showed good early speed, raced
close up to the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. GO GABRIELLA was crowded at the start and was off a step
slowly, was forwardly placed to the turn, lost position three wide nearing the top of the lane and faded in the stretch run. IGO broke in at the start and was
hard to place in the opening stages, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. OBJECTIVLYPERFECT lacked early speed, came two to three
wide along the turn and did not have an impact.
