Footnotes
PRIMORDIAL FEAR pressed from between runners briefly, dropped back heading into the turn, came out four wide turning for home getting closer to the
leader, drifted out through the stretch, struck the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear. DOMINANT DESTROYER stalked from outside, went four to
five wide on the turn, asked for run about the five-sixteenths, kept on to get up for place over RED ZEPPELIN, who moved to the lead from between runners
at the five-eighths, was clear on the turn racing off the fence, challenged in mid-stretch while coming out a bit, could not kick on and lost second. JACK
SLYE exchanged some bumps with a rival early up the backstretch, was in pursuit three to four wide on the turn, shifted inside a rival in late stretch and kept
on evenly. LIONESQUE broke a half-step slowly, settled into stride toward the back, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, improved position in the
stretch. SETTEBELLO exchanged some bumps early up the backstretch, shifted in at the five-eighths, raced near but off the inside on the turn, came out in
the stretch and ran on. WIN THE DRAW showed brief speed inside, steadily dropped back. THE BAND COMING switched out early, went two to three wide
on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. DOC FISHMAN reared at the break, was urged along but not a factor. THEBOYFROMGORMLEY was not
a factor while racing wide.

Footnotes
TWOWAYCROSSING was off a bit slow on the break, had a good stalking position behind the front pack down the backstretch, was steadied mildly nearing
the half, travelled comfortably mid pack alone through the turn, rallied while shifting five wide at the furlong marker and found his best stride late to get up
just before the wire. CARLIN CLAN broke sharp to take the early lead, contested for the front inside through the turn, lost the lead in mid stretch and
regrouped on the fence to rebid to get up for a share of the place award at the finish. HANK OLLIE pressed up front on the outside with his co speed rival on
the turn, began to inch away with an eighth to go for the lead, was caught by the winner in deep stretch and held safe at the wire sharing the place share in
the end. LIEUTENANT STAN tracked the engaging leaders just outside at the half, angle four wide four the drive to be in the hunt on the outside, needed
another gear at the furlong pole and had to settle on the fringes. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was brushed at the start, tracked three wide in the backstretch,
saved ground through the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and could only finish up evenly to the line. CURLIN'S GHOST was ridden early to keep
up with the field, trailed at the top of the stretch, switched out for the drive in the six path and finished up passing tiring runners. IMPOSTER SYNDROME
tracked behind the contesting frontrunners in the early stages on the rail, was in range with three sixteenths remaining following the pacesetters and
weakened at the furlong pole making no impact. WICKEDBLACKBULLET stalked close to the rear inside at the half, was asked on the rail through the turn,
offered little response and was not a factor through the lane. RUNAWAY CHARLIE travelled near the back of the pack in the beginning, was urged turning
for home and could not get involved running to the wire. VENTI settled in mid pack four wide racing down the backside, offered a mild run three wide around
runners at the three eighths pole, shifted just outside in the four path at the top of the stretch and retreated at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
SOUPER HOITY TOITY settled between runners but three wide off the pace, began to advance on the far turn swinging five wide into upper stretch, took
aim and struck the lead about the sixteenth pole, held safe while being eased up late. LOVE TO RUN switched outside the leader entering the first turn,
stalked that one up the backstretch, edged closer on the far turn, came into upper stretch four deep and put to urging, ground on steadily to secure second
late while getting brushed lightly nearing the wire. CRYSTAL SHIP moved clear and shifted in on the first turn, widened on that bend to dictate terms from
just off the rail, was challenged in the stretch under strong urging, drifted a bit and brushed with a rival, was outkicked. SISTER SEAGULL raced outside the

Footnotes
EPILOGUE was allowed to settle near the back on the rail in the beginning, advanced nicely inside on the turn, shifted outside off the contesting pacesetters
three sixteenths from home, took command outside at the furlong marker and was edging away in the end. DECIMATOR stalked mid pack on the turn,
angled to the inside in the three path for running room at the top of the stretch, shifted back to the outside at the furlong marker and closed well five wide to
get up for the place award. TRICKY MAGICIAN led the field through the turn inside, was headed by outside rivals at the top of the stretch, continued to be
brave up front battling with an eighth to go and gave way late to just miss the place share with a gutsy inside effort. COMBATIVE pressed for the front in the
early stages, waited behind the leaders inside at the half, looked for a seam in upper stretch and finished up with interest to garner a minor share at the line.
DOWNY BOY trailed the field saving ground three eighths left to run, rallied up the fence through the stretch and closed well late to be involved in a multiple
horse photo for the minors at the wire. DRAGON'S BREW made an early move splitting foes to contend three furlongs from home, loomed four wide at the
quarter pole, took command briefly at the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch losing positions. VANBRUGH pressed the pace just outside early on, took
closer order to actually poke his nose in front at the quarter marker between runners, battled with rivals for the top spot in mid stretch and faltered nearing
the sixteenth pole. MR. DAZZLE was away slowly on the break, trailed down the backstretch, caught up to the field at the half and could not make an
impression running in the stretch. DIXIE GIANT broke sharp to be on top at the break, was eased back to track the contesting trio down the backside,
tracked the leaders three wide on the turn, sat behind the front pack four wide into the stretch and could not find another gear to threaten at the finish.
TYCOON travelled four wide on the turn tracking the frontrunners, angled out to be six wide for the stretch run and had nothing to give in the drive to the
wire. DESOLATOR tracked the leaders five wide running outside on the turn, was floated out to be seven wide at the top of the lane and could not get
involved in the late stages.

Footnotes
KEEN FLATTER exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward tracking in behind the pace, came out five wide for room at the top of the stretch,
bumped a rival lightly at that juncture, bid between foes at the sixteenth pole and edged away. MORE GELATO bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was
ridden along between runners off the pace into the turn, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and ran on. PUDDINGONTHERITZ set the pace inside
while pressed by an outside foe, kicked clear by upper stretch, was overtaken by two foes a sixteenth out and best of the rest. NINETYFOUR EXPOS was
urged at the break, pressed the pace two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. GOLDEN TRAIN stalked from outside three to four wide, came up
empty. STROKES (IRE) commenced a move four then five wide midway on the turn, was lightly brushed in upper stretch, bid outside six wide nearing the
sixteenth pole but was outfinished. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY angled in early, saved ground racing at the rear, failed to menace.

Footnotes
COMMANDER JOE settled nicely in a good tracking position on the rail at the half, was well in hand waiting inside on the turn, rallied inside at the top of the
stretch, slipped on through up the fence to take command at the furlong marker and was starting to draw away in the end. SIR SEAMUS took a comfortable
lead on the pack into the turn, had another gear at the top of the stretch to repel the challengers turning for home, was collared inside by the winner in the
final sixteenth and finished up well in a game front running effort. OLD CHESTNUT rated mid pack on the rail down the backside, followed the winner
advancing inside on the turn, closed up the fence in mid stretch and got up for the show money late. SOUPER SUCCESS advanced three wide mid pack
three furlongs to the finish, angled out six wide for the drive and showed good energy late to get up for a minor share outside. THE GREAT OZ hopped at
the break, began to rally three wide midway through the turn, angled out seven wide turning for home and closed well just missing getting a small share of
the prize in the end. MAAKWA chased the frontrunner in the early stages of the race, was in the hunt between rivals three sixteenths from the line and
stalled in deep stretch. LORD OF WAR settled in midfield four wide between foes at the half way marker, was ridden for more with runners on either side on
the turn and only offered an even finish to the wire. EMBOLDEN made an early move three wide into the turn, continued to fight on to contend five wide at
the top of the stretch and levelled off at the furlong marker. NIAGARA SKYLINE had a good tracking position behind the early frontrunners at the half, rallied
five sixteenths from the wire, was in contention four wide in upper stretch and could not offer a finish to be involved in the end. MY SILENCER was shuffled
back entering the turn to trail the field, was urged for more at the five sixteenths pole and could not make an impact in the stretch drive. AL HEYBAY
travelled near the rear down the backstretch, was urged for more run on the turn and could not get interested for the drive to the line. FORESTER'S TURN
was away awkwardly soon after the break to trail, could not regroup on the turn and was not a factor running to the wire.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL was taken up slightly in the early going when in tight on heels, settled mid-pack tracking, bid inside in the stretch and drew clear. TOLD
IT ALL tossed the head at the start, settled toward the rear racing near inside, rallied inside for the place. READY FOR A FIGHT was ridden from the break
to gain forward position, contended four to five wide, kept on in the stretch but lost second. SOUPER WATSON settled toward the back racing outside rivals,
entered the turn about three to four wide, swung nine deep turning for home after being asked past the three-eighths, was gaining too late. LUCKY CURLIN
settled mid-pack in the second flight travelling three wide into the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, improved position from between runners.
SOUPER DORMY was taken up when in tight between runners early, raced four wide into the turn, swung out seven deep turning into upper stretch, kept
on evenly. CASH DIVIDEND settled while shifting in early, raced near the inside through the turn, moved out at the furlong marker and ran on well but too
late. FORESTER'S FORTUNE raced outside runners off the pace five wide through the turn coming into upper stretch eight deep, was in a bit tight and
eased up nearing the wire. NICE ACE pressed inside on then just off the rail, weakened. TOWN CRUISE dropped back from between runners three wide
heading to the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, was not a late threat. SPITE STORE set a pressured pace two to three wide, came up empty.
CLAYTON was forwardly-positioned three to four wide between runners, asked for more at the quarter but had no late response.

Footnotes
DECORATED INVADER tracked patiently inside behind the leader on the turn, waited for running room at the top of the stretch, bullied his way through to
split dueling leaders at the furlong marker and drew away nearing the finish. BREAKING ALONE was allowed to settle near the back in the early stages of
the race, looked for room in the six path in upper stretch, angled outside seven wide for clear run at the eighth pole and closed well besting the rest at the
finish. HENLEY'S JOY was situated in midfield outside rivals three eighths to the line, angled outside to be eight wide rallying at the top of the lane, arguably
poked his head in front briefly at the eighth pole and needed a little more to threaten in deep stretch. A THREAD OF BLUE travelled in the middle of the field
inside running on the turn, shifted out to be seven wide for the stretch drive, was in range with the leaders an eighth to the line and stalled a touch to settle
for a small share. LIKE THE KING had command from the onset, continued to dictate the pace at the half, was headed outside turning for home, fought on
inside until the furlong marker and tired nearing the wire. ENTRY TO HEAVEN stalked near the back in the beginning, looked to rally five wide behind
horses at the top of the stretch, lacked clear running room in mid stretch and finished up evenly the final sixteenth. DAY TRIPPER pressed the frontrunner
through the turn, offered a strong bid four wide two furlongs to the wire, gave way while in tight quarters inside the eighth pole and faded the final sixteenth.
ROCKET JOE COPPER stalked mid pack four wide through the turn, angled out seven wide two furlongs to the finish, was roused in upper stretch, offered
no response and gave way. KEEP GRINDING tracked three wide just off the leaders on the turn, was in contention in the five path at the quarter pole,
steadied while between rivals nearing the furlong marker and was not persevered with afterwards to the wire. SOUP AND SANDWICH hopped at the break,
trailed the field at the half, angled for clear run in the nine path in upper stretch and could not reach contention running to the finish.

Footnotes
IRONSTONE stalked in behind racing about in the two path, steadied slightly past the six- and one-half, raced inside foes in behind the leader on the far
turn, came out at the top of the stretch, took aim and struck the lead just past the furlong marker and drove clear. THE MINKSTER quickly moved clear but
was getting out and fighting the rider early, set the pace in the three path on the first turn, moved a bit nearer the rail up the backstretch, continued in the
lead and in the clear off the rail on the far turn drifting out a bit turning for home, was overtaken in mid-stretch and outkicked. BRINGER OF RAIN brushed
with a foe at the start, raced inside just off the pace, steadied on heels nearing the three-quarter and dropped back to last racing just off the inside, improved
position in the stretch inside rivals. MANNIX (IRE) brushed with a foe at the start, raced outside that one three wide on the first turn and early up the
backstretch, was within striking distance between runners on the far turn, failed to rally in the stretch. LUCKMAN settled at the rear near inside, came out
eight wide leaving the first turn while advancing rapidly on the pacesetter, gradually moved in to be four wide and in striking distance outside rivals on the far
turn, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE GIANT was allowed to settle trailing the field into the turn, travelled well inside picking up runners five sixteenths left to the wire, continued his
momentum shifting out to the seven path in upper stretch and was full of run with an eighth to the line to edge away in deep stretch. ROMANTIC GAMBLE
was situated mid pack on the rail entering the turn, angled out rallying around runners to vie for the lead in the six path with a sixteenth to run and was out
finished in deep stretch by the winner. TARA TATTOO made a good move circling runners four wide at the three eighths pole, continued his run to briefly
lead getting his nose in front at the furlong marker and stalled in deep stretch holding for the show award. SUPREMEACTION tracked the leaders racing
between foes down the backstretch, waited behind a wall of runners midpoint on the turn, finally found room in the the three path at the eighth pole and
closed with good energy to just miss getting up for show at the finish line. UNCLE SPIDER tracked behind the leaders on the rail at the half, waited inside
through the turn and offered a mild rally up the fence in the final sixteenth. BIG WARDEN broke sharp the lead the field in the early stages, was collared by
outside runners three sixteenths to the wire and gave way weakening the final sixteenth. DAWSON SILVER stalked in the middle of the field all alone three
furlongs remaining, was asked for more run at the quarter pole, angled to be in the eight path for the drive and passed faltering rivals the final furlong. COOL
LAOBAN tracked four wide in the beginning, took closer order to the front leaders to be in the mix two furlongs from the finish and tired between challengers
in mid stretch. DROP A CARIBOU chased the early speed, was ridden to keep up midway on the turn, gave way turning for home and had little in the
stretch. I AM RESILIENT settled close to the rear racing down the backside, was asked through the turn and could not get involved for the drive. BIG
BROWN BREWSKII travelled near the back at the half, could not keep up to the pack on the turn and was never a factor. C C'S KINGDOM tracked three
wide in the second flight early on, was roused between rivals three wide in the turn, weakened at the top of the stretch and was eased crossing the finish
line. INCENDIO threw his head, reared up at the break, hit the gate in the process and dislodged his rider at the start.
