Footnotes
CROSSTOWN GIRL stalked the pace through the far turn engaging in upper stretch edging clear along the inside under a drive. MONGOLIAN MISSION set
the pace through the far turn being engaged in upper stretch ceding late to inside pressure hanging on for place. MON PARADIS raced evenly through the
turn giving a mild rally down the lane improving some late. SAN NICOLA PRANCER stalked the pace chasing on the turn extending to upper stretch
weakening late. MY WYNTER ECHO slow early lagged to upper stretch mustering up a mild rally there. WICKED VALENTINE played no factor. ESTA
CALIENTE hustled along faded on the far turn. NATALIA'S TEMPLE tracked early then gave way on the far turn.
