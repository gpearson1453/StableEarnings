far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground mildly in the lane. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD raced off the pace
through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. ALWAYS ANGELS raced in the six path
around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and faded in the lane. CLASSIC VINYL
raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
three path and made no bid. BLONDE SAMARITAN trailed the field while racing ground through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far
turn and was not a factor. ISTRIA saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn and was empty in the stretch.
