Footnotes
SPEIGHTSTER RED led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, kicked clear
entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. EKATI'S VERVE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. FELIX THE FOX raced in the three path around the first
turn, chased the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path and kept on in the lane. BRACES raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second bend and finished evenly. INGREIDO raced in the four path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid.
SNOW CANDY raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two
path and was empty from there. NOICATTARO stumbled leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EIGHT DANZAS between runners around the first turn, moved up along the inside down the back stretch, shifted around foes leaving the quarter pole,
lugged out entering the stretch bumped with PIE KILLER, straitened up quickly, fended off late charge to the outside, got the victory under a stiff drive. MY
BOSS LADY five wide around first turn, raced off the pace and in the four path down the backside, sent along far turn from outside position, shifted in
quickly leaving the quarter pole, shifted out once more in deep stretch, gaining good ground late. DECOUPAGE sent away with a purpose, loose lead down
the backside, still clean leaving the quarter pole, collard in deep stretch, held on well for the show money. CASTILLEJA tracked leaders around the first turn,
traveled in the four path down the backside, aggressive ride far turn, finished even late. INANNA'S QUEST slow into stride, quickened tempo at the half mile
marker, split foes nearing the three eighths pole, empty late. TOWERING GAZE saved ground around both turns, had no late kick. PIE KILLER sent away
from the outside for position early, tracked leader into far turn, weakened. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC bad stumble at the start, rushed along down the
backside, outrun.

Footnotes
SEVIER led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and dueled gamely
down the lane to hold the win. GIGGING saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the rail coming off the far turn and dueled gamely to the wire to just miss while drifting out late. FLAT OUT FLYING raced in the three path around the first
turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole
and gained ground late. SCAR raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and gained
ground through the final furlong. ELLAS MY LOVE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. TWITTY CITY brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the
gate, trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the second bend and passed tiring
horses in the lane. ILLUSTRIOUS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved
ground around the far turn and made no bid. SHOOT THEMESSENGER brushed with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the five path around the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and faded in the lane. NO
SALT raced in the four path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the far turn still in the four
path and came up empty from there. SOUPER CATCH raced at the back of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, angled in to save
ground around the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
OTIS OTIS OTIS was away from the gate quickly, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming
around the turn and drew off down the lane. ODDS ON bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside
for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground through the final furlong while proving to be no match for the
winner. BAILEY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and gained ground in late
stretch. DRIVE BY LAYOVER dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kept on in upper stretch and
weakened late. INSTIGATED bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. CLASSY SOLUTION bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, settled
at the back of the pack between horses in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the five path, swung wider still into the stretch and never fired.
MUTAKAAMIL raced off the on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the five path and was empty from there. SAN
ANTONE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the four path around the turn and flattened out in the lane.
MUCHACHO MACHO raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. KEVIN WITTE trailed
the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn and was never a factor. STROLL SMOKIN dueled between horses up the backstretch,
began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

a drive. HIDDEN SPRINGS bad stumble at the start, calmly handled into the turn, queued up leaving the three eighths marker, split foes, gaining ground
through the lane, shifted inside nearing the sixteenth pole, good energy late. EMME ROO raced along the inside and off the early pace, saved ground
tracking around the turn, shifted off the inside after the quarter pole, finished willingly late. RUBY DOOBY DOO between runners into the turn, moved up
racing four wide, loomed a threat at the quarter pole, even strides late. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE tracked the speed from the four path, sent outside for the
stretch run, had no late kick. PRINCESS ZURI slow into stride, never a threat. LIL ZOIE sent early, under pressure lost ground around turn, steadily faded
