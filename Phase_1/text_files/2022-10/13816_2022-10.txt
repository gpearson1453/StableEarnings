PENANCE trailed briefly, advanced outside, bid very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and moved clear. LET'S CELEBRATE dueled between rivals
then inside and continued gamely. WICKED JANE lacked speed, swung very wide in the stretch and closed well. MAGICAL ANNA led narrowly outside
under rating then faded in the final furlong. SPIRIT OR SPITE steadied behind rivals into the far turn and flattened out. DIAL A LADY raced close up wide
and faltered after half a mile. NOT A TRACE dueled along the inside early then faded steadily. LADY BREXIT saved ground and trailed throughout.

THRILLS AND CHILLS lacked speed, advanced inside and wore down the pacesetters through the final furlong. CAPTAIN CHAZZ stalked the loose
pacesetter, took over into the stretch, moved clear but was caught late. TRUE DAKOTAN trailed for half a mile and offered some late energy. ANGELI BLU
far behind early then narrowed gap without threatening. WHERESTHEPASSION moved briefly closer into the stretch then faltered. TEMPESTUOUS was
urged off the leaders inside and faded in the stretch. MIZZEN MAN chased outside and gradually weakened. SPAN OF CONTROL prompted the pace
inside for half a mile and gave way. BAR ON THE BEACH sprinted clear to midway on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
CARTOUCHE settled early, angled inside into the far turn, angled out in the stretch, bid clear and just lasted. J D'S VISTA far behind outside, moved
extremely wide into the stretch then surged late. CHICK'S SHADOW rated outside, advanced into the stretch and finished willingly. WISHES AND DREAMS
trailed for half a mile then rallied well along the inside. BACI was reserved along the inside and lacked a rally. SHESASUPERFREAK sprinted clear in the
opening quarter, widened briefly on the turn then tired. IT CAN pursued the pacesetters near the inside and gave way. THIEF OF HEARTS prompted the
pace outside for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ADHWAA chased off the pace, bid three wide on the turn, rallied and was up in the final yards in a tight finish. HIGHTIME VALENTINE outrun early, moved
very wide, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. IMPERIAL MOON quickly took control, led to midstretch then weakened slightly. LIVE
AID saved ground throughout, moved closer in midstretch but was outfinished. LOVE ON FIRE dropped back along the inside and gave way readily. GIA'S
FUEGO raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then stopped on the turn. STILL ALIVE displayed poor action from the outset and was eased in the
stretch.

moved very wide on the final turn then moved extremely wide into the stretch. MIDNIGHT OBSESSION saved ground close up, bid into the stretch with a
gradual gain. YOU LOOK COLD forced pace in the two path, led briefly then tired. AEGEAN SEA broke sluggishly, rated wide then proved empty in the

Footnotes
CHAMPION BY DESIGN forced the pace outside, took over nearing the quarter pole then edged away through the stretch. MR. TUTTLE chased very wide
throughout and finished full of run too late. BUFFALO SHUFFLE rushed to the lead inside, was collared midway on the turn then tired. LEMON CREEK
LOUIE lacked speed, offered a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. GO FOR THE KILL raced outside within striking range and weakened. I SAW IT ALL
far back early, split rivals into the stretch and faltered. FRANK N DUCKY dropped back inside and gave way readily. NIANGUA lagged far behind
throughout. BEACH WARRIOR was urged just off the leaders then stopped abruptly.
