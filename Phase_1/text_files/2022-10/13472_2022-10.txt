Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN was sent along to set the early pace, raced just off the inside down the backstretch while inside of foes and drew off while being kept to
pressure. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) was hard sent from the inside of the Wolfman, held well for the place position but was no match for the winner. TOM
TERRIFIC raced off the early pace, moved up from the inside around the far turn and had not enough for the top pair. SHOULDA HAD IT was off very
slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced at the back of the pack early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole, lost his whip
nearing the eighth pole and lacked a final bid. BOONDOGGLE angled off the rail to chase from the outside of rivals early and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
FLETCHER stalked the pace from the outside of foes, was ridden along nearing the three eighths pole, raced three deep near the quarter pole and finished
well to prove best under steady handling. ICY INTENT settled off the early pace to race near the back of the pack early on, made an advance through the
far turn, raced three wide near the quarter pole, swung seven to eighth wide into the upper stretch and rallied for the place position. HARBOR MOON rated
along from the inside, continued an inside bid near the three eighths pole, angled out to race five deep near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to
the wire. GENERAL J R pressed the early leader from the inside down the backstretch, was headed near the eighth pole and weakened in the final stages.
EASY AS A. B. C. stalked the pace from the outside, hard ridden through the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run. SIR
LUMPALOT settled to race mid pack early, was near the inside around the far turn, shifted out through the upper stretch and lacked a final bid. CANDIDATE
showed good early speed from the outside to cross over, set the early pace and weakened the final quarter of a mile. SOUTHERN LAD raced five wide
around the first turn, lost ground to race far back and never menaced.

Footnotes
MI YAYIS showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY chased the early lead
from the outside, raced off the inside in the stretch run and held the place position but was no match for the winner. VICTORIAN RIVIERA stalked the pace,
raced along the inside around the far turn and kept on to the wire. HOV LANE stalked the pace along the inside, moved up from the rail through the stretch
and improved position late. CHASING ARTEMIS settled off the early pace, raced four wide to five wide through the far turn, raced from the outside in the
stretch run and made a late gain. CONDUCTANCE dropped back early, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled six to seven wide into the upper
stretch and had no late run. DOOMSCROLLER was void of early speed, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SAKARI chased
the early pace while racing three wide between rivals and weakened in the drive. RED PRIESTESS was rated to race in hand while racing from the outside
of rivals while racing four deep and faded in the drive. LITTLE MISS MINION dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
RECRUITER was off a step slow, showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing two deep and held gamely in the drive to remain clear under
steady pressure. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY pressed Recruiter from the inside and kept on to finish second best. TORRONE stalked the pace from the
outside, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and made a late gain to improve position. ROL AGAIN DANCER chased the pace from the inside,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly through the drive. THE COLORA KID coaxed along early while racing between rivals near
the two pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MY MAMBA settled off the pace, raced near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
KATIE'S NOTION showed good early speed to set the early pace and raced well clear to widen the margin under a steady hand ride. PHRA PHROM raced
off the early pace, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, shifted out to race four wide and was no match for the winner late. YOUR ANALYSIS chased the
pace from the outside, raced six wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. ESPRESSO LUNGO raced mid pack early on, raced three deep
near the quarter pole, angled in to race near the rail in the stretch run and made a mild late gain. FRONT DANCER was bumped at the start, raced two wide
through the far turn while racing up close and weakened the final eighth of a mile. RENNIE prompt the pace from the outside and faded. RARE BREED
dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. JEBSTER raced from the inside early on, checked nearing the three eighths
pole, raced three deep near the quarter pole, shifted out and never threatened. EL BAILADOR bobbled at the break, raced off the early pace and never was
a factor.

Footnotes
TARGE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to three wide in the stretch run and finished well to get up under all out pressure. PAISLEY SINGING
showed good early speed from the outside, crossed over half way down the backstretch, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and was wore down late to
narrowly hold the place position. DOUBLE FIREBALL sent early from the inside, lost some ground through the far turn, raced near the rail in the stretch run
and finished willingly to the wire. CHAMBEAU settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position.
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER dropped back early, raced five wide near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the stretch run and raced evenly late.
RESPONSE TIME raced mid pack early, was five deep near the three eighths pole, raced six wide past the three sixteenths and lacked a rally. MY LOVELY
GIRL raced off the early pace, ridden along nearing the three eighths pole, raced four wide around the far turn and had no response. CANVAS ART was
forwardly placed to lay up close along the inside and faded. SPICY MARGARITA was sent along, checked sharply in the early stages, raced four to five
wide around the far turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
NOBLE BID showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced off the inside in the lane and held firm to remain clear
under strong handling. MY MY GIRL was rated along to race in hand early, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch
run and rallied well late to get up for the place position. ALTA VELOCITA settled to race mid pack early on, made a rail bid through the stretch run and
finished willingly to the wire. BEHIND THE COUCH stalked the pace, raced two wide around the far turn and had no closing run. CANOODLE was unhurried
early, raced three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. I CAN RUN was void of early speed, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never
was a factor. CANADIAN GINGER was rated from the outside of Noble Bid while racing two deep and faded.

Footnotes
GERRYS GEM was bumped at the start, prompt the early leader from the outside, drifted deep stretch and prevailed under strong encouragement. HEADS
OR TAILS stalked the pace while racing outside of foes, raced three wide near the quarter pole, raced wide in the drive while racing from the outside Gerry
Gem and finished gamely to the wire. AMICALOLA FALLS was rated in the early stages, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, shifted out four to five
wide and finished willingly to the wire. CAPTAIN CARDO was bumped at the start, raced at the back of the pack early on, made a good rail bid in the stretch
run and moved up to improve postion. APPRAISAL was coaxed along between rivals early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.
GREAT CAMANOE vied for the early lead from the inside and faded in the drive. BILLINGSGATE raced off the early pace, was four deep around the far
turn and lacked a rally.
