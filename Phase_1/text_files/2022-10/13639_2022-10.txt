Footnotes
STORM GAUGE stalked the pacesetter, began to edge closer two to three wide on the turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, kicked clear and was
kept to the task. ABSOLUTE JEWEL tracked in behind the leaders off the pace, was between runners briefly late on the turn, finished well to get up for
second but too late to reach the winner while gaining best. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER stalked from outside going four to five wide on the turn, loomed a threat
at the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late kick and lost place late. LOADED SECRET settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, gained late.
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS shifted in early racing toward the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled ten wide in upper stretch, ran on well late. MOON POOL
tracked in behind mid-pack inside, came out a few path at the top of the stretch, had no late rally. GOLD FORESTER was forwardly-positioned stalking
three deep, came out six wide in upper stretch and ran on. CALL ME KITTY raced outside toward the back, went five wide on the turn, came out a bit in the
stretch, had no rally. GOLDSTORM GLORY moved forward and clear up the backstretch dictating terms, faltered in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TWIN CITY tracked the early frontrunner down the backside, closed the gap on a fading pacesetter with three eighths to run, took command nearing the
quarter pole marker, opened up a touch with an eighth to go and had enough to hold safe at the wire. SAMMY STONE settled in all alone with a half mile to
run, began to reel in the front group midway on the far turn, loomed five wide at the top of the stretch, lugged inwards on the drive in upper stretch, switched
leads in deep stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner in the final sixteenth. LOOKINASSAH was allowed to settle trailing entering the backstretch,
roused on the rail into the far turn, shifted out for run off tiring horses four wide turning for home and closed belatedly on the top two but finished up well
enough to get third money nearing the line. FIGHTING IRISH tracked just outside in the second flight off the loose leader at the half, took closer order
through the far turn, battled four wide at the top of the lane for the lead, faded between the top two finishers at the furlong marker and tired late to lose the
show award nearing the finish. ARNIE P travelled near the back of the pack into the backstretch, was asked through the far turn and could only pass tired
runners in the stretch. CALUSA DONNIE broke inwards to start, rated on the rail in the second tier at the half, was encouraged for run while inside three
eighths from the finish and offered little response through the lane. MUSICAL STRIDE broke well to quickly lead into the first turn, opened up on his rivals
down the backside, was collared outside by challengers nearing the quarter pole and had nothing left to give at the furlong marker. GREEN AMAZON trailed
the field down the backstretch and could not reach contention through to the finish line.

Footnotes
MONEY PRINTER stalked just off the pacesetter racing off the inside two to three wide, moved to the lead at the three-sixteenths, was soon clear and kept
to the task racing three to four deep down the lane. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) settled mid-division inside, came out four to five wide in upper stretch and
under urging, ran on evenly and got the nod for place while receiving continued urging. PRIMO TOUCH set the pace in the clear racing off the rail, came out
in mid-stretch, fought on for the place but lost the nod. ENGLISH CONQUEROR raced outside a foe mid-pack early, went two to three wide on the turn,
angled six to seven deep in upper stretch, kicked on mildly. RIPTIDE ROCK shifted in, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. MALIBU MAMBO was
outpaced, swung seven wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CEDAR VALLEY hopped at the start and recovered to battle up front for the lead into the turn, assumed control on the rail three eighths remaining, was
asked for more to widen in upper stretch and tired very late to be caught at the line settling for a dead heat. IS THERE A FOREST travelled in mid pack
between rivals, loomed into contention four wide at the quarter pole, took dead aim on the leader in upper stretch and found her best stride late to close well
getting up at the finish for the tie. MUMBLEBEE settled near the rear three wide down the backstretch, travelled six wide around runners on the turn, shifted
out to the seven path for the drive and closed well gaining on the leaders the final eighth to be a clear third. BODY OF LAW trailed the field with three
eighths remaining, was roused midpoint on the turn, split foes at the quarter pole, shifted outwards mildly at the furlong marker and finished with interest to
garner a minor placing. MY GIRL HOOTER veered in at the break, regrouped to sit behind the contesting leaders into the turn, slipped up the rail five
sixteenths from home, was in range in the two path at the top of the stretch and could only offer an even finish to the wire. SHISHKA showed speed
between rivals in the beginning, pressed for the lead three furlongs to go, was still in the mix for a smaller share at the furlong marker and tired in the last
sixteenth. I AM I SAID showed speed to be engaging for the front three wide into the turn, began to fade five sixteenths from the finish and weakened down
the lane. DONTCALLMESWEETY was shuffled on the turn behind foes and with rivals on either side at the quarter pole to trail, angled out to the seven path
for the stretch run and could not find more to get involved in the late stages. CORA put in a mild run racing five wide midway on the turn, began to show
signs of weakening at the top of the stretch and retreated in the drive.

Footnotes
CARELESS HEIRESS tracked inside on or just off the rail, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole, was five wide at the top of the stretch, struck
the lead a furlong out and was clear, held a rival at bay under vigorous hand urging. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH bumped with the outer rival at the start, raced
outside a foe off the pace, swung seven wide, bid outside the eventual winner in mid-stretch but could not kick on with that one. PIPESTONE pressed the
pace two to three wide, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, was overtaken by mid-stretch and outkicked. SIMPLE SOUVENIR raced inside saving ground
on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch and ran on. BORN TO BE GOOD raced outside mid-pack two to three wide, dropped back on the turn,
moved out eight deep in upper stretch and went evenly in the lane. SILENT SCARLET set the pace inside, gave way in the stretch. CLASSIC QUEEN broke
awkwardly and bumped with a rival bobbling a bit and almost losing the rider, was outrun.

Footnotes
FORESTER HUMOR broke sharp to be in front leaving the chute, continued to be the leader while uncontested through the turn, broke away in upper
stretch and was well rated to hold safe at the finish. TREBUCHET advanced outside of horses three or four wide on the turn, angled out mildly more for the
stretch drive, drifted inwards under right handed urging at the furlong marker and was gaining in deep stretch. MOMENT OF PEACE tracked the winner on
the rail throughout, was roused while chasing in vain in upper stretch and ran on determinedly through the lane to hold for third money at the finish. STAR
SCHOLAR settled at the rear down the backside, crept up the fence into the turn, angled out to the four path turning for home, dipped back inwards at the
eighth pole and finished with some energy inside for a small share. MIDNIGHT ARKLE chased the winner three wide early, loomed boldly three sixteenths
from the wire, was steadied between rivals at the furlong marker and could not recover in time to be a factor. ROBITAILLE trailed between rivals in the
beginning, was ridden to go after the leaders on the turn, little response was given and had no impact through the lane. DIXIE'S FLATTER challenged
between runners leaving the chute, began to weaken at the half mile marker and retreated in upper stretch to not be involved in the late stages.

Footnotes
SILENT LUCIDITY broke outwardly bumping a rival, settled off the pace, swung seven wide into upper stretch, drove past late. LIONESQUE dueled outside
a foe two to three wide, edged clear late on the turn, held the place but was outkicked for the top prize while drifting out late. BODIE was bumped at the
start, settled off the pace, advanced three then five wide on the turn, gained steadily in the stretch between runners and missed second. UH OH IT'S MAGIC
stalked three wide, moved out a path bumping a rival about the seven-sixteenths, was within striking distance while being asked by the quarter pole but had
no response and kicked on evenly. SCENIC HOLIDAY settled off the pace, advanced four to five wide and was bumped leaving the backstretch, continued
outside on the turn, ran on evenly lacking the needed rally. SPANISH PRINCE dueled inside, steadily weakened. THEBOYFROMGORMLEY showed brief
foot inside, dropped back, came out in the stretch. TRAGICALLY FUNNY saved ground on the turn but was outpaced throughout.

Footnotes
PICTUREDAY JESSICA trailed the pack at the quarter pole, looked for running room at the top of the stretch, found a seam in the four path at the furlong
marker and accelerated to shoot through to get up in the last jump. WANT TO GO DANCING tracked the dueling leaders three wide early on, took
command at the top of the stretch, drifted out mildly driving to the wire and was caught right on the line. INTO EMPIRES SONG showed early speed just
outside to battle for the top spot in the beginning, was in contention turning for home between runners, stubbornly fought on in deep stretch while not
threatening the top two but held on to best the rest for third money. DIXIEWISH was taken back to trail in the beginning, angled to the inside at the half, was
eager while under restraint through the turn, waited while in tight quarters with horses around her two furlongs from home and finished outside with late
energy for the minors. BAYSVILLE showed speed to battle inside for the lead down the backstretch, was collared by outside foes at the top of the stretch,
tried to respond and needed another gear to be involved the last eighth. WANNA PLAY tracked the frontrunners on the rail, slipped up the fence throughout
the turn, was in range at the top of the stretch and had nothing to offer inside running to the line. FREE CARRYCOMB advanced around runners four wide
at the three furlong marker, loomed five wide at the quarter pole, angled out to the eight lane for the stretch run and was empty to wire. TECHIE sat in the
two path behind the frontrunners, waited midway on the turn outside, was steadied briefly with five sixteenths remaining, angled to the seven path and had
no finish for the drive.
