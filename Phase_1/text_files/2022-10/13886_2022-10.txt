Footnotes
ONE WAY RAY pressed the pace two wide into the turn, moved to vie for the lead through the turn, cleared into the lane then widened through the final
eighth while being ridden out. BUMPY set the early pace, was joined by the winner on the turn, vied with that one through the turn and into the lane, could
not keep up after straightening then held on for the place spot. CHA CHA LARRY chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane
then weakened. JUST A NOTION raced in the four path through the turn while well back, dropped closer to the inside into the lane and never factored.
STUDENT PRINCE was never a factor while in the three path. LOOKING SALTY was off alertly, raced near the inside through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN set the early pace while under pressure from the inside into the turn, continued under pressure from the inside through the turn,
cleared entering the lane then widened when asked. MYLITTLEREDVETTE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, lost contact with the winner while
straightening into the lane then stayed on to be clearly second best. ANCHOR MANNE raced into the turn while near the inside, came off the rail to pass a
tiring rival in mid-turn, angled into the three path entering the lane, shifted into the five path inside the eighth pole and could not gain while finishing best of
the rest. AMELIA'S MACHO never a menace while in the four path throughout. VICIOUS RUMOR raced in the three to the two path through the turn,
dropped closer to the rail for the drive and never was a factor. DREAM TRAVELER never made an impact while racing in the three path through the turn
and in the five path into the lane. CROSSING THE ROAD outrun along the inside. IMPLODING raced close up early to put pressure on the winner into the
turn then steadily faded along the inside.

GUANA CAY stalked the pace in the three path, dueled outside of a foe around the turn and early stretch, drew off and lasted under mild urging.
TREASURE OF WAR was unrushed, rallied four wide at the three-eighths pole, closed but couldn't get past the winner. WELLINGTON WONDER stalked
the pace in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. HABUIAH stalked the pace in the two path, dueled inside, then gave way in the stretch.
THEREARENORULES raced evenly in the two path, then faded in the stretch. KIMBERLEY DREAM was not a factor. POLKA POLENTA led inside before
giving way approaching the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
ZUPITA was off alertly to gain the lead at once, raced on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane while off the inside, floated out to the four path while
straightening, continued clear to the eighth pole then widened while being kept to the task. EVIL INTENTIONS raced five to four wide through the turn, came
into the lane from the six path with aim on the top one, could not reel that one in but stayed on to save the place spot in her debut. PUMPITUPJUSTICE was
in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the minor share. MEAN ELENITA was unhurried
while just off the inside through the turn, angled into the six to seven path for the drive and finished with energy. D' KITTEN saved ground through the turn
and into the lane then finished evenly while not a menace. DISHIN' IT OUT was well back while in the two path, came into the lane from the four path and
gained belatedly. MARTZ CREEK MUSIC chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane and weakened. KNOCKNEREA tracked the
pace from the two or three path through the turn and into the lane then faded. LEGS FOR DAYS was in the three or four path through the turn when not a
serious threat, angled to the nine path and was never in it. RHYTHM FOREVER raced in the three path through the turn while a contender then was empty
