Footnotes
SINGING ALLI was sent for pace, set a comfortable and uncontested lead, went to a drive in upper stretch, and kept finding enough to maintain her
advantage despite drifting out a few paths late. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN raced keenly inside early, tracked the leader inside of BEING CREATIVE, took up past
the seven eighths despite no apparent mischief, continued keenly into the backstretch, tracked in range in the two to three path around the far turn, and
chased on second best in the lane. BEING CREATIVE tracked the leader outside of AIKEN TO BE TAKIN, continued in the three to four path outside that
foe in range of the leader around the far turn, chased on three wide in upper stretch, drifted out a few paths and ultimately lacked the needed late kick to
improve position. BEZEL SET chased toward the rear inside of EMOJI PRINCESS while racing keenly under restraint around the clubhouse turn, chased
the leading tri down the back straight and in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven in the six path in upper stretch, and flattened out. MEXIA
chased toward the rear two wide around the first turn, settled back to the rear pair outside of EMOJI PRINCESS for the backstretch run, was urged in the six
path around the far turn and offered a brief, mild bid, floated into the eight path into the lane and could not sustain a bid in the stretch. EMOJI PRINCESS
settled at the rear, raced inside of MEXIA in the rear pair down the back straight, took mildly closer order in the five path on the far turn, floated into the lane
in the seven path and came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was rated tracking off the first flight five wide on the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn to
upper stretch, wrested the advantage in that path entering the lane and went clear under some right handed encouragement. WEDDING BOURBON,
forwardly placed between rivals in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn tracking just off the leaders, came through inside those foes when
presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for command but proved only second best. HAPPY SAILS, forwardly placed three deep between foes in
the opening stages, was eased off the leaders nearing the bend, shifted to the five path racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a
share late. TROUBLE IN RED broke sharply, pressed the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled three deep between foes into upper
stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. AMARI S., urged to terms with the pacesetter four deep between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the
inside dueling for command into the turn, tipped off the rail disputing the issue between foes into the stretch but came up empty late. MARQUEE COWBOY
settled between foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. MY LADY SLEW, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside while being prompted to contend
in the opening stages, steadied out of tight quarters racing past the nine sixteenths marker and soon retreated. EVIE JEAN, bumped at the start, angled to
the inside racing in the last flight early and failed to menace thereafter. NEW CHINA switched out four wide dropping off the leaders on the backstretch and
never proved a threat. LALUCHADORA proved no factor.

and around the turn, swung out five wide for the drive, was outkicked by FOLLOW THE SIGNS and CHANNEL WON into the lane, but continued to chased
on best of the rest. REMEMBER THE MAINE settled toward the rear early, began to improve two wide on the turn, and found his best between horses in the

at the inside of the leading flight, took back abruptly past the seven sixteenths, chased on midpack in the two path around the rest of the turn and flattened
in the lane. GREELEYS ICE chased midpack down the back straight and in the four path on the turn, raced five to six wide in the lane and flattened from
midstretch. MASTER GUNS was reluctant to load, chased toward the rear of midpack early, got carried out near the center of the track by GRAND
HIDEAWAY past the seven sixteenths, raced six wide into the lane and flattened out. AIRWAR chased near the rear, saved ground around the turn, was
driven inside in the lane and offered no bid. OMAR ATTACK settled near the rear, raced in the six path on the turn and had no rally near the center of the

Footnotes
CO CONSPIRATOR, reluctant to load in the gate, broke readily, angled in sharply racing to the first turn forcing the pace, dictated the pace into the
backstretch on a narrow advantage just off the rail, continued to dispute the issue inside foes in that path to the far turn, dueled for command between foes
into upper stretch and gamely held his rivals, edging clear late under firm handling. SCAT SHACK came through close quarters to gain a forward placing
along the inside racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to briefly loom outside the winner but was
outkicked in the drive. FLASHY RICHIE angled to the inside in early stages dropping off the second flight, saved ground to the lane while gradually drawing
into striking distance, bid inside the top pair when presented an opening in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. EMPTY HOLSTER bobbled at the
start, settled between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression. TWO
COOKIE RULE, caught in tight quarters between foes racing into the first turn, advanced between rivals racing through the backstretch to prompt the
pacesetter into the far turn but faded in the drive. ZARMAE settled outside foes in the last flight racing three deep to the backstretch and never gained
contention. A BOLD RYDE, caught in close quarters three deep racing into the first turn, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter three wide into the
backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
PROTONIC POWER shifted inwards while being rated between rivals off the second flight to the backstretch, angled inside on the far turn while conceding
some position, tipped off the inside nearing midstretch to split foes and produced a solid late response to surge to the lead between rivals in late stages
under firm handling. SAMYAZA gained a forward placing between foes racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, angled inside the leader to bid for
command along the rail racing into upper stretch and kept on with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. BENS MALICE was settled well off the
leaders while switching off the inside to the backstretch, advanced four wide, then five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest while being
outkicked for second. ULTIMATE IRONY, bumped, then held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, settled along the inside to the far turn, tipped
out to split rivals three deep in the stretch and steadily gained position to the end. DYNABLUE settled along the inside in the last flight to the backstretch,
saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort to improve position along the rail in the drive. GATE CREW angled to the inside early tracking off the
second flight, pulled his way to contention after a half, gained on the leaders along the rail on the far turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch to bid between
foes but flattened out leaving midstretch. CHICKEN TRUCK, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to advance
four wide into the far turn to gain terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. UNCLE NICK, caught in tight quarters
dropping off the first flight racing to the first turn was rated between rivals in the second flight, switched outside foes on the far turn and was carried wide
entering the stretch by LONESOME DREAM while losing momentum. CHANGI tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and faded
between foes racing through the far turn. FLEET OF HOOF, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way nearing the
lane. LONESOME DREAM, urged to the lead inside rivals from the break, drifted out racing through the first turn, held sway on a narrow advantage to the
second bend, drifted out markedly nearing the lane and emptied out abruptly. ANDREW THE GIANT settled last early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HAND PAY chased while saving ground, was pushed along past the three eighths and began to improve, was driven inside in upper stretch, shifted out near
the three sixteenths to get outside of UNCASHED, sustained his rally, got up in the final jumps, did not return to be unsaddled though he appeared merely
excitable but not in any apparent distress, and was vanned from the backstretch gap to the test barn. UNCASHED was reluctant to load, was sent for speed
between horses but outsprinted to the front by LOOKIN FOR BALA, attended a fast pace outside of that foe, vied through midstretch while drifting out,
wrested the lead near the sixteenth pole, but could not hold off HAND PAY in the final strides. LOOKIN FOR BALA was sent between horses, set a fast
pace inside while prompted by UNCASHED, continued on the lead while saving ground around the turn, vied inside through midstretch, was headed by
UNCASHED near the sixteenth and flattened late. MCMONEY settled at the rear, trailed along the rail on the turn, bid along the rail into the lane, and kept
on best of the rest under a drive. RIGHT ON RICHIE chased between horses early, came three wide into the turn, chased toward the rear in the four to five
path around the turn, was driven five wide into the lane and kept on mildly past tiring horses late. DIXIEMAGIC broke outward but nonetheless sharply, was
hustled for pace but ultimately outsprinted by LOOKIN FOR BALA and UNCASHED, tracked the leading pair while steadily pushed along, chased the
leading pair in the three path on the turn, floated into the five path in upper stretch and weakened. SUMMER ALL YEAR tracked the leading pair inside of
DIXIEMAGIC early, settled back between horses in the chasing flight approaching the half, chased near the rear in the three path on the turn, angled inside
in upper stretch and came up empty. SIR STERLING chased three wide early, joined to track outside of DIXIEMAGIC approaching the half, chased the
leading pair in the four path on the turn, but weakened between horses in the lane.

Footnotes
EL ASESINO, brushed at the start, was urged through close quarters to dispute the pace between rivals, shifted out of tight quarters after the opening
quarter to press the pace three wide into the turn, gradually drew on even terms with the pacesetter in a prolonged drive past midstretch and narrowly
prevailed in an all out effort. PINSON broke alertly, angled in sharply brushing the eventual winner while crowding BOOM FIVE THOUSAND, set the pace
on a narrow advantage just off the rail racing into the bend, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid through the stretch but just failed to contain that foe. TALE
OF THE NILE ducked out at the start, settled off the second flight racing into the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to
edge a rival for a share. YAK tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn, advanced four wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed final kick while just missing for a share. GONZO broke outwards brushing the eventual winner, was settled out of tight quarters racing last in early
stages, saved ground on the turn gathering momentum, then tipped out three wide in the closing stages to gain some position while no real threat.
SIRCORRI tracked off the first flight between foes while angling inwards nearing the bend but came up empty in the drive. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND,
brushed while racing in tight quarters along the rail pressing the pace through the backstretch, contested the issue into upper stretch and gave way. JUST
GUN IT tracked the leaders between foes in second flight but faded early. ONE WAY HOME dropped out early.
