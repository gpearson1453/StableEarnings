Footnotes
STEADY JOHN was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far turn and edged clear late. CORKY'S CAUSE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, improved position from the rail down the lane and missed. DOMINGUEZ chased the front
runner between horses through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around the second bend and kept on to the wire, getting outfinished late.
DIAL HIM UP raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made up some
ground in the lane while never threatening. RUNNIN THE RED bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, saved ground around the first turn, settled
off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, swung wide into the stretch and was empty in the middle
of the track from there. RIVES stumbled leaving the gate, bumping with the horse to his outside in the process, recovered to lead the way while saving
ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn, took a bobbling step in midstretch, was pulled up and vanned
off.

TRUSTYOURINSTINCT sent strait away for the lead and the rail, very nice tempo around the turn, felt the pressure from the outside rival nearing the
quarter pole, accelerated quickly, went clear under a steady drive. SAN ANTONE stalked the leader from the start, just outside and just off the flank of the
pace setter into the turn, loomed a danger nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with winner, held off inside foe late for the place money. DOODLE
HOPPER slow into stride, raced off the pace and five wide into the turn, shifted inside leaving the quarter pole, stayed along the rail through stretch, gaining
late. FUTILE tracked the leaders early on, moved up into the turn between runners, shifted towards the three path around the turn, no gain through the
stretch. THE EXCEPTION clean start from the outside post, tracked from the three path, moved up around the turn, five wide top, faded late. BAPTIZE THE
BOY hard to load, broke slow, outrun.

Footnotes
WHIZWIT good early speed, dragged himself into the race from the outside, raced just off the flank of the pace setter around the turn, took over leaving the
quarter pole, went clear inside the sixteenth, under a drive. PROUD CIVILIAN tracked early on from the inside, lost ground around the turn along the inside,
shifted out four wide through the stretch, found best strides late. CAPTAIN QUINT nice clean break, found the leading roll into the turn, collard leaving the
quarter pole, held on the show placing through the stretch. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON raced off the early pace, split foes moving up near the three eighths
pole, shifted out four wide leaving the quarter pole, even through the wire. COATANDTIEREQUIRED slow into stride, moved inside around the turn, had no
late kick. WIRED IN between runners into the turn, scrubbed on around the turn, no late bid. GANDHI'S ORION clean start from the outside, coaxed along
four wide, lost ground around the turn, outrun stretch.
