Footnotes
BUXTERHOOTER tracked the leading pair inside, continued in the pocket down the back straight, tracked the leader in the three path on the far turn, bid
outside him near the five sixteenths, vied outside him into the lane, took the lead near the furlong mark, and held to the wire under a drive between horses.
FEELING DANGEROUS broke a step slowly and awkwardly, settled at the rear, raced at the inside of the rear pair down the backstretch, took closer order
from near the five eighths, chased along the rail around the far turn, rallied inside into the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, continued to draw closer under a
drive, caught PRIVATE LAKE for second in the final strides but just missed catching the winner. PRIVATE LAKE broke through the gate but was held in
place by the assistant starter, was sent for pace between horses, set the pace while pressured by GOLDENPENCE, cleared into the far turn, set the pace in
the two path around that bend, vied inside of BUXTERHOOTER in upper stretch under a drive, was headed at the furlong mark, dug in gamely, but could
not reel that foe back in and lost place late. STAGE DOOR chased outside of BUXTERHOOTER around the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair
between horses into the backstretch, settled back off the tracking flight near the five eighths, chased in the five path around the far turn, came into the lane
in the six path and chased on mildly to prove best of the rest under a drive. MY BOBBY MCGEE chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, joined the
tracking flight three wide down the back straight, continued to track in the five path on the far turn, raced four wide into the lane and came up empty. DOM
CAETANO (ARG) settled second last around the first turn, raced in the rear pair well behind the tracking flight into the back straight, took slightly closer
order past the three eighths, trailed in the three to four path around the far turn and had no bid in the lane. GOLDENPENCE was sent for speed outside
foes, pressed the pace outside of PRIVATE LAKE, proved no match for that foe into the second turn, tracked between horses in the four path, emptied out
past the three eighths, was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
STORM'S REFLECTION, away alertly, was urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, turned back a rival's
challenge on the far turn and held sway to the end under firm handling. STORM BORN angled to the rail tracking off the first flight racing into the first turn,
saved ground to upper stretch, tipped out three wide racing past midstretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. JEALOUS EYES, caught six wide
while carried out by MICHAEL GEORGE racing into the first turn, continued to gain position three deep, then four wide racing into the lane and gained
position to the end while edging a rival for a share. HURTS SO BAD, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, then to the far turn,
weakened leaving midstretch. OPTION, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in pursuit in that path to the far turn
and gave way. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the second flight three deep between foes, continued
evenly in that path to late stages. KEEN RESPONSE was settled outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside after a half, saved ground through
the far turn into the lane but made no impact. HARMON KILLER BREW, reserved between foes to the backstretch, continued evenly three deep between
foes to late stages. LUKE ATTACK switched outside a rival racing into the first turn to track the leaders as part of the second flight to the far turn and
steadily faded into the lane. JACKPOT BOY angled to the inside early while racing as part of the last flight and failed to menace thereafter. MEET GEORGE
JETSON, reserved last to the backstretch, offered no rally. MICHAEL GEORGE drifted out five wide racing into the first turn and dropped out early. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

OEUVRE tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, swung into the lane into the six path outside the dueling
pair, loomed into midstretch, vied outside of DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT past the furlong mark, and edged to a defined lead in the final sixteenth. DANCIN AT
MIDNIGHT had a narrow lead while pressed by PURR SEA to her inside down the backstretch, dueled outside of that foe around the turn, floated into the
lane in the five path and continued to duel outside of PURR SEA, vied inside of OEUVRE to her outside past the furlong mark, but was outfinished in the
final sixteenth. PURR SEA hounded the pace inside of DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT down the back straight, dueled inside of that foe around the turn, floated into
the lane in the four path and continued to duel inside of DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT, was no match approaching the sixteenth mark and flattened out late.
WHITE LIES raced two wide in the rear pair, was between horses once IGGY BIGS joined the rear flight near the five eighths ,chased in the two path
between horses on the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. GO MADI GO bobbled slightly at the start and came away
last, settled at the inside of the rear pair, hugged the rail on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and flattened. IGGY BIGS chased early, joined the
rear flight three wide near the five eighths, was urged in the four to five path past the three eighths, came into the lane in the six path and had no rally.

COFFEE CALIENTE, urged between rivals to gain a narrow advantage in the opening stages, dictated the pace along the inside racing into the turn, kicked
clear through the stretch and held a safe advantage to the end under right handed encouragement. TAHOE RUN, forwardly placed three wide between foes
racing on terms with the first flight into the bend, kept on with a steady effort through the stretch to prove best of the others in the drive. CELEBRATING
HAL, forwardly placed along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing into the bend, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to
advance but was outkicked for second. LINE TO GAIN tracked off the first flight four wide on the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane and
continued evenly. MOON CONNECTION, urged between foes pressing the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. RED BIRD
tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn but offered no rally. INDIO GUAPO settled outside foes in the last
flight early but proved no threat. NORMANDY ANGEL broke outwards bumping SNOWMOBILE at the start and dropped out early. SNOWMOBILE,
bumped, then shuffled back at the start, retreated early.

Footnotes
STAR OF KODIAK was settled into stride dropping well off the second flight shifting to the three path racing to the turn, was urged to advance splitting rivals
entering upper stretch, shifted five wide racing past the furlong marker and produced a solid late response to just nip AZRAEL at the wire under firm
handling. The latter was rated just off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out, then angled in to the two path nearing upper stretch,
split foes just off the inside to gain the advantage late and just missed. SIERRA HOTEL tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing through
the backstretch, advanced in that path to challenge nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide between foes racing past midstretch contesting the issue
but was outkicked by the top pair. LAKE MILLS broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the bend, shifted out
entering upper stretch resisting several challengers, but yielded in late stages. TUFF ATTACK angled to the inside early stalking just inside the pacesetter
racing to the turn, advanced along the rail into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. JOLTING JOE settled well off the leaders while angling to the
rail in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out avoiding tight quarters in late stages while making no real impression. STALLONE vied
briefly between foes in the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE settled outside foes in early stages
and proved no threat. MAJESTIC ATTACK tracked off the second flight four wide on the backstretch and steadily retreated into the turn.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL was reluctant to load, broke sharply between horses, prompted outside of FOGGY KITTEN, stalked into the turn, reengaged in the
three path past the five sixteenths, vied into the lane, kicked clear past the three sixteenths and held clear under urging. SWEET CONFUSION was slow
into stride, advanced when nudged along past the five eighths, attempted to split horses into the far turn but steadied approaching the seven sixteenths, was
pushed along from the inside near the three eighths and began to improve, swung five wide into the stretch, sustained her bid and got up for place. OWEN'S
PLEASURE chased toward the rear outside of CHAMPAGNE BLING, was pushed along in the five path on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch,
angled inward and rallied through horses past the furlong mark, kept on inside late but was outkicked for the place. BIRDIE BE GONE tracked the leading
pair down the backstretch, raced in the four path in the tracking flight on the turn, bid three wide near the five sixteenths, was driven four wide in range in
upper stretch, could not match GO STORMIN GIRL from the three sixteenths, chased between horses but could not hold place late. CHAMPAGNE BLING
chased toward the rear inside of OWEN'S PLEASURE early, chased in the four path around the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and continued willingly to
the finish. JOLIE RULER trailed early, regained touch with the field into the turn, joined the rear flight of the main group in the six path around the bend,
swung eight wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick. VOODAYO chased midpack early, tracked while saving ground inside of BIRDIE BE GONE on
the turn, was in range in upper stretch but caught behind traffic, kept on under a drive to midstretch and flattened past the furlong mark. FOGGY KITTEN
was sent for speed inside of GO STORMIN GIRL, set the pace while pressured by that foe, was headed at the three sixteenths, kept on in range to the
furlong mark and emptied out inside.

Footnotes
SEMINOLE BEACH was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped off the inside after a half to track the leaders into the far
turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then split foes while shifting to the three path in upper stretch and continued with a solid late
response to wrest the advantage and edge clear under right handed pressure. MILLARD'S SMILE tracked just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the
first turn, moved to close the gap on the backstretch shifting out three wide, pressed the issue outside a rival, then challenged for command between foes
nearing upper stretch, struck the front entering the lane but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. MACHINEGUNPREACHER settled last outside foes to the
backstretch, advanced four wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. AMANI'S EAGLE, caught four wide racing to the
first turn, was rated just off the second flight on the backstretch, advanced to lodge a brief bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened
out in the drive. PINEDALE broke outwards bumping CAMARGO at the start, was reserved along the inside while climbing a bit in the opening stages,
switched outside foes racing into the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch but made no real impression. SNOOZER was urged forcing the pace outside
a rival on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command while shifting to the inside racing into the far turn and gave way midstretch.
CAMARGO, bumped at the start, was urged pressing the pace inside a rival into the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BEHAVIN MYSELF cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued clear in the four path on the backstretch, kept setting the pace in the two to three path on the
second turn, was engaged by BETTER THINK TWICE into upper stretch, was also engaged by EGOMANIAC to his outside midstretch, dug in between
horses, separated from the rest of the field with EGOMANIAC from the sixteenth mark, battled and got the nod at the wire. EGOMANIAC settled in second
last, was pushed along two wide for a bid into the far turn, improved in the three path, swung into the lane in the five path, sustained his rally, engaged the
leading flight past the furlong, ran on well to separate from the field along with BEHAVIN MYSELF in the final sixteenth, fought on but missed by the
slimmest of margins. KNIEVEL chased between horses around the first turn, inched forward between the tracking flight past the five eighths, was driven in
the two path near the three eighths, improved under urging in range in the three path in upper stretch, remained close up between horses past midstretch
but was no match for the leading pair in the final sixteenth. FEEDING FRENZY chased three wide through the first turn, settled back toward the rear into the
backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn and improved to midfield in the five path, swung into the lane in the six to seven path, and chased on mildly.
BETTER THINK TWICE tracked the pace inside of COOL CAT CHARLIE, was pushed along into the far turn and tracked along the rail, bid inside of
BEHAVIN MYSELF into upper stretch, loomed through midstretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. COOL CAT CHARLIE tracked the leader outside of
BETTER THINK TWICE through the first turn and down the back straight, raced three wide in the tracking flight into the far turn, flattened in the four path
around that bend, was driven approaching the quarter pole but came up empty. COPPER CROSSING chased inside, flattened in the two to three path on
the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and proved empty. RECKLESSNESS hopped at the start, settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the
far turn, had no response when asked in upper stretch and was allowed to trail home.
