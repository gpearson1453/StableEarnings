Footnotes
MY BOY SAM pressed the pace, raced close throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. NUGGET OF GRACE vied on the
front end, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but held off MARVINS GOLD for place. MARVINS GOLD unhurried in the beginning, made a
steady gain, came around the final turn five wide, made a bid and was outfinished for second. SCREWBALL hopped start, raced within striking distance,
forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late rally. VALIANT DEFENDER void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. FIFTYFIVE STRONG
raced near the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and was never a factor. AMBASSADOR HOUSE pressed the early pace, raced four wide around
the second turn and faded. HEAVENLY TRUMP void of early speed and was never close. HARD TWIST showed early speed, dropped back and was
outrun.

backside, moved up, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. I'LL RAISE YOU raced near the rear in the beginning, made a late bid, racing
four wide around the turn and was outfinished for second. LION HEART LEGEND pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. G

Footnotes
LAGOON challenged for the early lead, drove clear around the turn, pulled away down the lane and proved much the best. LUCAS ZIP IT broke sharp,
eased off the front end, came around the turn on the outside, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LOUISIANA FLASH
vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. FOOLISH BOY challenged on
the front end, saved ground, lacked a late kick and missed show. CAPTAIN COOL raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside and
finished evenly. MALIBU MONEY broke poorly, racing in the rear and was never a threat. PRODUCTION TIME void of early speed and was never close.
RAMMER JAMMER always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
MO CLASSY pressed the pace, moved up down the backside and challenged for the lead, took command, pulled away and held on well for the win. MO
BLING unhurried in the beginning, had an outside trip, made a late gain, finished willingly and was a clear second. MEET ME raced in the middle of the field,
saved ground around the second turn, made a late bid and was a clear third. OUR LITTLE GIRL raced in back of the field, made a late rail bid and was no
factor. EMMAS RULER void of early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, finished wide and was no threat. CUSTOM FOR TINA went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. IRON BANNER pressed the pace, faded and was finished early. A WISH FOR MADELYN raced within
contention, saved ground and dropped to the back.

BINDING unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn, dueled on the inside down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. TEMPRANO
raced within striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of odthers.
DARREN'S FORTUNE went to the front, drove clear down the backside, lacked a finished and was a clear third at the wire. LIAM SKYE raced in the middle
of the field and put forth an even effort. APPLEWOOD lacked early speed and was never a factor. I'M D'CAT stumbled badly at the start and was always
near the back. WHISKEY'S GONE pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.
