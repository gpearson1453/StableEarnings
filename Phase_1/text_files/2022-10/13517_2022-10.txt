Footnotes
SEVENTH ST DIAMOND was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was up in the
closing yards. CROSSFIRE COWGIRL dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole but could not resist the
winner late. NEW MEXICO LINDY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MISS
FLUFFY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. ABSTRACT LILLY was off
slow, rushed to vie, raced five-wide through the turn and gave way through the final furlong. PRETTY PEPPY disputed the pace from between foes and
weakened after going three furlongs. I WIN LIKA GIRL vied for the lead while racing four-wide from between foes and weakened after going five furlongs.
ELEGANT EMPRESS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. ROCKETT'S RED CITY lacked early speed, raced off
the rail through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SHELLY D'ORO set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. SUPERBLEA lacked early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and gained the place. ZIPPIN BY U was void of early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. RAISE OUR FLAG dwelt, raced unhurried early, moved
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LITTLE SAMURAI settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
rally. PRESLEY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. SHELL GAME pressed the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

DIGGER'S GOLD was allowed to settle early, moved three-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the final yards.
SWITCHERONIMO settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and rallied late. CEDAR EXTRA BOLD set a pressured pace from
the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way late. BREXTON was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and lacked the needed closing response. MICKEYS GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to rally.
TRUST N PRAYER was off a step slow, moved up from the inside to offer a bid nearing the half and weakened soon after.

and drew clear. TRICKING TRIXIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid in tandem with the winner with a
sixteenth to run but could not match strides with that rival late. EXPRESS WARRIOR was off slow, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. SPACE GIRL lacked early foot, angled out nearing the quarter and again in
mid-stretch and finished with some late run. INDY GAL DORO sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and tired through
the final furlong. SISTER MARK chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened in the drive. DARTH ZILLA showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JAZZ DIVA was off a step slow then rushed to contention, chased the leaders while racing six-wide and
