and then was brushed after that by the winner and finished well. TAX ME NAUGHT Close up along the two path, took the rail on the turn, eased out and
finished with interest. SABREEN Five wide early, three path on the turn and weakened. PARTY IN THE RAINE Saved ground on the turn and tired. STEAL

Footnotes
ONE JOURNEY Away on top, set the pace along the two path, was collared midway around, lost the lead, came back to take the advantage and drove
clear. SINGLE PURPOSE Broke sluggishly, well placed along the three path, four wide into the lane and closed well late. FLOWERS GALORE Well placed
along the two path, angled out and made a late bid. SWEET TOOTH SUE Lagged back four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. EMPRESS PALPATINE
Tracked, challenged midway around the turn, took the lead into the lane, was hooked and faded. MY LITTLE ONE Three path on the turn, was outrun.
WOWSPELLEDBACKWARD Hard to load in the gate, two path on the turn and tired. MY DADDY'S TRAINER Broke slow, saved ground and tired.
