Footnotes
MAJESTIC SEAS was hustled along to set a pressured pace from the half mile pole, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch
handling and just lasted. ROCKET APPEAL engaged in close early chase then dropped a bit out of contention, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out past
the eighth pole and closed steadily to share. BE BE BOP pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, remained a factor
to deep stretch but flattened in the final yards. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased outside, ran in the five path of the turn and finished well. NOT A TRICK
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, raced evenly to mid-stretch but ducked out steadying in later yards. SPURN chased off
the rail, rounded the turn in the three and four paths then flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
THEOLA FUGGINS was hustled along to set the pace, widened at the rail on the turn then kept alert through the stretch. STORMIN' ANNA chased outside
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, cleared ARAYA mid-stretch and finished well. The latter came away awkwardly then gave
chase, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. SHE'S A BRICKHOUSE chased toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn, was
forced out past the eighth pole but came back to finish evenly. SUPER WICKED chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, angled out
past the eighth pole then flattened stride the final sixteenth. DREAM OF GOLD chased, rounded the turn in the four path and raced widest in the lane.
COSMIC REWIND stumbled leaving the gate then angled to the inside to give chase, checked, and may have brushed the rail past the five sixteenths pole
and had little left.

MOTAWAAFEQ tapered in to stalk the runner-up off the rail, pulled himself to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear at the five
sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn then only under a mild hand ride in the lane. BENNY THE BOOK moved to the inside and rated the early pace,

settle for second best. SULEMAN broke a step slow then saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and was
along for third widest. PROUD UNION saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly
down the lane. ITS OVER rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn three
wide and ran evenly in the lane. VIOLENT ROCK settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran two deep while between
