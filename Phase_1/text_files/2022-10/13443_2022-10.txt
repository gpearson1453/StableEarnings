ADRIEN'S AURORA saved ground in second flight, went five wide off the final turn, gained in the final sixteenth and held safe. JUMEIRAH COAST angled
out, off the rail sharply in the backstretch, advanced quickly into the lane, lodged a rail bid inside then missed while finishing with good energy. PAULIE
WALNUTS broke outward bumping outside foe, chased from the rail, and improved position late. STORMCHASER dueled inside for the early lead, shook
off rival into the stretch and yielded late stretch. EVER TRUE dueled outside of STORMCHASER, was unable to continue on with the fore mentioned and
gave way. BEAUTIFUL BABE bumped leaving, and chased throughout. BOLSANO broke awkwardly, and failed to menace. CHILLIN WITH CHIP allowed to
settle outside early, and had no response when called upon.

AWESOME SATURDAY stalked five wide in the backstretch, overtook the lead at the three eighths pole, drew clear into the lane and finished under strong
hand ride. DANCING WILLIE led the way leaving the chute, contended the pace from between foes, was overtaken then chased three way into the lane,
was no match for the winner and finished up clearly second best. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER sat in striking position in the three path, and lacked the kick
needed. MR. KALYPSO raced near the back of the pack outside, and passed tiring. IRISH TRICK stalked four wide, was checked leaving the backstretch,
and was faded. DELVECCHIO pressed from the rail, and gave way inside.

ARROGANCE rated off the pace from the rail, was roused off the final turn, and ran down the leader. KAPTAIN KOWBOY vied hard outside in the three
path, drew clear in the far turn, saw margins diminish nearing the stretch and was ran down late. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK unhurried early, and closed late
for show. IT CAN'T HURT vied inside, was unable to move on with KAPTAIN KOWBOY in the far turn, and flattened in the stretch. LIKE GOLD lodged a late
bid. YOGA RULER chased four wide and tired early. ALBERTA never reached contention.

Footnotes
BON PRIX hustled to the front, turned back challenge from BIG AL'S VISION in the far turn, moved clear into the stretch and held safely. ZICATELA tracked
five to six wide, went in pursuit of the leader but was unable to reach BON PRIX and finished up well. DREADNAUGHT unhurried early, round the final turn
in the four path, and rallied late stretch. GRAY ADMIRAL saved ground and was outkicked in the stretch. BIG AL'S VISION prompted the early pace, was
unable to move on with the eventual winner and yielded in the stretch. SOUTHERN WARLORD chased inside early, drifted out off the final turn and gave
way. ROLLIN SEVENS raced very wide though the backstretch, and failed to menace. AMEER never involved.

GOLD'S UP race six wide into the opening turn, tracked outside through the backstretch, gave chased in the final turn, dueled inside of WIDE EYED WILEY
at the head of the stretch, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. WIDE EYED WILEY settled outside leaving the first turn, commenced a bid nearing the
quarter pole, dueled outside of GOLD'S UP but was outfinished. CONTE ROSSO sat in striking position, moved up alongside SPIRIT RACER near the half
marker, dueled through the final turn, disposed of rival and was lacked the closing response needed, but held on for show honors. REMAIN CALM went
wide through the opening turn, rallied late stretch and missed. ANDY BOBBY angled to the two path leaving the first turn then was reserved off the early
pacesetters, was set down at the head of the lane and lacked the kick that was needed. AMIGO QUERIDO lacked a serious bid. PRENTON outrun
throughout. SPIRIT RACER took the lead into the first turn, was joined by CONTE ROSSO leaving the backstretch, and wilted abruptly at the three sixteenth
pole.

Footnotes
LITTLE HARPER fanned four wide leaving the first turn, contested the pace outside of WHITEROSE SPIRIT in the backstretch, moved clear just after the
half, was kept under mild encouragement into the stretch and remained clear of any challengers. SHE'S EXPENSIVE took closer order nearing the quarter
pole, rallied between into the stretch and edged away late stretch securing second. HUMBOLDTSTRONG raced in tight quarters into the opening turn,
saved ground inside, closed four wide into the stretch and was along late for show. SAYGE'S SPIRIT tracked the pace from the rail, battled inside entering
the stretch, and weakened late. FOREVER LADY dropped back in traffic leaving the opening turn, chased the leader into the final turn, and flattened out.
LULABELLE hustled early, was gapped, and showed interest late. MUSICAL RELOAD settled three wide leaving the opening turn, and tired early.
PRECIOUS NOTES raced in close quarters into the opening turn then was rank heading into the backstretch, and was unable to recover much ground
afterwards. WHITEROSE SPIRIT hurried outside into the first turn, contested the early pace, was overtaken and gave way. NORTHERN GOLD went wide
through the first turn, tracked outside, was done early then eased, and walked off.

Footnotes
GO MAMA rated well off the pace inside, progressed steadily in the five path off the final turn, set sights on EDGE OF OKOTOKS in the stretch and won
driving. EDGE OF OKOTOKS coaxed easily into the lead, went clear into the far turn, and was collared late. CONVINCE trailed into the stretch and closed
determinedly outside, missing out. FLORIST fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, waited at the head of the lane in traffic, drove four wide into the
stretch and was outkicked for show honors. LETS GO ALL THEWAY squeezed leaving then trailed, and rallied through traffic late to a good finished.
SUGAR MOON reserved off the early pace in the four path, lodged a rail bid nearing the stretch, and gave way late. NO BAKK TALK sent for speed outside,
went four wide into the far turn, hustled off the final turn then was brushed, and flattened. NO COLLUSION was never far back, and bid belatedly inside.
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER sat off the pace, and failed to threaten in the drive. BABS DELIGHT raced wide leaving the backstretch and lacked a response
when asked. LUCY TREASURE stalked the leader from the rail, and have nothing in reserve when called upon.
