Footnotes
BARONNE chased early, rallied on the turn and gained the lead, was well clear in mid stretch and just lasted late. STAR ENTERTAINER was well placed on
the inside, angled out three wide in the stretch, closed fast and was quickly getting to the winner. SMUDGE THE CAT set the pace pace and gradually
weakened. KHOPILOT allowed to settle early, improved late while no threat. RESERVATION allowed to settle, failed to menace. ROCKY'S EXPRESS
raced between horses early and faded. BUILT LIKE TARZAN was well placed early and gave way in the stretch. EL TIZ had brief foot, and was through
early. OXBOW'S RIDE was outrun.
