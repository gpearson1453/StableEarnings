lead, challenged throughout and was outfinished for second. TRUE RED SLEW pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, put forth an even effort
and lacked a late rally. TRICKY MOM raced in the middle of the field, had a wide trip and went to the wire evenly. SHEZA HUNK void of early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. MY LITTLE GUERA lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. THURSDAY

SIMPLY WICKED unhurried in the beginning, angled out around the turn, made a wide rally and got up late. SLITHER dueled on the front end, came around
the turn three wide and was caught late for the win. EMERALD FOREST vied for the early lead, racing between rivals around the turn and weakened deep
in the stretch. MEXICAN WONDER BOY showed early speed, saved ground and faded. SCRAPPY ARTIE raced evenly near the back, saved ground
around the turn and lacked a rally. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAPTAINS COVE raced within striking distance, moved up three wide around the second turn, took the lead and drove clear down the stretch. CORRENTE
DE OURO showed early speed, eased off the front end down the backside, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
CASTLEBERRY dueled for the early advantage, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. LONG WARRIOR raced near the
back in the beginning, came around the second turn wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SMARTY RIDGE raced evenly near the back and was never
a threat. WHITE SQUALL broke a step slow, trailed in the early going, came around the second turn wide, passed tired ones and was vanned off. WEST
TEXAS BOB flashed early speed and made a steady retreat. BARNEY'S PASSION always raced near the back and was outrun.

TRIPPER JOHN challenged on the front end, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. HALF OURS N STORMY unhurried in the
early part, moved up seven wide around the turn, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BIND FAITH lacked early
speed, made a steady gain and held on for show. JAMAICAN ME void of early speed, made a late gain and missed third. MY MAN LOUIE dueled on the
front end and weakened deep in the home stretch. DIABLO CAT raced in the middle of the pack, finished wide and put forth an even effort. R T'S WILDCAT
showed early speed, raced four wide around the turn and faded. MY AMIGO CHARLIE flashed early speed and made a steady retreat. CHARLI MICHAEL
raced near the back and was outrun. GRAND PRADO showed little and was never a threat.
