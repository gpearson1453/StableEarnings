drive wide, through the wire. SALSA RITA dueled outside into the turn, quick move around the three eights pole, clear lead leaving the quarter pole, outside
pressure in deep stretch, drifted out and bumped STARSHIP REINA, finished willingly late. MOON ME AGAIN slow into stride, very nice four wide sweeping

turn from the three path, found herself in a fight between runners, bumped by SALSA RITA, in deep stretch, finished even after the trouble. PLAYERA slow
into stride, checked hard along the rail, raced on left lead, outside position even to wire. CHIEFS KINGDOM inside dueling early, saved ground dueling
around the turn, faded through the stretch. MS BIG SPRING dueled between early, shuffled back entering the turn, outrun. MOSLER'S TOUCH slow into
stride, never a threat. There was an inquiry and TWO rider objections in this race, the rider of PLAYERA, claimed foul against the riders of MOSLER'S
TOUCH AND SNACKSTER, stewards ruled that SNACKSTER, Drifted in nearing the three eights pole, and interfered with PLAYERA, SNACKSTER was
disqualified to last. During the stretch run SALSA RITA drifted out interfering with STARTSHIP REINA, SALSA RITA was disqualified and placed behind
STARTSHIP REINA.

Footnotes
FREDDYNESS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. IMAGOODFELLA tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn and
chased the winner home. ESTILO CLASICO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, battled from the three path around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. HE'S A PISCES raced at the back of the pack between horses early, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane.
EXCALIBRATE stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three
path and was outkicked in the lane. EXPANSIVE raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.
MR. NIBS trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. LYFE IS SIMPLE raced off the pace on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GULLEY brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and edged clear in late stretch. GAROPPOLO brushed with the horse to his
inside at the start, led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path, floated wide
into the lane and was passed late but finished gamely. MONGOLIAN HERO raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked in the lane but kept on to the wire. PRAYER BOOK raced in the three and four
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and never threatened.
SPOTTED CAT saved ground while racing off the pace through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.
UNORTHODOX raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and
tired from there.

backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the second bend and gave way in upper stretch. SHIP MASTER raced off the pace on the inside through
the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. SHADOW BAY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from
there. STELLAR LUTE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
second bend and faded in the lane. DRAGON RUN trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, was outrun from that point on, eased to the wire

BATTLE CRY chased the leader from the three path around the first turn, moved up to duel on the outside racing up the backstretch, continued to battle
from the four path around the far turn and dug in gamely to edge clear while drifting in late. CASHING BIG CHECKS led the way from the two path around
the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and raced gamely in the lane, the best of the rest. WASSER raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the four path and kept on in the lane no match for the top two.
BRAVO REGINA stumbled leaving the gate and nearly unseated the rider, recovered to save ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside
for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM raced in the three
path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path and faded from there.
ANOTHER HOT MESS saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and
tired in the lane. WHEREDIDYOUGO trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second bend and made no
bid. THREE COINS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the two
path and was empty from there.
