moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. FROGGY sprinted clear before going a quarter, saved ground while setting the
pace and weakened through the final furlong. CEDAR EXTRA BOLD raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing four-wide,

Footnotes
MITHQAAL sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, increased his advantage through the second turn and drew off as the easiest of
winners. WILMAS IRISH ROVER chased the winner while racing five-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. SKY JUMPER
was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. KEARNEY chased the winner while racing three-wide and weakened.
MAGIC MOSCO broke in the air, raced five-wide through the first turn, was unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not reach
contention.

not reach the winner in the drive. SHAME ON CHARLOTTE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the
quarter and failed to threaten. SOUTHWEST SILVER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.

DIAMOND MINE pressed the pace of ABSTRACT LILLY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into
the lane and drew off with complete authority. OLIVIADIDIT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good energy.
COCKTAILWITHATWIST chased the leaders while racing five-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter and gave way. CHAMA STORM lagged early, raced
five-wide through the turn, drifted in with a furlong to run and did not menace. AMERICAN CULTURE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. ABSTRACT LILLY bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead
before going a quarter and weakened after a half.

OUR TEN ANGELS pressed the pace of CRYSTAL WHO while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, quickly
opened a clear margin and raced in hand to the wire. HALEY WHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match
for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. I GET STORMED showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late
run. CRYSTAL WHO set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. WHAT A MEMORY lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. ANDYMEISTER was off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders from the inside, weakened after going
three furlongs and was eased through the lane.

MORE FIREWATER dueled for the lead with DIABOLICAL MIGHT while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin before going a quarter, increased his
margin through the turn and drew off as a handy winner. LONZO WHO settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, was
no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. GOLDEN MERGER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some
late run. GATLING GOLD raced off the pacesetters throughout and failed to gain in the drive. DIABOLICAL MIGHT disputed the pace with the winner while
racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. RAISE OUR FLAG steadied at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. TRUEZER showed brief speed, raced six-wide through the turn and weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY
CONCERING THE START FOR RAISE OUR FLAG AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.
