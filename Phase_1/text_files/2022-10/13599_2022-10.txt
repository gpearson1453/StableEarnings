Footnotes
PELLETIER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, was blocked, waited, angled out and split foes into the stretch, then made a steady gain,
edged ahead and held. MISS CALIFORNIA broke out at the start and raced mid pack to the turn, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. SIGN AND SEAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, stayed
on, weakened late and held the show. FORGOT PASSWORD well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. MY DIOR allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and passed a tiring
rival. TIPARILLO rated outside early, faded four wide through the second turn.

Footnotes
ARGYLL well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then made a steady gain and drew off
inside the furlong marker. MY TWO AUNT JOANS mid pack and outside, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
closed well for the place. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, stayed on, then weakened late
and held the show. PITON allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not gain the final
furlong and held a share. GOVERNOR ATWOOD allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and improved
his position. MULETRAIN ran evenly. ROGERS GINGER well placed and between, faded three wide through the turn. TAPPED OFF well placed and
outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

strides. BLUE GRASS ANNA well placed and inside, dropped back through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a
steady gain, edged ahead late and was outfinished. ORGANZA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, exchanging bumps

MERLIN'S SONG mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead and
lasted. DIAMOND DUST set the early pace on the inside, shook clear, while bearing out through the turn, stayed on when challenged in the lane, came
again late and missed. RESIST THE DEVIL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened out and
gained the show. WOODCHUCK tracked the pace, angled out through the turn to gain a striking position three wide, bid on that path and weakened the final
furlong. COLBALOAF mid pack, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. TWIRLING
MAMBA well placed and outside, gained a striking position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. GOOD ON YA
was no factor. CALL ME LATER led early, rated outside the pace and faded two and three wide through the turn. PER RULING #23005PI FROM THE

UP IN ARMS 'mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked, waited, got through inside the leader,
then made a steady gain and edged up. SERENE WARRIOR hopped at the start, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, lugged in and missed. SWEET MOOCHIE allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady
gain and edged up for the show. WILD LOOKER set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drifted out slightly and weakened late.
TEQUILA MARY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
CYBERBURG well placed, gained a striking position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
AMAZON LIZZIE never far back, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had no rally. SKY DIETY well
placed, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. YES IT'S ERIE well placed and
outside, faded three wide through the turn.
