Footnotes
BLAME THE VETS set a clear pace in the two and three paths, drifted out a bit turning for home then dug in outside of foes to hold firm. AMORE MOON
bumped at the start, stalked the pace inside, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole but could not quite get past the winner. FLAT OUT COOL rated off the
pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, steadied and angled in turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, bid between the
top two in midstretch but was no match in the final furlong. PRESENCIA was shut off at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and was one-paced
through the lane. LORD JOAN saved ground and failed to menace. THE CUBAN MISSILE tracked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.
MARIMBA bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. BABY BLUE was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide and made little
impact. CASARENA HOTTIE played no factor while racing four and five wide. HER GREATNESS was pulled up nearing the far turn and walked off.

PIPITO stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up and clear late. LOST A
LEGEND pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, yielded to the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but fought on to save the place. WAR
FEATHER saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and just missed second. CANDENZA was unprepared for the start,
edged closer four wide around the turn and was slowly gaining through the lane. ACTION DREAM went evenly while racing two and three wide. JOYFUL
SURPRISE dueled along the rail to midstretch and weakened. BACH was outrun while racing two wide. ON JET HEIR stalked the pace three wide and had
no response.

Footnotes
CAMPTOWN RACES saved ground far back, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, split rivals five wide in upper stretch, powered to the front soon
after and drew off under a drive. CORPORATE AFFAIR dueled three wide between foes, kicked clear in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in
the final furlong. EXTRACTION WILL dueled two wide between rivals, weakened in the lane and lasted for the show. MINISTER QUINN was just in behind
the five-play duel, bobbled nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the duel four wide around much of the turn, angled six wide nearing the quarter pole
and kept on down the center of the track to just miss third. FUTURISTIC dueled four wide between horses and tired in the drive. CAJUN CRACKER dueled
inside of four rivals while hugging the rail and faltered in the lane. MISTER SUPPA LOUIE dueled five wide to upper stretch and retreated.
TRAVELINGBLUESMAN was outrun while racing two wide.

STAR WEAVER prompted the pace three wide between foes, took over in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and drew clear. ASK FOR BODE settled
off the pace while racing three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. ZAMFIR stalked the pace four wide, was one-paced through
the lane and won the show photo. FRENCHMEN STREET tracked the pace while alternating between the rail and the two path and was outfinished for the
show. NEW YORK'S FINEST dueled along the rail and weakened through the final furlong. EARTH dueled two wide and tired in the drive. SASSY BUT
SMART was outrun inside. KATIE'S COWBOY trailed in the two path.

CHARLIE'S WISH pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly clear and held clear under a drive. ATTHECROSSROADS
stalked the pace three wide, could not match strides with the winner near the five-sixteenths pole but stayed on to hold the place. OMO TEN GIRL chased
the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally and bested the rest. MAJOR PRYCE failed to menace while racing three wide. SOFIA D 'AMORE veered in at
the start, was sent up inside, tried to duck into the gap, steadied off heels nearing the five-eighths pole, angled two wide nearing the turn and had no further
bids. WICKLOW GAL set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole. REBATE hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little
impact. BRITTY trailed throughout.

in upper stretch, angled out in midstretch, drifted out through the final sixteenth and lost the show late. SHIVAREE raced off the pace two wide, swung six

Footnotes
AWESOME STRONG was bumped entering the first turn, tracked the pace four wide between rivals around that bend, bid three deep into the far turn, took
over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. TIGRE raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, moved up
between rivals down the backstretch, made good progress inside around the far turn and rallied along the rail to be clearly second best in the lane. KNOX
saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and ran on outside to gain the show in the final strides. APOCALYPSO set a pressured pace
along the rail, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole and kept trying inside of foes in the lane. COMMANDANT raced in range two wide around
the first turn and four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. FIFTY ONE FIFTY bumped at the start, raced well back two and three wide and
never threatened. DIAMOND COOL pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane. TURBO was bumped entering the first turn, had speed three wide
between foes and came up empty in the lane. HARD TO HANDLE was bumped out four wide midway around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn
and retreated. ROCKIN ROLLER hit the starting gate, raced well back three and four wide and was eased in the lane. BELTS 'N BROOKS got out midway
around the first turn and bumped HARD TO HANDLE, never reached contention and was eased in the drive. CAJUN HOPE was bumped entering the first
turn, chased the pace five wide, faltered and was eased in the lane.
