FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was three wide into the first turn, set the pace while clear in the two path, then was kept to left handed pressure to remain clear to
prove best. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved early and saved ground throughout, angled off the inside in the lane and had a mild late rally to gain the place
award. THE LITTLE SPROUT was reluctant to load, settled early, made a three wide bid on the turn but had no kick in the lane and lost the place award
late. VIBE SETTER tracked the pace two to three wide and stopped.
