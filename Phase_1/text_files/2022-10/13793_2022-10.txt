Footnotes
CABRA CHICA saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and edged clear. VANISHING FAITH hustled to the front,
moved clear on the turn then weakened late. BELLA MARIA trailed far behind then advanced inside to gain the show. PEARLS AND HEELS dropped back
early then moved inside with a mild rally. CAJUN COUSIN prompted the pace three wide, was put to urging on the turn but faded. SEA PINES forced the
pace between rivals down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MISS ALEX lacked speed, advanced inside then pulled away through the final furlong while kept to her task. ROSE LEGACY chased outside and closed
well to be easily second best. LADY BERNADETTE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and flattened out in the stretch. SHANIA SEA opened a long
lead to the stretch then stopped abruptly. LA ALTENITA hustled near the inside and proved empty in the stretch. MISBEHAVING LADY dropped far behind
and was never a factor. REMEMBER THIS GAL trailed to midstretch then caught a fading opponent. STACIAS RUBY broke slowest and weakened steadily.

SAMARONTI settled behind the pacesetters, rallied inside on the final turn then edged away driving through the stretch. OUTRAGEOUS BET prompted the
pace inside, took over on the final turn but was outfinished. OPEN LENGTHS dueled between rivals to the final turn and weakened. EL HERMANO chased
wide throughout, faded before half a mile and was no factor. GLACIER EXPRESS saved ground off the leaders, was asked for run after half a mile and
failed to respond. FARLEY rated three wide off the pace, made a brief bid into the far turn then yielded. ARRIVEDERCI alternated for the advantage to the
far turn and gave way. ECLIPSED MOON trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
TERPEYE trailed early, rallied on the turn, angled out in the lane and drew away while geared down late. LEVIOSA hustled to the front inside, dueled to
midstretch and continued willingly. SIZZLING ROMA was well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid into the lane and flattened out. STARSHIP BLANCA
dropped back early then passed rivals without menacing. ANGINETTI saved ground within striking range then faded in the stretch. BOCA ROYALTY raced
wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. CONGRATS ANSWER dueled outside to the stretch and came up empty. KENAI COOL dropped far behind
and was never in contention. BEYOND A MILLION chased far behind throughout.
