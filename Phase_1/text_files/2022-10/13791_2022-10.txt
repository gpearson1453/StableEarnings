Footnotes
KJOS KID sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened through the stretch while drifting out to the middle of the racetrack through the final
sixteenth of a mile and won as much the best under right handed urging. WILDCAT DREAM trailed into the stretch, rallied two wide and finished clear for
second. SOLDAT TEMPTATION allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals five wide. ALITA moved up four wide into the stretch then failed to
sustain that bid. LIZNOW offered a mild bid along the inside approaching the quarter pole then came up empty. CURIOSITY KILLS chased the winner into
the stretch then weakened late.

Footnotes
VOLBEAT never far back, rallied four wide through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch then finished full of run under left handed urging to win going
away. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE stalked the pace down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, shifted out
side past the furlong marker then was no match for the winner. UNCLE KEVIN never far back, improved position outside through the stretch. SWEET
LEMON DROP failed to menace. ROCK ON KITTEN was no threat. SUMMER RETREAT pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half. FIRST
SONG was hustled from the gate to set a pressured pace along the inside for a half, had speed until deep stretch then gave way. WEST LEONARD raced
wide and trailed.
