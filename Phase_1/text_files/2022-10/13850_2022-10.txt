Footnotes
SUMMER SHANDEE settled on the rail in mid pack running down the backside, rated kindly on the far turn, waited for a seam to open up turning for home,
split runners in the two path at the eighth pole to gain the lead and had enough late to hold safe the closing challenger at the finish. UNILATERAL was
unhurried in the beginning, trailed the field at the half, began to rally at the quarter pole, found his best stride late closing five wide outside of rivals through
the stretch but ran out of room at the finish. TARADAR hopped at the break but quickly recovered to track behind the loose early speed down the
backstretch, collared the pacesetter to lead in upper stretch, gave way to the winner inside the final sixteenth and held on right at the wire for the show
award. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) stalked in the three path entering the backstretch, dipped inside to the rail at the half mile marker, advanced on the fence
through the far turn, needed running room at the top of the lane, navigated his way through rivals in mid stretch and finished up well to just miss out for show
in the end. HAYROLL rated just off the fence in the middle of the field at the half, offered a brief run two furlongs from home, angled out five wide for the
drive and stalled with a furlong to the finish. TWICE AS SMART broke sharp and was eager early to be loose on the lead entering the backstretch, dictated
the pace through the far turn, was collared outside at the top of the stretch, battled for an eighth down the lane, gave way and tired nearing the wire.
LAMENT settled in the middle of the field outside in the early stages, was urged for more midway on the second turn, could not gain on the leaders and
faded between horses at the furlong marker. DYNAMIC MISSION travelled four wide into the first turn near the back in the beginning, continued to be at the
rear with a half remaining, was asked for run on the far turn, offered no response and could not reach contention in the stretch.

Footnotes
SCENIC HOLIDAY shifted in early, advanced near inside early on the turn, began to move out at the five-sixteenths, swung eight to nine wide turning for
home, took aim, got up late under steady handling. CHAIRMAN FOX got away alertly, shifted in to stalk the leaders two to three wide on the turn, moved out
four wide leaving the bend, bid and took the lead about the furlong marker, led till late but was caught. BORN HAPPY broke outwardly bumping a rival,
shifted in and saved some ground near but off the rail on the turn, tipped out four wide turning for home, rallied between rivals late to gain show honors. I
LIVE BY FAITH broke inwardly and a step slowly, steadily advanced three wide heading to the turn, went three then four wide on that bend and moving out
further for the drive while in striking range, evened out in the drive. MIGHTY PELE tracked up close from inside, attempted to go up the rail in upper then
late stretch and was in just a bit tight but got through and ran on. BREACH OF TRUST raced off the pace four to five wide and went evenly. UH OH IT'S
MAGIC was ridden along racing just off the inside but ran evenly and made no bid. RED FLARE stalked just off the pacesetter three wide, bit and took a
narrow and brief lead past the three-sixteenths then flattened out in the lane. NGABE was bumped at the break, went four to five wide on the turn racing
toward the rear and was never a threat. DETERMINED FRIEND shifted in early, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, altered out in late stretch
and was not a factor. UNCOMPROMISING moved clear to set the pace racing in about the two path, lugged in a bit in the stretch and came up empty.

ONEZY'S DREAM took command soon after the start, dictated the pace on the turn, opened up on the field in mid stretch and won comfortably in the end.
VALLEY GIRL tracked inside at the half, slipped up the fence three sixteenths from the finish, chased the winner in vain through the stretch and held on for
the place share at the wire. CRUMLIN TIME took a strong hold rating behind the chasing pack inside at the half, was steadied mildly near the three eighths
pole on the rail, advanced up the fence turning for home, shifted out to the three path with an eighth remaining and closed in to be a clear third. ORBALINE
tracked in the middle of the field down the backstretch, was roused with five sixteenths to the wire and showed some late energy between runners in the
stretch to be be on the fringes in the end. COOL SOCIETY settled near the back of the field in the beginning stages, was coaxed for more run outside foes
three furlongs left to go, was in the mix for a small share turning for home and levelled off in the drive to the line. PLUIE D'AVRIL chased the frontrunner just
outside throughout the turn, was ridden for more to keep up with the loose winner two furlongs to the finish and tired in the final sixteenth giving away
positions in deep stretch. WICKED MIAH tracked the leaders three wide into the turn, loomed four wide at the top of the lane and weakened between rivals
at the furlong marker. FIVE DAYS IN MAY was unhurried early and trailed the field down the backside, roused on the turn and could never get involved
running to the finish.

Footnotes
PERFECT CRIME was unhurried between rivals heading into the turn, moved out from three to five wide on that bend and further still for the stretch run,
rallied outside to get up late. FOUR ACES HIGH shifted in racing mid-pack in the two path on the turn, came out four to five wide in upper stretch, struck the
lead outside the sixteenth pole, led till very late but was caught. SOUPER CLASSY broke a step slowly, settled at the rear inside, saved ground on the turn,
came out in the stretch then continued to drift out late, missed second. GALVASTON stalked mid-pack and outside, went five wide on the turn, was in
contention in mid-stretch, steadied very late when in tight between rivals. LONG POND pursued the leader from between runners early, went two to three
wide on the turn, made a mild bid in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ROCKSTAR RO rated in behind the leader inside rivals, moved out a bit for
the stretch run under urging, ran on evenly. JIBARO set the pace racing on or just off the rail, weakened in the stretch. COTTON pursued the pace up close
outside rivals three to four wide, steadily retreated. GENDRAGON failed to menace after racing four wide on the turn. FROSTED ICING raced outside at the
back going four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SENSING HOLIDAY was in a good tracking position behind the contesting pacesetters at the half, shifted off the dueling leaders in the three path at the top
of the stretch, bid for the lead the final sixteenth and was kept to the task late holding comfortably for the victory. STUBBORN STREAK settled in mid pack
between foes in the beginning, took closer order advancing on the rail through the turn, angled out in mid stretch five wide, closed boldly the final sixteenth
but could not catch the winner while besting the rest at the wire. GUNGI pressed the frontrunner down the backside, began to edge away from the early
pace rival nearing the quarter pole, was collared by the winner in mid stretch and fought on to hold narrowly for the show money. DESANTIS showed good
speed to set the pace while hounded outside in the early stages, continued to battle for the front at the top of the lane on the rail and gave way on the fence
nearing the furlong marker and had to settle for a minor share in the end. KEYSER travelled near the back of the pack between runners at the half, was
ridden to keep up throughout the turn and finished up evenly running the the line. TASTE MY CANDY veered outwards on the break, travelled widest
running into the turn, was relegated to be near the rear outside through the turn and showed some late interest to offer a good finish down the lane.
HEEZESPEEDY rated three wide in the second flight while in range of the engaging leaders at the half, made an early move three wide around runners at
the three eighths pole, loomed four wide turning for home and tired at the furlong marker. HAPPY FELLA travelled close to the back of the field into the turn,
put in a mild rally just outside midpoint on the turn and offered little finish for the drive to the line. STORMIN DAVE was void of early speed, trailed the field
down the backstretch and could only pass tired rivals in the late stages. QUIET SPEED tracked behind the early pace duel between runners, was urged to
keep position at the quarter pole, offered little effort for the stretch run and retreated through the lane. SEATTLE APPEAL was situated on the rail at the
back of the field down the backstretch, could not make an impact inside on the turn and was not a factor for the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
RYDER RYDER RYDER pressed three wide early, continued to pursue three to four wide as the leader got away past the quarter pole, took aim in the
stretch and put to some urging, drove past seventy yards from the wire and eased up late. KANTBACKOFF set the pace racing off the rail, began to edge
clear at the quarter pole, was clear into upper stretch but no match while second best. SOLO ALBUM was urged at the break to gain more forward position,
raced in behind just off the inside, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest. BRITISH CROWN stalked up close from outside four to five wide,
moved out turning for home, got the nod for fourth. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY settled off the pace inside, came out a bit leaving the turn then moved out
about eight wide in upper stretch, missed fourth. CHAMPAGNE KRISTA saved ground inside and ran on evenly. MERITAMEN raced between runners
toward the back three to four wide into the turn, had no rally. KEY STROKE was between runners four wide into the turn, moved out late on that bend, was
not a factor. CANTHO chased briefly, dropped back five wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
WENTRU took command from the onset, was allowed to dictate the pace setting easy fractions in the beginning, continued to be unchallenged up front at
the quarter pole, drew away when asked in upper stretch and won comfortably at the finish line. MEYER tracked on the rail down the backstretch keeping in
range with the winner, rallied up the fence keeping his sights on the frontrunner in upper stretch and closed in on second but could not threaten for the top
spot at the finish line. REMOTE chased the frontrunning winner for the first mile, was roused to keep pace with the winner two furlongs from the finish and
began to weaken mildly at the furlong marker losing the place share while holding for third at the line. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION stalked in the middle of the
pack with a half mile to run, advanced up the fence on the final turn, angled out three wide at the quarter pole and could only finish evenly for a small share
in the end. LION KINGDOM trailed the field down the backstretch the final time, saved ground throughout the race and pass struggling runners with a
quarter to run. CANADIAN PHAROAH stalked outside near the back of pack in the beginning stages of the race, was roused three wide on the final turn,
offered little run four wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact through the lane to the wire. RELIABILITY settled at the rear for most of the race,
was roused just outside rivals when the running started with three eighths remaining and could not make an impression through the stretch running to the
wire. GO TAKE CHARGE travelled in mid pack in this marathon race in the early stages, was ridden to stay in touch with the loose on the lead winner three
furlongs from the finish and could not find another gear with a quarter left to run and backed away through the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BEN LOMOND settled outside the second flight, began to advance four then five wide late on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch and kicked clear.
READY HERO settled off the pace racing between runners into the turn, swung eight wide turning for home, engaged with an inside rival and outfinished
that one for the place. BAY OF RUM was encouraged along between runners in the second flight, came out a bit near the quarter pole then moved out
much further in upper stretch, rallied inside a rival but was outfinished by that one for second. POUND GREEN raced off the pace inside rivals going two
wide into the turn, moved out turning into upper stretch, was in a bit tight near the furlong marker and altered outside rivals, ran on to improve. STORMY
SOUL moved forward to contest the pace, dueled around the turn, was overtaken by other foes in the stretch and had no extra. CORDUROY ROAD was
urged at the break, gained forward position between runners, dueled outside through the turn, lacked the needed late kick. OVER THE HILLS chased from
inside, angled out in the stretch, failed to rally. MESA SKYLINE broke outwardly, shifted in, raced near but just off the rail on the turn, came out in the stretch
and ran on. PUGIN was outpaced while dropping back toward the rear outside runners, went about three to four wide on the turn, failed to threaten. BIG
TIME LOUIE attended the pace from outside four wide, faltered and faded.
