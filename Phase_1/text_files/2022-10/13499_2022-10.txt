and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. CROWLEY'S WAR rated back in the early going,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. GOLOVKIN brushed the gate at the start and
steadied, then passed a tiring rival in the lane. BACKDOORPARTY well placed and between, faded on the two path through the turn.

SIR LANCELOT sprinted away from the field, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. DAWGMENTALITY well
placed and inside, moved up up through the turn, angled around a tiring rival and came through on the two path into the stretch, was blocked, angled out
and closed well for the place. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane,
angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and edged up for the show in the final strides. LEGEND OF CHARLIE mid pack, looped three and four
wide through the turn, came four and five wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. HANDSOME PLAYBOY well placed, gained a striking position three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and weakened. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES unsettled in the gate, hopped at the start, moved up
three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. SHAMMAH tracked the pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
SMOKEY LEE never far back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in
the final strides. LAKE NAKURU tracked the pace, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in,
edged ahead late and was outfinished. WHISKYFORBREAKFAST mid pack, saved ground while bearing out through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, gained a short lead, then weakened late and held the show. NO TIME TO YAWN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged through the second turn, came again to edged ahead in the lane, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. ALPHA PREDATOR allowed
to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved his position. TITRATE allowed to settle,
moved up inside the second turn, held position three and four wide through the turn, then came four and five wide into the stretch and flattened out. NIP OF
BOURBON lost his path at the start, passed tiring rivals. LUPI stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead through the second turn, then faded the
final furlong. GOLD FELLOW was a brief factor and faded outside.
