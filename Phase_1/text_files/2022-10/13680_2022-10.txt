Footnotes
NICOLE GRACE was crowded a bit leaving the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going, improved position four wide on the far turn, made
a grinding rally in the lane, came within aim in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. AMERICAN ROYALTY rated just off of the pace while
three wide, tracked the moderate fractions to the quarter marker, gained ground in mid-stretch, took a narrow lead in the final sixteenth and was nipped in
the final strides for the win, while besting the rest. FIRE DIAMONDS was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, came in tight and steadied
nearing the top of the lane, advanced in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and was up for show in the final strides. BRITE TAN broke alertly then
took back off of the pace, stalked the moderate fractions to the second turn, came within aim in mid-stretch, lacked a late rally and was just edged for show.
CLOCHARD STREET was away a bit slowly and crowded NICOLE GRACE leaving the break, was hustled to the early lead on the first turn, set modest
fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive but could not hold off oncoming challengers late and
gave way.

Footnotes
PERSEVERANCE was forwardly placed early on, prompted the modest fractions to the second turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving the quarter marker,
took command into the drive and kicked clear late. ORCZY (IRE) was allowed to settle, maintained position through the backstretch run, came two then
three wide on the far turn, closed on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and was second best in the end. TWIRLING DERBY rated off
of the modest early pace, saved ground to the second turn, was outkicked in the drive and was clear for show in the late stages. SLEEP OVER established
the early lead, set modest fractions while prompted by the winner through the backstretch run, was overtaken by PERSEVERANCE leaving the quarter
marker, chased to mid-stretch and faded late. MO SUGAFOOT was unhurried, came three wide into the first turn, trailed to the quarter marker, lost contact
in upper stretch and was not a factor.

BANDEENA was allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, met the bid of BOLD ARTICLE leaving the second turn and battled with
that rival to mid-stretch, found more in deep stretch and proved best late. BOLD ARTICLE was unhurried, was roused on the far turn, battled with
BANDEENA to mid-stretch, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch but stayed on well late to be second best. PERFECT ICE STORM settled off of
the fast early pace, was steered three wide on the turn while coming within aim, could not keep pace with the top pair in the lane and was an easy third in
the final stages. TROPICANA GIRL was hustled to be forwardly placed early on, pressed the fast pace to the half-mile marker, lost position on the far turn
and tired in the stretch run. CARASYNTHIA was hard sent to the early lead, set fast fractions while pressed through the first half-mile, was overtaken
nearing the quarter marker and stopped in the late stages.

QUITCHERSNIVELIN came three wide into the first turn while rating off of the pace, maintained position to the second turn, slipped to the two path nearing
the quarter marker while making steady progress, continued that advance to mid-stretch, made a late surge in deep stretch to overtake I'M NO BALLERINA
and was up in the final strides to prevail. I'M NO BALLERINA was sent to the early lead, disputed the early fractions then shook free along the backstretch
run, was set down for the drive, was all out in deep stretch and was overtaken in the final strides, while holding safely for second in the end. ROSEBUD
RYDE was a bit hard to load, contested the early pace then took back off of the solid fractions and stalked the pace to the second turn, gained ground in
mid-stretch, was outfinished in deep stretch and just held for show in the final strides. DARK INTENT was away slowly but recovered to be in the second
flight into the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid on the far turn, was outkicked in the late stages and was just
edged for third in the final strides. CHELINA was unhurried in the early going, raced just off of the rail to the second turn and finished evenly in the final
furlong. HASTA LUEGO was allowed to settle, came four wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside on the second turn and was not a factor.
QUICK TAKE was forwardly placed early on, came three wide into the backstretch run, tracked the solid pace to the second turn, came four wide to the
quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive. LUVAHAPPYENDING was away slowly, spotted the field into the first turn, was pulled up nearing the
six-furlong marker and walked off under her own power.

WICKED BLUE chased the early pace, loomed two wide on the turn, took command into the drive and drew clear in the final sixteenth. MILEYS BLUECAT
was prominent on the run to the turn, lost ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not make headway on the winner in deep stretch but stayed on
late to secure the place. STREET DEMAND was allowed to settle, advanced two wide on the turn, continued that bid to upper stretch, could not match
strides with the top pair late but was clear for show in the end. ABADON broke alertly and disputed the early fractions, lost position on the turn, chased the
winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. MARKSMAN ON TARGET chased from the second flight, advanced in mid-stretch but lacked the
needed late response. LIVE A GOOD LIFE disputed the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the
stretch. LONO was away slowly and lacked early speed, improved position in the drive but was not able to factor in the late stages. TOMMY SPECIAL
chased the pace four wide on the turn and was not a threat. SNICKER'N DAN settled off of the pace while never far back, was steered three wide on the
turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and did not menace in the drive. ROYAL DANIELLE broke in good order and contested the early pace, lost position
on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
A DIME FOR ME came in tight in the early stages and was shuffled back nearing the half-mile marker, was steered outside of rivals on the turn, loomed
nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive and was ridden out in deep stretch. SWANEE showed early speed and dueled through solid early
fractions, took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch, was no match for A DIME FOR ME in the late stages
and just held for place over an oncoming rival. FAMILY TRIPS settled off of the early pace, swung four wide nearing the top of the lane, gained ground
nearing mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages, just missed for second in the end and was well clear for third. ALESHA was away slowly and lacked
early speed, improved position three wide on the turn, was not able to impact the leaders late and passed tiring foes in deep stretch. HEY WILMAAA
showed early speed and disputed the pace to the turn, pressed SWANEE to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded late. BRILLIANT
BIRD pressed the solid early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and tired in the drive. U S READY contested the pace to the turn, chased the leading
pair four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. ALY'S NATION lacked early speed, lost position on the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PEPPERMAN came away from the gate in good order, was floated three-wide on the first turn, made steady progress towards the leaders down the
backside, responded to strong handling from the half-mile pole, collared the pacesetters in mid-stretch and drew away while racing on the wrong lead.
BARHOPSKY devoid of early speed, chased the pack for a half mile, launched a sustained bid from the three furlong marker, swung five-wide into the
stretch and ran on well despite not switching leads to gain second while never seriously threatening the winner. JOHNNY DAR got away best, kept to the
two-path to the far turn, set a comfortable pace with THATSABADBOY to his outside, matched strides with that one from the quarter pole, bested his rival in
the stretch but was unable to fend off the closers in the final furlong. THATSABADBOY was content to follow JOHNNY DAR through the first turn, moved up
entering the backstretch run to take over the lead with that one right to his inside, the pair moved as a tandem from the quarter pole but gave way in the late
stages. STAN THE HOT MAN stumbled badly coming out of the gate, recovered nicely and moved to a stalking position in the three-path around the turn,
was pressed for move passing the half-mile pole but came up empty. STAY LIT was up close early, was asked to go after the leaders approaching the
half-mile pole but had no response and galloped home behind the field.

Footnotes
MINOSO hustled from the outside gate to contest the lead with POTENTE ALBA, dueled that one through the turn and into the stretch, gained the upper
hand in the final furlong and won by daylight while drifting out. WHOA BUDDY broke with the pack, moved into the clear to the outside, began a sustained
rally from the half-mile pole and continued on through the stretch but could not corral the leader. EL CHARRO CHAMP broke well, gained a good tracking
position behind the early leaders, was put into a drive past the three furlong pole and finished with some interest under strong handling. MISO FAST started
near the rear of the field after the break, remained on the outside for the run down the backstretch, came into the stretch four-wide and finished well. CASH
LIMIT was bumped on both sides after the break, lost ground early but was kept to task on the turn, found his best stride much too late but managed to pass
a few in the end. ELUSIVE LOVE was hustled to the front from the break, was unable to keep up with the early pace after a quarter mile, fell back but then
mustered a mild rally in the final quarter mile but needed more. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET broke in at the start, brushing with PROUDTOBESICILLIAN, was
then bumped from the inside by ELUSIVE LOVE, secured a good position near the rail while mid-pack in the early going, made a sustained rally through the
turn and loomed a threat the top of the stretch but flattened out in the late stages. POTENTE ALBA sped to the front from the break, was joined by MINOSO
and FORT LEWIS RIVERS to his outside, opened up a clear lead with the first named through the turn, battled to the furlong grounds and tired.
PROUDTOBESICILIAN was sandwiched shortly after the start, lost path and switched to the rail, appeared to be a little rank, lost touch with the field
approaching the turn, remained wide into the stretch and was allowed to gallop to the wire when hopelessly beaten. FORT LEWIS RIVERS was declared a
non-starter. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND DECLARED FORT LEWIS RIVERS A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, drew clear into upper stretch, was kept to task in
deep stretch and held sway in the end. COALINGA ROAD rated off of the early pace, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, was roused five wide in
upper stretch, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and held safely for place. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY bobbled at the
start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle while racing four wide into the backstretch run, improved position two wide on the far turn, mounted a
six wide rally in upper stretch, found his best stride late and could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch but was clear for third in the end. LAMMAS (GB)
showed early speed and attended to the solid pace, prompted the pacesetter to the second turn, lost ground to A MAN'S MAN in upper stretch and gave
way in the final sixteenth. HUGE BIGLY was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the solid pace to the second turn, chased the leaders to
mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. TESORO stalked the early pace three wide, improved position three then four wide nearing the quarter marker,
came in tight in mid-stretch, steadied nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. ORDER AND LAW was allowed to settle, improved
position on the backstretch run, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked a late response. BOLD ENDEAVOR was never far back while rating off of the
early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, lost position three wide on the far turn and tired in the drive. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was unhurried,
saved ground to the second turn and was not a factor.
