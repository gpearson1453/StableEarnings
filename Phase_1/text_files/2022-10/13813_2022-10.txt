Footnotes
TELLER TO SING snagged the inner part of the gate when leaving it, yet settled into a comfortable inside stalking position soon after, pursued the leaders
while shifting three wide turning for home, then rallied to drive past the leader at the furlong grounds, cleared soon after, and held from an outer rival late.
MY GOOD FORTUNE laid off of the pace along the inside, gradually shifted to the four path turning for home, then rallied belatedly in hopes of reeling in the
leaders at the wire, but ran out of ground. PASSIONFORTREASURE set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin entering the far turn, but offered little
resistance to the eventual winner's bid in midstretch, gave way, and lost place late. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO tracked two wide, but failed to keep pace
despite coming under coaxing with five furlongs remaining, and kept on after slipping inside of a rival in midstretch. UNDECODED pressed two wide, chased
the clear leader around the far turn, then hung on her left lead, lugged in while getting outkicked in midstretch, and faltered. TAMI ANN trailed two wide, then
in the three to four path around the far turn while outrun.

Footnotes
MOON MAGIC CHRISSY set the pace inside of a pair of hounding foes into the turn, shook free of her only remaining pursuer entering the lane, then held
sway on her left lead from a chasing foe thereafter. MEAN SUE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clearing leader in upper stretch, and chased
that foe home to prove second best. TAMARA'S WAY broke slowly and settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path and between horses
turning for home before darting to the five path and outside of the leaders at the three sixteenths pole, then stayed on to reach place at the furlong grounds.
LILY'S CREED laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path turning for home before being floated to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole, and
stayed on willingly. CONNELMAURA prompted the pace three wide, then only outside of the eventual winner while still in the three path turning for home,
and weakened entering the lane. MARSANNE tracked in the three to four path, but was outkicked while floated to the six path in upper stretch, and yielded.
RYE MUNNY broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, and improved. BONANZA GRADE lacked speed three wide and made little impact. STAR
POSE took a bump from an outer rival at the start, then failed to respond to strong rider urging in the early stages, raced far back two wide and was outrun.
BEER CAN LADY moved about before bumping an inner foe at the start, vied two wide and between horses around the turn, and weakened at the three
furlong pole.

Footnotes
ARGUMENTAL set the pace inside of a sternly pressing rival, drew off entering the lane once set down, and held sway under driving pressure. ADALINE
JULIA laid off of the pace two wide, tracked in the four to five path around the turn, and rallied to gain place approaching the final sixteenth. PENITENT'S
ROSE prompted the pace two wide, but gave way in the three path entering the lane. LITTLE SISTER SUE shied from an outer rival and bumped an inner
foe at the start, chased three wide, floated to the four path whilst between horses turning for homme, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and lacked a bid.
STORM HAVEN took a bump from an outer foe at the start, stalked behind the leading pair while just off of the rail, tipped outside of them turning for home,
but got floated to the four path in upper stretch before fading between horses. COLONEL GRACE broke a step slowly and never got involved along the
inside. AWESOME ALLY VEE took a mild nudge from an outer foe soon after the start, and was outrun.

CATHEDRAL BEACH broke a step slowly, rushed to pursue the leaders from along the inside while under mild coaxing, searched for racing room outside of
the leader in upper stretch while an outer TOTALIZER kept him hemmed in, altering course inwardly and off of the leaders heels when closing in on that foe
at the three sixteenths pole, recovered and sustained a grinding rail charge through the final furlong, vied through the late stages, and prevailed. GEAUX
YOSHKA tracked four wide while under steady urging around the turn, took aim outside of the leading quartet in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong
grounds, forged an advantage entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed by an inner bidder at the wire. TOTALIZER acted up in the gates while awaiting
the start, chased the leaders two wide and between horses, closed in outside of the leader in upper stretch while keeping an inner rival hemmed in, bid and
gained an advantage coming to the furlong grounds as an outer GEAUX YOSKHA menaced, but was headed by that foe a sixteenth from home, and bested
by an inner rival for place late. BOISE lagged behind, swung six wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly. GORMLEYS GOT GAME stalked three wide,
ranged up turning for home, but hung on her left lead while floated four wide in upper stretch, then was outkicked by bidding foes on either side nearing
midstretch, and yielded through the final furlong. UPTOWN HUSTLER set the pace along the inside, but was swallowed up between horses nearing the
furlong grounds. OVERTAXED popped the stall doors open pre-race without leaving the gates, then failed to get involved along the inside. DOUBLE
THUNDER lacked speed two wide despite rider's encouragement, and was outrun.

Footnotes
RUNNING BEE set a soft an unencumbered pace along the inside, felt mild pressure by an outer foe around the far turn, drew away from that foe entering
the lane, and widened under mild urging. BAKWENA laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, took the far turn in the three to four paths before
coming into the lane in the five path, and rallied to reach place leaving the sixteenth marker, and held that position from an inner foe late. POLICY OPTION
trailed along the inside, rated in the two path around the far turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place inside of rivals in the final
sixteenth, but missed. CATNIP delayed the start by stubbornly refusing to load into the starting gates, did so after multiple minutes of struggle, then stalked
the eventual winner from the outside, pressed him mildly around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch, then lost place between horses in the final
sixteenth. MOUNT RUNDLE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, rated at the rear two to four wide, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and moved up. WIN
WORTHY tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and yielded among foes at the furlong
grounds. WARBIRD saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. EPIMYTHIUM stalked along the inside, chased the top pair around the far turn before
tipping outside of them entering the lane, but weakned. BOX OFFICE WARRIOR took a bump from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed three wide, and
was done early. SETNA THE WISE tracked two to three wide, but faded under urging turning for home.

Footnotes
COPPELIA stalked three wide, loomed a danger while bidding in hand outside of the top pair turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and
kicked away through the final furlong. HEADLAND set the pace from an outer vying rival into the turn, met another foe's challenge turning for home, got
outkicked by the latter in upper stretch while fending off the prior for place, and was second best. MAGIC QUEST vied for the lead two wide, then from
between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, but yielded to those rivals nearing the furlong grounds, and held show. ZAINALARAB tracked while off
of the pace in the two to three path, came into the lane in the five path, but failed to progress through the final furlong. COMPELLING SMILE broke slowly,
trailed along the inside, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to threaten while moving up. BOMBDIGGITY stalked along the inside, but only
managed to chase before fading through the final furlong. RIDE THE PLAN chased from midpack three wide and outside of foes, then faded while getting
floated to the six path entering the lane. AWESOMELY SHY lacked speed two wide, floated to the five path while between horses entering the lane, and
failed to factor.

Footnotes
BRAZILLIONAIRE bobbled outwardly at the start while breaking towards the front, set the pace along the inside, met VERSTAPPEN's bid entering the lane,
shifted out to confront that rival's challenge approaching the furlong grounds, turned him away leaving that station, then shook clear once again entering the
final sixteenth, and held sway. AL'S ROCKET bumped with an outer rival before nudging an inner foe at the start, tracked two wide, pursued from the three
path around the far turn before tipping out to take aim outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, grinded away while hanging on his left lead through upper
stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, then sustained his chase to reach place in the late stages. KITTEN MISCHIEF broke a bit outwardly while off a
step slow, tracked in midpack along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before shifting five wide in upper stretch, and offered a late kick outside of
foes in the final sixteenth to miss reaching place. NO SLO MO stalked along the inside, tracked around the far turn, then sustained a rail chase through the
lane to vie for place in the final furlong, but got outfinished by a pair of outer foes late. VERSTAPPEN bobbled into an outer rival just after the start, stalked
two to three wide, loomed a danger while inching closer around the far turn, bid outside of BRAZILLIONAIRE entering the lane, vied before getting mildly
herded out by that foe approaching the furlong grounds, but was turned away leaving that station, and weakened. WAKE SURF broke slowly while brushing
the gate, saved ground far back, shifted six wide approaching midstretch, and stayed on. FORWARDLY took up while among rivals in the early stages, laid
off of the pace two to three wide, fanned four wide entering the lane, floated seven wide approaching midstretch, and made little impact. ROUGHIN THE
CITY pressed the leader two wide, but chased that foe while getting outkicked by another turning for home, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.
CHROME REPUBLIC bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed three wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MASTER GAME chased two wide and between horses, cut the corner to tuck behind his inner counterpart after that one made first run, chased that clearing
foe before bumping an outer rival to tip off of the fence approaching midstretch, and stayed on to bid entering the final sixteenth along with another outer
challenger, and prevailed. HURRY ON OUT steadied leaving the chute, tracked from off of the pace in the five to six path, stayed on outside of rivals to reel
in the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole along with an inner bidding counterpart, but was outfinished by him late. LUCKY DUDE checked leaving the chute,
tucked and moved forward to an inside stalking position, slipped through a vacated rail to bid inside of the leader turning for home, drew clear in upper
stretch while hanging on her left lead, changed over entering the final furlong, but faltered to a pair of rivals entering the final sixteenth. ALFIO saved ground
far back, but to no avail. NORGAY rushed after a flat-footed beginning to set the pace inside of a vying rival, remained a path off of the rail around the turn,
which allowed for an inner rival to produce a bid turning for home, gave way between horses entering the lane, then was brushed and faltered coming to the
furlong grounds. POINT OF AN AFFAIR vied two wide while in the three path, but weakened while hanging on her left lead through the lane. APOLLO
RISING tracked in the four path, but yielded in the five path entering the lane. ROUGH SKETCH never got involved. DORMIR showed little.
