Footnotes
SMARTY JOHN broke outward and bumped with a rival, corrected and edged up to the inside of BORN TO VICTORY to poke a head in front leaving the
five eighths, set a pressured pace under rating, moved clear in hand approaching the quarter pole then guided two wide, kept on under right handed asking
and kept BOWIE TWO STEP at bay. BOWIE TWO STEP rated close up while saving ground, edged up past the five sixteenths then eased out three to four
wide into the lane, switched over to his corrected lead with aim in mid stretch, failed to seriously kick on but saved the place. STAR SHOPPING dropped
back early and raced three wide, angled in around the turn, stayed inside for the drive and closed steadily. BORN FOR VICTORY , bumped with the winner
at the break, sped to the early lead, was headed from his inside past the five eighths, stayed on and pressed the pace, failed to match strides past the five
sixteenths, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. BELIEVEINROCKNROLL stalked outside a rival, shifted four to five wide for the drive and gave way.
WAR AND ROSES broke a step slow, saved ground nearing the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
MY CANDY GIRL saved ground around the first turn, swung outside entering the backstretch, advanced four wide leaving the far turn, gained the lead
outside FLIMSY near the eighth pole then dug in stubbornly. NICOLAR lacked speed, circled horses on the far turn, was five deep at the head of the stretch
and rallied outside the winner. DAILY PLANET , steadied when pinched back soon after the break, advanced inside horses to challenge for the lead in mid
stretch then flattened out. FLIMSY stalked the pace, advanced outside PEACE OUT to bid for the lead in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong.
ALWAYSINMOTION , three wide chasing the pace on the far turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and weakened. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS was not a
factor. PEACE OUT set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch.

KOZY'S WILDCAT rated kindly two wide while stalking the pace, bid in hand outside the leader mid turn, responded when roused entering the lane, shook
clear under strong handling in mid stretch, drifted out a bit and dug in gamely to prevail. PELOTA chased outside a rival, was under coaxing mid turn, shifted
four wide into the lane, kept on grinding through the final furlong but just failed to get up. ZEN MASTER , three wide and off the early pace, was under
strong asking leaving the far turn, came four wide for the drive, stayed on his left lead and offered a slight kick. DREAM HAPPY bobbled at the break,
regrouped and edged up nearing the half mile marker, stalked to the inside of a rival mid turn, eased out but lacked a solid finish. APPRAISAL , between
rivals early, dropped well back leaving the far turn, swung well wide for the drive and had belated interest. RAHMER , rated back soon after the break, saved
ground around the turn, eased out and faded. BRION sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, met the winner's bid mid turn, battled to about the three
sixteenths then gave way.

CHARDONNAY , bumped at the break, raced forwardly while two to three wide, was under a ride leaving the far turn, shifted out five wide into the lane,
gave hard chase of the leader past mid stretch, sustained a grinding run under intense pressure and just got up. MY MY GIRL moved up between foes
leaving the chute then bid to the inside of HASHTAG LUCKY to contest the pace, eased back off that one when she cleared nearing mid stretch, responded
when roused in upper stretch and battled back to re engage, spurted away a bit while under a stout drive past the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly from
there but just failed to contain the winner. CLICK TO CONFIRM stalked the about three wide, commenced a run near the three furlong marker, circled five to
six wide into the lane, ranged up past the three sixteenths and churned on willingly to the wire. HASHTAG LUCKY , well wide with the early lead, dropped in
near the three quarter pole and disputed the pace outside the winner, moved clear leaving the far turn, was taken back on past the quarter pole, ceded the
lead soon after, stayed on with willing pursuit past mid stretch then faded late. B B'S BUSTED lagged off the pace, angled very wide in upper stretch and
had belated action. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI stalked inside, shifted out with chase in upper stretch and faded. EIGHT DANZAS , well back early, angled very
wide in upper stretch but failed to generate a legitimate finish. JADES GELLY advance towards the inside through the opening quarter mile to gain a forward
spot, failed to kick on leaving the half mile marker and faded around the turn. RUNAWAY MONET saved ground and was outrun. PER RULING #22-231
FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, CHARDONNAY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
NOTHING BETTER bumped INDIAN LAKE when bearing out at the break, sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and held sway
under energetic urging. CHESS MASTER showed speed near the inner rail, rated back and swung out leaving the backstretch then chased the winner in a
willing effort. MARVALOUS MIKE , a forward factor in the two path leaving the backstretch, was shuffled back a bit on the turn then rallied between horses.
MATTA , eager to run down the backstretch, was in a forward position along the inner rail on the turn and weakened in the stretch. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE
saved ground around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. ABOUT TODAY (ARG) , three deep chasing the pace around
the turn, gave way. INDIAN LAKE , bumped and put in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was outrun. IT'S A GAMBLE , along the inner rail around the
turn, was outrun. ARTHUR'S HOPE , bumped and squeezed back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor.

Footnotes
ADDY'S LADDY T N T , three wide and in the clear as the closest pursuer of the duel, shifted out a bit soon into the lane, closed in under left handed asking
past mid stretch, sustained and forged past the leaders in the final strides. AWESOME DYNAMO sped to contention and got into a pace battle outside of
JEBSTER, carried that duel to deep stretch while holding a slim lead, fought bravely but was run down late. JEBSTER rushed up inside and disputed the
pace with AWESOME DYNAMO, failed to let that one shake free past mid stretch and held well to the end. WIRED IN broke a step slow, hustled up to the
inside of rivals, chased around the turn, eased out and had a mild gain. DESTINY JOY , two wide between rivals early on, came up empty. RIGHT QUICK
lagged back, saved ground into and through the lane but failed to menace. JAHEZ , four deep into the turn, made a run from the three eighths to upper
stretch then faded. MR. FIBONACCI , off the pace and outside a rival, swung very wide for the drive but failed to menace. SERGEANT PARKER , three
wide between rivals, faltered around the turn and was eased late.
