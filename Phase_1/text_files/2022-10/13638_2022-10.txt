Footnotes
LIBERTY BELLE chased the pace for a half, rallied two wide into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker then widened the balance of the trip
under strong handling to win as much the best. AWESOME WONDER broke in front, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for
the winner. ORBIT BOUND stalked never far back, moved up two wide through the turn, swung wide then finished evenly in the seven path. VALIANT
SPARK bore in at the start bumping rivals and had brief speed. HALF LEGEND was no factor. TOY TIGER was bumped at the start, had sped for three
furlongs then weakened. PASATIME also bumped at the start, prompted the early pace along the inside and was through after a half.

MISS EASY sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, edged clear late under strong handling and prevailed. DOMINUS O'S ME slow early,
closed with a burst of speed through the final furlong in the six path and just missed getting up in time. GRACIE DANCE pressured the winner two wide and
was outfinished. ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then leveled off. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN saved ground and lacked
the needed response. MANDOLIN BREEZE was no factor.

Footnotes
TIME TO SHOOT stalked the pace four ride, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead near the furlong marker two wide and proved best in a stiff
drive under left handed urging. OBIWAN broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, dug in determinedly but couldn't handle the winner.
AHIMELECH bumped at the start, loomed boldly two wide between horses nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished. NICK CAN FIX unhurried early,
swung wide and closed a gap late in the six path. JACK LUVS NOVA bumped at the start and failed to menace. TEAM HUCKY had good early speed near
the inside then faded. JOHN'S ROCK chased the pace two wide and was through early.
