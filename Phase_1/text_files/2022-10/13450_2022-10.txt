Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN bobbled slightly at the break and bumped lightly with LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT, stalked outside of KISS N BIZ early, dueled outside that foe
around the turn, took a clear lead approaching the quarter, opened up midstretch under a drive and ran on in command to the finish. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT
bumped likely with FIRST KITTEN at the break, settled toward the rear, began to gradually improve two wide on the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch,
sustained her rally, and chased on willingly to prove second best. HAPPY SAILS tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the
turn, proved no match for FIRST KITTEN in the lane but kept on for show. AMARI S. chased the leading trio down the back straight and in the four path on
the turn, and kept on mildly in the lane. KISS N BIZ was placed on the lead, set a pressured pace, dueled inside of FIRST KITTEN on the turn, proved no
match for that foe approaching the quarter pole, chased on under a drive in upper stretch but weakened inside. LALUCHADORA broke out and bumped
BALIMOS in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear pair, chased near the rear around the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and lacked the
needed rally in the lane. EVIE JEAN settled near the rear inside, saved ground around the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, and did not muster a rally
under a drive. BALIMOS was fractious at the gate, got bumped soundly by LALUCHADORA in the opening strides, settled two wide in the rear pair,
continued in the rear flight on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and proved empty. NEW CHINA chased inside down the backstretch and around the
turn, and emptied out inside.

Footnotes
CHI TOWN HUSTLER ducked out at the start, was righted immediately to dispute the lead between foes in the opening furlong, angled to the inside nearing
the turn dueling for command inside a rival, shook clear in upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. FISHERMAN
OSCAR, reluctant to load, was prompted between foes to gain a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the leaders into the turn, continued with a
steady effort along the inside, tipped off the rail midstretch and prevailed for the place honors. KEEP LEFT ducked inwards at the start, was righted to
prompt the pace three deep in the opening furlong, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner into the turn and weakened nearing midstretch. INDIO
GUAPO tracked off the flight near the inside racing into the bend, shifted out four wide midstretch and finished evenly late. STEEL HAWK was settled
outside a rival tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn and never gained contention. NORMANDY ANGEL tracked the leaders
along the inside from the outset to the lane but offered no closing bid. PRIMAL CAUSE broke slowly while being shut off at the start and failed to menace
thereafter.

Footnotes
AMERICAN PYRAMID led narrowly outside foes early, edged clear near the half mile mark, set the pace in the two path on the turn, and maintained a clear
advantage under a mild drive in the lane. BAILOUT KELA broke outward, chased the leading trio down the backstretch, chased the leading pair in the four
path on the turn, was urged near the three eighths, chased on four wide in the lane and proved best of the rest. JOAN'S WAY broke outward, raced inside at
the rear of the main group early, tipped two wide into the turn, chased two wide around the bend, rallied between horses in upper stretch, chased on willingly
but was outkicked in the final sixteenth for the place. WILDWOOD BYE trailed early, regained touch with the field into the turn, raced with the rear flight in
the four to five path along the bend, swung six wide into the lane and chased on mildly. LUCY JANE stalked the leader early, tracked the pacesetter in the
two path on the turn, proved no match into the lane and flattened three wide. POSITIONDUMONI was bumped by BAILOUT KELA in the opening strides,
settled near the rear of the main group, chased in the five to six path on the turn in the rear flight, was driven six wide in upper stretch and lacked the
needed rally. MY LADY SLEW tracked in range inside early, gradually lost position along the rail around the turn and continued to weaken inside in the lane.

Footnotes
BEHAVIN MYSELF settled out of close quarters at the start, was prompted to advance along the rail racing into the backstretch to wrest the advantage after
three furlongs, moved away to a comfortable advantage racing into the far turn, shifted out to the three path racing through the stretch but maintained a safe
margin to the end under pressure. EL ROMANTICO was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, tipped off the inside
entering the backstretch, lost the advantage after three furlongs, continued in steady pursuit of the winner through the far turn to upper stretch while shifting
outside that foe in the drive but proved only second best. MADELYNS HEAT settled last while angling to the inside in the opening quarter, switched outside
a rival racing into the far turn and continued with a steady effort three deep between foes to gain position to the end while prevailing for a share. HIGH LIFE
AGAIN, forwardly placed three deep between foes racing to the first turn, dropped off the leaders entering the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into
the far turn while being prompted to advance inside foes, made brief progress into upper stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. BLOOMING
GARDEN, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch, continued outside foes to race four wide into the lane but lacked the needed late
bid. CONCOCTION flashed brief pace between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch and emptied out abruptly after three furlongs.

Footnotes
BAYOU WIND tracked the leading pair, raced in the pocket on the far turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, rallied to lead midstretch, and held
narrowly. LUCY'S CAKES FLY raced two wide toward the rear, began to improve between horses around the far turn, sustained her bid under a drive in the
lane and missed. FALL MOON chased four wide through the first turn, inched forward to track the leading pair down the backstretch two wide, bid three
wide into the far turn, continued in range in upper stretch, chased on willingly but proved no match for the top pair late. SEEKING SECA prompted the early
pace outside of SHE'S WANDAFUL, dueled outside that foe around the far turn, edged to a narrow lead in upper stretch, but was caught by BAYOU WIND
approaching the furlong pole and flattened late. HARVEY'S PRINCESS chased inside, was driven inside in upper stretch, and kept on willingly while
ultimately unable to reel in the leaders. SHE'S WANDAFUL set the pace while prompted by SEEKING SECA, dueled inside that foe around the far turn,
proved no match in upper stretch and flattened out inside. TWELVE STARS chased three wide between horses through the first turn, continued to chase
midfield down the back straight and four wide through the far turn, and could not find the necessary kick in the lane. ZANDREA'S settled near the rear,
raced two wide around the far turn and had no kick between horses in the lane. MS CORONADO CHROME raced toward the rear inside through the
clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the back straight, steadied approaching the three eighths and lost ground inside, and had no rally in the
lane. SENSE OF SELF chased between horses, raced in range three wide on the far turn in range and weakened in the lane. COME ON SWEET PEA
settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the far turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HORNET broke readily, forged clear of the field racing off the inside to the turn, dictated terms on a commanding margin to upper stretch and was
kept to firm left handed pressure to the end. COMISKEY PARK tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing into the bend and continued with a
steady effort in that path to prevail for the place honors. COURTHOUSE COVE settled outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while
being fanned five wide racing through the stretch, exchanged light contact with BEEALEA in late stages but prevailed for a share. BEEALEA tracked off the
second flight between foes, then along the inside racing into the bend, tipped out to gain some position four wide between foes while exchanging light
contact late and was outkicked for a share. KIERKEGAARD tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn and faded in late stages.
GAME BOY BENNY tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight and faded into upper stretch. ANDREW THE GIANT dropped out early. BLAZEN
ROAD tracked off the second flight inside foes and steadily retreated into the turn.

Footnotes
SPEAKING SCOUT tracked the leading pair inside of ENCOURAGE down the stretch for the first time and through the clubhouse turn, tracked down the
backstretch and while in the two path around the far turn, rallied sharply inside of CAMP DAVID into the lane and soon opened up a clear advantage, and
drew off as much the best under a mild drive. TONKA WARRIOR prompted the pace outside of CAMP DAVID, vied between horses around the far turn,
came three wide into the lane, proved no match for SPEAKING SCOUT in upper stretch but stayed on with continued interest and found enough between
horses to hold safe for the place. XAVEY DAVE chased the leading pair between horses early, settled back to chase midpack through the clubhouse turn
and into the backstretch, chased in the two to three path around the far turn, dropped to the inside in upper stretch, rallied inside of CAMP DAVID, and kept
on inside for the show. BENS MALICE raced three wide in the rear flight early, chased three wide into the back straight, rallied four wide into the far turn as
the field contracted and ran at the outside of the leading flight, swung five wide into upper stretch, could not go with SPEAKING SCOUT, chased on willingly
but narrowly missed the show. CAMP DAVID led inside while prompted by TONKA WARRIOR, vied at the inside of the leading flight around the far turn,
came off the inside into the lane and had no answer as SPEAKING SCOUT kicked past, and flattened out between horses in the final furlong. AMERICAN
MAYHEM dropped to the inside early, was a bit keen while chasing, gradually settled back near the rear inside of WICKED GENIUS into the back straight,
was urged in the three to four path in the rear pair around the far turn and finished mildly past tiring horses in the lane. PROTONIC POWER settled at the
rear, continued in the four to five path in the rear pair around the far turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. WICKED GENIUS raced between horses
near the rear early, continued two wide near the rear down the back straight, came three wide into the far turn as the field contracted, chased three wide
around that bend but flattened out in the lane. ENCOURAGE tracked the leading pair outside of SPEAKING SCOUT and XAVEY DAVE, rallied three wide
between horses into the far turn, vied three wide around that bend, but emptied out four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL was urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset into the bend, shook clear entering the turn to open a comfortable advantage,
shifted well off the inside in the stretch but held sway to the end under firm encouragement. EL ASESINO, reserved three deep between foes in the opening
stages, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper stretch, angled to the inside racing past the furlong marker and continued with late momentum
to prevail for the place honors late. W W KAN DO was urged three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, shifted inwards while keeping
on with a steady effort between foes to late stages but was outkicked for second. AGAVE KID, urged to a forward placing four wide while prompted in
pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn, continued evenly in late stages. HIGH HERO, urged between foes pressing the pace to the turn, gave way nearing
upper stretch. OUTRUN THE POSSE settled last along the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside racing through the stretch to gain some
position but made no real impression. PEACOCK MAN tracked off the first flight along the inside to the turn and faded into upper stretch. WILD WES
tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening quarters and steadily retreated nearing the lane. EVIDENCE tracked off the first flight five wide on the
backstretch and soon dropped out.
