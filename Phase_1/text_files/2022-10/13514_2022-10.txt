Footnotes
GOODTIME ARTIE hopped at the start, moved up three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in
the final strides. SKYDIVING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead late and was outfinished. MARK THE MOOSE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. UP FOR THE CHANCE ran evenly. FEAR THE DEER well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns,
came through inside into the stretch and had no rally. GIOVANE'S PROMISE well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the second
turn, then drifted out four wide into the stretch and faded. EL POLICIA allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, steadied into the
stretch and faded.
