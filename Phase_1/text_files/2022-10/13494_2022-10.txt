the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch just missed. STRIBLING broke inward and had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the
stretch and gave way. MAVERICK MAN tracked the leaders from the outside and was roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had
no response. WHISKEY VICTOR was in range and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. THELONIOUS was bumped at the start and lost his rider.

mid stretch but gave way. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was away alertly and had the lead on the turn but had nothing left. KOZY KAT stalked the early leader
and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. MISS TEA BLONDE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the
turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SECRET AFFIRMATION had no speed and showed little in a dull effort. WESTLODGE

TRAGICALLY QUEWICK stalked the early leaders, raced evenly on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and drew clear. TOMATO BILL was in range, a factor
on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. AWESOME MINER was hustled early and dueled on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. DYNAMITE KARMA forced the pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch while all out.
CHASING VINNY was off slow and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA was off
the pace and roused on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no threat. WONNEFRAC was in touch but chased on the turn and
dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
JACK BEANSTALK set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. DILETTANTE was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. TYCOON was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. CRAFTY CONQUEST stalked the early leader and was roused on the turn but evened out through the
stretch. LETTING LOOSE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. ACE
DESTROYER tracked the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. CLASSY MISTRESS was
well back and closed the gap on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat. KEEN SAMURAI was in touch but lost ground on
the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
SANTIAGO SALSA was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the nine path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. STORMIN' HUMOR was in mid
pack, roused on the turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but failed to hold. SILVER SIGNATURE was in touch, moved up on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. CORE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the
stretch needed more. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS was up close and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MISTER
M V P was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. WAR DOCTOR was hustled early
and forced the pace on the turn but faded. NO EASY ROAD was in range and saved ground on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was
no threat. RED BARI set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but had nothing left. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ had no speed and showed little in a
dull effort. MISS D'S PRIDE stalked the early leaders but chased on the turn and was empty.
