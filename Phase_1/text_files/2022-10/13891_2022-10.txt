Footnotes
ARCH CITY settled off the early pace, moved up from the outside around the far turn, angled widest through the stretch run, surged late and got up under
strong handling. FLYING WARRIOR raced off the early going, was four wide near the seven eighths pole, raced six deep into the upper stretch, led nearing
the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. SCOTTY WHO pressed B a Champion from the inside down the backstretch and weakened through the
stretch drive. B A CHAMPION was off slow, rushed to set a pressured pace from the outside of rival and faded the final quarter of a mile. DECK HUMOR
stalked the top pair down the backstretch, made a three wide bid near the five sixteenths pole to challenge and faded in the stretch run.

JERSEY JOE vied for the early lead from the inside and prevailed under all out pressure. PROBATE vied for the early lead, raced three deep while racing
between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. RIGHT JAB settled off the early going, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and rallied gamely to
the wire. WATFORD raced off the early pace, moved up five wide through the lane, lacked room deep stretch and finished willingly. PLAYING FIELD was
void of early speed to race far back early and never was a factor. JEEBAR was off a step slow, rushed from the outside to make an early bid, was eased up
on through the stretch and had to be vanned off.

BYE BYE BRANDI showed good early foot to the early pace and drew off to be well clear while under mild pressure. CRYSTAL WHO chased the early pace
from the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. LENA'S GOLD settled to the mid pack early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
kept on to the wire. I GET STORMED was unhurried early, moved up six to seven wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. MARKED BY A
STORM stalked the pace, raced four wide and lacked a rally. CURBS ICE LADY was coaxed along early to lay up close, raced between and weakened the
through the stretch run. SOUNDLESS AX raced off the early pace, was six deep into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. MISS JAX dropped to the back of
the pack early, raced near the inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CROSSFIRE COWGIRL pressed the pace from the outside and finished well to edge clear late under strong pressure. FIRST AGAIN chased the early pace
from the outside, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in through the drive and got up for the place position late. HANNAH'S HIGHLIFE was
off slowly, rushed from the inside to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. IMAMONEYMAKER raced off the early pace, raced four to
three wide through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. COCKTAILWITHATWIST chased the early pace, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and weakened. PRETTY PEPPY stumbled at the break, raced mid pack early on, saved ground and lacked a rally. CHARLIENE was
coaxed along early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and had no late rally. PEACE N SOLITUDE was reluctant to load, forced out soon after the
break, raced off the early going after the troubling beginning and never threatened. MS MERAZ bolted in the early stages to race near the outer rail, was
coxed back around the far turn but continued a wide bid and never threatened. WHITE LINE FEVER failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIZ FOR REAL raced mid pack early on, advanced through the far turn, raced in traffic near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and finished well to get up
while racing five wide under strong pressure. RUN LIKE KATE was allowed to settle early on, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished
willingly to the wire. GEORGIANO was coaxed along early from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. FI FI D'ORO was
hustled along from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and made a good late gain from the outside. BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL was unhurried early
on, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and had not enough. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE settled off the early pace, moved up five wide
in the lane and made a mild late gain. STORM N GOLD was off slowly, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. EMOTIONAL INTEL
raced five wide near the three eighths pole and weakened while racing from the outside. BINALLOVERDRINKEN pressed the pace while racing between
and gave way. HOLLYWOOD PRINCESS showed good early foot to set the pace from the inside and faded. PREMEDITATED LILY settled off the early
pace, raced near the inside and had no late response.
