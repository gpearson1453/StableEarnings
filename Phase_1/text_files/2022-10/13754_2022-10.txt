Footnotes
SILVER SPUN raced in second flight, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, and won driving. MAKE GOOD CHOICES sat in striking distance while
three wide, swung out to the four path nearing the stretch and was outkicked. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE hurried inside then was steadied, gained closer order in
the drive, angled out to the four path and was along in time for a third place finish. NO SUPAH FOR YOU vied outside of EVER TRUE, matched strides
through the far turn, and flattened out. EVER TRUE away well, dueled inside of NO SUPAH FOR YOU, and flattened in stretch. MY LUCKY MARK trailed
and offered a mild bid deep stretch. ADRIEN'S AURORA offered little.

Footnotes
DAD'S LEGACY attended the pace inside, went in pursuit of the leader, gained the lead into the stretch and held under a late drive. LIGHTENING ANNA
fanned four wide into the opening turn, advanced quickly in the far turn, set sights on DAD'S LEGACY, closed gamely and lost the bob. WHISKEY BOUND
lagged early, and closed steadily just missing out. JUMEIRAH COAST showed some early speed, chased the pacesetters in the far turn, and lacked the
kicked needed. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT saved to no avail. PROOF IT moved out leaving the opening turn to contest the pace, drew clear into the far turn,
was overtaken entering the stretch and gave way.

CARAVAN PRINCE vied inside for the lead, dueled inside of KAPTAIN KOWBOY in the final turn, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. KAPTAIN
KOWBOY broke sharply, dueled for the lead, was unable to get by CARAVAN PRINCE and kept on clear for place. BIG JIM unhurried early, roused
entering the lane, and finished well. OUR SUNSHINE broke slow, chased and improved position deep stretch. H K RAPPER broke outward into LUCKY
LEGS, chased four wide leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the drive. COPPER MEIN raced four wide, and failed to menace. TORQUE READY
was outrun. LUCKY LEGS bumped leaving and was gapped. TEMPTED BY FIRE never reached contention.

Footnotes
HE'S THE CHAIRMAN vied outside for the early lead, gained the advantage into the far turn, was under pressure through the drive and held on. COSMIC
MARINE prompted the pace from outside leaving the backstretch, drove three wide chasing the leader, and surged late missing out. CHARMING VINTAGE
tracked the pacesetters, angled four wide off the final turn, and closed well. JAKE THE RAKE disputed the early pace inside, was unable to match stride
with
HE'S
THE

and

in

yards.
PAULIE

OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR trailed early, lodged a mild bid and faded in stretch. GRADY'S SONG fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, swung out into
the lane and failed to threaten. BLAZING CHANNING chased four wide into the opening turn, and lacked a serious bid. TINY TYCOON hurried away, and
offered little.

Footnotes
SINGING BELL established the front quickly, saved ground while showing the way through the turn, drew away nearing the stretch, and was kept to task
under intermittent handling. GOLDIE SOCKS allowed to settle off the pace, drove four wide into the lane, kept on under a drive to be along for the place
honors while never threatening the winner. MISS VICKERS fanned three to four wide leaving the backstretch, and rallied belatedly. HERMANITA ALEX
settled outside early, trailed into the final turn and closed with good energy outside. SHES A COOL CAT chased inside, drove between foes at the head of
the stretch and faded in the later stages. BRYNN'S DREAM lacked early foot, chased, steadied at the eighth pole, and passed tiring. FAMOUS LAST
WORDS chased inside, shifted outside in the drive and faded. VIOLET CITY raced three wide into the opening turn, rallied inside into the stretch then
yielded in the final furlong. GOLDEN FORTYNINE chased hard outside, and faltered into the stretch. GRACE TOO offered little.

Footnotes
FAVORITE trailed early then shifted outside leaving the backstretch, raced in traffic in the final turn, came under light right handed urging, and was up in
time. VIVIEN'S CHARM sat mid pack in the four path, swung out at the head of the lane, roused four to five wide into the stretch gaining the lead, was
caught late and checked before the wire. DRAMATIC FLAIR was in tight inside, shifted out entering the stretch, and closed with good energy.
DIPLOMATICA tracked outside, prompted action while five wide nearing the quarter pole, battled inside into the stretch, and weakened. AMBER PRINCESS
advanced inside, shifted out to the three path late stretch and improved position. QUEEN RHONDA took closer order in the far turn, experienced traffic at
the head of the lane, shifted outside and lacked the kick needed. SASSY CINDERELLA stalked the pace from the four path, roused on the final turn
between foes, and came up empty for the drive. THRILL OF THE NITE led the field into the backstretch, was under attack at the head of the lane and faded
gradually. LILBITSPICY showed little.

Footnotes
FATHER O'FLAHERTY angled down to the rail in the backstretch, swung out to the three path in the final turn, struck the front and edged clear. HARD TO
COME HOME set a pressured pace inside of REGAL MAX, disposed of rival near the three eighths marker, but was soon overtaken, and flattened out but
held place safely. CAB SAV raced six wide into the backstretch, took closer order outside, rallied into the stretch improving position and secured show. WAR
GIANT raced in close quarters leaving the chute, settled inside, waited for running room into the final turn, angled out to the two path in the final furlong, and
was bested for show. TUCKER TIME sat in range from the three path, roused through the stretch, and rallied late. SPOT ON DUDE tracked the pacesetters
while wide in the backstretch, moved up into closer contention in the three path, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, and lacked a closing response that
was needed. ABOVE AND BEYOND unhurried early, swung out into the lane, and came up empty in the drive. BACKSTREET BOBBY raced wide in the
backstretch, and lacked a bid. DANCING WILLIE stalked in the five path, fanned three wide into the far turn, and lacked a response when asked. IMPERIAL
DASH was gapped and passed tiring. REGAL MAX vied outside for the early lead, was unable to move on with rival and tired early.
