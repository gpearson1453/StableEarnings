WILDCAT ECHO stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing NO HUDDLE to
prevail. NO HUDDLE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, could not reach the winner but
finished with good energy. DEACON BEACON dueled for the lead with LATENITE GOLD while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run
and gave way through the final sixteenth. GOBLIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive.
FEISTY TOWN lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. LATENITE GOLD disputed the pace from the inside for a half
and weakened. RED CHILE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BRODIE BABY set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the nine-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
PIPER ROSE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best.
MAYAPRETTY pressed the pace of the winner from the inside and gradually weakened. MISS RULES chased the leaders while racing three-wide and
weakened in the drive. FETCHING FURY lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace.
HOT LIL MESS was void of early foot, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor.

unhurried early, advanced seven-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner but finished with good late energy. SUPERBLEA settled off the leaders
early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. ABBIE'S WAY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out

furlong. QUICK TO FUSS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. ZIPPIN BY U was off a step slow, lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT chased the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
DELIA settled off the leaders early, advanced six-wide through the turn and was up in the closing yards to be going away late. RUNNING FOR GRACE
lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run but could not resist the winner from
over the top. ROLL ON CAMRON was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
led briefly and gave way late. MISS LORDOSIS disputed the pace from the inside, stayed on well in the drive, angled out in mid-stretch and finished
willingly. FOXY RED was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished evenly. ANNIE GET UR
GUNS showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way. SUNNY JEWEL raced off the pacesetters from the inside, steadied nearing the
three-eighths marker and gave way. BIKINILESS steadied soon after the start, raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to
rally. REAL ME pressed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. EVANGELINA WHO showed no early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. RIGLET dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, weakened into the lane and was eased.
