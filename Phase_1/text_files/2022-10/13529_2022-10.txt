MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE never far back, closed willingly five wide through the stretch and proved best by the narrowest of margins under left handed urging.
ACTSPECTATION away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide then along the inside, edged clear near mid stretch and just missed hanging on. BULLION
pressed the early pace along the rail, steadied nearing the turn then finished with good courage inside rivals. VERIFIED vied for the lead four then three
wide and went evenly. BLAME IT ON EDDIE had speed from the start, moved closer on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. GOLDEN READY pressed
the pace three then two wide and was through after a half. TAMANRASSETT had brief speed, stopped abruptly on the turn, pulled up bleeding from the
nostrils and was vanned off.

A PRAYER FOR KIDS bobbled at the start, was allowed to settle, swung wide, closed willingly four wide and was along in time. INTO GOLD chased the
pace into the stretch, loomed boldly three wide then finished second best. LINO'S KID pressed the early going along the rail, dropped back a bit and drifted
to the three path on the turn, came on again along the rail to make the lead before the furlong marker then was outfinished. EL CONDOR CAZA failed to
menace. JOHNSBUCKEYEBADBOY was no factor. FAST AS FAST CAN B sped to the lead along the inside soon after the start, shook clear on the turn,
drifted to the five path entering the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
KY HOT BROWN dueled for the lead three wide early, took over entering the turn, set the pace in the three path into the stretch, was headed a furlong out,
dug in under left handed urging, fought back gamely and proved best. ALEBRIJE never far back, rallied steadily four wide through the stretch and just
missed. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO slow early, closed with a burst of speed along the rail and was narrowly beaten. KILTOOM had speed from the start,
surged four then two wide through the turn, gained a narrow advantage near the furlong marker then was outfinished. BAD LITTLE BEAST found his best
stride late. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD dueled for the early lead along the inside, had speed through the turn, drifted to the five path entering the stretch
then faded. A LITTLE WILD failed to menace. ON HIS TOES was outrun. MASTER contested the early lead two wide, had speed into the turn then gave
way.
