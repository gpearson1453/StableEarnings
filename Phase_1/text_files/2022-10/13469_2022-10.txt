Footnotes
STRONG AGAIN settled off the early pace in the three path, cruised up four wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole and drew off while
ridden out. DANLEY raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. EDEN PARADISE saved
ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and was along for the show. BLUTO'S CANDY trailed inside early, bid
three wide between foes around the far turn but tired in the lane. TAKEMYSHOT set the early pace in the two path, settled back when PRINCE FOR A DAY
was intent on the lead late on the first turn, chased the pace in the two path from there and came up empty in the lane. PRINCE FOR A DAY rushed up
three wide around the first turn, cleared off early on the backstretch, led inside around most of the far turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
WITCH OF LOVE dueled outside of VELOCE BELLA to the sixteenth pole and drove clear. VELOCE BELLA dueled inside of the winner in the two path and
just lasted for the place. DEMURELY raced off the pace three wide and surged late between foes. OLYMPIC FENCER chased the top two finishers in the
clear in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. FOR EVER OURS raced four wide in midpack and never
threatened. CINDY'S SONG saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, angled back to the rail leaving the eighth pole and finished with belated
interest. MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) failed to menace while racing four wide. CANDYMEISTER played no factor while racing three wide. CUPID AUSTIN raced
well back two wide, was bumped near the eighth pole and had no bids. CENTSATIONAL GRACE was outrun while racing four wide. TWIN CAUSE raced
off the pace two wide, was forced in in midstretch and dropped back. SOUTH PACIFIC saved ground in midpack, bumped and checked in midstretch and
had no further response.

Footnotes
ALLURAMORE prompted the pace two wide and drew off under a drive. GITANA set the pace just off the rail, yielded leaving the eighth pole and held well
to preserve the place. ROSIE'S HALO chased the pace two wide between foes, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. DIVINE
CONNECTION tracked the pace four wide and faded in the lane. SOL HOPE had early speed and steadily faded inside. FOXY LADY played no factor while
racing four wide. SOPHIA'S STORM trailed while racing five wide.

Footnotes
PUDDING stalked the pace from the rail, took over inside of foes leaving the quarter pole, quickly shook clear and widened under a drive. YES I'M A BEAST
set the pace in the two path, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept on well to hold the place. RED CRESCENT broke inwardly
and bumped UNTITLED at the start, raced off the early pace outside, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in
upper stretch but held well enough to preserve the show. THINKABOUTIT raced in range three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked the
needed rally. WENT WEST stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. REAL TALK was up close two
wide and faded through the lane. SMILING TEUFLES was fractious in the gate, broke a bit slowly and made little impact while racing two wide. UNTITLED
was bumped at the start and steadied soon after then trailed outside.

Footnotes
BOSTON PRINCESS had early speed at the rail, angled into the three path early on the turn to stalk the pace, took command in midstretch and drove clear.
SOLAIR hopped at the start, raced well back five wide and rallied for the place. SYLLABUS stalked the pace four wide and finished evenly for the show.
SOCIAL ELIZABETH set the pace in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. KILKENNY BELLA was bumped early, raced two wide in midpack and
lacked the needed rally. TORA LORA LORA advanced along the rail around the turn, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth pole and faded through the final
furlong. ARTIFICIAL INTELL was outrun inside. DEADLY TRAIL chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. DIAMOND ROCK played no
factor while racing four wide. BREEZY CONNECTION was bumped early, saved ground and made little impact. BYZANTINE EMPIRE was bumped early,
raced four wide and played no further factor.
