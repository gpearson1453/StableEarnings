Footnotes
VOODOO FIRE broke outward, raced three wide with the rear group down the back straight, raced in the four path with the rear pair on the turn, began to
inch forward past the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane, improve under a drive, found her best stride with a sixteenth of a mile left and got up in
time. QUE PASA MUFASA broke outward but nonetheless soon led, set the early pace while prompted early by HEY MA to her inside, inched to a clear
lead in the two path on the turn, was engaged by TAP N TWINE to her outside past the five sixteenths, shook her off into the lane and opened up through
midstretch, but could not hold off VOODOO FIRE late. BOOZIN AT BOZOS raced between horses in the rear group down the back straight, continued
toward the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, drifted out slightly and chased on best of the rest. TAP N TWINE was keen
early, chased the leading pair down the back straight, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn while positioned outside of HEY MA, bid outside of
QUE PASA MUFASA near the five sixteenths, loomed to her outside approaching the quarter pole, proved no match into the lane, chased three wide and
flattened in the final furlong. HEY MA attended inside the leader early, tracked the leader inside of TAP N TWINE while hugging the rail on the turn, was
driven inside in upper stretch, chased while no match for QUE PASA MUFASA from upper stretch, and flattened between horses in the final furlong. BELLS
OF JOY was wrangled back awkwardly early, raced at the inside of the rear group early, raced in the three path with the rear group on the turn, was driven
in range in upper stretch, angled inward midstretch, raced in tight along the rail behind HEY MA inside the furlong mark, and weakened late.

Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY broke outwards bumping TALKTOEACHOTHER, was settled last on the backstretch, tipped out entering the bend, steadily
advanced on the leader racing four wide into upper stretch and continued with a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under pressure.
TALKTOEACHOTHER, bumped at the start, was righted, then sprinted clear of the field along the inside into the turn, held sway past midstretch but couldn't
fend off the winner. COCO BRAVADO tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued
with a mild bid to prevail for a share. TODDLES was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and faded inside foes into the stretch. ART
HEIST broke slowly and never gained contention. ALPINE GHOST, urged along in the three path pursuing the pacesetter outside a rival into the turn, gave
way into upper stretch. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE settled outside foes and faded early.

Footnotes
HARD ATTACK tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, was a bit keen to join inside SIERRA HOTEL into the backstretch, nonetheless
continued patiently in a tracking spot in the two to three path when SIERRA HOTEL bid into the far turn, swung out near midstretch into the lane, drifted
inward in upper stretch and bumped SIERRA HOTEL while rallying, sustained his run and caught WHISKEY PLANK inside the sixteenth. WHISKEY PLANK
soon cleared, was engaged by SIERRA HOTEL to his outside into the far turn, kept a narrow lead in the two path around the bend, turned back that foe in
the two path and took a clear lead again in upper stretch, but was caught by HARD ATTACK inside the sixteenth mark. SIERRA HOTEL stalked the pace
around the first turn and while racing outside of HARD ATTACK down the back straight, bid outside of WHISKEY PLANK into the far turn, loomed in the
three path near the quarter pole, was turned back by the pacesetter into the lane, got bumped in upper stretch by HARD ATTACK, nonetheless kept on
willingly but was ultimately outfinished. IOYA AGAIN broke a bit slowly, raced a bit keenly while chasing the leading pair inside, chased at the rear of the
main group in the two path on the far turn, was driven inside and bid up the rail in upper stretch, loomed approaching the furlong mark, but flattened out.
TWOKO BAY chased the leading pair two wide, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn and offered a mild bid, but could not sustain that kick into
the lane and flattened out. DIAMOND DAVE settled in second last well behind the main group, raced in the two path around the turns, and chased on only
evenly under a drive in the lane. MAJOR SPARKS settled at the rear, trailed while saving ground, and lacked the needed kick under a drive in the lane. DUE
TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WAR MUSIC, caught in tight quarters at the start, was held up dropping off the leaders in the opening stages, tracked those rivals outside foes into the turn,
was fanned five wide racing past midstretch and produced a steady late response to just collar ALQWANI at the wire under firm right handed pressure to
prevail in time. The latter, urged to terms with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, switched out of close quarters nearing the turn to advance
on those foes three deep on the bend, moved to gain a narrow advantage midstretch, then grudgingly contested the issue to the wire to just miss. HALLIE'S
RAINBOW, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch but weakened late. STACY
ATTACK joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, shifted in nearing the bend to press the pace between foes through the turn to upper stretch but
faded in the last furlong. FRIEND, off last, angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the bend, shifted out four wide racing
through upper stretch advancing in tandem with the eventual winner but lacked the needed final kick. NOT TO BE DENIED settled along the inside in early
stages, saved ground to upper stretch but offered no rally. MOUDARI switched well outside the leaders in early stages, was pulled up racing through the
turn, then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
PURR SEA came away well to the lead, took prompting from JETS A GINNIN to her outside down the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path
on the turn while pressured by that foe, turned her away into the lane while still moving comfortably, opened up when driven past the three sixteenths and
gradually increased her advantage further to the finish. WHITE LIES settled at the rear of the main group, chased in the three to four path on the turn, was
driven four wide in upper stretch, responded with a rally between horses, and got up for place inside of JETS A GINNIN in the final strides. JETS A GINNIN
broke well, prompted the early pace outside of PURR SEA, pressed her two wide around the turn, was outkicked by PURR SEA into the lane, chased on
willingly nonetheless but lost the place late. LILY'S WOOFY chased the leading trio early, continued to track the leading pair in the five path around the turn,
floated six wide into the lane, was outkicked by the leader into upper stretch, and chased on mildly. EMERALD PRINCESS tracked the leading pair down
the back straight and in the four path on the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch and offered a brief bid, but flattened from midstretch. AROSE
FOR LYLA trailed down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses under a drive wile drifting out
several more paths. MALLOY settled in second last, raced in the two to three path on the turn, came two wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally
under a drive. SHEZ STUCK UP settled near the rear of the main group inside, chased in the two to three path on the turn, was driven inside in the lane and
came up empty.

Footnotes
TRAIL RIDGE ROAD was rated three deep between foes just off the second flight to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path on the far
turn, moved to challenge for command near the sixteenth marker and kicked clear late under firm left handed encouragement. KATIE M'LADY, reluctant to
load in the starting gate, was urged prompting the pace outside a rival, dispatched that foe after a half, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn,
went clear midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. KINGSBURY DREAM, reserved last to the backstretch, split foes just off the
inside nearing the lane, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued well enough to gain a share in late stages. CAT ATTACK, pulling
against restraint three deep in the opening stages, drifted out on the first turn, moved to press the issue outside the pacesetter into the far turn to upper
stretch and gave way late. BEYOND PROPER tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, continued in tandem with the eventual winner
inside that foe while making a brief bid entering the lane, altered course leaving midstretch and came up empty late. EMBARRASSING raced four wide in
second flight in the opening stages, dropped off the second flight racing through the backstretch and faded into upper stretch. LIZZ A BEE settled along the
inside in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. SWEET FRAULEIN angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking the leaders inside foes as part of
the second flight to the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn. LIPLINER, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the
backstretch, was through after a half.

Footnotes
DOCTOR OSCAR was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, asserted his lead under a hand ride in upper stretch, was shown the
crop in midstretch but finished well in command under only mild hand riding late. PALACE KITTEN tracked three wide between horses early, continued to
track in the three path on the turn while between horses, swung four wide into the lane, proved no match for the leader but chased on willingly and got the
place bob outside of HUEY ATTACK. The latter tracked in range along the rail, proved no match for DOCTOR OSCAR into upper stretch despite being
urged, kept on with interest but was outnodded by PALACE KITTEN for place. HIDE THE DEMON was a bit slow into stride, settled in second last, edged a
bit closer in the five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses mildly late under a drive. DEVILEYE settled at the rear inside,
saved ground on the turn, began to take closer order past the three eighths, was driven up the inside into the stretch and offered a brief rally, but flattened in
the final furlong. WHAT'S UP DUDE chased four wide early, improved into the turn to track the leader three wide, was driven five wide into the lane and
flattened out. CARLOS L. tracked two wide between horses early, weakened in the five path on the turn, floated seven wide into the lane, had no response
when only briefly asked midstretch and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
IRISH VALOR was settled out of striking distance while angling nearer to the inside in the opening half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch, then
rallied sharply past rivals to wrest command and go well clear under firm encouragement. SYMBOLIST, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first
turn, tracked just off the first flight on the backstretch, was urged to advance three deep between foes into the lane and proved best of the others in the
drive. LAVENDER EARL sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the far turn,
shifted out in upper stretch setting the pace to the furlong marker but yielded to the top pair late. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE, pulling hard along the inside
racing just off the pacesetter into the first turn, switched out prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch to the far turn but came up empty in the drive.
MOVE ON OVER, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch tracking off the first flight, saved ground to
upper stretch while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed late response. BRAVO BRAVO settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch
and offered no rally. END ALL GET ALL dropped out early.
