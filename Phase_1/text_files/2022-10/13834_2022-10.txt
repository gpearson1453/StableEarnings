Footnotes
GOING IN STYLE settled off the early pace, moved in near the three-quarter pole, advanced with five furlongs to run, stalked the leading trio in the two path
early on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the five-sixteenths, gained to take the advantage into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up in the
final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. WINNING CONNECTION disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, was asked along the rail on the turn,
fought on well in the stretch but missed while well clear for the place. OUTLAW COUNTRY was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while up for the show. SECOND AND REED was urged along towards the rear,
saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. UNCLE DAN stalked the leading duo on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three
path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. CHURRO contested the pace on the outside, vied between foes in the two path on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. THIRD MOON bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.
BROTHER SHOWTYME tossed his head some while last to commence, moved to the outside then raced greenly near the back, went four then three wide
on the turn and failed to respond. OBSCURED BY CLOUDS bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, fell back late on the
backstretch, dropped to the rear in the four then five path around the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
LORD GATLING went to the front, showed the way under pressure, vied inside on the turn, shook clear outside the five-sixteenths, responded well when
asked for his best into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead outside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper
lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand-ride from that juncture to the wire. FOREVER WICKED dropped well behind then moved to
the outside, went four then five wide around the turn and finished with good energy to just get the place. DONTBELATE showed speed then chased the
pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide around the turn, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match then lost the place but was
well clear for the show. MAJESTIC TIGER was urged along on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came
up empty. EL MAYOR brushed with a foe while off near the rear, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn and tired. MR. BRIGGS
pressed the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and faded. FORESTWOOD LANE
was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, suffered an injury at the three-eighths and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
TIZZY IN THE SKY came away quickly then was hustled clear before being taken in hand into the first turn, raced inside to the two path around that bend,
was well rated down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside on the far turn, drew off under a very light hand-ride into the final furlong and
widened to win handily. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN bobbled at the start then was hustled, settled on the inside, chased along the rail while inside of foes on
the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and secured the place while no match for the winner. WASP broke out a bit, went two then three wide
around the opening bend, settled outside down the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, chased three wide around the far turn and
weakened but was clear for the show. VIENNA CODE went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased between foes in the
two path on the far turn and came up empty. KERIK went three then two wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while saving ground on
the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
LASHARA (GB) brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the inside, moved off the rail late on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied outside
into the final furlong and closed determinedly to get up at the wire. BRAMBLE BAY went three then two wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, was let out in the three path on the far turn, made an outside bid into upper stretch, gained the lead inside the furlong marker, led to the final stride
but was denied while able to get the place. ANGEL PALM (GB) contested the pace on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive
in upper stretch, lost the lead to the runner-up inside the furlong marker and was outfinished but held the show. SILVESTRI (FR) was well placed while rated
just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind horses on the far turn, was asked into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened
then just missed the show. OAKHURST saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide while roused on the far turn,
swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TONED UP leaned out at the start, angled in at the rear early, went around the first turn in the two
path, settled at the back, was roused while saving ground on the far turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT traveled
around the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths and came
up empty.

Footnotes
THREE UNIONS showed good speed and went to the front, vied inside a rival while along the rail on the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch and proved best under strong urging. THREE GIRLS tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path
around the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked then just held the place. MIDTOWN LIGHTS broke out at the start, was
well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, moved out outside
the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to secure the show. STARTS NOW was reserved behind cover, bumped
with RED BUTTERFLY leaving the backstretch then bumped hard again with that foe, traveled three wide on the far turn, shifted five wide into the stretch
and improved position. LA GOULU broke a bit slow, settled on the inside, saved ground while roused on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed kick. LAKESIDE GETAWAY broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. NEVER PERSONAL broke a step slow, was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the turn, shifted four wide
into the stretch then moved out at the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. LOVE MY CANDY stumbled outward at the start and was off a bit slow, settled at
the rear, moved from the rail to the two path late on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then angled further out and was no factor. GOOD MORNING
KISS was forwardly placed on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and tired. MAYA'S DREAM settled off the pace, raced between foes in the two
path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond. BODE'S GIRL broke a bit slow, settled
towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. RED BUTTERFLY settled off the pace, bumped
with STARTS NOW leaving the backstretch then bumped soundly again with that foe, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty.

ROYAL MEGHAN was hustled from the start, steadied briefly when the leader crossed in front outside the three-quarter pole, moved up to contest the pace
on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. BLUE
PAYNT lunged at the start and was off a bit slow, settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn and narrowly secured the place while no
match for the winner. VEGAS WEEKEND was restless in the gate, angled in behind horses while taken under a snug hold early, was well placed down the
backstretch, chased in the two path early on turn before shifting three then four wide, pursued the winner in the drive and lost the place while able to get the
show. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA settled on the inside, saved ground under urging on the turn, came between horses outside the furlong marker and lacked
the needed response. DAME CINCO broke awkwardly and a bit slow, moved out then settled on the outside, was urged four then five on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LUCKY PERIDOT was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground on the
turn and was no factor. RESPECT MY CANDOR was hustled from the gate, angled in while in front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on
the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and faded. JERUSALEMA tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back into
upper stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

IMPLICATED was well placed while rated on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, gained to
make an outside bid into the final furlong, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. TAX IMPLICATIONS (GB) brushed the
inside of the gate and was last to commence, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, was roused two then three wide on the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch, lugged in under a left-handed crop while gaining in the drive, closed well into the final sixteenth, lugged in more
severely while coming to the winner late then was taken up and earned the place. SMOKIE EYES angled in while going to the front, showed the way while
near the inside, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and was out-kicked
but was clear for the show. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two to
three path on the final turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. THE CLASSY ONE was corrected with the left-rein at the start, rounded the first turn
in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused two to three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. GRAND OAK (IRE) was taken in hand early, tucked
into the two path for the run around the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
failed to rally.

crop in the stretch, shortened stride in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. WON AN AWARD broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged
along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and finished with good energy for the place. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) went to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, lost the lead along the rail on the turn, kept on well in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and earned the show.
MONTEPULCIANO was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground inside of two foes on the turn, was shuffled back some behind SEISMIC SPIRIT
coming to the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. WICO (IRE) angled in off the pace, went
three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. RUTHERFORD broke out at the start, was rated just off the pace, raced between foes in the two
path on the turn and came up empty. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the
turn, raced between foes in the stretch and failed to threaten. UNKNOWN AGENDA was bumped at the start and forced out, angled in towards the rear,
