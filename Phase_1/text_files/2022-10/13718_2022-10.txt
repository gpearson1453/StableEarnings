HE RUNS THE LINE stalked the pacesetters inside, bid to the front midstretch and edged away through the final furlong. SALTIN' THE RIM inside early,
advanced wide on the final turn to gain the place. ORIGO pursued the loose pacesetter, led at the three eighths pole and weakened. HE'SSOSUBTLE
dropped well behind then narrowed the gap without menacing. DANGNABBIT hustled to a clear advantage, was collared into the far turn and faded.
LIBERTY RUNNER bobbled briefly early then was always far behind. TWO COLOR MAP raced close up outside for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
PRINCE FILIP forced the pace three wide, took over into the stretch and pulled away while kept to his task. BUFFALO SHUFFLE rushed to the front inside,
was collared at the quarter pole and finished willingly for the place. EXPLAIN far behind early, swung very wide in the stretch and closed well. MASROUR
advanced near the inside on the turn, angled out, loomed a threat but flattened out. FIRE'S FINALE lacked speed, moved inside and failed to respond.
AMIGOS GUITAR was urged close up in the two path then inside and faltered. MAHOMES MONEY raced just off the leaders four wide and gave way. ONE
NINER TANGO prompted the pace between rivals down the backstretch and faded.

IT'S SO EASY earned a narrow advantage inside, shook clear into the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED vied with
the winner outside to the stretch and weakened. LONDONDERRY broke a step slowly then advanced inside with some late energy. GINGERS WISH rallied
outside on the final turn then flattened out. SOLEMN OATH settled off the pace outside and was never in contention. FED POLICY hustled from the start,
chased four wide and faded. QUIET PLEASE hustled just off the leaders briefly then stopped. DRIVEN BY SPEED saved ground off the pace and
weakened steadily. MONSTER RISING dropped back early and trailed losing contact with her field.

advanced inside and closed well for the place. CLOUT CHASER hustled to the front off the inside, was collared midway on the turn then tired. ET'S MOON
MAIDEN saved ground close up and continued well to the finish. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES prompted the pace outside then began fading on the turn.
PRINCESS SOPHIE settled off the pace inside and lacked a response. SEAMIALAUGH chased within range in the two path and faded. FINE ONE WON
flashed speed outside and weakened steadily. TILSA raced three wide down the backstretch and gave way. DISTORTED VIEW dropped back in the two
path and stopped. BILLIEANNE moved extremely wide on the turn and gave way.

FOGGY NIGHT set a pressured pace inside, pulled clear into the stretch, quickly widened and was being geared down late. BROADWAYCHARLYROSE
prompted the winner to the stretch, raced an erratic course tiring. CIVIL NOTION saved ground off the pace and gained on the second pick late. LADY
THOR was urged behind the dueling leaders then faded on the final turn. JERSEY COAST dropped back early and gave way readily. ROYAL PARTY
lagged far behind despite early urging and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HIGH VELOCITY quickly took control, widened on the turn, then gamely held off rivals from both sides. THE BIG BLUFF went after the winner on the turn,
continued well but could not get by. BRETT'S WORLD settled off the pace, advanced on the rail, loomed a threat but was outfinished. MAGNETRON trailed
far behind then closed gap too late. DIZZY GILLESPIE dropped back early and was never in contention. SILVER FURY raced off the pace between rivals
and faltered after half a mile. AMERICAN ROMA lacked speed and was always outrun. CRAFTY JACK pursued the loose pacesetter wide and stopped.

PETULANT DELIGHT raced in closest pursuit of the loose pacesetter, angled out in the stretch and closed to wear down the leaders. I LOVE JAXSON
advanced on the turn, led in midstretch but was caught late. MISSION OBERON sprinted clear on the backstretch, was collared in the stretch and finished
gamely. HEALY'S HOPE rallied outside and made a gradual late gain while no threat. CALL FITZROY raced far behind then narrowed the gap without
menacing. BOAT OVER THE HILL broke slowly, rushed to contention then faded. AWE MUN raced wide and was always outrun. RUNNINGFORHOME
raced within striking range and gave way readily. CAPE MAY STYLE was urged within striking range early and stopped.

OFF THE MEDS settled inside, advanced on the turn then drew away through the final furlong. DECKOLOGY pursued the loose pacesetter led briefly but
proved no match for the winner. CREA'S BKLYN LAW lagged far behind, advanced very wide and was just up for third. THE RIGHT PATH dropped back
wide and lacked a rally. MACH TRIAL raced wide, moved briefly closer on the turn then faltered. POINTER sprinted clear in the opening furlong, widened
before half a mile then came up empty. BIG BAD BUD chased in the two path and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
ROYAL COUP settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out at the quarter pole and drew off while in hand. ANGELUS WARRIOR vied along the inside and
continued well to gain the place. MY MAN ELVIS chased in the two path and finished well while no threat. LONG GRAY LINE lacked speed, moved inside
and made a gradual late gain. WEEKEND IN COURT trailed early, advanced wide on the final turn and flattened out. MO READY dueled outside for three
quarters and faltered. AUBURN HILLS chased three wide to the far turn and gave way.
