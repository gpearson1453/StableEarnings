Footnotes
NOTHINLASTSFOREVER prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead before the furlong marker and wore down rivals under strong
left handed urging in a game effort. MOESTER close up from the start, rallied along the rail through the stretch and got up for second. BABA LOOEY stalked
the early pace, loomed boldly four then three wide into the stretch but was outfinished. CATMAN JACK never far back, finished with good courage five then
four wide. CHOCOLATE RABBIT sped to the lead along the inside soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted out a bit then
weakened. SEASONS END was no threat. VICTORY DIVISION had good early speed then faded. ZAROSHA was no factor.

Footnotes
STAR HAWK was forced inward to the rail, bumped then in tight at the fifteenth sixteenths pole momentarily losing his action, stalked the pace through the
far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead near the top of the stretch then drew off while drifting out to win as much the best. FAT DADDY broke in front
then dangled inward before the clubhouse turn putting rivals in tight to his inside, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner.
SHELL FIRE stalked the pace and went evenly in the four path through the stretch. THRU THE VINE was forced into the winner bumping that one nearing
the first turn, pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. ZITMAN failed to menace. CANDY CRUSHEM moved up in the four path into the
second turn then came up empty. IMTHEPRINCE was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
OAKS HONEY unhurried early, closed fast four wide through the stretch and was along in time. RAISON KARTER with the second flight three wide, rallied
into the stretch to make the lead near the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. FAHRENHEIT dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then
was outfinished. EXPRIMIR contested the lead along the rail until deep stretch and was also outfinished. ANGEL'S ENTRY failed to menace. RELISH THE
RIDE close up along the inside, failed to respond. IT'S YOUR CALL moved up two wide before a half, had speed into the stretch then came up empty.
STRIKE A BEAT stalked the pace three wide and faltered in the stretch.
