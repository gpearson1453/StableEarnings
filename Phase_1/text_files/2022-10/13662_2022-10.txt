CPRIORITY showed early speed, raced on the front end throughout, dueled down the home stretch with UNIFIED ASSETS and prevailed for the win.
UNIFIED ASSETS raced near the back in the beginning, moved up on the backside, came around the final turn on the backside, dueled down the lane with
CPRIORITY and was outfinished for the win. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY raced near the middle of the field, made a steady gain, proved no match for the top
two, but got up for show. ZULTAN vied for the early lead, saved ground and lacked a finish. POPEYES HEART raced in the middle of the field, came around
the second turn wide and put forth an even effort. LEROY JENKINS lacked early speed, moved up, while racing on the rail, but was no factor. FAR

SPEED QUEEN lacked early speed, racing from the rear, made a steady gain, with a big moved on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane
and got up late. FINAL QUEST vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead, but was caught late for the win. ABSOLUTELY raced near
the back in the early part, gained ground late, but proved no match for the top two. VIV VIV VIV went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final
turn and weakened. MALIBU KENDALL raced near the middle of the pack and finished evenly. THAT YOU MARGARET void of early speed, came around
the second turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. GUANAJUATO raced within contention and faded, while racing on the inside. GATHER IN BALI raced
within striking distance, came around the first turn five wide and dropped back. FRIENDLY ACES pressed the early pace, dropped back, lost contact with
the field and was eased to the wire.
