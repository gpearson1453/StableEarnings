BAYOU MELODY chased the early pace, moved up four wide through the far turn and finished strongly to be well clear late under steady pressure. THE
BIGGEST ONE showed good early speed from the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. COFFEE ESSENCE veered out after the break to
race very wide, rated to race in hand, angled to the inside nearing the far turn, raced wide in the stretch run and was empty.

GRANDPA'S KID was unhurried early on, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, angled out to race from the outside, surged and got up strong handling.
SILVER STYLE showed good early speed from the inside, was well clear near the eighth pole and was wore down late. ANTONOV raced in tight quarter
soon after the break, settled off the early going, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ADERO stalked the pace, raced
along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. WEEKEND TIZZY stalked the early pace from the outside of foes,
raced three wide in the drive and weakened. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER was rated along to race in hand early and faded. RENEWING VOWS settled off the

MIRACLE SILVER found the lead with ease around the first turn, very nice even tempo down the backside, still clear leaving the far turn, felt pressure from
outside rival nearing the furlong marker, stayed clear under a steady drive. IT'S FATE stalked the leader from the inside, always in range entering the far
turn, shifted off the inside for clear run at the pace setter nearing the quarter pole, stayed on well through the wire. RELISHMENT slow into stride, steady
progress down the back stretch while outside rivals, sent seven wide leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly through the lane. CHARLIE THE GREEK off
the pace and between around the first turn, four wide into far turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole, evenly late. AULD LANGE SYNE bobbled at the start,
four wide trip both turns, sent seven wide top, no late bid. TAINO tracked off the top pair early on, faded through the stretch. ZONIC slow start, no threat.

ILLUSION OF HOPE stalked the top pair early on, raced along the inside around the far turn, moved up from the inside of Moon Party in the stretch run and
finished well to edge clear under strong handling. MOON PARTY settled off the early pace, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and finished second best. TALE LIGHTS settled early, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to
improve position. PINK VODKA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened through the
stretch run. KARATS AND GOLD stumbled at the break, rushed up from the outside to take command and was empty in the drive.

five wide at the top of the lane for clear run, all out drive to the wire, up late for the victory. APROPOS step slow at the start, coaxed up along the inside,
dueled around the turn, shook off rival leaving the quarter pole, could not fend off late rush to her outside, game try. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN clean start, dueled
from the outside into the turn, pressured leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly through the stretch. LETITGOTOVOICEMAIL step slow to start, urged on
between runners into the turn, scrubbed on around the turn, in range leaving the quarter pole, no late kick. BLONDE SAMARITAN slow into stride, never a
threat. BLETCHLEY GIRL slow start, eased nearing the quarter pole, jogged home.

LATE FROST rated early on, made a strong three wide bid through the far turn and widened through the stretch run to be well clear under steady handling.
PROUD MULE showed good early speed to set the early pace but was no match for Late Frost. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY was bumped at the start, raced off
the early going, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. O SHAUGHESEY was unhurried early on, moved up
three wide near the quarter pole and had no final bid. APPLE PICKER dropped off the early going, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and lacked
a bid. ANGELOFCANTERBURY was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and failed to sustain a bid while racing near the inside.
