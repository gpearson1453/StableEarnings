Footnotes
BOUDICA broke out at the start, tracked on the rail mid pack in the early stages, waited for room between and behind foes at the quarter marker, rallied five
wide in upper stretch, found a seam between horses nearing the sixteenth pole and shot through splitting runners to edge way at the line. ANITA
MARGARITA settled mid field down the backside, advanced five wide at the top of the lane to battle for the lead, dueled to the wire while drifting out in mid
stretch and was caught late nearing the wire. ALEXANDROVA was brushed at the start, stalked near the rear at the half, rallied turning for home six wide to
contend in upper stretch, lugged inwards on the drive at the furlong marker and could not recover in time to threaten for the top spot at the finish. MISCHIEF
LILY took command on the rail from the onset, was finally headed two furlongs left to run, fought on stubbornly on the fence the deep stretch and stalled
near the line and had to settle for a minor share. RUBY'S REIGN chased the leader down the backstretch, was in range turning for home on the fence,
needed room in upper stretch and when clear had little to offer for the finish. KEY STROKE was compromised at the break and trailed the field, saved
ground through the far turn and showed some interest to pass tiring rivals the last eighth. FILM chased the frontrunner at the half, took closer order to
contend between runners at the top of the lane, could not quicken with the pack for the drive, tired in mid stretch and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
LIDO KEY stalked inside in the early stages, was in a good tracking position on the rail entering the far turn, found a path four wide turning for home and
determinedly wore down her rival in the last eighth to get up at the end. LOVE TO RUN was away alertly to lead into the first turn, tracked the early speed
runner down the backstretch, assumed command at at the top of the lane and fought on stubbornly until deep stretch giving away to the winner nearing the
line. LADY MAEVE (IRE) was bumped at the break, trailed the field down the backside, advanced nicely on the fence through the far turn, waited for room at
the quarter pole, found a seam in upper stretch and needed more in the final eighth to threaten the top two. ENGLISH BISCUIT broke in at the start, stalked
four wide into the first turn, rallied at the three eighths pole outside three wide to loom into contention turning for home and stalled in the final eighth.
ARRIVISTE settled in mid pack just outside at the half, was behind foes at the top of the stretch for the run to the wire, finally found clear running room
nearing the sixteenth pole and showed some interest in the end. ANN OF CLEVES was situated near the back going into the far turn, roused while angling
out two furlongs from the wire to be in the five path for the finish and could not find another gear to make an impact at the line. ERASMO'S GIRL settled in
mid pack just outside travelling down the backside, was shuffled back to last when the field bunched up nearing the far turn, angled out to the six path for
the stretch finish and could not get involved late. ASTONISH was bumped by an inside rival at the start to trail after the break, circled five wide into the first
turn to clear to the lead entering the backstretch, was collared two furlongs from the finish and retreated on the fence at the furlong marker. RIDERS CLAIM
OF FOUL#1 ANNE OF CLEVES AGAINST #7 LADY MAEVE NEARING THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
FIRING BULLETS settled outside the second flight off the leading trio racing three to four wide into and on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep
commencing a rally, gained steadily despite being carried out numerous paths and just got the nose down at the wire. FEARLESS ANGEL set the pace in
about the two path with outside pressure and brief inside pressure, drifted four deep turning for home, shook clear of the outside rival in upper stretch,
continued to drift out badly thereafter despite corrections and was just nailed. NO KAY NEVER (IRE) stalked from outside four wide, lost ground on the
leaders early on the turn, shifted in late on that bend, kept on in the stretch while drifting out a bit late. HELLUVA HOLIDAY raced between rivals in the
second flight into the turn, steadied just slightly while lacking room just past the quarter pole, came out a bit at the top of the stretch then back in, ran on.
WITCH HAZEL raced at the rear early, was encouraged along by the five-sixteenths going four then five wide on the turn and coming into upper stretch
eight wide, was carried out further in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. ADORA pressed from outside three wide, was floated five wide into upper
stretch, had no extra for the drive. LOVE MY CHERYL pressed briefly inside then chased inside the second flight, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MAKES SENSE TO ME broke sharp to be in command leaving the chute, was hounded outside while setting the early fractions, fought on inside through
the lane, put away the outside pace rival in deep stretch and had enough to edge away at the finish. DREAMS AND SCHEMES had a good tracking trip just
behind the dueling leaders around the turn, angled out a touch for the drive in the four path and was gaining steadily down the lane to get up for second
right at the finish. MUSKOKA SUMMER pressed the pace outside throughout the backstretch and turn, battled with the winner the entire stretch and gave
way in the final sixteenth losing the place award right at the wire. TARA LUNA settled inside near the back at the half, switched out entering the far turn,
rallied five wide around runners at the quarter pole, closed belatedly the final eighth but needed more to threaten at the line. SILENT CREEK was away
slowly and trailed down the backstretch, was roused through the turn and showed some late interest between runners to pass tiring rivals the final furlong.
MENAGERIE tracked outside mid pack at the half mile marker, took closer order to the leaders running three wide three eighths from home, was ridden to
keep up between foes at the quarter pole and was empty down the lane. SONET'S NAME was steadied soon after the start, tracked behind the frontrunners
through the backside, was shuffled back a touch three eighths from home, had clear run at the top of the stretch and offered little for the drive. JAIMIE'S
WARRIOR tracked on the rail behind the frontrunners, waited inside on the turn, was roused on the fence two furlongs to go, offered no response and
galloped to the finish.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE HOME tracked in behind along the inside, shifted out about the five-sixteenths, was five wide turning for home and took over, drifted in just a
bit, drew away and was geared down late. LIAM'S AWESOME broke outwardly, settled well back shifting in up the backstretch, raced on or just off the rail
through the turn still with much to do, angled out three wide at the quarter pole, had plenty of room and captured the place while no match for the winner.
TACHYON SPEED was brushed lightly at the start, settled well back shifted in, raced on or just off the rail through the turn, altered out seven wide in
mid-stretch for room, rallied from between runners to get third. SHARP AZA RAINBOW settled about mid-pack shifting in, saved ground on the turn, angled
five wide at the top of the stretch, kicked on evenly. CRIMSON NIGHTS stalked four wide just off the leaders, came into upper stretch seven deep, needed
more and ran on evenly. ALL MY TOMORROWS stumbled at the start, began to advance three wide midway on the turn, swung nine wide passing rivals
into upper stretch, brushed lightly with a foe in mid-stretch and kept on. BLONDE DYNAMO was brushed and forced out at the start, pressed the pace from
outside two to three wide, drifted five wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. QUEEN GYPSY was forced out at the start, settled toward the
rear outside a foe going two to three wide on the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch then out a further path and brushed lightly with a rival, ran on.
SPIRIT BELLE pursued the leaders two to three wide, failed to rally. MYTHICAL STORM chased outside five wide through the turn, came into upper stretch
eight wide, was brushed lightly on both sides and steadied when in tight between near the furlong marker. TRICK AND TREAT broke outwardly brushing a
rival, was in pursuit up close three to four wide into the turn, came into upper stretch six deep, turned up empty. LADY GABRIELLE set a pressured pace
inside, gave way.

Footnotes
HELL N WILD tracked inside behind the pacesetters in the early stages, angled out to be four wide at the top of the stretch and was gaining resolutely the
final eighth to get up just in time in the end. HARD EDGE showed good speed to lead leaving the chute, put away the pressing pace rival in upper stretch,
braced for the closing winner at the furlong marker and battled to the line losing out right at the wire. GLORIANNIA settled outside near the back at the half,
was asked for run while angling out at the quarter pole, rallied seven deep in the stretch and showed a good turn of foot late to get up the last sixteenth for
the show award. AFLEET KATHERINE trailed in the beginning, saved ground advancing through the turn and offered a good run inside to be involved for a
small share crossing the finish. HAI BOBBI pressed the leader at the half, continued to chase the frontrunner through the turn, put in a mild bid in upper
stretch and weakened between runners at the furlong marker. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE rated mid pack with runners on either side at the half, was roused
nearing the quarter marker and finished up only evenly in the five path running to the line. VERDEJO stalked mid pack three wide into the turn, shifted out
for the drive in the six path and could not get in tough through the stretch run. NO MO LADY tracked on the rail behind the speed three furlongs from home,
was asked for run on the fence midway through the turn, no effort was given and stopped inside turning for home.

Footnotes
CAZADERO settled at the rear racing off the inside, swung widest into the stretch to be eight deep at the quarter pole, passed foes and drifted in a bit at the
furlong marker, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BOUND FOR NOWHERE stalked the pace from outside, advanced four wide on
the turn, took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was asked outside the three-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but fought on to get the nod for
second. SILENT POET pressed the pace three wide, bid leaving the turn, fought on gamely to just miss the nod for place. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) came in
after the break, tracked inside the second flight, came out four wide in upper stretch, drifted out several paths at the sixteenth pole and kept on. ROARING
FORTIES stalked three to four wide, angled six wide turning for home, was carried out late. WEDGEWOOD tracked from between runners in the second
flight, came out five wide turning for home, was carried out late. NOBLE EMOTION steadied when in tight and altered out at the nine-sixteenths, went four
then five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep and lacked the needed late kick. INTO THE SUNRISE set the early pace on or just off the
rail, came up empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
WHO'S THE STAR was away slow but got to the fence from the outside trailing the field into the first turn, was asked for run going into the far turn, split foes
while shifting out to the six path for the stretch drive and was full of run outside to get up in a well timed finish. ARTIE'S STORM tracked nicely at the half
behind the dueling frontrunners, angled off the leaders three wide midway through the turn, pounced to the lead at the top of the stretch and ran on well but
could not hold off the fast closing winner nearing the wire. WAR BOMBER (IRE) battled outside for the lead down the backstretch, put away his pace rival
entering the far turn, was headed outside at the top of the lane and fought on well to be a solid effort third at the finish. HOMBRE tracked between horses in
the second flight at the half, was ridden hard midway on the turn outside of runners to go after the leaders but could only provide an even finish and had to
settle for a small share. FROSTED OVER settled close to the back down the backstretch, was roused through the turn between rivals to get in range of the
leaders at the top of the stretch and levelled out on the fence at the furlong marker. SPECIAL FORCES was situated near the back three wide into the first
turn, tracked in the second flight outside down the backside, was asked for more run midpoint on the turn and had nothing to offer for the stretch finish. LIKE
THE KING pressed the issue on the rail from the start, began to weaken inside entering the far turn and faltered at the top of the stretch. IRWIN (IRE)
settled near the rear on the rail at the half mile marker, inched up mildly on the fence through the turn and had no finish to give down the lane.

ROUGIR (FR) raced about in the two path off the leaders early, steadied at the nine-sixteenths when a rival came out in front losing about two to three
lengths, continued three wide on that far turn, came into upper stretch five deep, moved out a bit later, had the best late stride to get up in time. MOIRA
settled tracking inside, came out at the nine-sixteenths, was four wide at the top of the stretch and looked poised to pounce but lacked room in behind
runners, dove inside near the three-sixteenths, bumping a rival in the process, bid inside late but was outfinished. FLIRTING BRIDGE (IRE) stalked three
wide early, advanced three to four wide on the far turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, kept on but was outfinished. FEV ROVER (IRE) was bumped
outward at the break, caught four wide early, took closer order four to five wide leaving the far turn, ran on evenly. ADVENTURING set the pace inside,
came off the rail leaving the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on willingly. MYLADY (GER) was forced into a rival at the start, moved forward
under some encouragement to stalk four then three wide, made a mild bid for the lead from between runners three wide on the far turn but flattened out in
the drive. HENRIETTA TOPHAM raced off the leaders three wide early, moved nearer the rail on the far turn, asked for run passing the three-eighths but
failed to rally. LEMISTA (IRE) broke outwardly bothering rivals, moved forward to stalk just off the leader two wide early, shifted nearer the hedge up the
backstretch and taken under light rating tactics, came out a bit on the far turn then angled back to the rail at the top of the stretch, was bumped and checked
near the three-sixteenths. MUNNYFOR RO lacked early speed bringing up the rear inside, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF LEMISTA (IRE) AGAINST MOIRA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
BUSHIDO broke inwards at the start but was away alertly to set the pace, as left alone up front unchallenged through the turn and was well rationed on the
lead to have enough left to hold safe at the finish. CHISELER stalked outside down the backside, rallied just outside at the quarter pole marker and closed
belatedly through the stretch to be the best of the rest at the finish. EVER A REBEL tracked inside on the rail through the turn, battled between horses in
mid stretch and was outkicked the final sixteenth for the place award. KEEN FLATTER was near the back in the beginning, trailed the field inside two
furlongs out and finished up with good energy to close in for the minors. HOUSEBUILDER settled at the back part of the field early, offered a mild rail rally
through the turn, lost his inside path at the eighth pole and could not make an impact afterwards. FIELD HOCKEY chased the leader throughout the turn,
began to falter inside at the furlong marker and had nothing left to offer in deep stretch. IMPETUOUS MOLLY trailed after the break, could not reach
contention through the turn and was a non factor.

Footnotes
SAME AGAIN DOC tracked in behind just off the rail, moved out four wide past the quarter pole, took aim in the stretch and steadily gained to get up late.
RUNNINFORCOVER stalked three wide, took closer order up the backstretch, bid three wide and took the lead at the three-sixteenths, was outfinished.
ZAFEATHER settled inside early, switched out heading up the backstretch, moved three then five wide on the far turn passing rivals quickly, continued to
gain late but needed more. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE tucked in two to three wide heading into the first turn, raced about mid-pack up the backstretch, asked for
more past the three-eighths going about three wide on the far turn, ran on evenly. AHMAS broke outwardly, settled off the pace two to three wide early,
moved out from three to five wide on the far turn, kept on in the lane. PERFECT PLAY was forced out at the break, unhurried early while angling in, saved
ground on the first turn, came out two paths in upper stretch, and kicked on willingly but needed more. BAYTOWN ELVIS stumbled at the start, saved
ground racing off the pace inside, came out a path in the stretch to pass a tiring rival but was never near enough to threaten. CONFIDENT N ELITE set the
pace initially racing off the rail then nearer the fence, faltered and faded. JMR PURE SENSATION raced off the inside and was not a factor. MORE THAN
HAPPY rated three wide and between rivals early just off the pace, faded.
