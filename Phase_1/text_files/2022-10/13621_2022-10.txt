Footnotes
BRAWNDO stalked three wide, took aim on a clear RED LABEL in upper stretch, ranged up to that tiring foe entering the final furlong, drove past him a
sixteenth from home, and drew clear. CLASSIC KING bumped with an outer rival at the start, was void early speed along the inside, tipped three wide in
upper stretch, then rallied through the final furlong to claim place late. BONUS APPRECIATION tracked in midpack four wide, chased a bidding rival through
midstretch, stayed on to bid for place along with an outer CLASSIC KING in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by that foe late. RED LABEL sparred with
an outer rival through the opening quarter mile, drew clear of that tiring foe into the turn, but hung on his left lead through upper stretch as an outer rival
gave chase, tired in the final furlong before failing to resist that rival's bid at the sixteenth pole, and faltered late. BELFAST BOY laid off of the pace in the
three to four path, and stayed on mildly without threatening. ARTHURIAN tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, turned for home two wide, but
failed to progress in upper stretch before tiring. EL FRANCO bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed two wide, and was outrun. EDITORIAL
COMMENT (ARG) vied for the lead two wide, but weakened into the turn, and stopped.

Footnotes
UPTOWN HUSTLER took a mild brush at the start, prompted the pace outside of the leader from the three path, vied around the turn, led while well in hand
entering the lane, then drew off under driving pressure. GUIDED ARROW broke inwardly while off slow, raced far back along the inside, steadied while
lacking room inside of a foe nearing the turn, managed to slip through with three furlongs remaining, gained noticeably turning for home, then sustained his
rail charge to gain place at the furlong grounds. CONSPIRACY FACT stalked behind the leaders while in the two path, tipped to the five path and outside of
those foes entering the lane, but failed to progress, then reached a tiring rival for show at the wire. NORTH BAY set the pace inside of a vying UPTOWN
HUSTLER, sparred with that foe around the turn, but failed to match strides entering the lane, weakened, and was nailed at the wire for show. PRIVATE
CONNIE was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, chased three wide and between horses, and failed to menace. PAID IN FULL bumped
an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly two wide, and tired. AZZURRO tracked four wide and made little impact. LOCO was void of speed while taking the
turn in the five path, and failed to factor. BLUNDER laid off of the pace in the three path, but lacked a rally. GRANTASTIC broke a step slowly and never got
involved. HE REIGNS came out a bit slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EXTRAVAGATE rated off of the pace along the inside, easily advanced to a stalking position entering the backstretch, swiftly bid for the lead outside of the
pace setter with five sixteenths to go, assumed command turning for home, drew off under moderate urging, and was ridden out to the wire. LIAM THE
BRAVE set the pace while tucking from the three to two path around the first turn, but proved no match for a bidding rival around the far turn, tired through
the lane, yet saved place late. PAID TWICE broke slowly while being bothered and crowded by an inner rival at the start, settled far back in the three path,
tucked and gained along the rail turning for home, tipped outside of a tiring LIAM THE BRAVE entering the lane to take aim on that foe for place, attempted
a bid in the final furlong, but hung. KING DOODLE broke on top, yet failed to sustain the fore in the opening stages, checked behind outer clearing rivals in
to the first bend, then chased from off of the pace two to three wide, and failed to factor. SPUNS SON raced far back in the two path, and passed tired rivals.
LEAD ACTOR prompted the pace along the inside, but resisted rider's restraint to back off of around the first turn, settled into a stalking position nearing the
backstretch, pursued from between horses, then tired. SCOTCH NO ROCKS prompted the pace from the three path, but weakened at the three furlong
pole. SHAKEDOWN STREET broke a beat slowly while being bumped by an inner rival at the start, was void of early speed in the five path, improved to
track the leading trio into the far turn, but tired around that bend. B G LEE stumbled outwardly at the start while breaking with the field, tracked in three to
four paths, but weekend between horses nearing the far turn, and was eased while guided out turning for home.

Footnotes
CAN'T HUSH THIS cleared off in the two path around the first turn, inched a larger margin down the backstretch to get away from chasing foes, then
sustained his advantage through the lane under driving pressure. COASTAL CHAOS stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader as that one's main
pursuer around the far turn, and was second best. SONO GRATO broke a step slowly, rated far back along the inside, improved while tipping two wide
around the far turn, and stayed on to reach show at the furlong grounds. MULBERRY STREET laid far back three to four wide, and moved up. ONE MORE
BABY was bumped by an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, improved into the far turn, but chased under urging around that
bend, and tired. WRITEITONTHEICE raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but faded turning for home. KISS PRINCIPAL tracked in midpack four
wide, moved to a stalking position down the backstretch, but weakened three wide and between horses into the far turn. MALIBU TIME broke a step slowly
and never got involved. ZIPPER ZAPPER raced in midpack three wide, and tried. PRESTONSBIRD bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide,
but weakened between horses after a half mile.

Footnotes
SCRIPT tracked in midpack along the inside, saved ground, came into the lane behind the leading trio, altered course outside of them approaching the
furlong grounds, took aim while offering a grinding charge, produced a bid in the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. BAJ stalked two wide, ranged
up to the tiring leader to bid in upper stretch along with an outer PENNER ASH (IRE), battled with that foe into the final furlong, but was outkicked by an
outer on-charging rival nearing the wire while gamely prevailing in the war for place. PENNER ASH (IRE) broke a bit outwardly at the start, stalked along the
inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, bid for the lead in upper stretch, dueled with an inner foe through the final furlong, but was bested by
his inner counterpart while getting outkicked by an outer foe nearing the wire. POLICY OPTION tossed his head while breaking slowly, trailed early on
before shifting outside of foes entering the backstretch, got mildly carried out to the six path by troubled foes entering the far turn, tucked down to the three
path around that bend, searched to tip out from behind rivals in upper stretch, shied seven wide at the furlong grounds, and moved up. TWO BIRDS set the
pace, pulled to an open margin entering the backstretch, saw that advantage narrow turning for home before meeting a pair of outer bids in upper stretch,
but was headed approaching the furlong grounds, and gave way. MASTER OF THE RING got rank into the first turn while settling off of the pace, tucked to
the two path around that bend, shifted five wide entering the lane while attempting to spark a rally, offered a grinding charge in upper stretch, but received a
solid bump from an inner CAMP DADDY nearing the furlong grounds, and flattened out. EMIRATES ROAD broke a step slowly while bumping with an outer
rival at the start, rated in the two path, trailed around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, and passed tired foes. CAMP DADDY tracked in midpack two
wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, failed to progress in upper stretch before shying from an inner foe approaching the final
furlong, which caused him to squarely bumped an outer foe nearing that juncture, and tired. MOMS MOON stumbled at the start, tucked to the rail while off
of the pace soon after, shifted to the three path around the first turn, got floated out mildly into the far turn by a pulling-up foe, then fanned seven wide
entering the lane, and made little impact. KENTUCKY MIST laid in midpack three to four wide, but floated six wide while between horses entering the lane,
and yielded. MARTINI'NMOONSHINE tracked two to three wide, but went wrong at the half mile pole, pulled up entering the far turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFULNESS vied for the lead inside of of rivals, disposed of that foe while shifting off of the rail entering the lane, which allowed for
DIAMONDSIFYOUDO to produce a rail bid in upper stretch, sustained the battled after getting headed nearing the furlong grounds, gamely battled back to
reclaim an advantage a sixteenth from home, and prevailed. DIAMONDSIFYOUDO was hustled along to an inside stalking position, remained under steady
coaxing while pursuing the top pair from the pocket around the turn, slipped inside of the pace setter in upper stretch after that foe vacated the inside,
gained a narrow advantage coming to the furlong grounds, but failed to kick on after shifting in a bit, hung while battling with her outer counterpart, and got
outfinished. THE ALYS LOOK was last away and slow into stride, trailed two wide, rallied to split foes three wide at the furlong grounds, and claimed show.
MIJA stalked two wide and between horses, but came under strong urging while failing to keep pace with the main group turning for home, sustained
chasing position along the rail thereafter, but lacked a bid. GUNS N' LILIES chased from midpack three wide under steady urging around the turn, fanned
five wide entering the lane, but lacked a true response. HARMONICA vied for the lead two wide, but yielded while getting floated three wide entering the
lane, and weakened between horses while hanging on her left lead. ROSES AND ROZAY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to
menace. HER LADYSHIP lacked speed three wide, shifted five to six wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. MISS SHIPMAN pressed three wide, but
weakened four wide entering the lane before being brushed by an inner foe at the furlong grounds. SOULTITLESREADY never got involved. TIVALI saved
ground off of the pace, but was through entering the lane, and eased.

Footnotes
FORBIDDEN SECRET set the pace in the two path, established a loose margin entering the backstretch, maintained an uncontested lead before widening
his advantage around the far turn, then held sway under driving pressure. CONFIDENCE GAME tracked in the three path, bid for place outside of TRAFFIC
MASTER in upper stretch, and gained that position late. TRAFFIC MASTER laid off of the pace along the inside, improved inside of foes to reach place
entering the far turn while not menacing the clear leader, then lost that position to an outer foe in the late stages. REDEEMER settled far back along the
inside, shifted four wide around the far turn, and stayed on. MO'S TREASURE took brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed two wide,
and failed to factor. AMERICAN BLAZE laid off of the pace four wide, but lacked a rally while yielding around the far turn. HAYES STRIKE stumbled at the
start, raced far back three wide and never got involved. NITROMAN pressed two wide, but only lasted a quarter mile, weakened entering the backstretch,
trailed by a distance around the far turn, yet surpassed easing rivals in the lane. BOURBON SPIRIT broke a step slowly while leaning in a bit, tracked in the
two path, but was shuffled behind a tiring NITROMAN at the three quarter pole, then steadied while faltering among rivals turning for home, and was eased
through the lane. ZAICI stalked in the four path, tucked to the two path down the backstretch, but wilted around the far turn, and was also eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
BAY STREET MONEY laid close up two wide, stalked, bid in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong grounds, drove clear at that juncture, and lasted
from an outer rival late. REWARD NIGHT stalked along the inside, tipped four wide in upper stretch, grinded away on his left lead, changed over while
taking aim on the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, ranged up late, but did not have enough to reel him in. AXTHELM tracked two to three wide,
ranged up turning for home outside of the eventual winner, but only managed to chase that foe through the lane, got outkicked by an outer foe for place at
the sixteenth pole, tired, but saved show. COLERIDGE broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, tipped out entering the lane, then to the five path in
upper stretch, and stayed on. RHETORIC vied along the inside of a rival, but failed to keep pace approaching the far turn, got outmoved by outer foes while
chasing turning for home, then kept on. WAKE SURF vied three wide, before clearing with a half mile remaining, but was headed by the eventual winner in
upper stretch, and faltered in the final sixteenth. GREATHEART laid far back in the two path and failed to factor. WATCH THE MUSIC laid off of the pace
three wide, came into the lane four wide, but tired. LEGIONNAIRE broke slowly, raced at the rear in the three path, failed to rally in the four path around the
far turn before fanning six wide entering the lane, and was no menace. JR'S GIFT laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted outside of foes down the
backstretch, but was floated four to five wide while yielding around the far turn. BRITAIN'S KITTEN tracked in midpack two wide, but weakened among foes
turning for home. COOL RAGS raced at the rear along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but was outrun.
