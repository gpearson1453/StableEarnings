QUICK TO ACCUSE was away alertly from the inside post, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the
turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, drew off under a strong hand-ride to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best.
ATLANTA'S ACUNA bobbled just after the start then bumped lightly with a foe, moved up then pressed the early pace under a snug hold, stalked outside
starting about six furlongs from the finish, was asked in the two to three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, remained on his inside
lead until near the furlong marker and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MR. MARLIN was forwardly placed on the outside, angled in
outside the half-mile pole, raced in the two path early on the turn, bumped lightly with FLASHY ALEX while shifting three wide around the three-eighths,
moved out under a drive in upper stretch and weakened while just able to get the show. FLASHY ALEX tracked the pace on the inside of an opponent,
chased in the four path on the turn, bumped lightly with a foe near the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired then just missed the
show. CHULLIGAN bumped lightly with a foe shortly after the start, settled towards the back, moved closer under urging with a half-mile to run, saved
ground around the turn and faltered. DROMOLAND bumped lightly with foes on both sides just after the start then was taken up, raced awkwardly and
greenly while tossing his head some at the rear, moved to the outside of the field outside the five-eighths, dropped back in near the nine-sixteenths, rounded
the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
SUNDAESWITHSANDY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in aim of the leader, advanced on that rival half a mile from home and took over
command with three furlongs to run, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
holding sway through the final furlong kept to task to prevail. TIMBUKTU coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. MILANO four paths off the inside near the rear of the
field down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and commenced a prolonged bid
steadily gaining ground through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and continued to steadily close outside through to the finish to procure the show
honors while well clear and best of the rest. EAGLE IN LOVE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GINNSU WARRIOR broke inwards hitting
the near side stall at the start, chased three then two wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and faded through the turn,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. SEBARAY coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under challenge
from SUNDAESWITHSANDY to the outside and was displaced from command when under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the stretch. DREAM OF A DAY coaxed from the gate, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighth, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

SIR JOHN broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a foe, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while saving ground on the turn, shifted over
heels into the two path into upper stretch, made a bid between foes at the three-sixteenths, battled inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and got up
under strong urging. BERT BERT BERT brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, chased four wide for most of the turn then dropped to the
three path, gained to take the advantage into upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. CENTRAL PRIDE hit the
outside of the gate at the start, settled at the rear, was roused while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch
and finished willingly for the show. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS bobbled at the start then brushed with an opponent, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in
the two path around the turn and tired. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE was urged to the front, showed the way under some pressure, vied inside on the turn,
was roused at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch and gave way. MAGIC TRUCK lost his footing at the start and was
last to commence, moved up under urging then was taken under a tight hold, came under urging in the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch
and had nothing left. KIYOMORI brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
RECKLESS SPIRIT bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the three
path, was roused five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to get the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under good handling. ROYAL SPIRIT
bumped with a foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, cut the corner while asked into the stretch, made a rail bid at the
three-sixteenths, battled inside of three foes into the final furlong, came out a path in the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the place.
WAR STRATEGY traveled around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path on the far turn, took the
lead near the quarter-pole, fought on well between foes in the final furlong, bumped with DIGITAL SOFTWARE late and just missed the place while narrowly
able to get the show. DIGITAL SOFTWARE went around the first turn in the three path, was rated on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the far turn,
was given his cue while making a bid at the quarter-pole, fought outside of three foes into the final sixteenth, bumped with WAR STRATEGY while being
out-kicked by the winner late and just missed the trifecta. VOLIERO was taken in hand early, tucked into the two path around the opening bend, was
reserved off the pace, navigated the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and lacked the
needed kick. RALLY SQUIRREL was hustled to the front, raced inside around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two
path on the far turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole, fought on between foes into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened.
SELL SOMETHING went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed
to rally. HARD RYE GUY lagged at the rear while saving ground, shifted three wide under urging late on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was
no factor. TOPIC CHANGER angled in early, settled on the inside, was roused near the quarter-pole and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BABY YODA vied from the two path between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and taking over sole command five-sixteenths from home,
continued in the two path into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was under light hand urging in the final sixteenth to the wire. BOURBON CALLING
vied three wide outside a pair coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on clear of the rest to secure the place honors. MARKET ALERT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled three
to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to secure the show honors. KING KUMBALAY chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. FIRE SWORD lost his rear footing
at the start getting away last and recovered inwards under coaxing, advanced after the start to vie inside a pair while along the inside down the backstretch
and through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY settled comfortably on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied in the five path into the
stretch, gained the lead at the three-sixteenths, responded well when challenged by the runner-up in the final furlong, drifted out late and held gamely under
strong urging. CLASSIC LYNNE bobbled at the start then was taken up, raced well off the pace under urging, traveled around the turn in the two path,
swung out while gaining into upper stretch, chased the winner past the eighth-pole, made a bid in the final furlong but was denied while well clear for the
place. FAST COREY set the pace under pressure to her outside while in hand, went around the turn in the two path, was asked inside the quarter-pole then
lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. UNION DOLLY was corrected with the
left-rein at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. PROPER GRAMMAR
was carried in early, established a good position down the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths, floated
five wide into the stretch and came up empty. LEMON TAFFY reared at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the
outside, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. QUICK POWER NAP was taken up with a tug of the left-rein shortly after the start, saved ground at
the rear and failed to threaten.
