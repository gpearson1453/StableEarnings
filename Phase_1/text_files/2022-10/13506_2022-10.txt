Footnotes
VALIANT GABE stalked the pace, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced three wide around the far turn finished well to prove best under strong
handling. PRESSING CONCERN pressed the early pace, raced four deep past the quarter pole, raced from the outside of Valiant Gabe and finished gamely
to the wire. GREGORIA'S BAY was off slowly, chased the early pace, raced from the outside in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. DIAMANTE
DE ORO was slow early on, raced along the inside around the far turn, continued a rail bid in the stretch run and moved up to improve position.
ALIGNMENT was off slowly, dropped back early to race well off the early going, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. I'M SO
EXTRA showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way. EPIC STARTER was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a
bid.

BAYOU MELODY off the early pace and along the inside, shifted out four wide around the turn, went to the attack from the five path at the top of the stretch,
stayed middle of the lane gaining ground, went clear under a steady drive. JALEBI BABY sent away from the gate, found the inside position and the lead
into the turn, came under heavy outside pressure nearing the quarter pole, stayed on strong late, desperately holding onto the place money. BEARGREASE
four wide and tracking into the turn, stayed out for clear run leaving the quarter pole, under an all out drive, just missed the place money late. NOBODY'S
SECRET coaxed up between runners soon after the start, felt pressure nearing the quarter pole, could not quicken with top runners, stayed even through
the wire. SUZY Q THE QUEEN off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, stayed along the inside through the stretch, finished evenly late. TWIN
BRIDGES nice clean start, moved up between runners, shuffled back off the speed, had no late kick. BEAUTY N BRAINS clean break, raced four path
around the turn, moved out five wide top of the lane, no late bid. WILLOW DRIVE slow into stride, moved up in the three path, no threat late. CALL THE PO

Footnotes
QUANTICO CREEK dueled along the inside, lost ground from the inside leaving the three eights pole, regrouped nearing the quarter pole, fended off the
outside challenger while drifting out nearing the furlong marker, under an all out drive got the nod under the wire. JESSICA'S RACE tracked early on, found
nice clean pocket into the turn, shifted well wide while making up ground around the turn, drew even with leader nearing the furlong marker, fought on hard
through the wire. ITSY BITSY IZZIE raced off the pace and between rivals early on, stayed along the inside for the stretch drive, finished with good energy
late. LINAHASPECSHOES raced along the inside, and off the pace, split foes while gaining ground nearing the quarter pole, raced outside through the lane,
finished even late. GOLDEN HEART tracked from the three path early on, moved up while five deep at the quarter pole, no late kick through the lane. I
GOTTA BOLT raced along the inside, stayed off the pace and towards the rail into the turn, moved up quarter, three path stretch, no late gain. REBEL
CONSORT dueled between runners into the turn, locked in between runners around the turn, faded in the stretch. WILLFUL DESIRE outside in the early
duel, stayed committed to the the duel from the outside, pressured leaving the quarter pole, faded lane. SISTER SPIRIT lacked early speed, three path into
turn, outrun. JIMMYDABOOK broke inward, veered off rail soon after start, never a threat.

Footnotes
TOUGH TICKETS rated along the inside down the backstretch, angled outside to race from the outside of Visual Artist and edged clear late under all out
pressure. VISUAL ARTIST tracked Morning March from the outside down the backstretch, took command near the three eighths pole, dug in near the eighth
pole and finished gamely to the wire. ARTISTIC REASON was allowed to settle early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire.
TAPPIN FOR GLORY was slow early on, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. JOE PHILLIPS was unhurried early
on, raced near the inside nearing the three eighths pole, checked just past the five sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. MORNING MARCH was
quick to begin to set the pace from the outside and gave way the final quarter of a mile. TRULULU broke in, bumped with rival at the start, stalked the pace
from the outside of foes and faded. C MY MEISTER dropped back early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and never threatened. CRAFTY DADDY
was bumped at the start, raced mid pack early, lost ground and never menaced.
