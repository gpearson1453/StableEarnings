Footnotes
SAMARITA tracked the leading pair two wide, tipped three wide past the three eighths, turned for home three wide in range, vied through midstretch,
wrested the lead near the sixteenth and edged clear. FIELD DAISEY tracked the leading pair inside, chased in the two path on the turn, raced behind the
leading line into upper stretch, altered out past the three sixteenths for room, responded with a rally, finished well despite drifting out and got up for place
late. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN was keen to prompt the pace outside of SNOOTY, dueled outside that foe around the turn and between horses into upper
stretch, inherited the lead near the three sixteenths when SNOOTY emptied out, vied with SAMARITA past midstretch, proved no match for that foe from the
sixteenth, flattened, and lost place late. CAIRO SUMMER settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch and
offered no kick. SNOOTY was anxious in the gate, was sent to the lead and set the pace early while pressured by GHAALEB'S DOMAIN, dueled inside that
foe around the turn and to the head of the stretch, emptied out approaching the three sixteenths and weakened inside.

Footnotes
MY BROTHER CAM was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, shook clear entering
the second bend, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN tracked off the first
flight along the inside to the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the second bend, tipped out nearing upper stretch, split foes midstretch and
prevailed for the place honors late. FORWARD CURVE, in touch prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, weakened racing three deep into
the lane. KEEP ATTACKING was rated outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn, angled inside nearing
upper stretch to bid inside foes but lacked the needed late kick. ANGEL'S MAGIC, caught four deep racing into the first turn, was prompted to terms with the
leaders on the backstretch, lodged a brief, three wide bid nearing the far turn but came up empty in the drive. WELLER ROGUE settled outside foes in the
last flight to the backstretch and never gained contention. CHEEKERS, urged to contend three deep while drifting out a bit racing into the first turn, faded
after a half. KANITHAPPEN, caught five wide racing into the first turn, never gained contention. DASTARDLY DEEDS settled last while angling inside racing
to the first turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
RIVZONAROLL broke very sharply, was prompted by RUN THE TABLE early, cleared into the turn, set the pace in the two path, was briefly challenged by
FEVER NATION in upper stretch but shook him off past the three sixteenths when hand ridden, was shown the crop midstretch but drew off under a hand
ride. FEVER NATION veered in sharply in the opening strides, was asked for position and advanced to track the leading pair along the rail, chased the
leading pair along the rail, angled out in upper stretch and briefly loomed outside of RIVZONAROLL, was no match for that foe past the three sixteenths, but
chased on safe for the place. HIGHLY PERFECT broke inward, chased well behind the leading trio while racing greenly early, raced in the four to five path
on the turn, swung out into the lane in the seven path, and chased on with interest to prove best of the rest. WICKED SKY settled near the rear, raced in the
two path on the turn, came into the lane in the three path and lacked the needed rally. RUN THE TABLE prompted outside of RIVZONAROLL early, tracked
that leader in the three path on the turn, began to flatten out approaching the quarter pole, weakened in the lane and drifted out late. HOT N FRESH soon
trailed, raced at the rear in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
MYSTIC STORM tracked just off the leaders along the inside through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out three wide midstretch and continued with a
steady effort to gain the advantage and go clear under pressure. BLOCKS OF MAGIC was settled off the second flight along the inside racing through the
backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. BROKEN HEARTS BAY
broke slowly, was prompted to regain some position outside foes in the opening quarter, angled inside nearing upper stretch continuing to advance, shifted
out four wide in late stages and edged rivals for a share. SONG OF AMERICA sped to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command
inside a rival into the stretch and weakened leaving midstretch. WILMA MANKILLER, in touch attending a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the
issue on the turn into upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage nearing midstretch but weakened late. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight racing into the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick. JOYZELLA settled last early and passed only tiring rivals.
MISS MIA tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. LIL CARRIE D settled off the second flight racing
to the turn but offered no rally. CANDY LOOKER, slow to gather stride, angled inwards racing into the turn but offered no rally. AIR GERRI tracked the
leaders three wide between foes in second flight racing into the bend and faded into upper stretch. KOOKYBERRY dropped out early.

lead past the furlong mark and cleared. SUN SQUALL chased inside down the back straight and around the bend, was pushed along and made a rail rally
into the lane, led midstretch, was outkicked by TWIRLING ROSES into the final furlong but kept on to hold the place narrowly. ROMAN PHAROAH pressed
the pace outside of TIZ APPROVED early, tracked him from near the five eighths, reengaged him in the four path on the turn, vied from the three eighths
into the lane, was outkicked by TWIRLING ROSES into the final furlong, kept on between horses but missed the place. JACK'S ADVANTAGE chased four
deep early, advanced in the four path on the turn to track the leading pair outside of TWIRLING ROSES, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, chased
on, showed good late interest but narrowly missed the place. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY was bumped by KREWE CHIEF in the opening strides, chased three
wide early and in the five path on the turn, swung eight wide into the lane but pursued only evenly. TIZ APPROVED set a pressured pace early, inched clear
near the five eighths, was engaged again by ROMAN PHAROAH into the turn, vied inside that foe while racing in the three path, continued to vie for the
pace to midstretch, but was no match for TWIRLING ROSES past the furlong mark and flattened out between horses. WILD FOX settled at the rear, raced
in the six path on the turn, swung out toward the center of the track into the lane and took mildly closer order. KREWE CHIEF broke out, chased near the
rear between horses down the back straight, was pushed along in the three to four path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch but flattened out.

ON A TOUR, pulling a bit along the inside while rated just off the leaders to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the far turn, was prompted to
advance in that path through the second bend, was fanned four wide midstretch challenging for command and narrowly prevailed at the wire under firm right
handed encouragement. INDICIA settled last racing to the backstretch while angling to the inside, saved ground while being prompted to advance racing
through the far turn, bid for command along the rail when presented an opening nearing midstretch and was just outkicked. UPTOWN QUEEN dictated the
pace while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, conceded the lead entering the backstretch, switched outside the leader to press the issue into the
far turn, vied between foes while shifting to the three path racing through the stretch striking the front between calls but yielded to the top pair nearing the
wire. SEAWARD was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, took over after three furlongs while shifting to the inside, dueled for
command inside rivals while shifting a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch and weakened between foes nearing the wire. SHABAM was rated off the
second flight racing three, then four wide to the backstretch, shifted in to make some brief progress between foes racing into the far turn but quickly came up
empty in the drive. LEA RO tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide nearing the far turn and quickly came up
empty.

Footnotes
TEST PILOT was placed on the lead, saved ground around the far turn, was engaged by MR. SOLO past the three eighths, shook that foe off when shaken
up in upper stretch, opened up, and continued to edge further clear late while kept to task. MR. SOLO tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn,
continued to track two wide down the back straight, bid two wide on the far turn and loomed outside of TEST PILOT past the three eighths, was outkicked by
that foe into upper stretch, drifted out in the lane but chased on well enough to hold the place. BAYOU BENNY chased inside through the clubhouse turn,
chased at the rear of the main group down the backstretch, continued patiently near the rear into the far turn, began to rally in the four to five path near the
seven sixteenths, raced four wide into the lane, chased on under a drive while drifting out and missed the place. BLAZEN ROAD tracked the leading pair
along the rail, bid up the fence into the lane, proved no match for TEST PILOT from upper stretch, and flattened late. PATH TO SUCCESS chased three
wide around the clubhouse turn, inched forward in tandem with RONSTADT into the back straight to join the tracking flight three wide, tracked the leader in
the three to four path around the far turn, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. COWBOYS DREAM settled inside of CARTIER CAT in the rear flight,
saved ground around the far turn, lacked the needed rally in the lane but passed a tiring horse late. RONSTADT chased between horses around the
clubhouse turn, inched forward into the back straight in tandem with PATH TO SUCCESS to track between horses, was pushed along in the two path on the
far turn and weakened between horses in the lane. CARTIER CAT raced two wide in the rear flight, was urged into the second turn, offered no response
while still two wide around that bend and had no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
PISTOL BOX tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight racing into the first turn, was eased back from that position nearing the midway point of the
backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting off the inside racing into the far turn, swung six wide racing through upper stretch, then rallied to the front in
that path to go clear in time under firm left handed encouragement. DR. FORMAN tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch,
advanced on the leaders four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide midstretch challenging for command to strike the front but couldn't fend off the
winner. KRAMDEN was roused to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, dueled for
command past midstretch but was collared nearing the sixteenth marker. THE LAST OPTION tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was urged
to challenge three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. PROMISING SHOES tracked off the second flight three wide between foes
to the far turn, then continued evenly between rivals in that path to gain some position late. SHWEET PERSUASION, pulling along the inside disputing the
pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch shifting a bit off the rail and gave out late. FEELING DANGEROUS was rated off
the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn, then continued between foes into the stretch but had no rally. ALLEN,
caught five wide racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. MANGO TREE was rated off the second flight in the three path to the backstretch,
angled to the rail nearing upper sretch while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. CHRISTIAN C settled last to the backstretch, advanced
along the rail into the stretch, shifted out three wide midstretch while racing in close quarters exchanging contact with BULLDOG OF BERGEN and was
taken up in the final sixteenth. BULLDOG OF BERGEN angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, was bumped while
racing in tight quarters between foes leaving midstretch and was steadied late while losing all momentum.
