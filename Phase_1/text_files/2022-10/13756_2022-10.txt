Footnotes
CORA PEARL challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and was all out, holding off TRIPLE L'S CUTTER, who was coming
up the rail. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER pressed the pace, racing in the middle of the field, made a late rail bid and was gaining on the winner. BANK ON IT
unhurried in the beginning, racing in the middle of the pack, came around the turn on the outside, made a late bid and finished willingly. YOU HAVE NO
IDEA showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. EARLY DAWN broke sharp, dueled for the lead and weakened. MEGANS
MILLIONS broke a step slow, racing in the rear, improved position, but was no factor. SKY TIZZY raced evenly near the back and showed little. PAYNT
THE MOON broke a step slow and was never a threat. CORONA DEL MAR pressed the pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
OUR LITTLE GIRL lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane, dueled deep in the stretch and prevailed for the
win. CATCAKE raced near the back in the early part, made a steady gain, came around the second turn on the inside, angled out down the stretch, rallied,
dueled late and was outfinished for the win. ISOLATION pressed the pace, came around the second turn on the outside, made a bid, took the lead, but
proved no match for the top two late. GEORGIA DAWN vied for the early lead, saved ground and faded. ANGELA'S CELERITY showed early speed and
couldn't keep up late. FINNLEYS ENCORE dueled on the front end and made a steady retreat. G'S DEADLINE pressed the early pace, raced outside
around the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
FLASHY BOY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, was in hand late and won handily. HOLY BAYOU raced within striking distance, came around
the turn on the outside, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. COUNTRY CAT JAKE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and proved no match for the top two. ELUSIVEDESTINATION raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide
bid and put forth an even effort. SERRANO'S WARRIOR pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. EASY EDDIE A void of early
speed, improved position, but was no threat. CUSTOM TAT always raced near the back and showed little. ADDISONS WARRIOR raced near the middle of
the pack in the beginning and faded. STARPORT lacked early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
BOURBON ST TAPPIN unhurried in the beginning, racing near the back, saved ground around the second turn, drove clear and won under steady urging,
holding off a late challenge by TIN DELAY for the win. TIN DELAY void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide gain
and finished willingly. MY BOOK raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top
two. OAK HILL SOLUTION vied for the early lead, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. COUNTERFEIT raced in the middle of the field and
put forth an even effort. BAND BOSS lacked early speed, had a wide trip, moved up, but was no factor. JOEBOY pressed the early pace and faded. BAYOU
SARGE raced within contention in the early going and dropped back. SLOW challenged for the early advantage and dropped to the rear.

part, racing near the back, came around the final turn wide, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ROCK ON COWBOY raced
in the middle of the field, made a bid around the final turn and was outfinished for second. WAR ROGUE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
weakened. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. GRAND PRADO pressed the early pace, saved ground around the
second turn and made a steady retreat. GRAND PRIORITY always raced near the back and showed little. CROCODILE JACQUES pressed the early pace,
racing wide around the first turn and dropped to the rear.

Footnotes
LODE OF BLARNEY unhurried in the beginning, racing near the back, moved up on the inside around the turn, got through on the rail and was just up. MR.
PRODUCTION raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid and was outfinished for the win. SHIFTY HENRY raced
within contention, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a late kick and proved third best. OVERDELIVER void of early speed, made a wide late gain, but was
no factor. CREATIVE LETTERS was hard to load, raced near the back, moved up, but was no threat. CARBON STRYKER raced within contention and
faded. CREEKMORE raced evenly near the back and was never close. LET IT B shot to the front, drove clear and dropped back. TALE OF A STORM raced
in the middle of the field and retreated.
