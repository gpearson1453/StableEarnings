Footnotes
VANCOUVER'S HUNTER away well and tracked the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his
position in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and was up in the
closing strides to get up in the final strides to prevail. LIZZIES GIRL broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the stretch
the first time, set a pressured pace from just off the rail in the run down the backside, shook clear of her pace rival leaving the final turn, but was unable to
fend off a late surge by VANCOUVER'S HUNTER in the closing strides in a game effort. EYE BE SEEING YOU unhurried early while dropping back to trail
in the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and
closed six wide in deep stretch to get up for a share in the closing strides. DONE THAT settled off the contested early pace while saving ground along the
inside entering the stretch the first time, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive in an even effort. ACCEPT NO
OTHER away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of LIZZIES GIRL entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival
in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CAROLINA GENT stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to get up in the final strides. UNBROKEN
away alertly and tracked the leader from along the inside through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, assumed
control leaving the turn and held a clear advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. SOMTHING ELUSIVE unhurried early while trailing the field into the
stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack through the second turn, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and
finished two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. EASTERS MEMORY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and into the backstretch, was unable to match strides with UNBROKEN leaving the final
turn, and faded in the late stages. I GOT VISION settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the first time, was always well
back and failed to make an impact. BECKAS BOY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, struggled to
keep pace with the field in the run down the backside, and had nothing to offer late.

GREYTOGO broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final
turn, collared the leader soon after straightening for home, and quickly assumed command and inched clear under confident handling. TEXAS LEGACY
away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of SHOWMAN entering the first turn, continued to force the issue three wide in the run down the
backside, took control from her pace rival leaving the turn, but was unable to fend off GREYTOGO late while proving second best. ABRIERWIN stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive
to get up for a share. BARBERRY BANDIT stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late when called upon. SHOWMAN away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and faded in the late going. DEANARROW
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

QUAGMIRE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and held off a resilient RING OF KERRY in the drive to prove best. RING OF
KERRY dueled for the lead from the outside of QUAGMIRE entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the lane, but battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive
in a solid effort. ADITYA away well and settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the
final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. PADDY D'ORO away alertly and stalked the contested early pace while
racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. WISE MARKET
tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, began to struggle to hold his
position leaving the turn, and needed more late. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME was off to an awkward start, and settled well off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. AVE'S IN
COMMAND stalked the leaders into the first turn while racing just out from the rail, began to drop back soon after entering the backstretch, and had nothing
to offer late.

turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to be up in time. CALAMAZEUS settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run five wide in the drive to get up for the place in the
closing strides. IT'S IN COMMAND raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside,
maintained a clear lead into the final turn, but was outfinished late while holding on for a share. BETTIN' MAN broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground along the inside, began to drop back while racing two wide through the final turn, but finished with renewed interest three
wide in the drive. MARTELLO stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
and finished evenly four wide in the stretch drive. REPRIMAND away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
