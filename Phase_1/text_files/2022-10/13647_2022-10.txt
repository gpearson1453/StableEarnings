Footnotes
CHILD MEMORIES chased in the two path, ranged up under rousing to bid from the seven path into the lane, and rallied to get up late. AWESOME
IDENTITY tracked in the two path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and ran on for place. NO WASABI FOR ME trailed from the four path early,
swung out to the eight path into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. ME OH MY OH stalked in the five path, was driven from the six path into
the stretch, and stayed on. SECRET TEMPTATION tracked from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, but finished evenly. BROWSING prompted the pace
in the four path, but gradually faded around the turn. BREAKING BULLET led from the two path, was roused from three path into the lane, but yielded.
COZY rated in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
WINTER'S GHOST settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and
drove clear. STORMY VICTORY stalked the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was second best late.
MILLENNIUM CONDO dueled two wide between foes to midstretch and weakened. GO HOME HAPPY failed to menace while racing two wide. FIRST
TEAM chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. TACTICAL CHEECH played no factor while racing four wide. BROADWAY RUCKUS raced
off the pace two and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. CHEF MENTEUR dueled between rivals down the backstretch,
angled to the rail entering the turn and retreated after a half. MY BROTHER MIKE had his head turned at the start, saved ground and made little impact.
THREE CENTS had only brief speed inside.

MOMZA prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed to make a bid into the far turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, and drew clear. CASH CALL
KITTEN trailed from the three path, was driven from the four path into the lane, and rallied late for place. PRINCE MAIOR set the pace in the two path, was
urged from the four path into the stretch, but yielded late for show. OFFICER COUNTRY tracked from the three path, was ridden from the seven path into
the stretch, but finished evenly. SUN VIKING stalked from inside but faded starting around the far turn.

Footnotes
BISSET stalked the pace in the three path while under a drive around the turn, steadily gained through the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead. IMONRA raced in range four wide and rallied for the place. LOVE RHAPSODY set the pace in the two path, was collared near the sixteenth
pole and weakened. APPEAR raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. ADELIESE'S SMILE hit the starting gate, causing the rider to lose
the left iron for several strides, raced five wide and never threatened. THE MONEY MACHINE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. BALI
BALLERINA was outrun while racing three wide.

JAZZY T settled off the early pace inside, circled four wide around the far turn, took over in midstretch, dueled outside of FLYING BLACK through the final
furlong and prevailed. FLYING BLACK stalked the pace in the two path, tipped three wide turning for home, bid between foes in midstretch, battled on inside
of the winner and was narrowly outfinished. NANA FANNY tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole, battled past the
eighth pole but was no match for the top two in the final furlong. MARIA'S REVENGE stalked the pace four wide around the first turn, bid two deep entering
the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of foes from there to the eighth pole then weakened. VIGIL ANNA broke outwardly, sped
to the front, set the pace in the two path and retreated nearing the five-sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
PRETTYKEEN stalked in the two path, was cued from inside around the far turn, shifted out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up
late. REACHING STRIDE tracked inside, was cued while shifting out to bid from the four path around the far turn, led into the final furlong, but was caught
late to place. SPIRIT OF POWER raced from wellback in the two path, was roused from the seven path into the lane, and kept on for show. INES'S HATS
set the pace inside, was coaxed from the two path into the lane, but yielded late. MARILYN prompted the pace from the three path but faded in the stretch.
GIRLY THE BUTCHER trailed from three wide and was never a menace. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA rated from the four path but was empty going into the
stretch.
