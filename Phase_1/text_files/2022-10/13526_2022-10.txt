Footnotes
PHAROAHS BABY GYAL , two wide around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted in about sixty yards from the finish and lasted under urging. MO
MARTHA , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, moved to the inner rail in upper stretch and was forced to steady on the heels of the winner
approaching the finish. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA lacked speed, circled the turn three wide and closed. WISE AND ELEGANT showed speed along the inner
rail, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. REVEILLE SONG lacked speed, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. WARWICK RIVER
dropped back early. An objection by the rider of MO MARTHA against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch drive but no action was taken.

Footnotes
APPALACHIANHEIGHTS , confidently rated while saving ground and tracking the pace, eased out soon into the lane, bid between rivals past the three
sixteenths, secured command with a furlong to go, went clear, switched over to her corrected lead and held firm under a drive. LIGHTFOOT MISS broke
sharply and led off the inside through the opening quarter mile, was content to be rated back off RAVENEL leaving the three quarter pole and stalked, rebid
four wide outside rivals soon into the lane, was floated out a bit while battling past the three sixteenths, kept on with good energy and saved the place. ALL
ABOUT KATHERN saved ground while within range early on, dropped back leaving the far turn, was under a hustling ride towards the rail entering the lane
and came back willingly. RAVENEL pulled her way forward outside rivals to take over past the three quarter pole, went clear and set the pace two wide,
drifted out when under pressure past the quarter pole, straightened and fought on to mid stretch then weakened very late. LIFE IN FLASH brushed at the
break, lagged off the early pace, saved ground into the lane and had a mild kick. LETMESLIDEBYYOU , off the pace, raced two wide into the stretch but
lacked a serious response. POSTINO'S CHAMPION , in the clear leaving the far turn, was under a hearty ride past mid turn, came four wide for the drive
and faded. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL broke outward and brushed with a rivals, edged up between rivals to gain a forward spot, pursued three wide into the
lane and faltered.

and inside a rival early on, angled out leaving the far turn, gathered steam under pressure and circled four wide into the lane, straightened away and
finished with good energy to nab the place. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY took command outside GOLDENIZE mid way around the first turn then clear, set the
pace two wide, was pressured from both sides leaving the five eighths, battled inside the winner from the half mile pole past the five sixteenths, stayed on to
chase that one from the quarter pole, shifted out inside the final sixteenth and kept on with good effort. GOLDENIZE had speed then rated back off the
winner while saving ground, pulled his way forward to threaten nearing the five eighths, had to steadied along in tight quarters for nearly a sixteenth of a
mile, angled out and came back three wide outside foes near the five sixteenths, forced the issue to mid stretch then faded. ONE TEN was steadied off foes
early, dropped back while saving ground into the far turn, swung out and circled into the lane and came back on. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS broke a step
slow, raced wide into the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and into the lane, moved up a bit nearing mid stretch, angled out and flattened out.
TRASH TALKIN LARRY , four wide early, angled in some to stalk, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and gave way. BADGER TOOTH , between foes
early, raced wide nearing the far turn and gave way.

hand ridden through the final fifty yards. GIVE IT A GO , off the pace and three deep into the far turn, moved up three wide past the five sixteenths, drifted in
some while splitting rivals leaving the three sixteenths and rallied to gain the place. DISPUTED NOTION , in close soon after the break, was taken in hand
soon after, crept closer off the rail then worked between foes nearing the quarter pole, angled about six wide for the drive and churned on. BROWN
DELIVERS , three deep with the pace near the five eighths, sparred outside the winner from the far turn to the quarter pole, failed to match strides soon into
the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. I'M NOT SLOW , three deep with chase past the half mile marker, eased out four to five wide
for the drive but needed more. BET ON BITZ , between rivals near the half, gave hard chase to the inside of a rival mid turn, came three wide for the drive
and came up empty. MANKLIN CREEK lacked speed, came wide for the drive and was not a threat. SWEET ASTA , four wide advancing past the five
sixteenths, was fanned seven wide into the stretch and faded. UNCOMMON VALOR saved ground into the lane, angled out near mid stretch but lacked a
solid kick. SCINTILLIO vied inside foes early, rated back off the leaders past the five eighths, retreated some mid turn, stayed inside into the lane then had
to check sharply when put in tight leaving the three sixteenths. SIMILAR TASTE , urged along while saving ground, faded.

ACADIAN GIRL made the early lead, saved ground around the turn, remained well clear through the stretch and was kept to her business in the drive.
UTTERLY COURAGEOUS hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and offered a nice rally. WITTY BANTER
lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and flattened out. EVANGELINE ALLONS , three wide chasing the pace
around the turn, faltered entering the stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
SOFIA'S SECRET , three deep attending the pace under some rating, came under a ride past the five sixteenths, emerged in a battle outside GLOWSITY
soon into the lane, carried that fight under strong handling to the sixteenth pole, wrested command late and edged clear at the wire. GLOWSITY disputed
the pace inside a pair of rivals through the opening five and a half furlongs, clung to a short advantage past mid stretch, ceded command inside the
sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. MAVILUS leaned in a bit at the break and bumped with a rival, rated in range of the contested pace while about
three wide, eased out to work between runners heading to mid stretch then kept on with effort to slowly bridge the gap. PURRFECT edged up inside runners
leaving the chute and gained a forward position, was under asking when retreating a bit mid turn, stayed inside for the drive and continued with effort though
never really threatening. PEACHY WEACHY , between horses while within striking distance through the opening five furlongs, swung out for the drive but
lacked a serious kick. DOTADA , well back leaving the far turn, raced two wide into the lane but lacked a bid. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , rank at the break,
regrouped and sparred between runners, stayed on to the head of the lane, wandered outward a bit and gave way. CHARMING WAY , bumped and in tight
at the break, recovered and edged up four wide outside rivals, loomed tracking the trio of leaders mid turn, failed to kick on entering the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
SMART EULEE broke alertly but drifted out a bit, showed speed along the inner rail, was patiently handled behind THUNDER BOSS around the turn, eased
outside that one approaching the stretch, secured command near the three sixteenths pole and drove clear. THUNDER BOSS sprinted clear leaving the
backstretch, moved to the inner rail entering the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and held the place. LADRO DI FICHI bumped with POET IN MY
HEART leaving the starting gate, was pinched back soon after the break, raced on her left lead in the drive and rallied along the inner rail. TAP N GLO , in
close quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn, was five deep turning for home and flattened out. POET IN MY HEART bumped with LADRO DI
FICHI at the start, chased the pace between horses around the turn, moved to the four path entering the stretch and weakened. MISTY'S LASS , three wide
chasing the pace on the turn, gave way. I CAN DO IT was outrun. HOLY DELITE , a forward factor in the three path on the turn, gave way.
TWENTYFORKARATROSE was not a factor.
