CRUMLIN BIRD stalked the early leaders, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. BETTABE SWIFT settled off
the pace, closed the gap on the turn and was up for place. PENNIESFROMABOVE was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. CHANCEWORTHTAKING set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. CHALDEA was
away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

touch, hustled along on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. NEW YORK MINT was off the pace, had a mild gain on
the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch passed foes. MOKSGMOL tracked the leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. MS. P'S BELLA was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. PIERIAN

MIA'S MAJESTY showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held sway. WAR DOCTOR
was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. NO MORE was in touch and raced evenly on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. RED BARI stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but weakened
through the stretch. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS was well back and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

AWESOME STREET was well back, gained ground on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was much the best. NADIABIZNIZ was
away alertly, moved up on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DONNARUMMA was in range and a factor on the
far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. SEAQUELLE tracked the early leaders and had the lead on the far turn but had
nothing left. SMART IRENE was in range and had a good position on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more.
DREAMINGOF JEANNIE was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from the nine path at the top of the stretch had no impact. RIGHT MATTERS
stalked the leader but chased on the far turn and had no late kick. WICKEN CENTS was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. BRIENNE OF TARTH
set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN DUDE set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and held sway. M C JACKHAMMER was up close, raced evenly on the turn and from the three
path at the top of the stretch was second best. QUIET WYATT was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the
stretch was up for show. SOUPER PRONTO stalked the early leaders and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
WILD RIVER WOLF was in touch but checked into the turn and was all out through the stretch. COMMANDER TOM was off the pace, showed little and
from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no threat. J AND B IN CRUMLIN tracked from the outside and was a factor on the turn but dropped back
through the stretch.
