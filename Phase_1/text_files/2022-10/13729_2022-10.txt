Footnotes
PARIS KENTUCKY stalked three to two wide before inheriting an advantage with a half mile to go, showed the way from a pressing rival around the far turn,
then shook free of her entering the lane. KEEN LADY tracked four to three wide around the first turn, pressed the leader around the far turn, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch and second best. BIRD HUNTER hit the inner part of the gate at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, saved ground
most of the way while only vacating the inside to surpass a tiring rival into the far turn, then improved inside of foes entering the lane to claim show. TOE
DANCER trailed in the three path, moved up four wide around the far turn to claim show with five sixteenths to go, but was outkicked by that rival entering
the lane. ISABEL DE CLARE bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly two wide before tucking to the inside nearing the backstretch, but
chased the top pair while maneuvering around a faltering foe approaching the far turn, then tired among rivals turning for home. TIAN'AI ROAD bumped with
an inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the two path, and never got involved. SAINT SISTA sped clear around the first turn, but weakened at the half mile
pole. LITERARY bobbled a bit at the start, tucked from the five to two path around the first turn while off of the pace, chased three wide into the far turn, then
weakened around that bend.

Footnotes
ZMUDA tracked in the five path and outside of foes into the turn, ranged up turning for home, chased the leader through midstretch before bidding for the
lead entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. DONYA KNOW IT prompted the pace outside of the leader and from the three path, vied around the
turn, led in upper stretch, dug in between bidders in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final sixteenth. MONOCACY chased along
the inside, slipped inside of foes in upper stretch as the rail was vacated, pursued an outer leading rival into the final furlong, attempted a bid approaching
the final sixteenth, but flattened out late. ECLIPSED tracked three wide and between horses before tucking two wide into the turn while among foes, stalked
behind the leaders around the bend before coming into the lane in the four path, chased them through midstretch, then altered course outwardly entering
the final sixteenth, yet failed to threaten late. DIALED INNA broke a step slowly, lagged behind around the turn, then improved along the rail. MRS. NUSHI
tracked two wide and between horses, but steadied when put to tight quarters nearing the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, then hung on her
left lead without menacing. EVOKING chased outside the top pair while in the four path, then from between horses around the turn as an outer rival ranged
up, but yielded entering the lane. SOCIAL MANDATE set the pace inside of a vying rival while just a bit off of the inside around the turn, but weakened
between horses in upper stretch.

TEN DAYS LATER smartly tucked to the rail entering the first turn, tracked along the inside, moved forward to stalk down the backstretch, smoothly tipped
outside of the leading trio entering the lane, bid outside of LAVER in midstretch, and edged ahead. LAVER tracked in the five to four path around the first
turn, moved forward to press the top pair down the backstretch, vied around the far turn before claiming an advantage turning for home, led entering the
lane, dug in to resist TEN DAYS LATER's outside bid in midstretch, but was bested. ENDPOINT tracked in midpack in the four to three path around the first
turn, tipped five wide turning for home, then stayed on to reach show. ESCAPOLOGIST was bumped an leaned on by an outer rival t the start, laid

between horses to vie for show inside of a rival in the final sixteenth, but was bested for that position. FACE VALUE tracked two to three wide and between
horses, but failed to keep pace with the leaders nearing the lane, sustained stride while altering course outwardly in the final furlong and, kept on. MAZING
MARK lacked speed two wide, got caught four to six wide around the far turn, then moved up. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) set the pace inside of a vying
rival while a bit off of the rail, sparred along the fence inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but gave way nearing the lane, and weakened on his left
lead. SWISS GUARD prompted the pace in the four to three path early on before vying two wide down the backstretch, then from between horses into the
far turn, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart nearing the lane, and gave way. WILD SEAN bumped and leaned on an inner rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three path while steadying under a hard hold around the first turn, and made little impact. KING RUSSELL took the first turn in the
four to six path while outside of foes in midpack, chase four wide around the far turn, but weakened between horses nearing the lane. PRINCE OF ROSES

Footnotes
DEVIL VISION settled far back in the two path, shifted to the four path turning for home before swinging to the six path entering the lane, then rallied outside
of rivals through the final furlong, took aim on the top pair in the final sixteenth, and just got up. OUTLIER tracked two to three wide around the first turn,
pressed the leading pair around the far turn, hung on his left lead while sustaining his charge in the four path in upper stretch, lugged in slightly while bidding
at the furlong grounds, led narrowly in the final sixteenth as rivals on either side offered bids, and got nailed by the outer while staving off the inner. SILVER
DUST took a brush from an inner foe at the start, tucked from the four path to the rail while achieving tracking position around the first turn, stalked from the
pocket around the far turn, awaited racing room behind the leader entering the lane, slipped inside of that foe nearing the furlong grounds, sustained a bid
inside of a newly leading OUTLIER in the final sixteenth, but desperately missed. PAYNE settled off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the three
to four paths before tipping to the fie path in upper stretch, but failed to progress before being outkicked for minor placings in the final furlong. TREASURY
set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes around the far turn while just a bit off of the fence, shifted further off of the inside while leading in
upper stretch, but met bids from rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, and faltered a sixteenth from home. HOT SHOT KID trailed, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch, and moved up. BANDIT SWANSON stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, which allowed for a rival to slip inside
approaching the backstretch, and tired around the far turn. BURNING BRIGHT nudged an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied between
horses around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

MOUNT ATHOS tracked in the two to three paths around the turn, tipped outside of the leading trio entering the lane to take aim, ranged up to bid outside of
COLD AS HELL entering the final furlong, and edged clear. COLD AS HELL set the pace inside of a pair of hounding rivals around the turn, shook free of
them in upper stretch as an outer MOUNT ATHOS menaced, shifted out when confronted by that foe at the furlong grounds, but was bested. SPEND
BENJAMINS stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, yielded and lost show to an outer foe in
the final sixteenth, but reclaimed that position at the wire. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace to wide, swung to the five path
in upper stretch, stayed on to claim show in the final sixteenth, but began to pull up in the closing stages, lost show to an inner foe at the wire, then was
dismounted nearing the clubhouse turn, and got vanned off. KUNSHAN BRIDGE trailed, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and moved up between
horses. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced towards the rear three wide, came into the lane in the five path and between
horses, and made little impact. AMPERSAND bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack three wide, but faded in the four path around the
turn before fanning to the six path entering the lane. ATRAS prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but yielded in upper
stretch. OSKEE WOW WOW broke slowly and failed to get involved along the inside. DATA STORM stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in
upper stretch before tiring.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR GENERAL cleared off early on, maintained a loose advantage down the backstretch before receiving a breather nearing the far turn,
encountered a challenge from an outer MAJOR FED turning for home, yet turned that foe away in upper stretch, and held firm. MAJOR FED tracked three
wide, took aim on the clear leader from the three path around the far turn, inched closer to attempt a bid turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch,
and proved second best. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT broke a step slowly while last away, laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued three wide and between
horses into the far turn, chased and vied for show inside of MEISTER turning for home, and gained that position entering the lane. MEISTER trailed in the
three to four path around the first turn, inched closer four wide entering the far turn to vie for show turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rival for
that position entering the lane. CUPID'S CLAWS tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring MAILMAN MONEY to trail the field around
the far turn, then surpassed that foe entering the lane. MAILMAN MONEY stalked two wide while not applying pressure to the clear leader, then tired along
the inside around the far turn.

Footnotes
FANCY MARTINI stalked along the inside, easily tipped outside of the leader entering the lane, bid and gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, inched
clear soon after, and held sway. BARISTA laid off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room around the far turn, split foes at the furlong grounds while
launching a rally, bid for place along with an inner foe entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed for that position while slowly inching closer to the leader.
SMARMY was slow into stride, saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room around the far turn, then chased along the rail while staying on inside of
BARISTA in the final furlong, bid for place along with that foe a sixteenth from home, but was bested. SISTER LOU ANN took a mild nudge from an inner
foe soon after the start, set the pace along the inside, held sway through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and gave way.
BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) took a bump from an inner foe at the start got caught four wide while off of the pace, fanned five wide turning for home before being
bumped seven wide entering the lane, hung on her left lead while shifting in and pinching a foe in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, and
stayed on mildly. JUSTIFY MY LOVE (BRZ) was taken back from between horses early on, settled far back three wide, swung out to the eight path
approaching midstretch, and stayed on willingly. CHAMPAGNE LADY stumbled at the start while still breaking with the pack, stalked two to three wide, got
floated four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid before yielding between horses through the final furlong. FLOWN brushed an outer foe after the start
before bumping with another rival nearing the first turn, settled in midpack along the inside, tipped to the two path around the far turn before swinging five
wide entering the lane, bumped an outer WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE in the process before bumping that foe again at the three sixteenths pole, and lacked a
rally thereafter. UNDISTURBED broke awkwardly, trailed in the two path, and made little impact. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE got keen between rivals moving
past the wire for the first time, steadied nearing the first turn, tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, got bumped six wide and between horses
into the lane, then was pinched among those foes at the three sixteenths pole. REAGAN'S DECISION pressed two wide, got floated three wide entering the
lane, and weakened between horses. MILLER'S MAIDEN bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
TRADEMARK broke out and bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked the trio of duelers from the three to four path around the first turn, pursued three
wide before bidding approaching the three furlong pole, assumed command and drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, then widened under driving pressure.
ACTUATOR brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack two wide, chased under urging three to four wide and among rivals around the far
turn before shifting to the rail in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding charge to reach place from an outer foe entering the final sixteenth. SAINT TAPIT
tracked two to three wide and between horses, emerged from among rivals to gain place in the four path while under an all out drive turning for home,
inched closer to take aim on the clear leader nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, yielded, lost place to an inner foe at the sixteenth
pole, then saved show. ETHEREAL ROAD settled far back two wide, shifted from the five path to the four path turning for home to knife through rivals
entering the lane, and stayed on in the final furlong, but missed reaching an outer foe for show. BIG BLUE LINE tracked along the inside, got shuffled back
behind tiring foes two wide around the far turn before tipping three wide turning for home, but was floated inwardly in upper stretch, and lacked a bid.
CREATIVE MINISTER laid off of the pace four wide, improved to a tracking postiion down the backstretch, chased the clearing leader while getting
outkicked for place by an inner rival turning for home, and gave way. SERIFOS saved ground off of the pace, but awaited racing room behind tiring traffic
around the far turn, and failed to factor. PIONEER OF MEDINA broke a step slowly before being pinched back between horses at the start, raced far back
three wide, was driven to gain five wide around the far turn, but made little impact. MAXIMUM IMPACT broke slowly, trailed, swung six wide in upper
stretch, and failed to factor. MAGOO brushed with an outer foe at eth start, dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the first turn, chased down the
backstretch, but was shuffled back while fading around the far turn. CASTLE LEOCH dueled for the lead between horses around the first turn, chased his
outer counterpart down the backstretch, then weakened around the far turn. STEINBECK brushed an inner foe at the start, dueled three wide, led down the
backstretch, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and wilted turning for home.

Footnotes
PURE PAULINE stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, sustained stride turning for home to bid inside of the leader in upper
stretch, drew clear leaving the furlong grounds, but was caught at the wire to dead heat with her aunt and stablemate. GRAND ENTRANCE broke slowly
and trailed, came under a drive three wide around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, rallied through the final furlong with her
clear niece to catch, and reeled her in at the wire to dead heat. COMPARATIVE broke in, stalked two wide and between horses before coming under
coaxing down the backstretch, chased before drifting to the five path entering the lane, sustained a rally to attempt a bid outside of the clear leader in the
final furlong, but flattened out while getting outkicked and flopping back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth. WITS AND WAGERS broke slowly while
shying from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and chased along the rail through the lane.
DEFINING PURPOSE tracked in the three to four paths, got floated to the six path entering the land, and lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. TAXED
vied for the lead three to two wide early on, cleared with a half mile remaining, showed the way while shifting a bit out entering the lane, and caved between
horses in midstretch. HUNTLEIGH vied along the inside before chasing her outer counterpart into and around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
SWEET SWEETFANTASY laid in midpack in the two path, but tired. MIGHTY MADISON stalked three wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, but
weakened. LADAN lacked speed two wide and showed little. LIKE FINE WINE laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn and was
done early.
