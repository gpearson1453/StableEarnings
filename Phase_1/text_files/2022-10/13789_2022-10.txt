Footnotes
MILWAUKEE BAY stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. CLOUD RUNNER
showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed in mid stretch and was no match for the winner. HIPPIE CHICK was in
touch and roused on the far turn but had no response. MADAMME IN LOVE was in range but chased on the far turn and was empty. OOPSY was off the
pace and showed nothing while outrun. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON HIPPIE CHICK AGAINST CLOUD RUNNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
RADCLIFFE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. STORMIN' HUMOR was
unhurried early, forced the pace on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. C BY THE SEA was hustled early and had a
slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. THY KINGDOM was in range and saved ground on the turn but needed more.
CORE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. WAR DOCTOR was in touch and roused
on the turn but had no response. KING OF AWESOME was well back, showed little and from the six path at the top of the stretch was outrun.

WICKED CRAZY stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. MAXIMUM DANGER was in
range, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DOINGGOODTROUBLE set the pace and dueled on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. THELONIOUS was in touch and had a good position on the turn but needed more. BOCELLI was
unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. DR CHAPPELL was in mid pack, roused on the turn and angled out in the stretch but
had no kick. SOUPER PRONTO tracked from the inside and raced evenly on the turn but failed to fire. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was well back and hustled
along on the turn but had no rally. ABSTEMIOUS had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

UNSPEAKABLE set the pace, took command on the far turn and was much the best. FOUR BOUNCE was in range, a factor on the far turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch held place. SPIRAL STORM settled off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. SMARTY ILLUSION was unhurried early and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick.
MAYITO showed no speed and raced evenly on the far turn but was no threat. SANTIAGO SALSA was well back and gained ground on the far turn but was
no factor. MY BOY CHRISTIAN was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. ASCOT BAY
was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SHAMBO forced the pace but lost ground on the far
turn and was empty. SENSIBLE PORTIONS was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.
