Footnotes
IMPERIALITE rated well off the pace while in the three path, went in pursuit of the leader, gained the lead late stretch and held under a drive. DURITZ
saved ground early, lodged a bid inside at the head of the lane, shifted out to the four path then surged in the final yards missing out. DR A TO D opened up
on the field entering the backstretch, showed the way under a snug hold, saw margins diminish rapidly in the final turn and was caught late stretch.
ADMIRAL VANNGO raced in closest pursuit of the leader, and offered a mild bid in stretch. DARK STORM COMING bore out sharply away from the gate,
rider steered back towards the rail into backstretch then saved ground, and closed the gap.

CONTE ROSSO sat in striking range while four wide, moved up alongside BEAUGATTI nearing the quarter pole, inched clear while drifting in at the head of
the stretch, and won driving. BEAUGATTI quickly went to the front leading the field through the backstretch, responded to challenge from CONTE ROSSO,
shifted out to the two path at the head of the stretch, and held on for second under heavy steady urging. REMAIN CALM advanced quickly in the far turn,
lodged an all out bid outside and needed more late. AMIGO QUERIDO trailed the field, closed late and passed tiring. STREAKIN AGAIN tracked inside, and
came up empty in the drive. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of BEAUGATTI against the rider of CONTE ROSSO alleging
interference at the eighth pole was upheld by the Board of Stewards. CONTE ROSSO was disqualified and placed second for interference to BEAUGATTI.

Footnotes
EXHI KID saved ground while showing the way, turned back challenge from FIRST PRINCE, and held firm. REALLY SLOW trailed the field early, closed
steadily outside and was just up late for place honors. FIRST PRINCE sat in striking position while three wide, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter
pole, was unable to stall the winner and was nipped for place. WYE CROSS unhurried early, lodged a rail bid late stretch and was out nodded.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE sat in range while four to five wide, roused at the quarter pole, and lacked a kick. TIMELY RUCKUS stalked inside, and yielded
with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
IT'S A FACT sat just off the pace under a snug hold, lacked running room inside in tight quarters on the far turn, found seam at the five sixteenth pole, struck
the front then held under steady pressure. MUDINATOR reserved off the early pacesetters in the five path, moved up menacingly nearing the final turn,
drove four wide into the lane, and lacked the rallied that was needed late. READYTOTAPNSING set a pressured pace from just off the rail, was overtaken
nearing the quarter pole, kept on under encouragement and flattened out in stretch. CATCH THE DREAM trailed the field, and rallied mildly late.
ARROGANCE showed little. LIL ZAPPER pressed the early pace in the four path, and gave way after the quarter pole.

SPIRE shifted out to the middle of the track, fanned four wide into the far turn, circled the field into the lane, rallied determinedly outside of PRESS GANG,
matched strides in the final yards and won the bob. PRESS GANG sat in range, drove three wide at the head of the lane, rallied gamely between foes and
was lost the bob after a game effort. DUNE D'ORO hurried inside to contest the pace, gained an advantage in the far turn, and was edged out.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER tracked inside, and was outkicked in the stretch. HERE COMES BARNEY sent for speed, vied outside for the lead, and wilted
at the head of the stretch. PUMP THE BRAKES chased outside and was outrun.

ENTITLED STAR saved ground while racing five wide, moved up outside in the far turn to overtake the lead, responded to looming threat from DONT GET
SMART into the stretch and just held under a late drive. FLASHY SISTER trailed the field early, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, set aim at the
head of the stretch, closed steadily and narrowly missed. SOPHIE MCTROPHY sat in striking position along the rail, shifted out to the three path and closed
gradually earning show. DONT GET SMART raced wide through the backstretch, drove four wide then loomed boldly at the eighth pole but could not muster
the bid that was needed and yielded late. CAGEY stalked from the three path, drifted in into the stretch, and passed tiring foe. KENSINGTON MARKET
saved ground while setting the pace, was overtaken and retreated inside. TEMPLE OF ZOOM rider steered to the outside rail after discovering a equipment
malfunction, was pulled up after the final turn, did not finish and walked off on own accord.

WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE stalked from the rail, swung three wide at the head of the lane, took aim on leading BEAUTIFUL CALL in upper stretch, and just
got by. BEAUTIFUL CALL sat just off the flank of FAST LANDING, prompted action in the final turn, struck the front and was out finished. VALENTINO
ROSSA raced wide through the backstretch, and closed gradually outside to earn third place finish. FAST LANDING emerged the leader leaving the chute,
saved ground while setting the pace from just off the rail, was overtaken after the quarter pole, and faded inside. AUSSIE'S BELLA showed early speed
outside in the five path, was set down and failed to threaten in drive. SPARK PLUG saved ground along the rail, and lacked a serious bid. EENY MEENY
MINY YO lodged a late mild bid and was unable to improve position. PEARLS AND CURLS settled outside, and offered little. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL
chased outside and tired. APRIL'S IMPERIAL was not a factor.

Footnotes
NO BAKK TALK reserved off the early pacesetters, drove four wide into the lane, and won driving. CAPA BELLA vied inside for the early lead, held a slim
advantage over SANDY BEACH, edged clear of the fore mentioned and was ran down in stretch. WICKED WOMAN broke inward bumping into ANN OF
WAR, angled towards the rail in the backstretch, angled outside and closed determinedly late earning show. SANDY BEACH vied hard outside, pressed the
pace, was unable to get by then weakened late stretch and was edged out. SCARLETT'S FLOWER bumped sideways leaving, met traffic in the final turn,
angled in sharply at the head of the stretch, and finished evenly. SHIP'S CREEK chased outside, raced four wide into the far turn, and improved late.
BEAUTIFUL BABE bumped leaving, chased mid pack, swung five wide off the final turn, and rallied belatedly. CORDILLERA broke awkwardly, advanced
outside in the final turn, and flattened out in stretch. SAVYSKYE raced in traffic and failed to menace. ANN OF WAR squeezed leaving, was bumped near
the three sixteenth pole, and gave way. LITTLE ROSALYN chased outside, angled in bumping into ANN OF WAR, and yielded. NO SURPRISE bumped
leaving, saved inside and faded.
