Footnotes
DISRUPTION broke in at the start, settled on the inside of a foe, gained to make a three wide bid on the turn, took over into upper stretch then kicked clear,
responded well under the crop in the final furlong and held under strong urging. WEEKEND RAGS was hustled from the start, disputed the pace, dropped
off the pace leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path near the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the stretch and was
second best. CENTRAL SPEED broke in and bumped with a foe, tossed her head under restraint early, was reserved the pace, moved closer late on the
backstretch, ranged up four then five wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. NAUGHTY
NAN broke out and bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. LAVON bumped with rivals at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch, lugged in inside the three-sixteenths and bumped with a foe, lugged in again late then jostled with a rival and failed to
threaten. BUSTIN HOT was hustled from the gate, showed speed then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and
tired then jostled with a foe late. LA CONQUISTADORA raced well back in the field under urging, rounded the turn in the two path, came four wide into the
stretch, was bumped inside the three-sixteenths, jostled with foes late and was no factor. QUEENS OVER THREES was taken up at the start then drifted in,
raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. MA MI JO DREAMS bumped with foes on both sides at the start, disputed the pace, vied in the
two path on the turn and gave way. DASHING DELLA was urged along on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, dropped
back into upper stretch, was taken up some while out of contention outside the furlong marker and capitulated. SUPER SLIDE chased the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn and retreated. FOREVER AMY was taken up after the start, dropped well behind then was pulled up and
walked off.

FRANK'S ART settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid at the furlong marker, took the
lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. ATHENRY was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on
the turn, rallied five wide into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final furlong, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the
place. WAR TERMINATOR was well placed towards the front, saved ground while asked on the turn, chased in the stretch and finished willingly for the
show. SANDRONE bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the inside of foes, dropped back leaving the backstretch then moved to the rail from
the two path, gained in the two path into upper stretch then made a bid between horses, took the lead outside the furlong marker, lost the lead inside that
marker and weakened. MISTER CHAIRMAN settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, gained under a drive into upper stretch, held a
good striking position into the final furlong but flattened out. EDDIE THE GREAT leaned out and was off slow, raced under urging off the pace, dropped from
the four path to the two path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. AGILITY settled off the pace, was roused three wide on
the turn and failed to impact. COURAGEOOUS OH LA bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, angled in while going to the front, vied inside on
the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. TOMMY THE TORCH broke out at the start, raced just off the pace between foes, vied three wide
on the turn and came up empty. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. TWO DOWN was off slow and
spotted the front several lengths, dropped well behind, went three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. HUDSON
OVERPASS pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path around the turn, led into the stretch then was headed and capitulated.

Footnotes
MY BOY TATE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, gained to take the advantage into the
stretch then kicked clear, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. WHO HOO THATS ME was well placed just off the pace, drafted
in the two path for most of the turn, dropped to the rail while asked outside the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner to
the wire and earned the place. PERFECT MUNNINGS was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and
was out-kicked while able to get the show. WUDDA U THINK NOW was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two
path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened. BIG ENGINE settled under some urging, moved out near
the nine-sixteenths, chased five wide on the turn and came up empty. FAST N FEARIOUS was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace,
dropped back while inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, faltered while floating seven wide into the stretch and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
DR. BLUTE was fractious in the gate, went to the front, showed the way in the two path, responded well when asked into the stretch and held under strong
urging. CURLIN'S WISDOM went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on
the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to get the place. BARESE bobbled at the start then
bumped with foes on both sides, went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was roused late on the backstretch, chased in the three
path for most of the far turn, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch and kept on willingly but missed the place while able
to get the show. SEA FOAM broke in and bumped with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along in the four
path around the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was outfinished. BROOKLYN STRONG broke a bit awkwardly, went three to four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. BIG BOBBY was restless in the gate then broke a bit slow, went four wide on the turns and was no factor. MONTEBELLO bumped with a rival at
the start then was pulled off that foe by the rider, settled on the inside, was through after a half-mile and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked
off.

Footnotes
CITY MAN checked when shut-off along the rail early, was rated just off the pace on the inside, cut the corner while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied while
given a clear rail opening by the leader in upper stretch, made a bid coming to the furlong marker, kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much
the best under good handling. COLD HARD CASH bumped with a rival at the start, moved out leaving the chute, raced in the three path on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid while asked in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final
furlong, jostled with a foe while between horses near the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. SANCTUARY CITY saved
ground around the opening bend, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, jostled with a foe
around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. RINALDI went to the front, rounded the first turn in the
two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, came off the rail into the stretch and let the winner through, led
under a drive into the final furlong then gave way. OCALA DREAM bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. THERAPIST was caught four wide
early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was roused in the two path at the quarter-pole then
angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. KINGDOM ON PAWS was restless in the gate, became a bit keen when taken in hand behind a checking
foe early, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside but with cover, was roused late on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch, steadied briefly when a foe angled in front around the three-sixteenths, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to respond.

hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, chased four then three wide around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly
for the show. BETSY BLUE angled in early then was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and also finished willingly but just
missed the show. LEELOO was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure, vied in the three then two path around the turn, lost the lead to the winner
in upper stretch and gave way. VENTI VALENTINE bumped with a foe at the start while last away, moved in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed
to rally. GONE AND FORGOTTEN was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back three then two wide on the turn and

Footnotes
LET HER INSPIRE U prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, took the lead with three furlongs to turn, was asked once straightened for the
drive, extended the advantage into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. SHARP STARR tossed her head while taken up
at the start then checked, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on the far turn, gained into upper stretch, moved out
outside the furlong marker then brushed with a foe and finished willingly for the place. ICE PRINCESS was taken under a tight hold early, went four wide on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, brushed with the runner-up outside the furlong
marker and weakened but was clear for the show. CARAGATE tugged keenly on the bit into the first turn, was rated in the two path around that bend,
settled more kindly down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path for most of the far turn then shifted three wide, came five wide into the stretch,
remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. SWEET MYSTERY was coaxed from the gate, became keen when taken under
restraint behind horses nearing the first turn, went three wide around that bend, settled down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path
under urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BRATTLE HOUSE went to the front, showed the way in the two path,
dropped to the inside early on the far turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths and faded. FROST ME was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged five wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SUNSET LOUISE was reluctant to load, tugged very
hard at the bit while rank to place into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ARCTIC ARROGANCE went to the front, set the pace on the inside under pressure, lost the lead early on the turn, battled inside two foes under a drive in
the final furlong, shook clear into the final furlong and drew off under strong urging. QUICK TO ACCUSE tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the
four path on the far turn, fought outside of two foes into the final furlong and secured the place while no match for the winner. STARQUIST pressed the pace
on the outside, took a short lead in the three path early on the turn, battled between foes under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened while clear for the show. DONEGAL SURGES was well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, was
driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. JACKSON HEIGHTS broke a step slow, dropped well behind early, gained six wide on the turn but
lacked the needed response. SHADOW DRAGON settled off the pace, was urged five wide on the turn and failed to respond. BLAME IT ON DADDY was
rated off the pace then settled later on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and capitulated. THTWASTHENTHISISNW angled in near the
three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left. CANARSIE was well placed towards the front, chased three wide on the turn and tired.
WITH KNOW NAME settled on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and faltered.
