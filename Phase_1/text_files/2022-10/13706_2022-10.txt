made a steady gain and closed for the show. CASTLE KING allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the second turn, came widest into the

Footnotes
HALF BIRTHDAY eased to the lead inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. SONNET rated outside the
leader, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. LA
REINA DEL NORTE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the
show. TUDOX ROADSTER led in the early going, vied between to mid way of the turn, then faded on the two path and held a share. KEEP SCROLLING
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded the final furlong. ANOTHERMANICMONDAY was never involved.
