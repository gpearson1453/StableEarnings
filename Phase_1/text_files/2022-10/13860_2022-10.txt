Footnotes
SWEET CRYSTAL broke sharply, set the pace while keen and under restraint, continued on the pace in the two path on the turn while prompted by
GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN to his outside, shook that foe off when driven in the three path in upper stretch, continued on well clear while driven past
midstretch and was allowed to coast home late. ARRINGTON settled in second last, saved ground patiently around the turn, was driven in upper stretch and
responded with a rally, and improved between horses to prove best of the rest. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN attended the pace outside the leader, continued
just outside of SWEET CRYSTAL around the bend, was no match from upper stretch and chased on mildly. BARBARA ROHLOFF chased the leading pair,
hugged the rail around the turn, was driven in the two path into the lane and lacked the needed rally. PRINCESS RULER hit the gate and broke slowly, was
pushed along into the turn, trailed in the four to five path on the turn, came into the lane in the five path and offered no bid.

Footnotes
C F V WICKED RED settled last while shifting a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, continued outside a rival to the far turn gathering momentum,
swung four wide racing into upper stretch advancing in tandem with SPALDING STROLL to challenge for command and kicked clear under firm
encouragement. The latter was reserved while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dropped well off the leaders on the backstretch, saved ground on
the far turn gathering momentum, shifted out to bid three wide between foes in upper stretch, contested the issue past midstretch but proved only second
best. MY BROTHER CAM was urged prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue into the far turn to upper stretch but proved no match
for the top pair. RAVE ON was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage for a half, dueled for command into the far turn
and gave way into upper stretch. SUPRISE CAT, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leaders to the first turn, dropped off those rivals on the
backstretch and faded between foes into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD tracked the leading pair, bid three wide into the far turn, led three wide near the five sixteenths, cleared when driven in upper stretch and was
wrapped up in the final sixteenth. SILVER QUARTERS trailed early, took closer order down the backstretch, continued to improve in the three path on the
far turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied between horses and proved second best. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased the leading trio, continued behind the
leading trio in the four path on the far turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and kept on willingly though outkicked for the place. IWILLPERSEVERE chased
inside of LOOK AWAY early, edged forward inside of DIAMOND MAXIMUS past the eleven sixteenths, chased down the back straight and in the two path
on the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and kept on mildly. D'FEVER vied inside of YOU'RE IN COREY, was headed by GITA'S LAD near the five
sixteenths, continued in range inside past the quarter pole, but had no more when driven in upper stretch and weakened. YOU'RE IN COREY vied two wide,
continued between horses in the leading flight through the far turn, began to flatten out after GITA'S LAD took the lead near the five sixteenths, came six
wide into the lane and weakened. LOOK AWAY chased two wide, weakened in the three to four path on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and
did not rally.

Footnotes
INDAWIN was pinched back out of tight quarters at the start, settled last on the backstretch, switched outside foes gathering momentum leaving the midway
point of the turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied stoutly to the front under firm encouragement to wrest the advantage in time. KHOZYS
CROWN vied for command between foes from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage leaving midstretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. COUGER, off slowly, tracked off the second flight inside rivals in early stages, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. WANNA HAVE FUN settled between foes in the last flight early, angled to the inside entering the turn, tipped
out to race between foes just off the inside in the stretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. FIRST SQUADRON broke sharply, forced
the pace four wide in the opening quarter, pressed the three wide on the turn to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. LA GUERRERITA
tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing into the turn, tipped out entering upper stretch to race three wide between foes in late stages but lacked the
needed final bid. LADY ATLANTIC tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was carried out six wide by COUGER in upper stretch and
came up empty in the drive. SILVER POM POM tracked off the second flight four wide on the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the stretch. APOLLO U
ANYWHERE hopped at the start while breaking a bit slowly, was urged to terms with the first flight inside rivals disputing the pace on the backstretch into
the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SUPERTRIX settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. ASHLEY ELIZABETH flashed
brief pace three wide between foes in the opening quarter but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ALEXIS N NIKO dueled two wide around the first turn, vied between horses down the back straight, vied inside of J J'S SOLUTION into the far turn but
settled back off that foe near the three eighths while saving ground, re-bid in the two path into the lane and drove to the lead in upper stretch, and continued
to increase his advantage under a hand ride in the final furlong. TAHKODHA KNIGHT dueled inside of ALEXIS N NICO early, vied at the inside of a
three-horse leading flight down the backstretch, settled back out of the leading flight into the far turn, chased in the three path around the bend and into the
lane, shifted out approaching the furlong mark, and secured the place near the sixteenth marker. J J'S SOLUTION was keen to track the leading pair while
positioned three wide around the first turn, encroached to join the leading pair three wide near the thirteen sixteenths, vied three wide down the back
straight, continued to vie outside of ALEXIS N NICO into the far turn, inherited the lead near the three sixteenths when that foe settled back, was driven in
the four path in upper stretch, could not hold off the re-rally of ALEXIS N NICO to his inside, chased on and lost the place with a sixteenth of a mile
remaining. LAWMAKER hopped at the start and broke slowly, settled at the rear, advanced to chase the leading trio near the eleven sixteenths, was pushed
along for a bid three wide around the far turn, was driven into the lane in the five path and emptied out. ARCTIC ICE tracked the leading trio while positioned
four wide through the first turn, was relegated to last when LAWMAKER inched up inside him near the eleven sixteenths, weakened in the four path on the
far turn, swung to the center of the track and was eased down the lane.

LOVE THE NEST tracked just off the first flight three wide on the backstretch, made a steady advance to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch,
gained the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear late under firm encouragement. W W SCOUT'S HONOR broke sharply, was urged along
the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled inside a rival on the bend, proved no match for the winner late but kept on gamely to
prevail for the place honors. DOCTOR OSCAR gained terms with the leader attending the pace on his own courage racing through the backstretch, pressed
the issue on the turn into upper stretch and was outkicked for the place honors. PALACE KITTEN settled outside a rival in the opening stages, tipped out
racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. MOJO MAN tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and gave way into upper
stretch.

Footnotes
W W COOKIE MONSTER tracked three wide down the backstretch, attended the leading flight three wide into the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
began to drift out under a drive, nonetheless wrested the lead from FAST JACK near the furlong marker, and opened up in the final sixteenth while kept to
the task and continuing to drift out. FAST JACK dueled inside of W W HOTSHOT down the backstretch and through the turn, vied inside of W W COOKIE
MONSTER midstretch, was headed by that foe near the furlong mark, proved no match in the final sixteenth and chased on second best. LOCAMOTOR
tracked behind the leading pair down the backstretch, tracked the leading trio in the three path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and was driven,
found himself outkicked by the top two in the final furlong but chased on best of the rest. TONYS MORNING LINE settled toward the rear of the main group
early, bumped with READTHECLIFFNOTES into the turn after that foe was bumped by WHAT'S UP DUDE, chased two wide between horses on the turn,
came into the lane four wide, and finished willingly between horses. HUEY ATTACK chased inside, hugged the rail around the turn, was driven inside in
upper stretch and took closer order, but flattened out in the final furlong. W W HOTSHOT dueled outside of FAST JACK down the backstretch, continued to
vie between horses around the turn, was outkicked into the lane by FAST JACK and W W COOKIE MONSTER, and weakened. DEVILEYE was void of
early speed, took closer order along the rail on the turn and regained touch with the rest of the pack in upper stretch, was driven between horses but leveled
out late. WHAT'S UP DUDE raced three wide toward the rear of the main group down the backstretch, came in on READTHECLIFFNOTES past the half
mile mark, was pushed along for a bid in the five path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track for the drive, and flattened out. MAC PANDOWDY
settled toward the rear of the main group, continued at the rear of the main pack in the two path on the turn while racing inside of READTHECLIFFNOTES,
came into the lane inside and had no rally. READTHECLIFFNOTES raced between horses toward the rear of the main pack, took up past the half mile mark
when WHAT'S UP DUDE came in and bumped him between horses, raced in the three to four path at the rear of the main group around the bend, was
driven five wide in upper stretch, and came up empty.

Footnotes
CARTE BLANCHE, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages stalking just off the leaders, pressed the issue in that path racing through the far turn,
shook clear in upper stretch while shifting inwards and was kept to firm encouragement. KRAMDEN, restless in the gate before the start, tracked just off the
first flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out three wide racing into upper stretch, shifted about under pressure past midstretch but continued
willingly to prove best of the others. TONALTALITARIAN settled off the leaders while angling to the rail racing into the backstretch, saved ground to upper
stretch, altered course off the inside while caught in close quarters momentarily nearing the sixteenth marker but continued with interest between foes to
prevail for a share. RIVER CACTUS tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, was fanned to the
five path racing past midstretch but continued to improve position. SHWEET PERSUASION, restless prior to the start, was off slowly, settled into stride to
the backstretch, gained position between foes racing into upper stretch but finished evenly late. BULLDOG OF BERGEN switched outside the pacesetter
prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the pace between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but faded in late stages. IRISH MAJOR settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. THE LAST OPTION tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight to
the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but came up empty in the lane. PINSON, urged to the lead
while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way racing into the lane. MANGO TREE,
caught four wide on the first turn, then five wide racing into the backstretch, retreated early. ANTRIM'S GIANT tracked three deep in second flight to the
backstretch and was through after a half.
