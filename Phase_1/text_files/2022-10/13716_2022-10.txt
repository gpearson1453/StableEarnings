Footnotes
ONE COOL DUDE set a clear pace, maintained a loose lead from a chasing rival around the far turn, and drew off through the lane. NORDIC LIGHT settled
off of the pace along the inside, failed to achieve position inside of rivals nearing the far turn, steadied and backed out entering that bend, then shifted off of
the rail around the far turn before swinging five wide in upper stretch, then stayed on willingly to reach place in the shadow of the wire. GET THROUGH
broke a step slowly and trailed the field early on, gained three to four wide around the far turn, reached show in upper stretch, but flopped back to his left
lead while lugging in from a right handed crop at the furlong grounds, kept on to bid for place in the late stages, but was outkicked nearing the wire. ORDER
OF MERIT stalked two wide and from between horses, chased the clear leader while under urging around the far turn as that foe's only pursuer, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, lugged entering the final furlong before the rider vigorously asked for a lead change, then faltered
in hand through the final sixteenth. HEIR TO GREATNESS stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair around the far turn, then was
outkicked for minor placings in upper stretch before keeping on. ONEMORANDTHECHECK tracked in midpack in the two path, and was one paced.
ARISTOCAT stalked along the inside, then faded around the far turn. ANGEL OF THE NORTH lacked speed in the three to five path around the first turn,
and tired. GO VIRTUAL was never involved. ON SPOT tracked four wide, but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
SAVE GRACE tracked from off of the pace two wide and between horses, emerged from the group turning for home, tipped out to take aim on the leading
pair in upper stretch, ranged up outside of them entering the final furlong, and kicked clear. SOMEBODY LOVES ME vied for the lead two wide, sparred with
the pace setter through upper stretch, wrestled a narrow advantage coming to the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer bidder soon after. POUT
set the pace inside of a vying rival, battled with that foe through upper stretch, but was headed approaching the furlong grounds, and yielded. UGHROUDA
stalked three wide, chased the leading pair into the turn, but yielded between horses turning for home, yet sustained stride in upper stretch, and kept on.
TYRONA was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair while tipping to the three path turning for home, and
yielded. SWEET TRUFFLES was moving her head about while trying to be settled by the assistant starter when the gates sprung causing her to coming out
a length slow, raced at the rear in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to menace between rivals through the lane. BACKSTREET AFFAIR
brushed an inner rival at the start, was void of early speed two wide and between horses, retreated under a firm hold behind rivals down the backstretch to
trail nearing the turn, and made little impact. OPEN SAYS ME saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE chased from
midpack four wide, but tired in the six path entering the lane.

LADY GOLDSTART laid close up along the inside, took back to stalk passing the half mile pole, loomed a danger from the pocket around the turn, split the
leading pair at the furlong grounds, claimed an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and inched clear. SISTER ANNIE bumped with an outer rival at the start,
pressed three wide, vied outside of the leader while in the three path around the turn, sparred through midstretch as an inner foe-splitting rival joined the
fray, then was outkicked by her a sixteenth from home, and proved second best. MUSIC CITY STAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked four
wide, then chased the leading trio through the lane before driving past a tiring one in the final sixteenth to claim show. SUPER WONDER GIRL saved
ground off of the pace, then surpassed a tiring rival at the wire for a minor share. SOFIA STRONG set the pace two wide and between horses before
clearing to the rail entering the turn, but gave way to a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, and weakened. DULCIMER DAME took the turn in the four to five
path while off of the pace, got floated six wide entering the lane, and failed to menace. BEACHSIDE BUNNY hopped while breaking slow, laid off of the
pace in the three path and between horses, fanned five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. TIPSY GAL was outrun.

Footnotes
NINETIES COUNTRY tracked four wide before moving closer to press the leading pair nearing the turn, sparred outside of those foes around the turn,
forged an advantage while well in hand entering the lane, then inched away to a narrowly clear margin in the final furlong. TOWING dueled for the lead two
wide, then from between horses around the turn, got headed by his outer counterpart entering the lane, battled on gamely while sparring for place with his
inner counterpart through the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed. STEELY DANZA set the pace from an outer hounding rival early on, dueled with that foe
and another vying rival around the turn, got headed by his outermost rival entering the lane before gamely battling with his most immediate counterpart for
place thereafter, but just missed via a narrow photo. ORO DE MORO MORO chased from midpack two wide, shifted outside of a drifting rival entering the
final furlong, and reached that foe for fourth in the late stages. ZAP MOTION stalked the leading trio from the three path around the turn, tipped outside of
them entering the lane, but failed to progress through upper stretch, wandered outwardly before being overcorrected and flopping leads inside the final
furlong, and faltered late. MIDASWELLRUN lacked speed while taking the turning the three to four path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to
threaten. GOLD HERITAGE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turn, and failed to factor. WESLEYAN tracked along
the inside, but faded. SEE SPOT RUN was outrun.

AMERICAN STARLET set the pace outside of LAUGH AND PLAY early on, cleared that rival approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted ground out to the
five path while meeting that foe's re-bid in upper stretch, then swiftly repelled that foe when roused entering the final furlong, and drew clear under hand
urging. LAUGH AND PLAY laid close up inside of the pace setter early on, backed off at the three furlong pole before tipping to the three path to be outside
of his counterpart turning for home, got floated out to the six path while attempting a re-bid in upper stretch, inched closer soon after, but was turned away
entering the final furlong, and remained clear of show. IN MY OPINION tracked along the inside, then chased along the rail while gaining show in
midstretch. QUARIA COMET tracked in the three path, got floated to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, chased while failing to progress in upper
stretch, then shifted course outside of tiring foe in the final furlong, and stayed on to improve late. ONLY KIDDING stalked in the two path, got floated tot he
three path at the five sixteenths pole before fanning to the seven path to remain outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but gave way. MORGS WORLD
tracked from the two path, but failed to menace. GET SERIOUS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MY TOMMY LEE broke a step slowly and got
outrun. JOY ENAMORADA laid off of the pace in the four to three paths, and tired.

Footnotes
CYCLONE MISCHIEF prompted the pace setter from the outside while in the three path around the first turn, vied while tucking to the two path down the
backstretch, gained an advantage with five sixteenths to go, then drew clear entering the lane, and widened under driving pressure before being put to hand
in the final sixteenth. MY IMAGINATION stalked along the inside, tipped off of the rail turning for home to bid for place two wide entering the lane along with
an outer KING D'ORO, then edged away from that foe to secure that position in the final furlong. KING D'ORO stalked four wide before moving forward to
press the leading pair entering the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with them under strong urging around the far turn, yet kept on turning for home to bid
for place along with an inner rival entering the lane, but was outkicked for that position entering the final furlong. WADSWORTH broke a step slowly, saved
ground far back, improved to midpack nearing the far turn, then continued to move up mildly in the lane. PERMAFROST set the pace inside of a vying rival
while just a bit off of the rail early on, but got headed by that foe with five sixteenths to go, then weakened entering the lane. O GANGSTER was off a step
slowly, trailed two wide, then saved ground towards the rear around the far turn before improving. SEEKING UNITY tracked three wide and between horses,
then chased the leaders from the four path around the far turn before tiring. PRESIDER laid off of the pace in the five to three paths, and made little impact.
MR MIDWAY tracked two wide and between horses, but weakened nearing the far turn. SPENCER'S BOY LUNA broke a beat slowly, lacked speed while in
the six to five path around the first turn, then was done early.

HEART RHYTHM stalked the top pair from the three path, shifted to the four path entering the lane while closing in, bid in upper stretch before gaining an
advantage at the furlong grounds, then drove clear as an inner HERE MI SONG pursued, and held sway safely thereafter. HERE MI SONG tracked from
behind the leaders after tucking to the two path entering the turn, was coaxed along while chasing turning for home, shifted three wide and between rivals in
upper stretch while inside of a bidding HEART RHYTHM, claimed place at the furlong grounds while pursuing that clearing leader, then was fended off
through the late stages while keeping that foe honest. SOUTH BEND bobbled a bit at the start, trailed down the backstretch, came under an all out drive to
inch closer in the four path turning for home, but leveled off through the lane. PREVALENCE pressed the pace setter from the outside, vied around the turn,
led entering the lane, but failed to kick away as an outer foe menaced, failed to resist that rival's bid nearing the furlong grounds, and weakened leaving that
juncture. CHATTALOT set the pace inside of a vying rival, but was headed entering the lane, and readily stopped.

ABOUKIR BAY took a mild nudge from an inner foe soon after the start, trailed along the inside, swung to the six path entering the lane, then rallied through
the final furlong to drive past the leading pair in the final sixteenth. SHANNON bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked from behind the leading pair
around the turn before tipping outside of them nearing the lane, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by an outer on-charging foe in the final sixteenth before saving place. BOXING DAY lightly brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked
two wide, shifted to the fie path path entering the lane, grinded away with a clear SHANNON to catch in the final furlong, attempted a bid in the final
sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival while being staved off for place. OPENING BUZZ bumped an inner foe at the start, sparred for the lead three
wide, vied two wide entering the lane as an outer rival joined the fray, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong grounds, and yielded. KANT BELIEVE IT
bumped with an outer foe at the start, vied two wide and between horses before clearing an inner foe nearing the lane, fought on through upper stretch, but
gave way leaving the furlong grounds. GAMBLING CAT was pinched back between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, came into the
lane two wide, and failed to factor. BALL GOWN laid off of the pace in the three to two paths, and never got involved. KITING bumped an inner rival at the
start, dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
