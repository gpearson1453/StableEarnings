Footnotes
FLY BUDDY FLY tracked the quick early fractions, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, kept to task under left-handed urging through
mid-stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth, came within aim in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. EL CHARRO CHAMP broke alertly
and was sent to the early lead, set a solid pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free nearing the furlong grounds, was all out in deep stretch while
holding off rivals and was nailed on the line for the win in a game runner-up finish. WICKED BLUE rated off of the early pace, saved ground to the quarter
marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up for show in the final strides. TEXAS LONHRO settled off of the early pace,
raced two wide between runners midway through the turn, came four wide into the drive, found his best stride late and challenged for show in deep stretch.
TIZ VICIOUS pressed the solid pace while three deep on the turn, was asked for more nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides in deep stretch
and weakened. KATZUMOTO threw his head at the break and was off a step slowly, rushed up to press the solid early fractions, lost ground nearing
mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
GET'EM TIGER showed early speed and stalked the moderate pace, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch,
re-rallied inside of the furlong grounds, closed determinedly in deep stretch to overtake the runner-up and edged away in the final strides. TONI TWO
POCKET was sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, turned away GET'EM TIGER and shook free nearing mid-stretch,
was confronted again by GET'EM TIGER nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the determined winner in the final stages and was second best in
the end. SENORITA ESTRELLA chased the moderate pace two wide through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, was not able to impact the top two in
deep stretch and made a mild late rally to secure show. MAYCEE JO tracked the moderate early fractions while on a hold, saved ground to the quarter
marker, lost ground while in pursuit of the leaders in mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. SILK ROAD SALLY chased the moderate early pace,
improved position three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was unprepared at the start
and spotted the field leaving the break, chased outside of rivals on the turn, came five wide into the drive and was not a late threat.

Footnotes
COLORMEMONEY rated nicely off of the solid early fractions, advanced three wide on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, loomed in mid-stretch,
showed a good late kick to overtake the runner-up inside of the furlong marker and held sway in the late stages. QUIET CHARM was hustled to contest the
early lead, set a quick pressured pace through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner inside of the eighth pole and held well in
the final sixteenth to be second best. WHOA BUDDY stalked the solid early pace from the inside, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane,
was asked to advance along the rail in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages but stayed on to secure show. RHODIUM RUNNER was allowed to
settle, came four wide into the turn, angled in to the two path nearing the top of the stretch, passed tiring foes in the late stages and finished evenly.
DARKSABER pressed the quick pace three deep, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. THAT'S BIND
BABE chased the early pace, raced two wide midway through the turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, swung four wide into upper stretch and
gave way in the final furlong. TIME IS GONE showed speed and disputed the solid early pace, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CRAZY DREAMS was sent to set the early pace, set decent fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, repelled the runner-up nearing the top of
the lane, extended the lead into mid-stretch and drew clear under firm handling in the final sixteenth. C'MON MAN stalked the decent fractions while three
wide, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and stayed on for place in
the late stages. DR PESCADO was allowed to settle, came four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground four wide on the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, was outfinished for place in the late stages, while clear for show at the end. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was allowed to settle in the early going,
gained ground two wide on the far turn, came in tight and lacked racing room in upper stretch, found room inside of the furlong marker and did not produce a
late rally. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the decent pace through the far turn, chased the winner to mid-stretch
and tired in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH lunged at the start, unseated the rider and was declared a non-starter. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH LUNGED BEFORE THE START
OF THE RACE AND BROKE OPEN HIS STALL GATE PRIOR TO THE OTHER RUNNERS BEING RELEASED BY THE STARTER. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, THE STEWARDS DECLARED MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
WESTERN TOWN showed speed and was sent to the early lead, opened to a clear advantage nearing the turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter
marker, remained clear to mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive to prevail. TAMA SETS DA PACE was away slowly,
lacked early speed, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, improved position nearing mid-stretch, closed with a rush in deep stretch, put mild late
pressure on the winner and held for second in the end. LILY PAD LAKE was allowed to settle, raced two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased
to mid-stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker and was up for show in the final sixteenth. GREAT GIFT lacked early speed, saved ground through the
turn, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest in the final sixteenth. PRAY FOR SNOW was forwardly placed in the
early going, tracked the moderate pace three then two wide on the turn, chased the winner to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. JERSEY STAR
chased the early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung two wide into the drive, came in tight and lacked room in mid-stretch, lost ground inside
of the furlong marker and did not produce the needed late response. CAUSEWAY GIRL settled three wide off of the early pace, lost position in upper stretch
and was not a threat. FREED BY MAGIC chased the early fractions, raced two wide in pursuit on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the
late stages.

Footnotes
TORPEDO AWAY tracked the fast early pace, was well placed while along the rail on the turn, angled out to go two wide in upper stretch, gained ground
nearing the furlong marker, made a grinding rally to confront DARNQUICK in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. DARNQUICK was
hustled to the early lead, set a fast pressured pace to the turn, shook free and extended the lead nearing the quarter marker, held foes at bay to the eighth
pole, met the bid of TORPEDO AWAY nearing the sixteenth-marker, was bested by the winner in the final strides and held for second at the end. OUR
BOLD PRINCE hopped at the start, recovered to stalk the fast fractions heading to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the
drive, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held well for show in the end. JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR was allowed to settle while never far back, raced
outside of rivals on the turn, mounted a five wide rally in upper stretch, closed fast in deep stretch but could not impact the leaders in the late stages.
BIARRITZ was asked to show early speed and pressed the pacesetter to the turn, chased from the inside nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. PAPAPIFAS chased the fast early pace, came three wide approaching the top of the lane, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally.

VRONSKY FEINT was unhurried in the early going, loomed three then four wide on the far turn, chased IMPERIAL CREED to mid-stretch, closed
determinedly inside of the furlong marker, overtook the runner-up in deep stretch and inched away in the final strides. IMPERIAL CREED rated just off of the
early pace, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, challenged for the lead approaching the top of the lane, took command and drew clear nearing the
furlong marker, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and held for second in the end. VINCERO GRANDE stalked the solid early fractions, saved
ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, found racing room in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and held well late to be
clear for third. MISS MAIA was allowed to settle while in the second flight, lacked room while two wide nearing the quarter marker, angled out three wide in
upper stretch, improved position inside of the furlong grounds but was not able to make headway on the leaders in deep stretch. SACRED BEAUTY was
allowed to settle, saved ground through the backstretch run, swung four wide leaving the far turn, improved position nearing mid-stretch and produced a
mild late bid. MAGICAL THOUGHT was allowed to settle, came four wide along the first turn, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun on
the second turn while four wide, swung six wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. NAVY QUEEN was hustled to establish the early lead, set solid
prompted fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure on the far turn, was overtaken leaving the quarter marker and faltered in the stretch
run. DAMN THE TORPEDOES was away a step slowly, recovered to be prominent in the early going, prompted the solid fractions through the backstretch
run, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MACHO CHROME was off a step slow, then quickly sent to the lead, was roused at the head of the stretch and responded to win by a comfortable margin
under strong handling. RESERVENOTMET was close up early while holding the rail path, lost ground and fell back to nearly last position in to the turn,
began a rally passing the three furlong marker when eased to the two-path, was angled hard towards the inside in the final furlong but found his best stride
too late. INFERNAL TIGER broke out at the start and bumped BIG STUFF, found a good rhythm after traveling about a furlong, made some steady forward
progress through the turn, found some daylight passing the three-furlong pole and continued on with good run from that point while never a serious threat to
the winner. EYE CANDY RANDY broke well but ceded the lead to MACHO CHROME early, dogged that one from the outside, made a strong bid passing
the quarter pole but was repelled and tired in the final sixteenth. TIGER'S ARROW lacked early speed and was last in the early going, launched a bid just
past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the outside in the middle of the turn, swung six-wide into the stretch finished somewhat evenly to split the field.
AFRICAN PRINCE was mid-pack in the early going and within striking position down the backstretch, got a nice inside run through the turn while under
steady handling but was unable to make much of an impact in the late stages. BIG STUFF bumped at the start by INFERNAL TIGER, was near the rear of
the field after the break, remained in the 4-5 path through the turn, lost contact with the field past the three-furlong pole, angled back towards the rail,
entered the stretch still behind then swung out and managed to pass a couple of tired foes. OMMANEY BAY was pushed to get into the early pace mix,
tracked the pacesetters through the turn, made a run at the head of the stretch but tired in the final furlong. TIGERINTHETANK got a good break was in the
outside of the tracking pack down the backstretch, remained wide through the turn, angled over to the rail down the stretch but had nothing to offer late.
