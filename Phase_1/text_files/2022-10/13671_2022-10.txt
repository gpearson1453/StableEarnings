Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TEQUILA , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses and was up at the wire. STIMULUS MAKER
prompted the pace outside THE MAN TO SEE, overtook that one leaving the turn, opened up in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. KID BOURBON ,
squeezed back leaving the starting gate, raced between horses in the stretch and rallied. FREDISATEN lacked speed, circled the turn four wide and passed
tired horses. ON THE ENGINE , well placed in the two path around the turn, gave way in the drive. THE MAN TO SEE set the pace along the inner rail and
gave way in upper stretch. UNDER FIRE hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. CURLIN LANE , three wide stalking the pace to the turn,
faltered.

Footnotes
MUGSY MALONE , bumped at the break, regrouped and was rated forwardly while about four wide, cruised up in hand past the three eighths to loom a
presence, went on the attack when roused soon after, sparred outside rivals leaving the three sixteenths, shook clear with a furlong remaining and steadily
widened while kept to task. ITS OVER , with the pace two wide, moved to engage the leader mid turn, dueled between runners past the quarter pole, stayed
on with the winner to about the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. SPRITZER disputed the pace inside, briefly went clear into the far turn, dug in when
confronted mid turn, battled inside rivals past the three sixteenths then faded. MYSTIFIED , bumped at the break, rated close up, steadied when getting out
a bit on the turn then came up empty. ICY MINISTER , bumped at the break, lagged back while saving ground and failed to generate a serious kick. EL
SEGUNDO stumbled to the front but was quickly overtaken, dropped off the pace, circled five wide under asking into the lane and faded. DIVINE LAW ,
bumped and pinched back leaving the gate, trailed in the clear leaving the chute then lost his rider when ducking in and hitting the rail with about six and a
half furlongs remaining. There was a stewards' inquiry into the run of DIVINE LAW but no action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN vied outside a rival, moved clear into the turn, moved away mid turn, kept on while well off the inside in mid stretch and prevailed
following an extended drive. GIRLS LOVE ME bobbled slightly at the break, regrouped and was rated off the pace and removed from the rail, commenced a
run leaving the three eighths, circled five wide with momentum into the lane, kept on grinding but just failed to reel in the winner. FAST BREAKIN CASH ,
between rivals early, gave chase off the rail around the turn but lacked a solid kick. UNCLE JEROME , three deep nearing the half mile marker, dropped
back some mid turn, shifted out and churned on with some interest. ZAEVION saved ground and edged up a bit to the inside of rivals past the five eighths,
was under a hustling ride mid turn but failed to generate a legitimate kick. NOTTOWAY vied inside the winner early on, angled out as that one cleared past
the half mile marker, gave hard chase around the turn, stayed on to upper stretch then faded.

GALLANT GOLD prompted three wide and outside the leader, moved up to engage after a half mile, dueled under rating around the turn, responded when
roused and shook clear in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling and just lasted. BURGEE rated close up while off the rail and behind the leaders,
came under a ride mid turn, swung five wide for the drive, ranged up to loom a major threat, kept on grinding and just missed. ROYAL SPY cleared early,
set the pace in about the two path, was joined around the far turn, sparred to the inside of the winner around the turn and into the lane, failed to kick on
nearing mid stretch and weakened. SUPER E , sluggish from the gate, was under urging soon after, failed to respond and dropped far back.

Footnotes
QUICK TEMPO quickly went clear, set a solid pace two wide and under rating, responded when set down soon into the lane, kept on under strong right
handed asking past mid stretch, drifted out a bit but dug in gamely to prove best. CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked three wide outside the winner, was put to
solid asking mid turn, failed to make inroads but kept on with good energy. IMPERIAL KING , off the pace two wide, shifted out past the three sixteenths and
offered a mild response. ETCHED IN STONE saved ground chasing the pace and faded. BILLINGSGATE , off last when breaking awkwardly, was outrun.
