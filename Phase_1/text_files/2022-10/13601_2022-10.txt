Footnotes
KJOS KID matched stride for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted out to the six path, drifted in when asked with a right handed whip bumping the
runner up then edged clear late under strong handling. SILENCING vied for the lead into the stretch, was bumped between rivals at the furlong marker
causing her rider to check then dug in late to finish clear for second. MY DANCING QUEEN battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, drifted out
bumping SILENCING at the furlong marker then was outfinished. INDY LITES had brief speed. CONTESSINA stumbled badly at the start and was no factor.
KENZIE'S SONG was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SILENCING LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF KJOS KID FOR INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KJOS KID AND
PLACED HER SECOND.

SO DIALED IN chased the pace into the stretch, inherited the lead before the furlong marker and drew off late under a strong hand ride. FLAT FUN
unhurried early, rallied through the stretch in the four path and finished clear for second. GOOD IDEA stalked the pace and went evenly. AYE AYE SIR
broke in front, set a quick pace along the inside into the stretch then tired. SURF AND TURF well placed, failed to respond. MOTATAABEQ failed to
menace. LAZARUS PROJECT was outrun. HEZA HANDFUL trailed.
