Footnotes
INTO BOURBON was hustled to the early lead, showed good speed while carving out quick fractions, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, drew off into
mid-stretch, felt pressure in the final sixteenth from the runner-up and held in a drive at the end. SPEED GRAZY broke in a tangle and was off slowly, raced
two wide on the turn, swung four wide into the drive, closed with a rush in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but was best of the
rest. LOVER BOY TOM was allowed to settle, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung three wide into upper stretch, was gaining in the late stages and
was clear for show. ALPHABETICAL chased the fast early pace, lost ground to the winner along the turn, pursued INTO BOURBON to mid-stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. OUR EMPIRE raced in the second flight to the turn, lost position while four wide on the turn and was not a factor. BUBBLES
IS ON FIRE was jostled at the start and was off slowly, trailed to the top of the lane, improved position in upper stretch but was not a late threat. SPLIT
ACES broke in at the start and bothered BUBBLES IS ON FIRE leaving the break, chased the fast early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
AUTISMS WORLD stumbled at the start but recovered nicely and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted by SUNNY SPOT, was
confronted by that rival nearing the quarter marker, held that one at bay to mid-stretch and determinedly prevailed while drifting in the final stages. SUNNY
SPOT broke alertly and showed early speed, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run, confronted AUTISMS WORLD nearing the top of
the lane, battled with that foe to mid-stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final sixteenth and was well clear of the rest for place. ORCZY
(IRE) was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, did not offer a late kick but passed a tiring rival late to secure show. WILL IS CHILL raced
close to the early pace, was rank on the first turn, settled into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace to the second turn, lost ground nearing
mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

CLASS PROOF broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set quick fractions to the turn, was in hand approaching the quarter marker, drew
clear nearing the furlong grounds and pulled away in the final sixteenth. TOM'S MOON was allowed to settle, advanced on the turn while saving ground,
chased CLASS PROOF to mid-stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the final furlong and stayed on well to hold for place. BALLROOM HUSTLER chased
the quick early pace from the second flight, swung six wide into upper stretch, closed well late and was up for show in the final strides. GREGS CITY ZIP
chased the quick early pace from a two wide path, swung five wide into the drive, was gaining in the final furlong and just missed for show in the final
strides. SHORT RIB showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, raced two wide between rivals to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in
upper stretch and gave way. TIZ A THRILL threw his head at the break and was off a step slowly, gained ground three wide on the turn, chased to
mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. DRUMADOON was forwardly placed to the turn, raced four wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR stalked the early pace while three deep, maintained position to the quarter marker, gained ground while chasing the leaders to
mid-stretch, responded when asked in deep stretch and found more in the final strides to prevail. FOREIGN PROTOCOL showed early speed and pressed
the pace, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, was confronted by HORSE DOCTOR inside of the
furlong marker, met that bid to the final stages and was outfinished, while holding for place. WINDRIBBON bumped DEFENSE WINS leaving the start,
settled off of the solid early fractions, improved position four wide on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker, gained ground in deep stretch but was
outkicked by the top pair and held safely at the end for third. DEFENSE WINS was bumped at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going,
came three wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and made a late bid in the final sixteenth. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS hopped at the start
and was off a bit slowly, recovered to chase the solid pace from the second flight, waited for racing room leaving the turn and did not produce a late
response. MARQUE IT UP was hustled leaving the start and set the solid early pace, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by
FOREIGN PROTOCOL and chased that rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final stages and gave way. CLAIM OF PASSION lacked early
speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
TRULY A MESS was sent leaving a good beginning and dictated terms to the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, turned away that rival
approaching the stretch run, drew clear into mid-stretch and kept to task in the final sixteenth. BOLD DAUGHTER settled off of the fast early fractions while
not far back, came three wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed inside of the eighth pole and held safely at the end for second. AIRKITA
showed early speed and pressed the fast early fractions, advanced to confront TRULY A MESS nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in that effort
and held well for third in the late stages. FUNKY GREY was allowed to settle, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive, made a
mild late bid and challenged for third in the final strides. JACKIE SERMON tracked the fast early fractions from the second flight, could not keep pace in
upper stretch and weakened. FLYING SYLVIA was unhurried in the early going, came three wide along the turn and did not have an impact. NAUGHTY
FLIRT was away slowly and lagged in the early stages, came four wide into the drive and was not a factor. MOTHERS DREAM lost her path at the break
and was off slowly, lacked early speed while saving ground and was not a late threat.

Footnotes
DON'T TELL HYDEE was well placed in the early stages, gained ground while stalking the pace nearing the quarter marker, mounted a two wide bid in
upper stretch, overtook AMAAZA nearing the furlong marker, was full of run in deep stretch and charged to the wire as much the best. AMAAZA broke
alertly and showed good early speed, drew clear nearing the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, could not hold off the winner in upper stretch, was
no match for DON'T TELL HYDEE in deep stretch and stayed on in the end to hold for place. ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD was forwardly placed early on,
advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch run, weakened in the drive but held well in the end to secure the show. MISS
ARROWHEAD chased from the second flight, improved position while three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. STAND
IN YOUR LOVE saved ground while chasing the solid early fractions, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. ALL chased from the second
flight in the early going, improved position three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the drive and gave way inside of the furlong marker. ALESHA threw
her head at the start, was off slowly and lagged in the early stages, came three wide to the quarter marker, showed late interest but was unable to threaten.
CLOCHARD STREET chased from the rear, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung five wide into the drive and was not a factor.

HARCYN broke alertly and was sent to contest the early lead, set a pressured pace through the turn while carving out fast fractions, found more in upper
stretch, drew clear nearing the furlong grounds and pulled away in deep stretch in an impressive debut. MATT'S MONSTER settled off of the quick early
fractions, improved position two wide on the turn, was blocked nearing the top of the lane, found room in mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in the
final sixteenth but made a mild late gain and was second best in the end. STRUT ON LOUIE disputed the early pace, pressed HARCYN through quick
fractions to the quarter marker, lost ground to that foe nearing the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for show. RACHEL'S
COACH showed early speed, stalked the pace while four wide on the turn, chased the winner to mid-stretch and gave way. AUTUMN WORK settled off of
the quick pace, was never far back while saving ground on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late response. LANGSTON ROAD chased the
fast early pace from the second flight, lost position while three wide nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run. TACOMA SOUND hopped at the
start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early going, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide into the drive and was not a late
threat. CAPTIVATING BOY showed early speed and disputed the quick early pace, stalked the pace on the turn while five wide, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired. MOONLIGHTNWINE hesitated at the start and was off slowly, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. UPDRAFT lacked early
speed, lost contact nearing the quarter marker and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S ALIBI was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the turn while trailing, navigated through traffic in mid-stretch while advancing,
angled out in deep stretch, made a late surge to take command in the final strides and held the runner-up at bay to prevail in a game win. SHOULD BE
ILLEGAL raced in the second flight early on while settling off of the pace, improved position two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, advanced in
mid-stretch, finished well and vied for the lead in the final strides but was outclosed by the winner and was up for second on the wire. ALMANERA (IRE)
broke out a bit at the start and crowded GERLACH'S, showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, gained ground two wide nearing the quarter
marker, battled with PLAYING HARDBALL to mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was all out in deep stretch, could not hold off the
oncoming top pair and was just edged for place, while holding for show at the end. GERLACH'S was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried in the early going, came two wide along the turn, came in tight approaching the top of the lane, found room inside of the furlong marker and found
his best stride late. HANDSOME GARY was well placed in the early stages, came three wide off of the turn and did not produce a late rally. MR. MISCHIEF
tracked the quick early fractions, was asked for a run while three wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and did not offer a late response. PLAYING
HARDBALL broke alertly and showed good early speed to set the pace to the turn, set quick fractions to the top of the lane, battled with ALMANERA to
mid-stretch and faded late. AWESOME DUDE was allowed to settle, raced three then two wide on the turn and was not a late factor. GREAT STORY was
hustled to show early speed, pressed the fast early pace through the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY PRINCE bobbled a few strides after the break, lagged well behind the field early, saved ground through the turn, awaited some room at the
head of the stretch then swung wide into the clear, inhaled the field in matter of strides and won going away in a very impressive debut. PAPA TIGER was
hard sent for the early lead, ran unopposed through the turn, widened his lead in the stretch and was caught late by the eventual winner but finished well
clear of the rest of the field. BLAZEN GRAZEN off a step slow, chased the leading pack down the backstretch and through the turn while under constant
handling, continued to gain ground through the stretch but was never a threat to the top two. COUNT ASHER broke alertly and raced with, and to the
outside of HEZA VALENTINE, was pushed to keep up when that one started to inch away past the half-mile marker, eventually caught that foe and ran on
evenly through the stretch. AWESOME MOVE tracked the early pace, was put into a drive near the three-furlong pole, made some forward progress and
loomed a threat turning for home but raced greenly while on the wrong lead and lost ground late. HEZA VALENTINE broke alertly but did not join the early
pace, angled over to the rail approaching the turn, was making a mild bid but could not sustain any forward momentum in the stretch. SIXTYFOUR G T O hit
the gate and ducked out after the break, raced near the rear of the pack and wide, was hard-ridden from the five furlong pole but never managed to improve
position. PARTY FOUL broke well and was pushed to join the early pace, was content to sit behind PAPA TIGER for the first quarter mile, moved off the rail
approaching the turn, chased that one through the turn but tired badly in the stretch.
