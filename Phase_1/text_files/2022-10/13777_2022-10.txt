Footnotes
FRIDAY'S AT SHADY was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run, overtook the pacesetter nearing the
quarter marker, drew clear nearing mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages. IMPLICITLY saved ground while stalking the early fractions, came three
wide on the far turn while improving position, chased the winner to mid-stretch, could not make headway in the final furlong but was best of the rest.
ENGRAM was unhurried in the early stages, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was well clear for third in the final
sixteenth. BROKEN FINGER was hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions while pressed by the winner through the backstretch run, was overtaken
midway through the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
HOW ABOUT A FRESCA was off a step slowly and took back off of the early speed, tracked the moderate pace while never far back on the turn, circled
four then five wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly inside of the eighth pole, took a narrow advantage inside of the sixteenth-marker and held sway in
the final strides. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE rated off of the early pace, tracked the leaders from the rail on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, battled against
the winner in the final sixteenth, was outfinished in the final strides and was second best in the end. MADAME GAZELLE showed speed and established the
early lead, set moderate fractions while pressed through the turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken by the top pair and gave
way in deep stretch while clear of the rest for third. YODERANDO was away alertly, took back to track the early fractions, gained ground three wide on the
turn, chased to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. LADY ATTA TUDE was hustled leaving the break, pressed the pace to the turn, chased two wide
nearing the top of the lane, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and tired late.

STRETCH RUN broke alertly then took back off of the quick early fractions, stalked the pace outside of rivals on the turn, mounted a four wide bid in upper
stretch, responded to urging inside of the furlong marker and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. HANDR'SDREAM was crowded leaving the start
and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the quick early pace while two wide, improved position on the turn, mounted an inside rally in upper stretch, closed well
in the late stages, could not reel in the winner and was up for second in the final strides. ARMA D'ORO stalked the early fractions, gained ground two wide
nearing the top of the lane, continued that advance to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was clear for show. STANFORD BAY was sent
to the early lead, set fast fractions through the turn, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals late and gave way. CHIEF JACKSON
chased the fast early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and did not threaten in the stretch run. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was forwardly placed early
on, chased the quick pace two wide to the turn, came three wide into the drive, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and tired late. ZOE'S PAPA CEE broke out
at the start and bothered HANDR'SDREAM, lacked early speed and was outrun.

STRENGTH OF AUTISM rated off of the fast early fractions, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch,
took a narrow lead leaving the furlong marker and held under firm urging in deep stretch over the oncoming runner-up. DOGE OF VENICE was unhurried in
the early going, raced two wide through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, found his best stride late, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch
and held safely for place. IN HONOR OF AUTISM was crowded leaving the start, chased the pace from the inside, steadied in tight quarters nearing the top
of the lane, tipped out two wide for the drive, finished well in deep stretch and was up for third in the final strides. APLOMBADO lacked early speed, chased
from the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for show in the final strides. MARKS
HIP was forwardly placed in the early going, pressed the quick pace on the turn, chased in pursuit to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. PIPER'S
CAUSEWAY raced close to the early speed, came three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, made a mild gain nearing the furlong grounds
but could not sustain that run late and gave way. GALLIVANTER was hard sent to establish the early lead leaving the break, set a pressured and fast pace
to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
AMERICA GREAT was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, was confronted by DESERT DUDE
nearing the quarter marker, repelled that foe leaving the second turn, drew clear into mid-stretch and pulled away in the final sixteenth. DESERT DUDE
stalked the moderate pace three wide on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, confronted AMERICA GREAT nearing the quarter
marker, was turned away in that effort leaving the second turn, chased the winner in the drive and held for second. ROCKTILLYOUDROP was allowed to
settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong
and stayed on late to secure show. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY settled in the second flight, was carried out when COOLCROSS clipped heels and lost the rider
on the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch run, advanced three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, could not sustain that run in the
drive and weakened. WALKING BOSS was hustled in the early stages, pressed the pace into the backstretch run, prompted the moderate fractions through
the backstretch run, could not keep pace on the far turn and gave way. SYNC hopped at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried while three wide
through the backstretch run, was asked for a response on the second turn and was not a late factor. COOLCROSS was forwardly placed into the first turn,
came in tight midway through the turn, clipped heels, lost the rider and walked off under his own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT INVOLVING COOLCROSS ON THE FIRST TURN. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT COOLCROSS CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES WHEN
CLIPPING HEELS AND UNSEATING THE RIDER AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BIG SPIN off a step slowly, was allowed to settle while saving ground, was roused four wide on the far turn, circled seven wide in upper stretch, closed well
inside of the furlong marker, caught TEX HANLEY in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. TEX HANLEY rated off of the solid early
fractions, raced two wide to the second turn, took command in upper stretch, drew clear nearing the sixteenth-marker, was all out in the final strides and was
nailed on the line for the win. RIO KING was allowed to settle, raced two wide to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, found his best stride
late and rallied for show in the final sixteenth. LOOKOUT POINT was unhurried early on, came four wide into the second turn, angled in to the two path
nearing the top of the lane, improved position in upper stretch, could not impact the leaders in deep stretch but closed willingly in the final stages. BIG
SWEDE broke alertly and contested the pace to the first turn, drifted entering the turn, recovered to duel on the front end through the backstretch run,
carved out solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by TEX HANLEY nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the final furlong. RING
GENERAL was forwardly placed in the early stages, saved ground while tracking the dueling pacesetters through the backstretch run, advanced along the
rail nearing the top of the lane, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and flattened out. PICK BYMY FRIEND was away slowly, settled off of the solid early
fractions, was steered four then five wide on the second turn and was not a threat in the stretch run. PLAISIR was asked to show early speed and disputed
the pace with BIG SWEDE through the backstretch run, set solid fractions while dueling with that foe to the quarter marker, lost ground nearing mid-stretch
and tired late. PRACTICAL IMPACT was shuffled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to race in the second flight while saving ground through
the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. VANDENBERG settled three wide off of the early pace,
advanced three then four wide on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not offer a late response.

CONUNDRUM crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, circled the field to go
seven wide into upper stretch, loomed in mid-stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker and powered home late. ETHAN'S ANIMAL settled off
of the early pace, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive, advanced in mid-stretch, could not match strides with the
winner in the late stages and was up in the final strides to secure the place. MR. MASON tracked the moderate pace three wide, swung four wide leaving
the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was just edged for place in the final strides and held for show. MIKE DAD traded bumps with ALWAYS LITT leaving the
break, dueled with that foe through moderate early fractions, was set down for the drive, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and gave way.
SUMO chased the pace from the second flight, saved ground to the top of the lane, lost position nearing the furlong grounds and did not offer a late rally.
ALWAYS LITT exchanged bumps with MIKE DAD at the start, dueled with that rival while setting moderate fractions through the turn, was asked for more
run nearing the eighth pole and tired in the final furlong. BROOKYS TAPIT stalked the early pace, raced two wide between rivals on the turn, could not keep
pace in upper stretch and weakened late.

Footnotes
AMANOFMYSTATURE settled off of the early fractions, raced two wide to the quarter marker, improved position in upper stretch, closed with a rush in deep
stretch, confronted DISKO TRIBUTE in the final strides and won the nod on the wire. DISKO TRIBUTE stalked the early pace, gained ground two wide on
the turn, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, drifted while all out in deep stretch, met the bid of the winner in
the final strides and was gamely bested on the wire. SHARONA'S WILD BOY showed early speed and was forwardly placed, lost ground on the turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and just held for show in the final strides. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS broke in the air and spotted the
field leaving the start, came four wide into the turn, mounted a seven wide rally in upper stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for third in the
final strides. TERRY'S BOY tracked the early pace three deep, gained ground in upper stretch, altered course in deep stretch when crowded by the drifting
DISKO TRIBUTE, did not offer the needed late response and just missed for third in the end. DIAMOND RANGER chased the moderate fractions four wide
on the turn, swung five wide into the drive and lacked a late rally. GABBY HAYES bobbled at the start, spotted the field leaving the break and chased from
the rear early on, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide into upper stretch and did not threaten. RICKENBACHER broke alertly and was
sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, led to mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals inside of the furlong marker and tired
late.

SHARAC (GB) broke well, angled over the rail down the backstretch, got a dream trip through the turn, opened up a big lead in the stretch was able to hold
off a late challenge while under steady handling. LIVING WITH AUTISM was hustled out of the gate, backed off the early speed duel, responded when
asked to pick up the pace past the half-mile marker, loomed behind horses at the top of the stretch, swung out and bumped PETE'S INFERNO near the
three-sixteenth pole, was gaining on the leader but came up a bit short in a good effort. PETE'S INFERNO broke well but could not keep pace early, raced
mid-pack through the turn, made a four-wide bid on the turn, emerged widest of six across the track, bumped with LIVING WITH AUTISM near the
three-sixteenth pole, ran on well to gain third. LIL INDIAN ANGEL chased the pacesetters to the turn, started to make a move on the leaders while four
wide, loomed a threat but was unable to sustain the bid and finished evenly. DIZZY DAZMURA threw her head and lunged at the break, spotting the field
several lengths, regained contact past the seven sixteenths marker, made a sweeping move while four or five wide around the turn and passed a few late
despite racing greenly down the lane. CAL ROUGH brushed slightly by JEANIE'S SWAN after the break, kept to the two-path through the turn, was put in
tight quarters by LASSAROCK approaching the stretch and in turn bothered JEANIE'S SWAN to her inside, made some moderate progress while being kept
to task to the wire. LASSAROCK broke near the rear, was asked to pick up the pace passing the half mile pole, was behind a wall of horses through the
turn, attempted to find an inside path at the top of the stretch putting CAL ROUGH in tight quarters, angled to the outside for running room but lacked a
needed response. RAGTIME GIRL broke sharply, set the early fractions to the outside of SUMMER PUDDING to stretch but could not sustain her forward
momentum and faltered. JEANIE'S SWAN outrun early, got an inside trip down the backstretch and through the turn, was brushed by CAL ROUGH at the
head of the stretch while attempting to launch a bid but was outrun. SUMMER PUDDING broke a step slow but quickly advanced to share the early lead
with RAGTIME GIRL to the top of the stretch where she was surrounded by challengers and began a steady fade to to the back of the pack.
