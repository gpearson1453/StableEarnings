Footnotes
OUR STRONG VOWS stalked the pace from the inside, moved up three to four wide into the upper stretch, shifted in to race near the rail and just got up
strong pressure. MELIPONINI BEE settled off the early going, moved up two to three wide in the stretch run, split rivals approaching the eighth pole and
rallied gamely to the wire. ROMANOSA (GB) pressed the pace from the outside of Rock Rose and finished willingly to the wire. ROCK ROSE showed good
early speed to set the early pace from the inside, drifted deep stretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. QUEEN CASHMERE chased the early pace
from the outside of foes and kept on to the wire. PATTY CAKES raced off the early pace, was near the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch,
angled out nearing the three sixteenth pole and closed in belatedly. ICE COLD GOLD settled off the early pace, raced five deep into the upper stretch and
raced evenly with no rally. RIBALDRY (IRE) settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a rally. PRAY FOR THE U S A
stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
MAURITIUS showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing just off the inside, raced in hand down the backstretch around the far turn, roused
through the upper stretch and held safe to be clear late under steady handling. CRACK THE CODE tracked the pace from the outside, raced three to four
wide in the drive and finished second best. BENKEI settled off the early going along the inside, moved up two wide around the far turn and moved up to
improve position. FLAVIAN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on along the inside and weakened. PHRA PHROM raced off the pace, was two to
three deep around the far turn, angled out through the stretch run and had not enough. MO MONEY MO BETTA was bumped soundly at the start, raced
mid pack early, was five to six deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. PAUL P broke in sharply at the start, bumped rival, raced five wide near the
three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
COMBAT QUEEN showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing two deep and raced well clear while under a strong hand ride. LA CASA D'ORO
stalked the pace while racing between rivals, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. WHO KNOWS WHAT raced off the
early pace, was two deep near the quarter pole, angled widest through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. SMART EULEE settled off the
early pace, moved four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. FUHGEDDABOUDIT pressed the early going from the inside and weakened.
RED QUEEN was void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
MISTY'S LASS dueled for the early lead while racing from the outside of foes, drifted through the stretch run and prevailed under all out pressure. INTO
DISCO rated to race in hand early, moved up through the upper stretch, angled out nearing the three sixteenths pole, bothered Saucy and In Her cups, an
objection was filed by In Her Cups and stewards disqualified Into Disco and placed place fifth for interference. SISTER MAC tracked the early duel from the
inside and finished willingly to the wire. IN HER CUPS settled to race mid pack early on, moved up far turn, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch,
steadied near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in late and moved up. SAUCY stalked the duel from the outside of rivals, forced out near the three sixteenths
pole and had not enough. RICH GIFT was off a step slow, raced off the early pace, was three to four wide while racing between rivals in the stretch run and
had no late rally. AMAGE was slow early to race at the back of the pack early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. BLUE
MOON BUNNY raced off the early pace, raced two wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. ART I SOMETHING dueled for the early lead from the
inside and gave way.

encouragement. GALLANT GOLD showed good early foot while racing two deep early and was no match for the winner in the drive. GHOSTLIGHTER rated
early on, raced four wide around the far turn, angled widest through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. BOMBOLONI was shuffled at the start, stalked
the pace while racing between and weakened while racing three wide. AWARD NOMINATED broke to the outside, bumped rival, raced four to five wide in
the drive and had no late rally. FORTH was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and weakened the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
PHAROAH'S SONG was rated along the inside down the backstretch, angled four wide to race from the outside of Tequilera and finished well to get up
under strong handling. TEQUILERA showed good early foot to set the early pace, was clear near the eighth pole, dug in and gave way grudgingly. GALILEI
settled off the early going, raced four wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position. BECKON tracked the pace from the outside and weakened
in the drive. YARBOROUGH was unhurried early on, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and moved up. CORINNA raced off the early pace, was
four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. DAWN stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and had no late run. WITTY
BANTER was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, was five to six deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. KITTEN WITH A WHIP
dropped back early and failed to respond. SWIFT ACTION raced up close early, was near the inside around the far turn and tired.
