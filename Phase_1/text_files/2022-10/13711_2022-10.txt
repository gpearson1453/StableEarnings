Footnotes
SONG SPECTACULAR challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and was kept to the task. RUSSET
MOON unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. WAR ZONG
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. MOONSHINE MAX raced within striking distance, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
CHELSEA'S GLORY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. ISLE CALL U LATER pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn
and weakened. OAK HILL MO void of early speed and passed tired ones late. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER went to the front, raced outside around the turn
and faded. HEZA BREEZIN always raced near the back and showed little. AMANDAS NEW MAN raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was no
threat late.

Footnotes
EYE DEE KAY unhurried in the beginning, raced inside around the final turn, made a late rail bid, dueled and prevailed for the win. LIFE IS A BANQUET
challenged on the front end throughout, racing with MATTS FIRE N ICE throughout, dueled late and was outfinished. MATTS FIRE N ICE went to the front,
drove clear early, dueled to the wire and was outfinished. GHOST COWBOY pressed the pace, had an outside trip and proved no match for the top three.
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS raced near the back and was never a factor. FLAT OUT AMERICAN void of early speed and was never a threat. SMART
ANALYSIS lacked early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
JOSAN raced within contention, took command, drove clear around the final turn, drifted out leaving the turn, came back in and won under steady urging.
PRINCE PERFECTA raced within striking distance, made a late bid, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. CATINANDSCATIN unhurried in the
beginning, made a late bid, but proved no match for the top two. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor.
ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL raced in the middle of the field, finished evenly and lacked a late kick. FLAT OUT FABIO went to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and faded. JOHNNY JUDE pressed the early pace and was finished early. CIGAR VAN stumbled at the start, was never close and eased to the
wire. LAMONT broke poorly, racing in the rear, trailed the field and was distanced.

Footnotes
CYBER SNEAKER pressed the pace, moved up around the final turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. FISH N CHICK went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground around the second turn, couldn't keep up with the winner down the lane, but was a clear second. SHE'S MY PRIORITY raced within striking
distance, came around the second turn on the outside, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. SOCIAL DATE lacked early speed, came around
the second turn on the outside, moved up, but was no factor. MISS CHECKMARK pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn and faded.
CHICKEN OR THE EGG lacked early speed, came around the first turn on the outside and was never a factor. SHREW GRIT raced within contention, faded
and was no threat late. VENUS ISLAND always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
PRIZELESS vied for the early lead, drove clear and finished well. GRUNT bumped at the start, dueled for the early lead, drifted out down the home stretch,
proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. MUCHO MARVIN raced within striking distance, made a bid down the stretch, was forced out,
getting in tight quarters and finished third at the wire. I'LL RAISE YOU lacked early speed, made a late wide gain, but was no factor. IRON IN THE FIRE
raced near the middle of the field, eased back, made a late gain, but was no factor. KAHAAL bumped at the start, challenged for the early lead and faded.
OCEOLA lacked early speed and was never a threat. FIERY PLAYBOY showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. IT'S A BIRD
always raced near the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #5 MUCHO MARVIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 GRUNT FOR
INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #6 FROM 2ND AND PLACED HIM THIRD.
