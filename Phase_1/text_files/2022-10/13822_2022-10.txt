Footnotes
MERCURY TEN pressed Only Child from the inside down the backstretch, dug in inside the eighth pole while continuing in an inside bid and proved best
under strong handling. ONLY CHILD showed good early foot to set the early pace from the outside of foe and kept on to the wire in a game effort.
CHERRYS CROSS was bumped at the start, stalked the top pair from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire. GANDHI'S ORION broke in, bumped
Cherry Cross at the start, settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly with no final run. SO THERE settled off the early
pace, raced near the inside and lacked a rally. SETTE STELLE was unhurried early, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
BACKATYA waited off the duel, in hand and three wide around the turn, shifted way wide leaving the quarter pole, seven wide all out drive, up late.
BOURBON OVER ICE raced off the duel, and three deep into turn, moved inside around the turn, picked up the pace from the top of the lane, good energy
along the inside through the wire. MY LAST MISSION clean start from the outside, moved up into dueling outside position around the turn, between runners
locked in battle through the stretch, stayed on willingly. TURNPIKE BOB step slow at the start, coaxed into the lead from the inside, dueled around the turn,
even late. BAAGY tracked off the pace, moved up around the turn along the inside, shifted four wide top of the lane for clear run, stayed in the mix while
running on the left lead, tried through the wire. KARNAK slow away from the gate, angled in soon after the start, outrun. SILVER R slow start, no threat.

Footnotes
DANCER'S MELODY was off slowly, void of early speed to race at the back of the pack after the troubling start, made a steady advance through the far
turn, experienced traffic nearing the three sixteenths pole, angled out and finished well to get up under steady handling. DECOUPAGE dueled for the early
lead from the outside of Heart Full of Soul, had a narrow lead near the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late in willing effort. VICS
COOL CAT raced off the early pace, altered out through the upper stretch around Ghost Maiden and surged late in a belated rally. HEART FULL OF SOUL
dueled from the inside of rival while racing well off the inside, dropped downed to the inside around the far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
KIRBY was coaxed along early, raced between, checked slightly nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late
rally. Jockey of Kirby claimed objection against Decoupage and Lady Jean for interference through the far turn and stewards ruled no change. LADY JEAN
chased the pace from the outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run. GHOST MAIDEN raced off the early pace, was
pulled up through the upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ELOQUIST raced off the pace and along the inside, waited for que entering the far turn, day light opened inside turning for home, quickly accelerated, went
clear under a steady drive. GOLDEN JUAN used early speed to grab the lead and inside position around the first turn, raced on the lead into far turn,
pressure came from inside rival nearing the furlong marker, could not fend off that foe, stayed on well for the place. GUILLAUME tracked three path first
turn, raced off the pace and four deep into far turn, moved up while outside leaving the quarter pole, willingly through the stretch. HANALEI'S HOUDINI out
of the picture for most of the contest, started to gain ground from along the inside nearing the top of the lane, steady progress through the wire. PRACTICAL
COACH tracked the leader into far turn, saved ground second, faded through the stretch. HIGHWAY BOUND raced near the front around the first turn, in
range just off the rail into far turn, outrun late. HELMS DEEP between runners around first turn, shifted out five wide down the backside, no threat through

Footnotes
SILVER PHANTOM dueled from the inside, dug in deep stretch while continuing an inside bid and prevailed under strong encouragement. HALF BROTHER
settled to the middle of the pack, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in late and finished
gamely to the wire. CESAR was unhurried early on, moved up six wide near the quarter pole and closed in well late to improve position. HOP AND
SCOTCH raced off the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. POP SOCKS chased the pace from the
inside, raced two path near the quarter pole and raced evenly late. HOPPERNESS was void of early speed, moved up from the inside around the far turn,
shifted five wide and had not enough in the drive. WHISKIED UP was allowed to settle early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch, angled widest
through the lane and had not enough in the drive. ESTILO CLASICO dueled from the outside of rival and gave way in the drive. GODS GLORY was
forwardly placed to lay up close and failed to sustain a bid. HE'S ABOSS was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, saved ground and never was
a factor.

Footnotes
U CANT HANDLE THIS took control soon after the start, very easy tempo down the backside, under a drive always clear through the wire. VIOLET JESSOP
shuffled back soon after the start, strolled along way back down the backside, split foes leaving the quarter pole, shifted inside, gaining good ground late.
HOLDING COURT wide trip around the first turn, raced wide and off the pace into the far turn, three wide pursuit around the far turn, stayed on well for the
show money. CRYSTAL ORB tracked middle pack into far turn, moved up along the inside nearing the quarter pole, raced evenly through the wire. MAY
BEAU raced well off the pace into far turn, quick shift outside, gained around the turn, bid stalled while racing on the left lead late. SAINTS VICTORY
tracked along three wide into far turn, between runners nearing the quarter pole, bumped at the eighth pole, no late bid. MS BOOMBASTIC raced well off
the pace into far turn, drifted out leaving the quarter pole, empty. EXPECT A CIRCUS raced along the inside just off the pace into far turn, outrun through
the stretch. CHALLENGE PRINCESS stalked the pace setter from the three path into the far turn, outrun through the lane.
