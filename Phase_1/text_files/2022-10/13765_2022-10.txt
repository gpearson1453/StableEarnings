Footnotes
CALIFORNIA TWIRL set the pace inside of a vying rival, disposed of that foe as another rival took up the challenge entering the far turn, sparred with that
bidder around that bend, repelled him and drew clear in upper stretch, then tired in the final furlong as an oncharging rival closed in, yet lasted. MAMBA
FOREVER tracked four wide around the first turn, chased the top pair from the three path around the far turn, then stayed on in pursuit of the clear leader in
the final furlong, quickly closed the margin in the late stages, but ran out of ground. CONNECT ME tracked two wide and between horses, came under a
drive approaching the far turn, shifted to the three path and between horses entering the bend to surpass a faltering foe, then stayed on inside of rivals
through the lane to reach show in the final sixteenth. KLIMTOMANIAC broke a steps slowly, trailed three to two wide, and moved up. OUT OF ALCATRAZ
stalked along the inside, but faded under a drive around the far turn. LED TASSO stalked three wide, bid outside of the eventual winner into the far turn,
sparred with that foe around that bend, but weakened in upper stretch. HE'S A GOOD DANCER lacked speed in the three to five paths, and made little
impact. GREAT RAIN was briefly fractious loading, then broke slowly, raced far back two to three wide, and failed to factor. RILEY BEE settled far back
along the inside, cut the gap on the main group entering the backstretch, moved four wide and between horses into the far turn but tired thereafter.
WESLAN vied two wide, but wilted between horses with seven sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
FRIGID LADY stalked two wide and between horses, tipped to the three path and ranged up outside of a leading MISCHIEVOUS GAL nearing the lane,
dueled with that foe through upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong pole, and drew clear. MISCHIEVOUS GAL vied for the lead three to two wide,
led around the turn, dug in to resist FRIGID LADY's outer bid entering the lane, dueled with that foe before being headed at the furlong pole, and was
second best. QUEENANNE'SREVENGE tracked in midpack three wide and between horses, tucked two wide in upper stretch before tipping back outside of
VALIANT PRAISE entering the final furlong, then split foes and stayed to surpass that rival for show in the final sixteenth. VALIANT PRAISE tracked in
midpack in the two path, chased between horses entering the lane to claim show at the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by another rival for that
position in the final sixteenth. FLOWERDEW tracked three wide, but yielded while drifting four wide entering the lane, then kept on. TIZNOW MAMA vied for
the lead between horses before clearing an inner rival at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with her outer counterpart approaching the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened. INSPECTOR PENNY trailed along the inside, them moved up between horses. WEEHAWKEN tracked in midpack four wide, floated
five wide entering the lane, and tired. ROYAL DAME lacked speed along the inside despite rider urging, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and
made little impact. DOOIT bumped an inner rival at the start, laid close up along the inside before backing off to stalk nearing the turn, but faded around the
bend. RUN AND GUN took a bump from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
YOU MAKE ME HAPPY set the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path while meeting a pair of outer bids entering the lane, and held gamely. BET
HE'S READY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader and to the four path entering the lane to attempt a bid between horses, but hung.
SUPREMELY stalked three wide and between horses, floated to the five path entering the lane while ranging up to the top pair, but only managed to chase
them thereafter. STAND FOR FREEDOM broke a step slowly and bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, shifted to the six path entering
the lane, and moved up. INSOLITO laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. DERIVATIVE laid off of the pace in the three path and between
horses, cut the corner at the rear entering the lane, and made little impact. YOLO SANTIAGO was tough to load, pressed two wide and between horses,
then weakened turning for home. NIMRODS broke slowly while taking a bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, but weakened.

Footnotes
PASS THE PLATE bobbled a bit at the start, rated at the rear along the inside, patiently bided her time until entering the lane, rallied behind the leading
group in the final furlong, split the leaders two wide in the final sixteenth, and got up late. CURLY RUTH stalked along the inside, tipped to the four path in
upper stretch, grinded away in midstretch to attempt a bid outside of the leading pair in the final furlong, but leveled off while getting outkicked by an inner
bidder in the final sixteenth, and narrowly achieved place. PARK AVENUE set the pace along the inside, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch,
led from a trio of rivals entering the final sixteenth, but was caught late before getting nailed for place. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT pressed two wide, vied in the
three path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in the late stages. MADONE got caught in the four path while off of the pace around
the first turn, ranged up three wide around the far turn, but floated to the five path in upper stretch, and chased evenly thereafter. YLIKEDIS tracked along
the inside, awaited racing room two wide around the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, but lacked a kick to split rivals through a very narrow seam
in upper stretch, and made no impact. FLIPPANT laid at the rear two to three wide, shifted in in upper stretch and failed to factor. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) got
antsy in the gate, tracked three wide, then weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
TWIRLED set the pace in the three path, glided away from a pressing foe while shifting to the five path entering the lane, widened while lightly roused
through upper stretch, then felt a right handed crop inside the final furlong before being put to wraps through the final sixteenth. POBLANO tracked along
the inside, grinded away up a vacated rail to gain place at the furlong grounds, and fended off an outer foe for that position through the late stages. EYES
OF GOLD chased from midpack three wide and between horses, came into the lane in the five path, stayed on to vie for place in the final sixteenth while not
threatening the leader, but was denied that position late. SHE'S FANCY hit the outer part of the gate while breaking slowly, laid off of the pace three wide,
but retreated despite rider encouragement nearing the turn, tucked entering the bend, then picked up stride entering the lane, and rallied while splitting foes
three wide in the final furlong to reach a minor share. CATSKILL HUMOR took back from between horses in the early stages to trail along the inside, shifted
to the four path entering the lane, and rallied between horses. RUTHLESS RUA chased along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, but lacked a
bid before faltering between horses in the final furlong. PUFFIN laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, and failed to factor. JAIKY chased two wide and
between horses, got floated to the four path entering the lane, and tired on her left lead. AMBER CASCADE tracked in midpack four wide, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, then yielded in midstretch. LILIESFORMILLIE leaned on the inner part of the gate while breaking slowly, then raced far back
three wide and made little impact. GAVINERA pressed the leader from the outside while kept in the four path by that foe around the turn, then faded turning
for home. FEARLESS VIV began to move about right before the gates sprung, then broke slowly while hopping at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUNITE perched himself outside of the embattled leading pair, ranged up to them approaching the five sixteenths pole, swept past nearing the lane, kicked
clear in upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. HOIST THE GOLD broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside while just off of the rail around
the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane to take aim outside of a newly leading GUNITE in upper stretch, but failed to threaten that one in the final furlong
while proving second best. B DAWK was tough to load, then broke a beat slowly, trailed the field four wide and outside of rivals, moved up five wide entering
the lane to claim show at the three sixteenths pole, and ran on. ARTORIUS was void of early speed while three wide and between horses around the turn,
and failed to menace. FRIAR LAURENCE laid off of the pace two wide, was blocked behind traffic in upper stretch, altered course outwardly in midstretch,
but failed to factor. OF A REVOLUTION dueled for the lead two wide, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid turning for home, and
weakened. PROVOCATEUR dueled for the lead along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and caved.

Footnotes
TOUCH OF CLASS tracked from midpack in the three path, darted to the seven path entering the lane to be outside of rivals, rallied to take aim on a clear
EMPRESS TIGER in the final furlong, and drove past her in the final sixteenth. EMPRESS TIGRESS dueled for the lead inside of a foe, shook clear in
upper stretch, flopped leads while holding sway entering the final furlong, but failed to resist an outer on-charging foe's bid in the final sixteenth, then lasted
for place. TWIRLING SAVI rated far back along the inside, shifted out to the eight path and outside of foes approaching midstretch, then rallied through the
final furlong to miss reaching place at the wire. MINUTE WALTZ chased along the inside, vied for place in midstretch, but was outkicked for that position
entering the final position, and got surpassed at the wire for show. SARA MIA exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the
pace, grinded away along the rail through midstretch, but was blocked behind traffic entering the final sixteenth, altered course three wide in the late stages,
and kept on between horses. THUNDER LOVE (GB) laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. STORM
KISS dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded while hanging on her left lead. SOLID TUNE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the five path in
upper stretch, but lacked a rally. ALWAYZ LATE was slow into stride, trailed two wide around the turn, and made little impact. HONOR THAT laid off of the
pace in the two to three path, and failed to factor. MUSED (GB) laid forwardly two to three wide and between horses, but failed to progress in upper stretch
before fading through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead. ARTOS (IRE) exchanged bumps with an inner foe at the start, stalked three to four
wide, but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ RYE TIME saved ground towards the rear, gained around the far turn, vacated the rail entering the lane only to surpass a faltering foe, then sustained a
charge up the fence to bid entering the final furlong, led at the sixteenth pole, and held. THE PRINCE'S SPUR stalked along the inside, shifted out before
coming into the lane in the five path, chased the leaders while inching closer, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, kept on to menace
outside of that foe in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. STRONG QUALITY pressed two wide, vied into the far turn as an outer ANEJO bid, got headed
by that foe around the far turn, gamely reclaimed an advantage while taking a brush from that foe in upper stretch, led while being brushed again coming to
the furlong grounds as foes on either side threatened, then got outkicked by those rivals entering the final sixteenth. GATE RUNNER tracked two wide and
between horses, chased three wide around the far turn, failed to keep pace in upper stretch before shifting to the seven path at the furlong grounds, and
improved. WAR CAMPAIGN tracked in midpack along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, then to the six path in upper stretch, and chased
mildly. ANEJO broke a step slowly and shied from an outer rival soon after, got caught in the five path while off of the pace around the first turn, tracked four
wide down the backstretch, bid for the lead three wide entering the far turn, claimed an advantage around that bend, but failed to kick away from his inner
counterpart entering the lane, brushed that foe while lugging in and hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, then weakened after doing the same again at
the furlong grounds. KISSALOT tracked three wide, pressed down the backstretch, but was outmoved into the far turn before weakening between horses
turning for home. FILM STAR was crowded among rivals at the start, tugged four wide while off of the pace, floated to the seven path entering the lane, and
caved in hand through the final furlong. HIGGINSON laid off of the pace in the two path and never got involved. DECLARE THE MOON brushed an inner
rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, and was outrun. C FALLS set the pace inside of a vying rival, but weakened inside of a pair of foes at the three
furlong pole.

Footnotes
WICKED HALO prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, took over in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. FINGAL'S CAVE
bumped with an inner rival before taking up from tight quarters between horses at the start, trailed, gained four wide around the turn, then sustained her
charge to reel in an outer rival for place in the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT STROLL tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home, but failed to keep pace
with the leader while vying for place in upper stretch, then got outfinished by an inner rallying rival for place in the late stages. FREEDOM SPEAKS pressed
two wide and between horsed, vied around the turn, but proved no match for her outer counterpart entering the lane, and yielded through the final furlong.
LAST LEAF took a bump from an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three paths around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane,
but gave way. SMASH TICKET was restless in the gates awaiting the start, set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes, then weakened inside of a trio of
rivals in upper stretch. COLORFUL MISCHIEF was void of speed in the two path, and made little impact. REPUBLIQUE was tough to load, chased two wide
while under strong urging early on, then faded three wide around the turn. UNION LAKE stalked along the inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole,
and wilted.

Footnotes
SHOGUN WARRIOR stalked two wide before tugging between the leading pair around the first turn to vie nearing the backstretch, sparred among foes
around the far turn, kicked clear of them in upper stretch, and held. MONJID saved ground in midpack, improved entering the lane, but bumped with an
outer PANCAKE HOUSE while bidding for place at the furlong grounds, vied for that position through the late stages, and prevailed while inching closer to
the leader. PUSH BUTTON stalked three wide, vied around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, hung on her left lead while chasing the
clearing leader, shifted slightly in and bumped an inner PANCAKE HOUSE at the furlong grounds, then continued to vie for place into the final sixteenth, but
was outfinished. TIMO settled far back two wide, rallied while gaining behind the main group through midstretch, and stayed on through tight quarters in the
closing stages to reach fourth at the wire. GOOD SOLDIER tracked two wide and between horses, came into the lane in the five path, chased without
progressing before shying mildly from inner troubled foes passing the furlong grounds, then kept on after flopping back to his left lead in the aftermath to
miss reaching fourth. PANCAKE HOUSE smartly tucked to stalk along the inside entering the first turn, pursued from the pocket in the two path around the
far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane, attempted to bid for place inside of PUSH BUTTON at the furlong grounds, but bumped with an inner
MONJID while being pinched and steadied in tight quarters leaving that station, then kept on to get outfinished for fourth. INBOUND tracked in midpack
three wide, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. LOLAS BEAU bumped with an inner foe at the start, then saved ground far
back, but to no avail. CAROOM trailed along the inside, took the far turn two wide, and made little impact. GREYS THE BOY tracked four wide, fanned to
the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. SHANNONRUN settled in the two path, shifted to the five path down the backstretch, got
floated to the eight path entering the lane, and tired. MOUNT KISCO bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied along the inside, then caved between
horses in upper stretch. THE RIDER OF PANCAKE HOUSE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MONJID FOR INTERFERENCE IN
MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
