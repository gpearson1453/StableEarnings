CINNAMON DREAM controlled the pace inside and remained clear under a steady drive through the stretch. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL raced close up
between rivals, moved outside on the final turn and continued willingly. FAR HEART broke a step slowly, chased wide then flattened out in the stretch.
GOVERNMENT GIRL raced just off the leaders three wide then faded on the final turn. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO prompted the pace briefly then faded after
half a mile. PAGE ELEVEN dropped back inside and was never in contention. ONLY GIRL fanned very wide on the first turn and gave way readily.

SCHNUER WILL led narrowly in the two path, extended her margin in midstretch and remained safe while tiring late. FRAME THIS lagged far behind, split
rivals in the stretch and closed well too late. ABIDALE lacked speed near the inside, was asked for run on the turn, angled wide and rallied. LA REGALADA
well placed outside, bid on the turn then weakened in the stretch. GOD STILL LOVES ME forced the pace along the rail for half a mile and gave way.
MOVING IN STEREO raced outside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MURRICANE lunged badly at the start breaking well behind his field, raced far back, circled on the turn, offered a late surge and was being geared down in
the final yards. EXXTOP settled off the leaders outside, rallied on the turn and was up for the place. BIRCHMOUNT RD vied for the advantage between
rivals and continued willingly. LEMON CREEK LOUIE led narrowly inside dueling leaders, shook loose in the stretch then tired. GO FOR THE KILL lacked
speed, moved very wide on the turn with a mild gain. RUNNING VIOLENCE outrun early, moved inside on the turn then proved empty through the stretch.
DON'T RECALL hustled along the inside early and weakened. SHANGHAI WARRIOR prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
SNAPPY RIDE vied to the far turn in the two path, shook loose on the turn and eagerly widened driving. NICKYS NOTION stalked the dueling pacesetters,
went after the winner on the turn and was no match for the winner. IMAGISM chased wide down the backstretch, faded on the turn then came again for the
show. LADY RYAN broke awkwardly, moved outside and was no factor. CLASSY GIZMO prompted the winner inside to the far turn and gave way. EDIES
WAY dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. SANTAFE EXPRESS dropped back in the initial quarter mile and was no factor inside. THE
FURMANATOR lacked speed chasing wide and was never in contention.

MY FRIENDS BEER settled outside the pacesetters, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader following a long drive. SOUTHERN BRIDGE rated just
outside the leader, bid to the front at the five sixteenths pole, was collared in the stretch but continued gamely. DISTRACTANDATTACK saved ground
throughout, squeezed through on the final turn and flattened out. OLYMPIC ROMP lagged far behind then caught stopping opponents. SHANE'S JEWEL
hustled to the front inside, led for five furlongs and gave way. B B BAD lacked speed inside, moved out in the stretch and faded.

settled well behind, advanced wide into the far turn, joined for command but was no match for the winner in the lane. BRODY SLAM raced close up, was put
to urging on the final turn and continued well. CONNOISSEUR was urged to a clear advantage for half a mile, vied on the final turn and faded. STARSHIP
BLANCA steadied inside on the first turn, rated behind the leaders then flattened out. IRISH JUMPER was urged within range wide in the opening half mile
then stopped. LA VIEXA lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RISQUE REBEL set the pace off the inside under rating, widened in the stretch and remained safe under mild drive. INDOCTRINATE trailed early, angled
out rallying on the final turn, split foes and gained. CELTIC TREASURE prompted the pace three wide to the final turn and weakened. DECKOLOGY
pressed the winner along the inside to the five sixteenths and tired. E T'S SUPER STAR dropped back early and gave way readily. EL HERMANO raced
close up outside for three quarters and faltered.

Footnotes
SOPHOS trailed down the backstretch then advanced inside, split foes angling out in the stretch and was just up at the wire. OFF THE MEDS settled behind
wall of duelers, moved near the inside in the stretch, led briefly but was nailed. SILVER FURY earned a narrow lead early in a heated duel, shook loose on
the turn then weakened in the stretch. RUNNINGFORHOME forced the pace inside, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but tired. HIZAAM rallied five
wide on the final turn then faded in the stretch. ROYAL COUP dropped back early then passed rivals wide while no factor. THE ANGRY MAN lagged far
behind and was never in contention. NOON TIME GEM broke slowest, hustled within range inside then faltered. GUSHING OIL dueled four wide to midway
on the turn and gave way. TACTICAL PLAN vied three wide between rivals then stopped in the stretch.

HOLDTHEFLIGHT urged to the front inside, repelled a challenge and edged clear again under steady handling. SCREEN SAVER pursued just off the pace
between rivals and closed well inside. EXPENSIVE CUT chased inside, angled out on the final turn and flattened. ABUELO NUNO prompted the winner
outside for three quarters and faltered. LEASE trailed early, raced very wide and never a factor. MR. EINSTEIN raced close up in the two path between
rivals and stopped. BAR FOURTEEN lacked speed, faded into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MY FIRST LOVE stalked the pace outside, took over midway on the final turn then eagerly drew off under modest pressure. ONE WILD WOMAN settled
close up, bid on the final turn and proved no match for the winner. ICE LOVE lagged far behind, advanced near the inside and closed well. LA NEBLINA
dropped back early, moved very wide on the final turn and was no threat. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX saved ground close up then faltered by three eighths pole.
DON'T TELL FRANKIE hustled to the front, was collared into the far turn and gave way. MAARTY'S DILEMMA dropped far behind and was never a factor.
TOURING MARYANNE fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and faltered. ANOTHER FLIRT moved off the pace in the two path then inside and
stopped. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY dropped back early and weakened steadily.
