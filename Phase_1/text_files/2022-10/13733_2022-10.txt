Footnotes
MIA'S AUTHORITY bumped with the outer rival at the start, was under a tight hold early despite being keen to go on, moved out four to five wide about the
half-mile marker, bid three to four wide leaving the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch outside a rival, maintained the advantage over that one and
was geared down late. COURTINGCOURTNEY attended the pace from inside, was encouraged along outside the quarter pole, drifted out a couple paths
turning for home while making an inside bid, was outkicked but second best. ZIPPITY DAY bumped the inside rival at the start, moved out from two to four
wide on the first turn racing off the pace, advanced outside up the backstretch, was forced out six wide at the half, came back in on the far turn to eventually
be near inside past the quarter pole, ran on. PRACTICAL GIZMO moved forward to force the pace three wide, weakened past the quarter. LITTLE FIRE had
bumps on both sides at the start, raced toward the rear off the inside, swung four wide for the drive, came out a bit further in the lane and ran on. SKINNY
DIPPIN settled off the pace, advanced mildly midway up the backstretch, was in tight while being forced out five wide at the half, moved back in for the
second turn and was along the rail outside the quarter pole, lacked a rally. MUSKOKA LADY raced near the inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
RIFLING broke sharp to be up front inside down the backstretch, battled on the rail for the lead through the turn, put away her pace rivals to open up at the
furlong marker and was kept to the task winning comfortably in the end. KATCHY NAME stumbled on the break, recovered to track the dueling threesome
through the turn, was in range while shifting out to be five wide turning for home, raced greenly in upper stretch and finished up well late besting of the rest.
WAR'S END KISS tracked mid pack between rivals down the backside, raced three wide outside foes at the quarter pole, closed belatedly while six wide on
the drive and got up late for the show money. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES rated five deep just behind the speed trio at the half, engaged for the top spot three
wide on the turn, bid for the lead at the top of the stretch and needed more in the final sixteenth stalling late losing some positions near the wire. SEATTLE
CAUSEWAY rated inside behind the front threesome down the backside, was roused on the fence to go on through the turn, offered little response and
finished up evenly to the line. DOMER ALLURE hopped at the start, was unhurried early to trail at the half, put in a brief run outside at the three furlong
marker, shifted out for the drive in the seven path and could not make an impact through the lane. SPEEDY BUBBLES fought for the lead between rivals in
the early stages of the race, began to give way with horses on either side two furlongs to go and tired at the furlong marker. RASHIDA was taken back to sit
off the dueling early pace at the half, steadied mildly while between runners nearing the three eighths pole, could not get involved through the turn and was
not a threat in the stretch. STUFF settled near the back on the rail in the beginning, was urged inside with three eighths from home, could not keep up with
the field on the turn and was not a factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
IVY'S STAR bumped the inside rival at the start, settled at the rear angling to the inside, came out at the top of the stretch, split rivals four wide about the
furlong marker and drew clear. ROYAL CITY REIGN attended the pace from inside rival but racing off the fence, dropped back beginning at the
three-eighths, switched out four wide at the top of the stretch while re-engaging for the lead, bid nearing the furlong marker, drifted out and could not kick on
with the winner but secured the place. GORMLEY GIRL settled off the pace outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven
deep and kicked on. STORMY SUZIE raced off the inside toward the back early, moved out from two to six wide on the turn eventually coming eight wide
into upper stretch, ran on mildly. SPEAK ENGLISH was bumped at the break, a bit eager to race up in behind the leaders near inside, moved out four wide
coming to the quarter pole and loomed a mild threat but lacked the needed late kick. ROSE RING pressed the pace, vied outside three wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. AWILDAS TREASURE broke inwardly, prompted the pace, moved to duel inside a rival but two wide on the turn, turned up empty
for the stretch.

Footnotes
HENRY'S GAMBLE was allowed to settle trailing early on, began to rally between foes in the two path midway through the turn, opted for the outside route
at the quarter pole going seven wide at the top of the stretch, had clear run turning for home and found his best stride late to get up just in time at the wire.
KERICS BEAUTY stalked near the rear on the rail in the beginning, advanced nicely up the fence two furlongs to the finish, found a seam splitting runners in
the two path in the final sixteenth to lead briefly and just missed the victory at the finish. BIG GINGER battled for the lead in the three path down the
backside, chased the leader midpoint on the turn, showed interest through the stretch between rivals four wide and determinedly got up for third nearing the
line. SUGAR IS GOLDEN battled up front in the early stages, opened up on the pack travelling inside with five sixteenths remaining, began to get leg weary
leading in mid stretch and faded very late to only hold on for a minor role at the finish line. CLEOMENES trailed the field three furlongs from the line, raced
four wide at the quarter pole, dipped inside to the rail at the furlong marker and lacked room in deep stretch to finish on the fringes in the end. KNOW HOW
(GB) travelled in mid pack between rivals the half, had a chance for a small share at the top of the stretch, could not find another gear and faded the last
eighth. ASHBURY was steadied briefly leaving the chute, settled midfield all alone at the half, lost ground to runners through the turn to trail turning for home
and passed tired foes in the stretch. EXECUTIVE EFFECT rated on the rail behind the dueling pair down the backstretch, angled three wide five sixteenths
to the finish, was in range for a minor share four wide at the top of the lane, could not find more and folded the final eighth. INSPECTOR RELOAD was
situated mid pack three wide at the half, was roused five wide between foes two furlongs to the finish and tired through the stretch. FOURTEEN DAYS
veered out at the start, chased the pace four wide at the half, asked to stay in touch with the leaders racing three wide on turn and backed away from the
field outside at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TEMPEREYA raced wide early while setting the tempo, continued to dictate the pace racing just off the rail, was encouraged past the quarter pole, clear in
mid-stretch, just lasted from PEMBERLEY, who stumbled at the start, settled at the rear near the inside early, came out four wide at the top of the stretch
while beginning to gain ground, was all out and gained steadily and slowly but just missed. VIVID VIXEN settled off the pace two to three wide early, went
three then four wide on the far turn coming five deep into upper stretch, kept on evenly in the lane. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL tracked from inside just off the
leader, switched out a the three-eighths, was within range and loomed a potential threat two to three wide at the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late
kick. MUM'S THE WORD stalked the eventual winner three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
IMA DAREDEVIL had a nice tracking position on the rail down the backstretch behind the contesting front pair, angled just outside for run at the quarter
pole, comfortably assumed command at the top of the stretch and drew off in the final eighth. D'S SOUL sat outside tracking the frontrunners in the second
flight at the half, was scrubbed on for run two wide through the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and battled on outside to win the place award on
the nod at the finish. ANITA GRIGIO tracked between horses in the second tier three furlongs to the finish, was ridden while on the rail through the turn,
rallied to split foes in the three path at the furlong marker and just lost the place share in the photo at the wire. ELEANOR POWELL settled near the back at
the half, was urged while trailing the pack inside through the turn, showed some late energy up the fence to pass tiring horses and get up for a small share.
AIRY FAIRY contested for the lead on the rail in the early stages, opened up on the field on the turn, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch and
weakened at the furlong marker. BOSSALINA trailed the field in the beginning and never reached contention in the late stages. NICE COMPANY pressed
the pace outside down the backside, began to weaken two furlongs from the wire and stopped while between runners the final eighth.

Footnotes
MIDWAY MISCHIEF settled off the pace inside, took closer order midway on the turn, moved out at the quarter pole bothering a rival then came back in,
looked for room in upper stretch in behind the leading pair, had moderate room in mid-stretch but moved to the rail past the eighth pole bothering another
rival, dueled late and prevailed. POSEIDON STEEL attended the pace two to three wide, led in mid-stretch, was engaged by an inside rival, dueled and just
missed. CLASSY WHISPER was coaxed forward inside to take the lead after the opening three-sixteenths, contested the pace, steadied when placed in
tight quarters past the furlong marker, came out and ran on to retake show honors. BET N WIN stalked three wide into the turn, was forced out and put in
tight at the quarter steadying slightly, moved out six wide for the drive and ran on. JIMMIES BIG DAY stalked from outside going four wide on the turn,
lacked the needed late kick. CITY LEGEND settled at the rear, swung seven wide, was never a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL
AS OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDERS OF BET N WIN AND CLASSY WHISPER BOTH AGAINST MIDWAY MISCHIEF ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE
QUARTER POLE AND MID-STRETCH RESPECTIVELY, MIDWAY MISCHIEF WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND BET
N WIN.

Footnotes
NADIABIZNIZ tracked the contesting leaders in hand inside at the half, advanced up the fence five sixteenths to the finish, split foes to get the lead two wide
at the furlong marker and had just enough left late to hold off the closer for the victory at the wire. IVICTORY was situated near the back three furlongs to
the wire, rallied three wide on the far turn passing runners, was full of run seven wide through the stretch and was gaining with every stride just missing out
at the finish. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS waited while inside of rivals on the far turn, looked for a seam in upper stretch, weaved her way to be clear at the
eighth pole and finished up well to be a close third in the end. ISLAND BELLE travelled five wide into the first turn, stalked in the middle of the field down the
backstretch, rallied four wide midway on the far turn, was in the hunt in upper stretch but needed a little more to threaten in the final sixteenth. REINS OF
PURPLE was situated near the back on the fence with a half remaining, angled outside to rally four wide three furlongs to go, circling runners on the turn
loomed into contention seven wide top of the lane and stalled in mid stretch. DOO DAH led the field into the backstretch, dueled on the rail for the lead
through the far turn, was headed by multiple runners while inside turning for home and backed away on the fence with a furlong left to run. ASHWICKEN
settled in mid pack with runners on either side at the half, was in range while behind the fading frontrunning leaders at the quarter pole and could not offer a
finish to contend through the stretch. SILENT CREEK pressed for the front going six wide on the first turn, battled outside for the lead down the backside,
continued engage for the top spot on the far turn, was collared at the top of the stretch and retreated four wide between horses the final eighth. HUSHEMUP
stumbled badly to her knees at the break, recovered to track midfield down the backside on the rail, offered a brief run on the far turn and faded between
horses at the quarter pole. HIT ME UP tracked behind the frontrunners just off the fence three eighths to run, gave way midpoint on the far turn and had
nothing left for the stretch drive. SHAZEEN trailed the field in the early stages, lost touch with the pack around the far turn and was not persevered with
through the lane.
