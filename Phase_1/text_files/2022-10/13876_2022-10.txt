Footnotes
WANDERING WEST tracked in the six path, was cued to bid four wide around the turn, took the lead into the stretch, drifted out though the stretch, and held
clear. GRAN ANDREWS chased from inside, was roused while shifting out to the seven path into the lane, got herded outward in the final furlong, and ran
on for place. NORTH CAUCASUS stalked in the five path, brushed an outer foe approaching the turn, was driven from the four path into the stretch, and
kept on to show. SIXTY ONE rated in the three path, was ridden along while swinging out to the eight path into the lane, but finished evenly. ACTION
WARRIOR dueled from the three path early but backed up around the turn. FULTON STREET dueled for the lead from the four path but gaveway at the top
of the lane. SIR KAHN trailed throughout from the four path.

tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch, tipped three wide midway around the turn, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out
late. EXAMINER set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, fought on inside to midstretch then weakened a bit late. NEW YORK

BLUTO'S CANDY chased in the three path, was cued through an opening inside around the far turn, opened up into the stretch, and held clear. LEOPARDI
tracked from two wide, moved up to bid four wide around the far turn, was driven from two wide into the lane, and kept on for place. TAKEMYSHOT trailed
from inside early, was coaxed while shifting out five wide around the far turn, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show.
FIGHT was in the four path around the first turn, prompted the pace from the three path but yielded at the top of the stretch. VOICE OF NOW stalked from
inside, was hustled between foes around the far turn, but faded. LANCELOT LYNK raced in midpack from the four path but was done early. NOT A DANCE
set the pace from inside but was done rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
SHEA D SECRET tracked the pace three wide between foes, bid four wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
SING SCAT was bumped entering the first turn, was rank while racing three wide around that bend, edged closer between foes around the far turn, steadied
near the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch, had aim outside of the winner but was unable to match strides with that foe while staying on to gain the
place. TWO BEER BUZZ stalked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, bid between foes turning for home but flattened
out in the final furlong. GRAND ARROW was bumped at the start, saved ground in range but was one-paced through the lane. REBATE was bumped at the
start, was bumped and pinched back entering the first turn, raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the lane. CAYMAN QUEEN was bumped
at the start, bumped and forced to check entering the first turn, bumped again late on that bend, raced well back three wide and passed tiring rivals.
QUICKER 'N YOU failed to menace while racing four and five wide. GLADIATORA was outrun inside. CAIRO WINNER pressed the pace two wide, led
around much of the far turn and tired in the lane. BABKA was bumped at the start, was bumped and forced to check entering the first turn, raced four wide
and never threatened. LADY BOURBON was bumped entering the first turn, steadied along around that bend, raced two and three wide and was through
early. I LOVE IRELAND set the pace inside and stopped in the lane. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF REBATE AGAINST SING SCAT
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

HARD BELLE raced off the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed determinedly and was up on the wire. FROSTED ARMOUR
pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, vied to midstretch, drew clear leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under
left-handed urging and was nailed. INTER MIAMI set the pace in the two path, vied inside from the five-sixteenths pole past the eighth pole and weakened
late. RABDAN raced off the pace two wide and rallied belatedly. ONUR (ARG) had brief speed two wide. SAVVY was bumped at the start, raced two wide
and never threatened. RISK VS REWARD bumped SAVVY at the start, saved ground and played no further factor. POSEIDON'S SON had his head turned
at the start and was very slow to begin, raced four wide and was never involved.

from the three path into the lane, but yielded late. MAJESTY'S MAYHEM rated in the three path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but flattened.

MAJOR KING raced in tight between rivals early, was coaxed while shifting out to the five path into the lane, and rallied to get up late. INSPIRED MISCHIEF
rated from the four path, drifted out to the eight path in the stretch, and ran on for place. LUNAR ROCKET stalked from inside, tipped out two wide into the
lane, and kept on for show. CORPORATE AFFAIR led from the two path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but yielded late. HEARNS pressed
from the three path but was one paced in the stretch. LONG STORY chased from inside but flattened in the stretch. CHEF MENTEUR tracked in the four
path, drifted in throughout the stretch, and was no threat. PRINCE FOR A DAY was always behind.
