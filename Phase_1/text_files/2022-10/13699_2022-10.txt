Footnotes
I'MAGAMBLER raced four-wide through the first turn, stalked the pace of C D POLDARC while racing five-wide, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with
SIXTH GEAR nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and edged away late. SIXTH GEAR was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, vied with the winner but could not match strides
late. CHIPPSTER was forwardly placed from off the rail early and gave way in the drive. C D POLDARC sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting
the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. MARK'S WARRIOR was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and failed to
menace. SNOW IN THE NORTH lagged far back throughout and was eased through the lane.

SMOOTH BLUES stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and quickly drew off. AISLE
RUNNER set a pressured pace from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. BLACK EYED BANDIT was pinched back at the start, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain
late. ZESTY JAZZMAN pressed the pace from the inside, angled out into the stretch, angled back inside through the final sixteenth and lacked the needed
closing response. ROAD TO HEAT was forwardly placed early, raced six-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. MICKEYS GOLD settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. THE RIDERS OF ZESTY JAZZMAN AND BLACKEYED BANDIT LODGED
OBJECTIONS AGAINST AISLE RUNNER CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF BLACKEYED BANDIT AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

LEAVE IT dueled for the lead with GOSPEL GINA while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin and drew off
through the lane with complete authority. MISS BRIGHT TOWN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking
position but could not gain on the winner late. GOSPEL GINA disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way to that rival after
going a half. KEEP IT ROLLIN chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and weakened. LEMON ICE lagged throughout and raced
five-wide through the turn.

SANTIAGO'S TOWER was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was up in the closing yards. BONFIRE PARTY dueled
for the lead with BESITOS CRIMINALES while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. BESITOS
CRIMINALES disputed the pace with BONFIRE PARTY while racing four-wide, drifted out in mid-stretch and gave way. HOT CHARLIE chased the leaders
while racing five-wide and lacked the needed closing response. FLYING FALCON settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened. ZIVA DA'VID showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AZTEC SUN hopped at the start, moved up to settle just off the leaders, advanced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
drew clear. SMOKE STACK dueled for the lead from the inside with THIRSTY ECHO, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear lead
with a quarter to run but could not match strides with the winner late. ZEE CARROT EAGLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. FLYING FRED showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled
out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not threaten. ANNA'S IRON MAN raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. GUY IN THE SKY raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THIRSTY ECHO disputed the pace with
SMOKE STACK while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. OLIVER TWISTED showed no early speed, dropped back and was eased
through the lane. THE RIDER OF ZEE CARROT EAGLE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST AZTEC SUN CONCERNING THE TURN AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

and drew off through the lane with complete authority. DIA DE PAGO was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
failed to gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. K P AIM HIGH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished evenly. JERSEY JOE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. I'M A COOL CAT raced off
the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. JEEBAR lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not

Footnotes
LATENITE SLEWZY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
drew off. TIZ FOR REAL lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. THE TIME'S
RIGHT was off slow, raced unhurried early, advanced eighth-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. NAVARONES SPARKLE was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. NOWORRIESTODAY was off slow then hustled along for a contending
position from the inside and gave way in the drive. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated
bid. HOLLYWOOD PRINCESS settled off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EMOTIONAL INTEL pressed the
pace while racing five-wide for a half and weakened. RUN LIKE KATE showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. GRACEANNE
was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. GEORGIANO raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn
and weakened. INDIAN DIVA was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong.
