Footnotes
LAW ABIDING stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch awaiting room, gained an opening at the top of the lane, rallied up the rail and
proved best in deep stretch. VIRAT away quickly in the beginning then settled in a stalking position, traveled two wide around the bid, bid between rivals in
the lane and finished gamely to the wire. TREBBIANO stalked the lone leader three deep, bid three wide leaving the bend and took over at the top of the
stretch, cleared briefly nearing the eight pole, was soon challenged in the furlong grounds and yielded to the top pair. BLACK AND BLUE jumped the track
crossing surfaces and dropped back, rounded the bend three wide, brushed with inner rival at the top of the stretch, moved out and rallied four deep late to
earn a minor award. MASTERMIND steadied behind TREBBIANO early, moved down to the inside trailing the field, steered out on the turn and came three
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GREENBOW broke slow, became rank early on, settled into the stride, took the turn two wide, brushed rival at the
top of the stretch, tipped out and flattened. DEVIL MOON lunged at the start then went up to take command, cleared and crossed over to the rail, led
through the turn then was challenged into the stretch, failed to offer any resistance and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN PANTHER broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, stalked the speed from inside into the turn, tipped out and took aim two wide
leaving the bend, rallied steadily in the drive and overhauled LA V. late. LA V. stepped to the front early, crossed over to the inside nearing the turn, held a
comfortable lead into the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and got run down late. TAKE A LEAP broke well but lacked early speed and dropped back,
saved ground through the turn, came with a mild rail rally in the lane and gained the show. LARIMAR chased along the inside through the turn, moved out in
upper stretch and lacked further response. SAILING ALONG broke a step slow, sat well off the pace up the backstretch, rounded the bend three wide,
angled out further in the lane and failed to menace. TIZ A MASTER bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the lone leader outside a rival, traveled two then three
wide around the bend while losing ground and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ settled off the pace, went between runners in a bit of a tight spot into the turn, traveled two wide around the bend, steered out at
the top of the stretch, closed well under the right hand and steady handling and ran down KATERINI late. KATERINI chased four then three deep early, bid
three wide around the bend, took over past the quarter pole, moved clear in upper stretch but could not fend off the late charge from the winner. DEAR
BEAU (IRE) sat off the pace up the backstretch, advanced three then four wide around the turn, took aim at the leader in the stretch but finished evenly late
while holding the show. GRANOLA GIRL tracked outside a rival then came three wide into the stretch, lacked the needed late punch and got edged for the
show honors. TIERGARTEN raced up close inside rivals then got crowded and checked near the half-mile pole, checked into the turn and again early on the
bend, moved out in the lane and kept on while unable to threaten. NEAREST N DEAREST took control early and showed the way to the turn, led along the
inside through the bend, lost command nearing the stretch and weakened inside. NATALIA chased between then moved inside on the backstretch, cut the
corner into the lane then moved out and flattened. BUY AMERICAN forwardly placed outside the leader early on, took the turn two wide and faded down the
lane.

Footnotes
CHRIS FIX unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside for the first turn, closed in while angling four wide on the far turn, rallied outside the top pair in the
final furlong and drove past. MOURVEDRE bobbled leaving the gate then sent clear and angled to the inside, taken in hand leaving the first turn, set all the
pace to the stretch, challenged from outside at the eight pole, lost command shortly after and stayed on to the wire to edge STILL ON THE BOOKS for
second. STILL ON THE BOOKS tracked four then three wide on the first turn, took aim three then two wide on the far turn, drew alongside the leader at the
eight pole, took over in midstretch but faltered in the final sixteenth and lost the place. ARMAVEER chased three then two wide early, came three wide into
the stretch, angled to the inside in the lane but lacked a late bid. M K HEART raced near the back on the inside into the first turn then pulled the rider into
range around the bend, checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, entered the lane two wide and could not rally. TAKE THE TWO TEN got pinched back
between rivals early, suffered a mild shuffle between foes on the first turn, trailed into the far turn, came three wide into the drive and was not a factor.
MONGOLIAN NINJA traveled along the rail then moved into the two path on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, moved back to the inside on the
second bend and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
LINCOLN CITY settled on the inside near the back, angled four wide around the turn, steered down to the inside in the stretch and surged clear. CHASIN
MUNNY bumped leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn, steered out and bid five wide outside the leader into the lane, took over in upper stretch
but was overtaken with a sixteenth remaining and held the place. MAC DADDY TOO bumped in the beginning, chased on the inside, tipped three wide past
the quarter pole, bid inside the leaders in upper stretch but lacked the needed late punch. FINALLY HERE broke a step slow, had to steady in tight
approaching the dirt, trailed into the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, finished well and missed the show. INCH raced off the pace, gained two wide
around the bend then swung six wide into the stretch to launch a bid but faltered in the late stages. NILES CHANNEL had to steadied crossing the dirt,
raced outside a rival near the back, traveled two wide then moved to the rail around the bend and could not rally. ENCROACHMENT vied three deep for
command, inched ahead on the turn then cleared at the quarter pole, led four wide into the stretch, relinquished the lead short after and weakened. GIVE
ME THE LUTE vied between rivals up the backstretch, fought to the five-sixteenths pole then lost touch with a quarter mile left to run and tired in the stretch.
MAVEN showed early speed, jumped the track crossing the dirt to lose a bit of ground then went up to re-engage the leaders from inside, steadied and
tossed his head at the three-eighths pole, lost ground around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
STARSHIP SKY broke a step slow, coaxed early on the inside then pulled briefly when running up behind the leader and moved into the two path, tracked
two wide through the far turn, tipped out and rallied three deep in the lane and bested inner rivals. AWESOME PAMELA tracked two then three wide early,
moved out widest on the backstretch, asked four wide around the far turn, chased in range through the stretch then put in a late bid but could not get by.
ROMAN EMPRESS brushed leaving the gate, sped to the front and moved to the rail, set the pace under pressure then dueled up the backstretch, lost the
lead at the three-eighths pole, fought back around the far turn and down the lane but got outkicked by the top pair. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL brushed in the
beginning, pulled while pressing the pace from outside, moved up to duel on even terms in the middle stages, inched ahead on the far turn, put to
left-handed urging in the drive, clung to a narrow lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. NEVER SWAY forwardly placed outside the top pair early on,
chased three wide through the far turn and finished evenly down the lane. CHAO MAR tracked four wide around the clubhouse turn, moved into the two
path around the second bend and lacked further response. LADY BLACKBIRD stumbled badly leaving the gate, chased three then two wide early, angled to
the rail on the far turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
RAGTIME ROSE attended the pace four deep up the backstretch, vied three deep then outside SWEET TESSA past the quarter pole, gained the lead into
the stretch, kicked clear and held well while drifting out. CUTE KHLOE was off slow from inside, moved into range then lacked room behind ELECTRIC
GLIDE into the turn, tipped to the two path between rivals, chased between at the top of the lane, moved out then drifted out past the eighth pole, finished
willingly outside the winner but had to settle for second best. MOUNT MARY (IRE) stalked two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
finished evenly for the show. BALENCIAGA BETTY took an awkward step crossing over the dirt early and dropped back, went two then three wide around
the turn, steered out in the lane and improved position. ELECTRIC GLIDE pressed the pace from inside, got shuffled back into the turn, lacked room in
upper stretch and could not rally once tipping to a clear path. WIRLY GIRLY raced up close three deep early on, steadied between rivals past the
five-sixteenths pole, chased three deep in upper stretch and churned on while unable to threaten. CARMEL BY THE SEA raced off the pace three deep into
the turn, came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. SWEET TESSA set the pace in the two path then moved inside on the bend, lost command into
the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SAVILE ROW vied between up the backstretch, inched ahead on the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held well under right handed urging.
HOUNDSTOOTH stalked the pace outside a rival or two wide, bid inside the leader in the stretch but lacked the needed late punch. DAMAZIO got crowded
briefly early, chased three deep up the backstretch, tipped out and put in a mild bid four deep entering the stretch, failed to sustain the challenge in upper
stretch and churned on to gain the show. ENCODE vied for the lead three deep into and around the turn, roused entering the stretch, could not keep up with
the winner in upper stretch and got edged for the show. STREET ART broke a bit slow, stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, lacked room at the top
of the stretch, tipped out and could not rally. MITICO vied for the lead inside pair of rivals, fought back through the turn, then weakened in the stretch run.
LAUGHING LEGACY tracked four deep up the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and moved into the three path and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TOM AND JAZZY hit the gate, stalked the leader on the inside, tipped out midway around the far turn and challenged from outside, drew alongside PLEASE
FOCUS with a furlong remaining and drove clear. PLEASE FOCUS cleared quickly and was keen early under a hold, controlled the pace to the far turn, met
the challenge from TOM AND JAZZY midway around the bend, resisted to midstretch then lost command at the sixteenth pole and stayed on for a clear
second. LUKA GRAZIE broke a step slow on the outside, traveled three then two wide off the pace on the first turn, three deep on the backstretch, came
four wide into the drive and showed a mild response to earn the show honors. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY bumped leaving the gate, tracked two wide early,
saved ground through the far turn, earned a minor award but failed to threaten. RECKLESS AFFAIR bumped at the start, pulled early on the inside then
steadied, spun three wide into the lane and failed to menace. MY RANSOM chased four then three wide on the first turn, went three deep into the far turn,
remained off the rail into the drive and could not respond to urging. CRYPTO RIDE bumped leaving the gate, settled on the inside, started to weaken on the
far turn and tired. STORMY JOE lagged behind early in the two path, continued two wide around the far turn and was not a factor.
THEUNTOUCHABLEONE chased three wide on the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, asked right handed at the three-eighths pole,
dropped back around that bend and tired.
