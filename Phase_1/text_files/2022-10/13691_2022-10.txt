Footnotes
MS. LEA raced unhurried early, pulled to contend from the inside nearing the three-eighths marker, gained command with a quarter to run and quickly drew
off as the easiest of winners. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but was clearly
second best. POW WOW tracked the leaders from the inside throughout and weakened in the drive. TRICKING TRIXIE settled off the leaders early, raced
four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. NICOLE'S TALES pressed the pace while racing four-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
SHORT POCKETS raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
INQUISITEUR in the closing yards to be going away late. INQUISITEUR sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace,
re-cleared nearing the quarter but could not resist the winner late. CLIFTON PARK was reserved off the leaders from the inside throughout, reached a
striking position late but failed to gain. DIGGER'S GOLD showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late.
GLENDORA MINECAT raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. ME AND
JACK raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and did not threaten. TRUST MANDO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
weakened after going six furlongs.
