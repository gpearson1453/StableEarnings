OCEAN'S RESERVE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand two then three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. REFUAH chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. TIE BREAKER two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, weakened in the drive. TWIRLING VINE chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. JOSIE'S THUNDER chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and made no impact. OUR SON JAKE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide into the turn coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got out through the latter portion of the bend four to five wide before heading six wide into upper stretch, folded, and
was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
THAT IS KEY broke in at the start, moved up to be well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path while in dead-aim of the leading trio early on the
turn, angled four wide while roused at the five-sixteenths then moved to the five path, rallied outside to take over into upper stretch then kicked clear, drew
away under strong urging into the final seventy yards then was eased up in the final strides while much the best. KERIK broke in at the start, moved out
while lacking speed under urging, gained three then four wide around the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no
match for the winner. BIG AL'S GAL was taken in hand while just off the pace before leaving the chute, moved to the outside with six furlongs to run, tracked
outside from that juncture, issued a challenge in the four path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired while able to get the show.
LINNY KATE was last to commence, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside under some restraint, was let out in the three path while between foes on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. GRUDGE went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, was asked in the two path
under pressure on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded. JEN'S BATTLE broke in at the start, moved up into a good position down the
backstretch, dropped back inside early on the turn then shifted to the three path before the five-sixteenths and retreated.

MISS DRACARYS established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm and patiently
handled through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, held well and clear to the finish. CREATIVE CAIRO just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home and held on to preserve the place honors. STARSHIP MALLOMAR
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader, kept on to the finish
safe for the show honors. WICKED GROOVE three wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, stayed on one paced through the

Footnotes
UPPER LEVEL was away alertly then crossed in front quickly while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while
inside on the turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive while off the inside in upper stretch, extended the advantage
into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. CHARLESTON STRONG tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two path on
the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. STJAMES was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, saved
ground while asked on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while narrowly able to get the show. RECLUSE was last
to commence, jostled with KIMBO DANCER on the backstretch, was rated while tugging at the bit, went around the turn in the two path, was roused outside
the quarter-pole, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position to just miss the show. STRAIGHT TIME made light contact with a foe at the start,
settled on the outside without over, was roused three wide on the turn then came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. JURKOVEC
settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch under the crop and came up empty.
PROVEN HOPE bumped with foes at the start then was hustled, settled outside near the back but with the benefit of cover, was roused four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KIMBO DANCER jostled with RECLUSE down the backstretch, was rated towards the rear, went
around the the turn in the three path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TRUE EMPRESS four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, commenced a four wide bid in hand from the three-eighths into contention swinging
four wide into upper stretch, inhaled the top pair with ease nearing the eighth pole while sitting chilly in stark contrast to the rest of the field under a drive,
then edged clear while never engaged by the rider save for one sole nudge near the sixteenth marker to prevail going away at the end. TRADE SECRET
broke out at the start bumping SHE CAUGHT MY EYE, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. DAZZY ranged up after the start to be forwardly placed four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before taking over just inside nine-sixteenths to run, shook away tucked to the two path through the turn and came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and was overhauled nearing the eighth pole, proved no match for the top
one and kept on well clear of the rest to preserve the show honors. BELARUS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, made no real impact while improving position by tired rivals. MONSHUN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE got bumped at the start by TRADE SECRET, came under coaxing and chased three to
four wide, went three wide into upper stretch and folded. ICE COLD GOLD chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
SNICKET coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way briefly inside before taking to the two path, remained
patiently handled slipping away through the turn and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, held clear to the eighth pole, dug in under tepid
late threat growing a bit leg weary but held safe to prevail. FIRING CAROL chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors latching on the winner as she hit the finish. CHASING CARA coaxed from the
start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. TO A T chased
just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. SILVER STRAND coaxed from the gate,
chased five then four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. BABA hustled from the start, chased
just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the drive.

up the inside to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the very last jumps to the wire in a blanket finish. ANADOR (FR) three wide in
pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take narrow and
brief command a sixteenth from home, then got caught in the final strides to the finish while just preserving the place honors by a nod. MAYBE LATER three
then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing in late and just missed at
the end. STELLA MARS just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied and missed at the end. DREAMFUL showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the
backstretch, tucked along the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from flanking challengers and was collared a sixteenth from home, fought on to the finish, then was reported to have bled. PEGS A. K. GIRL three
then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
outfinished in the late stages. LADY OF THOROTON grew rank off heels under the restraint of the rider early on, went just off the inside through the first
turn before chasing three to four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside but was outfinished
in the late going. CAPITAL GAL three wide into the first turn, tipped four wide to get away from being off heels of a rival and floated out EXCEPT

the two path into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the wire. SYNONYMOUS tracked along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home and made no headway. EXCEPT TEMPTATION got carried four to five wide into the first turn by CAPITAL GAL,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SOLIB coaxed from the
