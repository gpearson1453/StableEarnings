Footnotes
RICHEBOURG pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, moved to the lead before mid-turn, widened into the lane, continued to extend the
advantage to inside the eighth pole while being kept to the task then was geared down the final seventy yards. LEMON ROSES was in the three to the two
path through the turn and into the lane, moved closer to the rail and chased the winner home while well clear for the place spot. LOVELY LISA was in the
two to three paths through the far turn, came into the lane from the three path and moved up for the minor share while never a menace. BEACH KITTEN
bobbled and broke to the outside, raced well back and last into the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a threat. BAND OF ROSES
set the pace on a clear lead into the backstretch, was under pressure from the winner into the far turn, was headed by that one before mid-turn, and faded.
GIMME CANDY was in the three path through the turns and tired.

Footnotes
DELFT BLUE was unhurried while off the inside, began gaining momentum through the turn while in the three path, came in the lane from the four path,
drove past and cleared late. ZOFFA was unhurried while just off the inside, asked for more in mid-turn, swung into the lane from the four path and was
gaining to the end. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE set the pace while near the inside into the turn, continued with a clear advantage into the lane then yielded
approaching the sixteenth pole. OVERTHOUGHT raced along the inside through the turn and offered a mild gain. GOOD FIRST chased the pace while in
the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and tired. ELI saved ground through the turns and never was a factor. MIGHTY CRAIC
in the two path through the turns and was empty turning into the lane. WORLD CRUISER was never in it while in the three path through the turns.

Footnotes
MOON DAZE set the pace into the first turn, raced on a clear lead down the backstretch, extended the advantage through the far turn, continued to be
ridden while widening into the lane and finished under a hand drive. CIERRA EMPIRE was unhurried while in the two path, split rivals in late turn when
gaining momentum, dueled with another until inside the eighth pole for the place spot and was clear for the runner-up spot. DISHIN' IT OUT raced off the
inside into the far turn, angled into the three then the four path in mid-turn, was four wide in late turn and into the lane, dueled with the runner-up and could
not keep up with that one late. ITZFOREVER was along the inside throughout and tired through the lane. SHEZA NUT raced through the four to the five
path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and was empty. KAYS HEAVENLY STAR chased the pace from the two or three path into
the far turn was empty turning into the lane. TAMARAC LADY steadily lost ground while in the three path in the far turn.
