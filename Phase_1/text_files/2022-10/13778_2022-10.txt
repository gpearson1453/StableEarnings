Footnotes
JOE'S HAD ENOUGH prompted the early pace, took over when cued while two wide around the turn, opened up into the lane, and held clear. HELLO JACK
tracked in the four path, was hustled into the stretch, and ran on to secure place. WINOOSKI rated inside, was steadied into the turn, drifted out to the
eleven path into the lane, and kept on for show. DREAM OF BLESSINGS chased in the two path, shifted in going into the turn, swung out to the five path
into the lane, but finished evenly. CONRADO raced from wellback in the four path, was coaxed from the five path around the turn, was ridden from the six
path into the lane, but was one paced. BAD HENRY led from the two path but yielded going into the stretch. HOLLYWOOD HERO trailed into the stretch
and never threatened. SEAX stalked from the three path early but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
TWELVE O'CLOCK was unhurried from the path, saved ground around the turn, shifted out to the five path into the lane, and rallied to get up late.
KRYPTON stalked the early pace, was roused from three wide around the turn, bid from the four path into the lane, led into the final furlong, but was caught
late to place. DEN STREET trailed from the six path, swung into the stretch, and kept on for show. VILLEGAS SWING led from the three path but yielded in
the final furlong. RUNAWAY TOM rated from inside, was hustled around the turn, but flattened down the lane. CYNIC tracked in the five path but was never
a factor. MY BIG DRAMA prompted the pace in the two path but dropped back around the turn. FORTY DREAMS raced from wellback in the five path but
was no menace.

Footnotes
JOURNEYTOTHEMOON was shuffled back early, trailed in the four path for a half, circled five wide around the far turn, took over near the sixteenth pole
and inched ahead. FRANKIE'S GIRL stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead turning for home, was collared near the sixteenth pole and fought on
inside of the winner. DONTMESSWITHTESS set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch, fought past the eighth pole then weakened. DIVINE
EXCHANGE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DOMINEERING chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN
had her head turned at the start and was well last at the start, moved up inside to track the pace at the rail and tired in the drive. SWEET ACTRESS played
no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SPY HUNTER dueled while two wide, was roused to take the lead rounding the turn, and drew clear in the stretch. DROPKICK MURPHY dueled from
inside, was ridden from the two path into the lane, but was second best. CATALINA EXPRESS tracked in the two path, was driven between rivals around
the turn, swung out to the five path entering the lane, but finished evenly for show. CUTIE chased from the rail, was hustled around the turn, but was one
paced. TAPIT'S DIRECTION was held up in the three path, was coaxed from the five path going into the stretch, but flattened. LAS OLAS trailed from the
three path early, floated out to the eight path going into the lane, but was no factor. JIMMYS LUCKIE MANN rated from inside but was never a threat.
LUSCIOUS DANCER stalked from the three path but weakened going into the stretch.

tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole and rallied between foes to gain the place in the final strides. AVATAL HERO advanced four wide around the turn
and was one-paced through the lane to just miss second. LADY PETAL pressed the pace two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane,
battled to deep stretch and weakened late. GRAYSONSTUFRIENDLY set a pressured pace inside and weakened through the final furlong. THAT'S MY
CAT broke in a tangle, advanced five wide around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. GO MIKA raced off the pace five wide and lacked a rally while
lugging in through the stretch. AWESOME MARINA chased the pace inside and faded through the lane. VALIANT SHI SHI raced off the pace four wide,
checked near the quarter pole and had no further bids. MY REAL DREAM had some speed two wide and steadily faded. MIGHTY MADI broke a bit
awkwardly, raced three wide and was never a threat.

Footnotes
AMAZING TRIP led from the two path, was coaxed from the three path going into the lane, drifted out under left handed in upper stretch, but held on.
QUEEN CUPID bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked inside, was roused from the four path into the lane, and ran on for place. SHEZA HAPPY
GIRL chased the early pace, ranged up five wide into the turn, was coaxed from the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. STARSHIP NUGGET
trailed from the two path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. HEIRESSINDY was hustled between rivals in midpack but was one
paced in the stretch. DIGNIFIED tracked from the three path but flattened down the lane. JEFF'S ANGEL rated in the six path but was no factor. ARETE'S
CHALICE raced from wellback in the four path and was no threat. SASSY LIKE JULIA bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four
path but gave way around the turn.

JET WINGS set the pace in the two path and dug in between foes to hold safe. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of the
winner near the eighth pole but was turned back. ALPHA BLUE stalked the winner in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and was
one-paced. SHAKE YOUR BONES raced off the pace four and five wide and had a mild rally. DOUBLE WARRIOR chased the pace in the four path and
lacked the needed rally. JRUE BREEZE went evenly inside. OLIVEROROLIVIER hit the starting gate and trailed two wide.
