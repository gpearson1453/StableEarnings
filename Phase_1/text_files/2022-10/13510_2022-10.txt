Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE stalked the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, was greeted by an open rail into the lane, stayed inside while
gaining momentum, caught the leader outside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. OCELIA chased the pace from the three path through the turns, bid three
wide into the lane, gained a clear lead with a furlong to go then was no match for the winner through the final sixteenth. CARRY ON was in the three of four
path through the turn, bid from the four path into the lane, was well spotted with three-sixteenths to go and hung inside the eighth pole. INCESSANT set the
pace near the inside through the turn and into the lane then gave way while coming off the rail into the lane. AZURITA raced near the rail through the turns,
shifted into the six path through the lane and never was a factor. TRAUMARAMA was in the three path through the far turn and lacked a response. QUEEN
CHARMAINE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, was asked for more into the lane and was empty.

Footnotes
DONEGAL FACTOR stalked the pace from the two or three path through mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead while straightening then
extended the advantage the final eighth. PACE was unhurried while along the inside, gained momentum into the lane, shifted to pass tiring rivals inside the
sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. TIZ THE COAST vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn, was well placed into the lane then
weakened. AMERICAN DOLLARS vied along the inside into the backstretch, settled back to chase the pace into the far turn, continued in close proximity
into the lane then lacked a closing response. OFFALY COOL raced near the rail through the turns, entered the lane from the three path and never was a
threat. I NINETY FIVE bobbled and bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide through the far turn then weakened. MYTHOMANIA was in the two
path through the turns, came into the lane from the five path and shifted to the eighth path late. BAYTOWN BEAVER trailed for half while off the inside,
came into the lane off the rail and never was a factor. RIVER BOY never a factor while in the three or four path through the turns. KILBAHA (IRE) chased
the pace from the three path through the turns and was empty into the lane.

TIME TO CONFESS pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane then drew away when asked. PILLOW DROP raced in the two path
through the turn when never far back, lost ground to the leader into the lane, split rivals near the eighth pole and finished with good energy to be second
best. ALLIE MAES REVENGE chased the pace along the inside early, was shuffled back through the turn, stayed on through the lane and moved up. HER
WAY set the pace through the turn while near the inside then gave way after entering the lane. TAP THE LINE was well back while off the rail, continued in
the three or four path through the turn and into the lane and never was a threat while moving up late. SNUGGLER was in the three or four path through the
turn, bid in late turn and into the lane, looked to be a threat while straightening then was done in mid-track. ANGELSNDISGUISE chased the pace from the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and tired. WOO WOO GIRL was in the five to the three path through the turn when outrun.

Footnotes
HALOO hustled out to a long lead into the backstretch, widened the advantage into the far turn, maintained the lead into the lane then was ridden out while
not challenged through the final eighth. MIRACLE ON ICE was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three path on the far turn, came into the
lane from the five or six path and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. ALYANAABI chased the pace from the two path through the
turns, bid from near the rail into the lane then stayed on to save the show spot. SIMPLY JACK was in the two or three path through the turns and missed the
show spot while not a threat. MUCHO MOJO raced along the inside through the turns and needed more. FLY HOME chased the runaway leader through
the turns and into the lane then was empty in deep stretch. SHANNONRUN never a factor while in the three path through the turns. VERSATILE no menace
while along the inside. BLUEBERRY was outrun while in the three to the two path through the turns. SUPE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RIVER REDEMPTION stalked the pace from along the inside through the far turn, came off the lane and into the two or three path entering the lane, shifted
back to the rail when leader drifted out, caught that one inside the eighth pole and drew clear. JEOPARDY THEORY pressed and led while along the inside,
continued with the lead into the lane while coming off the inside, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole, yielded to that one but stayed on well to be
second best. CABLE CHANNEL was unhurried while off the inside, came into the lane from the six path and was gaining to the end. PADDY'S HOUSE
chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. BAKWENA was unhurried while in the three path through the
turn, gained momentum into the lane then rallied through traffic and finished with good energy. FORT LOWELL saved ground into the lane and offered a
mild gain. FUTURE VICTORY pressed the pace two wide through the far turn then faded after entering the lane. EYE OF THE CAT was in the two path
through the turns and lacked a response. CALRISSIAN raced through the three or four path through the turns and never was a factor. SAQEEL was outrun
while in the two or three path. LORD CAPTAIN was in the three path through the turns and was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE was unhurried while off the inside, advanced from the four path into the far turn, gained momentum in late turn, swung into the lane four
wide with serious momentum, caught the leader, rushed past inside the eighth pole and was never threatened thereafter. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL stalked the
pacesetter from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, was passed by the winner when closing in on the leader, continued
on with good energy to settle for second best. HOT LITTLE THING set the pace from the two path through the far turn, continued with a clear lead with an
eighth to go then was no match for the top two while staying on for the show spot. TIZZY JOJO was never a serious threat while near the inside.
PASSIONFORJUSTICE saved ground throughout and tired through the lane. EMPIRE SUNRISE was in the two path through the turns and lacked a closing
response. E'S MAGIC chased the pace along the inside through the far turn then was empty turning into the lane. RILEYS REDEMPTION never a factor
while in the three or four path through the turn. QUILTER was outrun near the rail. NIGHT LIVIN chased the pace from the three path through the far turn
then was done nearing the quarter pole. TEAKETTLE was outrun while in the two or three path through the turns. UNBRIDLED TALENT raced in proximity
through the far turn while in the four path then was empty turning into the lane.

the two path and then couldn't hold off the winner. MOWINS raced in the five path with a mild late bid. HAZEL RAH pressed the pace outside of the leader
in the four path, then faltered in the stretch. CIBOLO saved ground, angled three wide in the stretch but had no late bid. STOP HAMMERTIME had a mild
late bid in the stretch. ME AND CHILI stalked in the two path before yielding. FLOWERPECKER pressed the pace inside, then faded in the stretch
STARSPANGLEDXPRESS and LATIGO were not factors. The five-eighths time was omitted due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
COUNTRY CELEBRATION led, drifted in, lasted. FURRST HANKA steady gain. SEPARATE INCIDENT always prominent. IN THE CARTEL energy too
late. BV BLAZE OF GLORY even run, mid-pack. RUNNING WATER bore in start, no menace. APOLLITICAL B GIRL brushed early. ALOTA LOVIN bobbled
start. AJK PAYYOURTAX shut off early, lost chance. APOLLITICAL UPRISE squeezed start, lost path. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #4 SEPARATE
INCIDENT AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5 COUNTRY CLELEBRATION FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN #3 RUNNING WATER BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM 6TH AND PLACED 9TH FOR
