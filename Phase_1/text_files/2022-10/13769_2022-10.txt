Footnotes
MAGICAL EXPRESS dueled early, shook clear on the tun, remained clear in mid stretch and lasted late under strong handling. LAZARUS PROJECT was
never far back, rallied on the turn four wide closed fast and just missed. MAKING ME CRAZY was allowed to settle early, rallied in the stretch while between
horses, finished willingly in a good effort to just miss. BREEZY MONEY raced close up throughout and went evenly late. CUMBER never far back, saved
ground and lacked a late response. SAMURAI SAINT raced wide and was no threat. TOMATO BILL pressed the pace and gradually weakened .
