Footnotes
WHITE PIGEON settled off the early pace while off the inside, moved three wide through mid-turn when moving closest to the leader, bid two wide near the
three-sixteenths pole, dueled to near the sixteenth pole and edged up late. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN raced off to a clear lead soon after the start, continued
clear in late turn while moving nearer the rail, dueled with the winner near the eighth pole to inside the sixteenth pole and could not keep up while clearly
second best. KOSELIO raced between rivals through the turn when never far back, shifted into the four path after straightening in the lane then chased the
top two home while well clear for the show spot. C J ALL THE WAY chased the pace from along the inside through the turn then faded through the stretch
run. GREY CHARMER was never a factor while in the two path through the turn and into the lane. TRAPPE THE GOLD chased the early pace into the turn
while near the inside then retreated through the lane.

INEEDAGIRLLIKEYOU vied for the lead into the far turn while two wide, cleared in late turn, widened into the lane then was kept to the task to last.
LAYLA'S SONG chased the pace from along the inside through the turn, guided to the three path entering the lane then steadily gained on the top one but
ran out of real estate. COUNTRY JEWEL raced in the two path through the turns, got closer to the inside into the lane and was gaining to the end. ZIPSY
ROSE LEE was unhurried down the backstretch, moved four wide into the far turn, got into serious contention into the lane, lost ground when fanning into
the five path and offered a mild late gain. SAKONNA settled early, bid three wide through the turn to get into contention then flattened out inside the eighth
pole. CAJUN KID raced in the three path through the turns and lacked a closing response. TWISTED GARTER inside through the far turn, came into the
three path for the drive and lacked a response. MAPLELINE vied for the lead into the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. AKEDAH pressed the
pace from into between rivals into the backstretch and was done after a half.

Footnotes
DRIVEN ONE dueled inside, went clear in the stretch and lasted under mild urging. POPSTER steadied early, raced inside, angled five wide at the quarter
pole and rallied belatedly. MOON DOG stalked the pace in the three path, rallied five wide on the far turn and missed. NOMADIC FIGHTER was unrushed
between rivals, saved ground around the far turn, rallied late but hung. BIG BLUE stalked the pace in the three path, bid late and then faltered.
MATTHEWSTHIRTYFOUR was checked in the early going inside, saved ground and had a mild late bid. SKYLINE dueled outside of the winner, then gave
way in the stretch. GROOM LAKE was unrushed, then bid late in the five path. ASCENDING MOON stalked the pace in the four path before fading in the
stretch. KING OF STING raced evenly. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) was not a factor. KILLER BEE stalked between foes to the far turn and gave way.
