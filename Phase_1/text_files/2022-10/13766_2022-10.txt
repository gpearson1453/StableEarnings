between rivals and rallied. SAMUI SUNSET , three wide both turns, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out late and gave way grudgingly. DR. FERBER
, four wide the far turn, moved inside horses in mid stretch and had a slight rally. PRINCE OF PORTLAND raced in mid pack between horses and failed to
rally. MINT GAME , angled to the seven path between horses in upper stretch, passed tired ones. HONOR MY WORLD raced between horses, swung to

factor, moved to the eight path in upper stretch. ALPHA QUEUE set the pace alohg the inner rail and gave way in the drive. PRETTY GOOD YEAR raced in

Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN rated kindly while stalking outside a rival, bid to engage the leader after a half mile, took a short lead mid turn, responded to solid handling
and kicked clear in upper stretch, kept on under a drive and steadily widened in the final seventy yards. NO FOOLING DUDE was sent clear early, dropped
in and set the pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted three furlongs out, sparred inside the winner to the head of the lane, kept on gamely through
the final furlong and regained the place. TAUBER , bumped at the break, edged up between foes to track, moved up three to four wide leaving the far turn,
threatened the winner approaching the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch then flattened out. TOMMY SHELBY , outrun early, moved up between foes
around the turn, dropped inside for the drive and closed steadily. LADDIE LIAM , hustled along four wide chasing the pace, circled six wide into the lane but
came up empty. NOTION TO TAPIT , bumped at the break, raced off the early pace, came three wide into the lane, shifted in and churned on with interest.
NO MORE TALK , well placed stalking inside, angled out mid turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, failed to kick on and faded. OXIDE dropped well back
early, saved ground around the turn and had belated interest. TOM TERRIFIC , bumped at the start, raced four wide around the turn and lacked a punch.
COMMANDING GENERAL was sent up inside early and gained a forward spot, came off the rail mid turn, altered five wide with pursuit in upper stretch and
weakened. MAID THE JOURNEY saved ground and faltered. RAPID RESPONSE , five wide outside rivals and in range to the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
SKY'S NOT FALLING showed speed inside horses down the backstretch, moved to the two path on the turn, advanced between horses entering the
stretch, remained on his left lead until late, was well clear in mid stretch, dug in and came to the finish with a loose right rein. ROCK THE BOAT , off slowly,
was rank in traffic entering the turn, raced between foes in the stretch and rallied. SHOWTIME CAT , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground
around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and rallied between horses. CYNERGY'S STAR saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses and lacked
the needed response. GRATEFUL BRED , soundly bumped and forced in by PICKIN SEA GLASS leaving the starting gate, swung to the four path turning
for home and failed to rally. BOSS MAN J J , three deep leaving the backstretch, moved in on turn, was on the lead near the inner rail entering the stretch
and weakened. PICKIN SEA GLASS bore in leaving the starting gate, was shuffled back entering the turn then was not a late factor. ISLAND PHILO
showed speed, circled the turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY was hard sent to the lead, dropped in and edged away a bit into the turn, rated kindly around the turn, was guided off the inside
entering the turn, responded when set down soon after and pulled away under a drive. HELDISH edged up between foes early to reach a forward spot,
dropped in to advance inside runners past the three eighths, came back out to take aim with a quarter to go, gave game chase but had to settle for the
place. WILDHUNCH , four deep early, stalked three wide mid turn, came back out for the drive and gave way grudgingly. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER broke
slowly and raced well back early, gained steam off the rail mid turn, angled six wide into the lane, shifted back in through the final furlong and closed willingly
between runners. LOST WEEKEND stumbled and was soundly bumped at the break, recovered and moved up between foes in the opening furlong, angled
in to make a run mid turn, chased into the lane and gave way grudgingly. TIZ NO CLOWN , three wide between runners chasing the pace mid turn, came up
empty. PRIDE OF PAYTON , four wide mid turn, faded. PAYMENGOLD flashed speed then dropped back between runners nearing the half mile marker,
saved ground into the lane, eased out past the three sixteenths and offered a mild kick. INDYBOUND , three to four wide, failed to keep pace into the lane
and gave way. BO'S BOURBON rushed up inside then had to steady after about a sixteenth of a mild, saved ground and steadied off heels near the three
eighths, failed to go on from there and gave way. BANDITS HEART stumbled and was bumped at the break, chased the early pace between foes, failed to
kick on past the three eighths and faltered.

away. STARTWITHABANG trailed down the backstretch, fanned six deep entering the stretch and rallied. SHERIFF'S KID , between horses turning for
home, swung to the seven path in mid stretch and passed tired foes. UNREQUITED LOVE sprinted clear early, set the pace near the rail and weakened the
final sixteenth. BETCHA BY GOLLY , in the three path between horses around the turn, offered a mild move to mid stretch then weakened. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING , three wide leaving the turn, was no threat. SOMMER VELVET , bumped leaving the starting gate, was three deep on the backstretch,
chased the pace and tired. SICK PACK SARA , four deep mid way on the turn, weakened. SPANIKOPITA raced in the two path between horses turning for
home and failed to rally. DULCE KIARA bumped SOMMER VELVET when drifting out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch
and was not a factor. TARGE raced along the inner rail around the turn and weakened. CHICA RABIOSA gave way and was eased late.
BELLSWILLBERINGING , outrun, was eased late. BON FIRE DIVA chased the pace, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
COCONUT CAKE , three wide the first turn, relaxed outside foes through the backstretch, picked up the pace past three wide past the five sixteenths,
shifted out a bit wider into the lane and closed in under a drive, moved alongside DOUBLE FIREBALL with a furlong remaining, kept on doggedly, wrested
command in deep stretch and prevailed. DOUBLE FIREBALL took command outside rivals heading to the first turn, then clear and angled in to set a rated
pace, responded to asking in upper stretch, dug in when collared with a furlong remaining, fought valiantly to the end but just wasn't quite good enough.
AMPLIO ESQUEMA rated off the pace while saving ground, was held up a bit leaving the far turn then eased out and worked between runners near the
quarter pole, swung out for the drive and closed nicely to gain. MY DIXIE LASS , between runners and off the early pace, angled five to six wide for the drive
and offered a mild run. MALDIVES MODEL rated in the two path, raced between runners leaving the far turn, angled out and made progress four wide into
the stretch but failed to seriously sustain in the final sixteenth. GALS GAL , between runners stalking past the three and a half pole, chased three wide into
the lane and faded. I'M GITTIN THERE stalked the leader, came under a ride mid way on the final turn, dropped in and faded. MY THOUGHTS , in range
while saving ground, dropped back under coaxing near the five sixteenths, was trying to make some headway then had to steadied in close quarters in mid
stretch. MOSALAH , three deep early, made a four wide advance approaching the stretch, failed to kick on soon into the lane and faded. GAMESTONKS
rated off the early pace, was under asking three to four wide nearing the lane but lacked a kick.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT bobbled very slightly at the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn stalking the pace, eased out three wide entering the stretch, swept to
command outside MALIBU BEAUTY inside the three sixteenths pole and was kept under urging in the drive. MALIBU BEAUTY , clear soon after the start,
saved ground on the turn, drifted to the two path turning for home and finished gamely while unable to withstand the winner. SWEET GRACIE , four deep
around the turn, was fanned to the six path entering the stretch and rallied mildly. BOURBON WILDCAT , outside horses while chasing the pace around the
turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and weakened. FOOL YOURSELF , between horses chasing the pace around the turn, was in the four path at
the head of the stretch and weakened. WICKED HOT , a forward factor in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch, weakened on the turn.
BREVIARY was outrun. SUMMER ODDS hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to be a factor. COURAGEOUS GIRL raced between horses and
gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CHICKIENESS drifted out at the break, corrected and edged up to pursue, circled four wide into the lane, leveled off under right handed asking leaving the
eighth pole, rolled up outside the leaders to take command in deep stretch then drew clear. SKYLAR'S SISTER prompted the pace two wide, moved up to
loom outside the leader mid turn, gave hard chase from there, came back on while on her left lead to threaten between rivals inside the sixteenth pole, kept
on willingly and got the place. BOSSERATI sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away an initial threat mid turn, spurted away off the
rail and under a drive past the three sixteenths, drifted a bit and gave way grudgingly. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA broke a step slow, recovered and moved up
towards the inside, angled out under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, swung six wide soon into the lane and rallied. FIVECOMMATWO , hustled along two
wide around the turn, lacked a rally. SHELL BELLE , jostled at the break, raced well back and between rivals into the turn, churned on but failed to menace.
PRECIOUS AVARY drifted out at the break and bumped soundly with SHELL BELLE, saved ground and offered a mild kick. DIAMOND SUE , bumped at
the break, raced between runners heading to the turn, shifted four wide but lacked a rally. LECTRIC ROD flashed speed inside, was hustled along around
the turn and faded. BLOME , off the pace, raced four wide mid turn and gave way. COCKTAIL DREAMING , brushed at the break, moved up early and
chased four to five wide, stayed a presence to the head of the lane then faltered. FLAMINGO FAZE stumbled badly at the break, regrouped to be four wide
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WICKED PRANKSTER sprinted clear soon after the start, was taken to the inner rail approaching the first turn, remained along the rail throughout,
responded tenaciously n the drive and prevailed. STREET COPPER raced in mid pack down the backstretch, moved up outside foes on the far turn, was
fanned five wide at the head of the stretch and rallied. CRABS N BEER , three wide both turns, chased the winner throughout in a game performance.
JOHNG lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. MIDNIGHT HAULER , in the three path on the first turn, was in the
four path between horses turning for home and passed tired ones. NICK PAPAGIORGIO , reluctant to load into the starting gate, prompted the pace outside
the winner and weakened late. CANNON'S ROAR , checked in tight quarters approaching the first turn, circled the first turn four wide, remained well off the
rail and failed to rally. RHUMJAR , steadied in close quarters approaching the first turn, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch and lacked a rally. SO
STREET stalked the pace racing along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. NICKY BEAR , along the inner rail on the far turn, was not a factor. BENNY
HAVENS , well placed four wide entering the stretch, faltered. MR. D'ANGELO was outun. UP AGAINST IT , three wide the first turn, was five wide leaving
the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON tracked a contested pace three wide, eased out a bit wider advancing into the lane, closed in under strong handling and joined
the fray a furlong out, took over outside the leading pair with a sixteenth to go, kicked clear and was taken in hand at the wire. KARAN'S NOTION , away
alertly, forced the pace outside HEIR PORT, dueled between runners while on near even terms leaving the eighth pole, kept on gamely and saved the
place. ALWAYSINAHURRY , a bit sluggish from the gate, was put to a ride soon after while outside rivals, shifted six wide into the lane and closed willingly
to nab the show. WHISKEY AND YOU drifted in at the break and was off a bit slow, corrected and saved ground, eased off the rail leaving the far turn,
edged up between runners past the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the lane and rallied. GOLDENIZE , taken to rate early on, raced between runners
leaving the far turn, crept closer four wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish through the final furlong. HEIR PORT sped to the front, set a pressured pace
towards the rail, maintained the advantage under strong asking past mid stretch, ceded the lead with about a sixteenth to go and faded late. MEMORY
BOUQUET taken to rate just off the leaders in the opening furlong, shifted in and was hustled along to the inside of the winner, gave futile chase in mid
stretch and faded. GOING TO THE LEAD , squeezed at the break, raced wide and off the pace, swung very wide for the drive and was trying at the wire.
TREASURE TRADITION , brushed at the break, three wide early, angled six wide under pressure into the lane but lacked a rally. REDEEM EDDIE , rank at
the break and off slow, rushed up inside, gave some chase then dropped back leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
POUNDING MUSIC rated close up between rivals, dropped in entering the lane and bid to take over, kicked clear, kept on under strong handling, dug in
tenaciously when confronted in deep stretch and prevailed. DOWNTOWN KATIE rated three wide early, commenced a run outside rivals leaving the three
eighths, swept six wide into the lane, closed gamely outside the winner but just could not get past. MOSLER'S IMAGE rated close up while saving ground,
was stalled from the three eighths to past the five sixteenths, had clear sailing along the rail through the final furlong and rallied to nab the show.
EVANGELINE ALLONS rated in the two path early on, progressed past the five sixteenths, sustained between foes leaving mid stretch but out kicked in the
final seventy yards. GLOSSAMER prompted the pace, bid in hand outside PLEASE MARRY ME near the half mile marker, took over past the three eighths,
spurted clear then was guided four wide into the lane, was headed from the inside by the winner and gave way grudgingly. BRUSHING rated outside foes
early on, gained four to five wide approaching the stretch then flattened out. RED WINE TIME , reluctant to load, hesitated at the break to be away a few
lengths behind the field, swung five wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. FOXTROT SEVILLE lagged well back, raced three wide into the lane, shifted
in but came up empty. MO FIRE , inside early, angled out, edged up four wide nearing the quarter pole then gave way. DRY WELL rated along early, angled
out nearing the quarter pole but failed to respond. LOVE MY CAT saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch but failed to menace. PLEASE
MARRY ME pulled her way clear from the outside then dropped in, met an outside challenge leaving the five eighths, sparred around the final turn, failed to
keep pace past the five sixteenths and weakened.
