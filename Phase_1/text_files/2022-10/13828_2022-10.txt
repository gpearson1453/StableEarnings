Footnotes
IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN , lightly steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, was blocked inside the eighth pole, altered course to the
six path near the sixteenth pole, closed determinedly and was up at the finish. AMERICAS WOMAN saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail
through the stretch, gained a brief lead late and gave way grudgingly. RENAISSANCE (IRE) , rated off the rail on the turn, angled outside in upper stretch,
had aim on the lead in mid stretch and came up empty. CAST NO STONES showed speed along the inner rail around the turn, raced in the two path in the
stretch and weakened. AWESOME LAWSON , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses in upper stretch, was taken to the five path in mid
stretch and lacked the necessary late response. LOOKS DON'T LIE bore in leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside CAST NO STONES and
weakened. WATER WITCH , steadied in traffic about a furlong after the break, circled horses four wide leaving the turn, floated to the seven path in mid
stretch and was not a factor. CERULEAN was outrun. TORRE BRANCA broke slowly and was outrun. CHICAGO RIVER dropped back entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET ASTA , bumped at the break, recovered and raced snugly in hand four to five wide off the early pace, circled six wide with momentum into the lane,
surged past the embattled leaders leaving the three sixteenths, kicked clear under a drive, wandered inward and held sway. SAINT MARCO, bobble at the
break, raced three deep with the pace, dueled leaving the far turn, carried that battle four wide outside SCINTILLIO into the lane, failed to match strides with
the winner but stayed on well to be clear of the rest. MANKLIN CREEK saved ground, edged up into the lane, eased out then back in for the final furlong
and churned on. UNCOMMON VALOR lagged off the pace while towards the inside, swung well wide past mid stretch and had belated action. GIVE IT A
GO chased the pace, moved up between runners mid turn then faded. SCINTILLIO disputed the pace two wide, took a short between runners past the half
mile marker, dueled into the lane then gave way. BET ON BITZ , four wide with pursuit, faded. I'M NOT SLOW , bumped at the break, sped up and took
command inside a rival leaving the chute, set a pressured pace, was headed around the far turn and faltered. PER RULING #23-051 FROM THE
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, SWEET ASTA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SAFEEN stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn, challenged for the lead outside ZIPADOO in upper stretch
and prevailed in an extended drive. ZIPADOO chased the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead leaving the far turn and gave way grudgingly.
SILENT STORY lacked speed, eased off the inner rail entering the far turn, was three wide turning for home and passed tired horses. INSCRUTABLE
lacked speed, eased off the inner rail entering the far turn, followed SILENT STORY around the turn, angled four deep entering the stretch and passed tired
rivals. RIDE THE RAPIDS , three wide both turns, chased the pace and tired the final furlong. WICKED KITTEN raced between horses the far turn and
retreated through the stretch. HIGH DONNA , a bit rank approaching the first turn, eagerly rushed up between horses to take the lead entering the far turn,
showed speed to the stretch and tired. MODERN SOCIETY , three deep the first turn, was not a factor. WAVERLEY was no factor. CONCERT HALL trailed.

Footnotes
DEVILISH AFFAIR , away well, rated back from between rivals near the five eighths, tracked behind foes leaving the far turn, dropped in to advance nearing
the lane, came back out with three sixteenths remaining, responded to left handed asking and leveled off nicely past the furlong grounds, reeled in the
leader in deep stretch then went clear at the wire. SHINY PENNY was taken back off the leaders soon after the start, angled in and edged up nearing the
turn, slipped through along the inside and joined the dueling trio of leaders past the five sixteenths, wrested command soon after, spurted away under a
drive in mid stretch, kept on gamely but could not fend off the winner's charge. MAGICGIRL , with the early pace three wide between foes, eased back off
the pace leaving the far turn, shifted in for the drive, came back on with interest in the final furlong and nabbed the show. TORCH CARRIER disputed the
pace four deep mid turn, failed to go on with the leaders past the three sixteenths, exchanged a brush with FORTES in the final sixteenth but kept on with
some effort. FORTES , three wide between runners contesting the pace mid turn, brushed with TORCH CARRIER late and gave way stubbornly. HAD THE
NOTION , sluggish away, circled six wide into the lane but lacked a bid. R TRUE SENSATION speed clear early, set the pace just off the inside, was
surrounded mid turn, fought on to upper stretch then gave way.

CENTER STAGE , patiently rated along the inner rail for six furlongs, eased out to the three path at the head of the stretch, steadily advanced outside
MURPH, overtook that one inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MURPH , clear on the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way
grudgingly. TOSS A COIN , rated along the inner rail for six furlongs, was taken to the three path turning for home and rallied. CHELICHNA saved ground
around the far turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. NIBBLES , outside horses down the backstretch and in the home stretch, lacked
the necessary late effort. EISWEIN , no threat, raced between horses and passed tired ones. DOTADA lost ground on the turns and failed to rally. AMUNET
, no factor, swung to the seven path inside the eighth pole. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , three wide the first turn, chased the pace two wide around the far turn
and gave way. MIRANDA'S DESMOND was no factor.

Footnotes
SENSON rated close up three wide and between foes, took command without much asking past the five sixteenths, was nudged clear soon into lane,
moved way in mid stretch, cruised home from there and was confidently handled through the final sixteenth. DIAL EMMA REILLY , off the pace, was under
pressure off the rail and gathered steam past the five sixteenths, swung out five wide for the drive and finished with good energy. SCAMPER ALONG ,
brushed at the break, was hustled along off the rail around the turn, circled five wide into the lane and offered a mild rally. SALAMINA , well placed tracking
outside a rival, edged up between foes mid turn and had dead aim, failed to quicken with the winner, chased to mid stretch then faded. SOME IS NINE
broke a step slow, advanced outside rivals past the five eighths and bid to force the issue, lost ground around the turn and gave way. JOE MIKE JIM
prompted the pace while saving ground, failed to go on under asking mid turn and faded. MICK'SBESTBETYET , urged along saving ground mid turn,
swung out for the drive but failed to rally. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ , sluggish from the gate, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace.
MEJORAMIGA sped clear early and dropped in towards the rail, took pressure past the three eighths, stayed on to remain a presence to upper stretch then
succumbed.

POST TIME broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and was taken to rate, edged up to the outside of NOAH CHANCE nearing the turn and
stalked the leaders, crept closer without much effort mid turn, shifted out and launched a bold four wide bid into the lane, quickly cleared and drifted out from
a left handed ask, wandered inward from some right handed encouragement leaving mid stretch, was taken in hand for the final sixteenth and eagerly
widened. VALENZAN DAY sped clear early, dropped in towards the rail and set the pace under asking, took pressure from ROAN BURGUNDY leaving the
far turn, dueled approaching the quarter pole, failed to contain the winner soon into the lane but kept on willingly to be clear for the place. ROAN
BURGUNDY drifted out at the break, straightened and was taken to rate, moved up to prompt the pace outside VALENZAN DAY with three eighths to go,
sparred under asking then raced between runners into the stretch, drifted out nearing mid stretch and faded. COMPLETED STORM , bumped and in tight at
the break, raced three wide into the lane and failed to menace. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL stumbled and was roughed up at the break, dropped well back
leaving the chute, angled out in the lane and had some late energy. MY MAMBA saved ground without making an impact. NOAH CHANCE stalked inside,
was under pressure into the lane, failed to kick on and faded.
