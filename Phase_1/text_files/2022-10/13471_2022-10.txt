Footnotes
SAFE TRAVELS was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a comfortable advantage from the outset to the far turn, held sway on a widening advantage
into the stretch, was kept to pressure to late stages and was taken in hand in the final strides. MISSION BELLE tracked the pacesetter three deep between
foes to the backstretch, then came around a rival leaving the far turn to steadily close the gap on the winner to the end. TAPERINEA, caught four wide
racing into the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch tracking the leader outside a rival to the far turn, angled inside on the second bend, saved
ground to upper stretch but had no late bid. LAKE BARKLEY angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, raced in hand
nearing the second bend when caught behind a fallen rival and offered no rally. SHE TAKES FLIGHT was a brief factor between foes in second flight,
steadied off a fallen rival nearing the far turn and soon faded. ROYA trailed throughout. IRISH HALO was rated tracking just off the pacesetter along the
inside in the opening half, lost her rider racing into the far turn but walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN BUT OFFERED NO RALLY.

Footnotes
LORD DYLAN was placed on the lead for the opening half furlong but relegated to second as HURTS SO BAD rushed up near the five eighths, stalked
inside to the half, tracked the leader in the two path on the turn, tipped outside of HURTS SO BAD into the lane and bid to his outside under a drive, took the
lead near the furlong mark and edged away under a hand ride late. HURTS SO BAD rushed to the lead near the five eighths, cleared into the turn and set
the pace in the two path, maintained a narrow lead in upper stretch as LORD DYLAN bore down to his outside, was headed by that foe near the furlong
mark and chased on second best. TRIPLE CHROME broke out, tracked between horses early, chased two wide on the turn, shifted five wide to upper
stretch and drifted out a bit more, chased on willingly under a drive, got up for show near the furlong mark and proved best of the rest. GOTTA CHASE IT
chased two wide early, made a bid three and then four wide around the turn, loomed approaching the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, proved no
match for the top two and flattened late. PERIPATETIC was bumped by KING ZION in the opening strides, settled near the rear outside of that foe early,
continued near the rear in the four to five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and kept on mildly past tiring horses. KING ZION broke out and
bumped PERIPATETIC in the opening strides, raced with the rear flight early, continued patiently in the two to three path on the turn, was driven between
horses in the lane but lacked the needed kick. MORANT chased near the rear early, was outpaced in the three to four path on the turn and offered no rally
in the lane. WILDCAT HAGRID was in tight early, tracked inside down the backstretch, chased along the rail around the turn, came into the lane still inside,
and had no response. GRUMPA tracked three wide early, tracked the leader outside of LORD DYLAN into the turn, flattened three wide from the three
eighths, floated five wide into the lane and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
STAR OF KODIAK tracked just off the leaders between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, made a steady advance to striking
distance inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm left handed encouragement. STALLONE broke sharply, dueled
for command inside a rival into the turn, went clear midway through the bend, shifted off the rail setting the pace on a clear margin to midstretch, then
grudgingly resisted the winner's bid while failing to contain that rival. TOM'S LAST GENERAL, urged three deep between foes in the second flight in the
opening stages, gained a position just off the leaders while angling to the rail racing into he turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch while being
roused to advance but had no final kick. TETSU raced behind the second flight off the inside in the opening quarter, was forced wide racing through the turn,
then continued four deep into the lane while making an effort to improve position. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the
second flight in the opening three sixteenths, was eased off the pace while shifting off the inside racing into the turn, was forced wide on the bend avoiding
some traffic and gained some position late outside foes while making no real impact. COMFORT ME NOW tracked the leaders four wide in second flight in
the opening stages, was forced wide avoiding a stricken rival midway through the turn while shifting into the path of TETSU and soon gave way. MAJESTIC
ATTACK was off slowly and failed to menace thereafter. SUSPECT was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, was pulled up abruptly
after taking an awkward step midway through the turn, then was vanned off the course following the race. THE HALF MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
OEUVRE stalked outside of WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY, encroached outside her into the turn, headed her near the three eighths under her own volition, edged
to a clear lead past the five sixteenths, opened up when shaken up near the three sixteenths, continued to open up under a mild hand ride and was
wrapped up late. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY was sent for speed inside, set the pace while prompted by OEUVRE to her outside, was engaged by that foe into
the turn and headed near the three eighths, tracked the pace inside to upper stretch, could not keep up when OEUVRE was shaken up near the three
eighths, but chased on under a drive and held place. READY TO RUNAWAY broke out and bumped SOMEONE SAID SO in the opening strides, settled at
the inside of the rear flight, raced in the two path on the turn well behind the leading trio, was driven inside in upper stretch and bumped SOMEONE SAID
SO, chased on mildly and missed place between horses. SHARP HERO tracked the leading pair three wide early, continued in range in the four path on the
turn, was no match for OEUVRE and WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY into upper stretch and flattened out. SOMEONE SAID SO was bumped by READY TO
RUNAWAY in the opening strides, chased in the rear flight outside of that foe down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was bumped again by
READY TO RUNAWAY in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally and drifted out late.

Footnotes
SHE B GLAMOROUS was settled last in hand to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, swung out six wide in upper stretch
and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under energetic handling. DAIGLE dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the
backstretch, conceded the lead after a half, switched outside the pacesetter entering the far turn while being prompted to regain terms with that rival,
pressed the issue into the stretch to strike the front nearing the furlong marker and continued willingly to the end while just failing to contain the winner. ON
A TOUR tracked off the second flight three deep to the backstretch, was urged to advance four deep between foes through the stretch and produced a
steady late response to edge several rivals for a share at the wire. SILVERA tracked just off the first flight along the rail from the outset to the far turn, shifted
out racing into the stretch, then three deep between foes in the closing stages gaining position while being just outkicked for a share. NORTHERN
ALLIANCE, reserved while angling sharply to the inside in the opening stages to race behind the second flight, saved ground on the far turn awaiting an
opening nearing upper stretch, tipped off the inside, then altered course inside foes racing through the stretch and continued willingly while being outkicked
for position. ROMANTIC ATTACK, in touch prompting the pacesetter racing into the first turn, pressed the into the far turn while angling to the inside once
gaining a clear advantage between calls, dueled inside foes into the stretch and came up empty leaving the furlong marker. RENTAL POOL tracked off the
first flight outside a rival in the opening half, steadily gained on the leaders three wide racing into the far turn, shifted to the five path entering upper stretch
and failed to sustain her momentum. IMAGINE GOLD settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. KINDA LUCKY angled to the
inside in the opening stages to track behind the second flight between foes racing to the far turn but came up empty when called upon to advance entering
the lane.

Footnotes
RESURRECTION ROAD was placed on the lead and cleared, set a comfortable and uncontested pace, saved ground while clear around the turn, went to a
drive in upper stretch and maintained a clear advantage inside to the finish. NOFANSINTHESTANDS chased midpack, was pushed along and responded
with a rally in the four to five path on the far turn, chased RESURRECTION ROAD willingly under a drive in the lane but proved a clear second best.
WEEKEND PASS settled near the rear, continued patiently down the backstretch in the rear pair, raced in the rear flight in the four path around the far turn,
was urged approaching the quarter pole and driven five wide into the stretch, and chased on best of the rest. DARING DAMSEL was restless in the gate,
tracked the leader outside of WANNA HAVE FUN, took slightly closer order in tandem with that foe past the five eighths, tracked between horses in the
three to four path on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and flattened. SIMPLY FAST settled at the rear, took briefly closer order inside of WEEKEND
PASS near the nine sixteenths, saved ground in the rear flight on the far turn, drifted out sharply in upper stretch and had no rally in the lane. WANNA HAVE
FUN tracked the leader inside of DARING DAMSEL, inched slightly closer to the leader in tandem with that foe past the five eighths, raced in the two path
on the far turn at the inside of the tracking flight, was driven inside into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
UPBEAT MELODY broke sharply, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside into the bend, then kicked away through the stretch
under firm handling. KENNESAW tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail
for the place honors inside foes. SWISHAWISH angled inwards to lead the second flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out four wide racing
through the stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a share. LAKE MILLS angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing
into the bend, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes. ON K P was urged three wide
prompting the pace from the outset to upper stretch but yielded in late stages. BAYOU COLONEL tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the
bend, shifted out three wide in the lane and continued evenly late. CINDY'S G MAN was urged to terms pressing the pacesetter between foes through the
backstretch into the turn, came up empty leaving midstretch and was taken in hand in the closing stages. MY BROTHER CAM, off last, tracked off the
second flight racing four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. WHERE'D THE DAY GO settled between foes in
early stages and never gained contention. DASTARDLY DEEDS settled outside foes, raced wide into the stretch and proved no factor. STORMIN EL
PRADO, held up between foes avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, failed to menace thereafter. LONESOME DREAM was settled last while going
a bit erratically on the backstretch and trailed the field into the stretch.

Footnotes
MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was reluctant to load, broke sharply, attended three wide outside of the dueling pair, took the lead three wide past the three eighths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in gamely under a drive, turned back TURN THE SWITCH near the sixteenth pole and held sway. RUBY'S
RED DEVIL settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear pair on the turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, was taken five wide into upper stretch
and went to a drive, closed willingly and gained to the finish. TURN THE SWITCH tracked the leading line outside of MANGO TREE early, chased the
leading line in the two path on the far turn, took closer order on them from near the five sixteenths, shifted inside of MIND YOUR OWN BIZ in upper stretch
and loomed through midstretch, but was turned back near the sixteenth and flattened late. MANGO TREE was anxious in the gate, tracked the leading line
inside of TURN THE SWITCH early, chased in the four to five path on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, and lacked the needed late kick.
UNBROKEN SONG settled toward the rear, saved ground in the rear pair on the turn, regained touch with the rest of the field into upper stretch, was driven
two wide, kept on mildly and drifted out late. WINGING WAYS dueled between horses, took a brief lead near the three eighths when CHOPPER began to
weaken, was soon headed by MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch and weakened. CHOPPER dueled inside of WINGING
WAYS, began to flatten near the three eighths and had no more in the lane.
