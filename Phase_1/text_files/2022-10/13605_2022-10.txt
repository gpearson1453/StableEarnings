ROZ Gained four wide on the turn, reached the leader in gear, put that away and drew off while drifting out through the final sixteenths. MIDNIGHT
MINDSET Away well, set the pace along the two path, was hooked at the top of the lane, altered well out in the strip in upper stretch and finished well.
