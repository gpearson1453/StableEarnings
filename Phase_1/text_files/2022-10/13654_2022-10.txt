Footnotes
AFRICAN ANGEL was well placed early and was between rivals on the turn, split rivals leaving the five sixteenths and made a three wide bid by the quarter
pole to duel for command, then kicked clear the final furlong to prove best, driving. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR set a pressured pace two wide early, then was
on the inside on the turn and dueled by the quarter pole, then ran on to the wire to be second best. SIDESWIPED tracked the pace and was on the inside
on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but needed more. CAIRO SUGAR was reluctant to load, settled five wide early, then
dropped down to be three wide by the quarter pole and offered a belated rally. I CAME TO DANCE was reluctant to load, off a step slow and settled on the
inside, made a mild inside bid leaving the turn but had no late kick. FOXY JUNIOR chased the pace four wide and made a five wide bid by the quarter pole
but flattened out. IOANNA broke outwardly at the start, pressed the pace three wide and was four wide by the quarter pole and came up empty.

under steady right handed crop urging. TAYLOR'S BELLE was four wide into the first turn, reserved early, advanced four wide on the turn and came five
wide in to the drive and finished willingly to be clearly second best. MIKEY'S JEWEL was off slowly, settled back early, came widest into the lane and was
along for the show award. MIA ANGELINA was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. HOLMDEL PARK set a pressured
pace off the inside and gave way on the turn. ABHAILE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. SMOKIN CLASS was rank and checked into the first
turn, then dropped back on the inside on the turn. WICKED SOLUTION pressed the pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn and stopped.

SIR ROCKPORT was well rated early and made a three wide move on the turn, took over leaving the three sixteenths and then drifted in slightly nearing the
sixteenth marker while clear and widened the margin late to prove best. KEIKO KRAHE dueled for the lead three wide, made a bid to shake clear on the
turn, then dueled with the winner leaving the turn and angled off the inside by the sixteenth pole, second best. MY MAGICAL MAN chased the pace on the
inside and lacked the needed winning bid. ELEVATED FOREVER was reserved early on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated
rally. KNOCKOUT KICK dueled for the lead on the inside and folded in the lane. The rider on number five claimed foul against the winner for alleged
interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays they disallowed the claim of foul and left the race as is.

KEEPING IT COUNTRY set the pace while in the two path, then was headed by the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the turn and then held sway late to
prove best under a drive. RAY OF LIGHT was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the lane, altered course in the furlong grounds and split rivals
late to gain the place award while gaining. BAILEY COFFEE was washed out in the post parade, then broke alertly and prompted the pace and made a
three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, but hung in the lane. NOTEWORTHY was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn but hung
late. D'STORM was off slowly and never factored.

Footnotes
SONG SAVER stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew away leaving the turn and
was kept to mild left handed crop pressure to prove best. QUEEN'S DREAM was settled early, then advanced while in hand between rivals and three wide
on the turn, then was roused by the furlong marker and finished well. TAPIT'S GIRL was well placed and saved ground on the turn, then was blocked by the
quarter pole, angled out leaving the turn for racing room, then had a mild rally to gain the show award late. NAIL POLISH broke a little flat, then settled into
stride, made a four wide move on the turn but flattened out. GOLDEN LAW chased the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled back to trail the field on
the turn, swung out six wide and passed the tiring rivals. POSITIVE FORCE pressed the pace and was between rivals on the turn and weakened.
POLISHED GEM set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
