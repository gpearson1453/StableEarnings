GOLD NOTE was allowed to settle well off a blistering pace for the first three quarters moved up in the three path as the field turned for home took the lead
in the stretch and drew clear for the win. TIGER THE MAN was well off the fast pace made a three wide move on the second turn took a brief lead at the
head of the stretch but could not fend off the winner while second best. RUN FOR MATTY was way off the speed duel made a move four to five wide on the
second turn but was not able to go by the top two. RISKY BOY chased the pace along the inside but had no rally in the stretch. BRAZILIAN SUMMER
sprinted to the front along the inside in a two horse speed duel the pair opened about 10 lengths on the closest rival up the backstretch but stopped midway
on the second turn. BIG BIZ was the outside horse in the speed duel and began to back up on the second turn was eased late but crossed under the wire.
GOT MOJO was always well back and pulled up in the stretch and was vanned off.

MY FIRST PEARL raced along the inside on the turn came three wide turning for home and wore down the frontrunner through the lane to earn the victory.
TRACK SMART was quickest away from the gate opened a good lead at the head of the stretch along the inside took that lead to deep stretch but could not
hold off the winner in the final hundred yards. BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL was well off the pace early skimmed the rail into the stretch to get into contention
was boxed in briefly at the sixteenth pole with MY FIRST PEARL moving up on his outside and TRACK SMART tiring in front of him had to swing out in the
final yards and could not make up the needed ground. BIND ME UP was allowed to settle well off the pace came wide on the turn and through the stretch to
get a minor share. CELEE'S LAST TE was up close in the two path into the stretch but then gave way quickly through the stretch. ALWAYS A TIZ was mid
pack in the two path swung very wide entering the stretch but backed up through the lan.

BRAZEN NOW was allowed to settle just behind the pace but was caught three deep entering the stretch steadily wore down the leaders in the stretch to
earn the victory. AUTOPILOT was well off the early pace came five wide turning for home and was picking up horses through the stretch but could never get
to the winner. TAPPED TO THE MAX was the quickest early and opened a good lead going into the turn held the advantage until mid stretch but gave way
in the final eighth. SKY T was away well and showed good early speed while in the two path was up close to the stretch run and then faded. GREY ROGUE
was along the inside in the middle of the pack but had no rally in the stretch. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY was along the inside up the backstretch and on the
turn and had no rally in the stretch. CHERUBIM raced in the two path in the middle of the pack but had nothing left for the drive. WYOMING CONQUEST
was away a length slow and was in the back throughout while never a factor.

Footnotes
ARIZONA KALEI broke the best and went right to the front in the two path was challenged until midway on the turn and then pulled and steadily increased
the margin at the head of the stretch and drew clear to win as the rider pleased. GRACIE'S A TIGER showed good early speed and challenged the eventual
winner until midway on the turn and was no match for the winner through the stretch while second best. WILLOWMYGIRL raced along the inside on the turn
came through along the rail and was closing well for third while never a threat to the top two. BRING THE POSSE raced three to four wide up the
backstretch and on the turn and could not make up any ground. SHASTAWIN was up close for the first quarter along the inisde but backed up going into the
turn. AMY D was away very slow spotting the field three lengths at the break was hustled to get to mid pack and then tired in the turn. GRAND
EXPECTATIONS was always five to six wide and tired through the stretch.

ARIZONA ANDREW was quickest away from the gates took a clear lead from the outset came off the rail a bit turning for home and was challenged on the
inside and outside but repelled those challenges and drew clear to win while not being asked. ECHO CANYON came four wide on the turn made steady
progress through the stretch and was up for second in the final furlong. BRAYBRAY raced in the two path and was closest to the eventual winner at the
head of the stretch but was caught for second in the final furlong. WHEELER DEALER came through along the inside at the top of the stretch to get into
contention but tired through the lane. MO SUMMER was in the middle of the pack in the two path going into the turn but had nothing to offer in the stretch
and dropped back. ARIZONA STEPHEN was closest to the pace along the inside after a quarter but dropped back quickly going into the turn.

Footnotes
COLLUSIONIST had a ground saving trip for much of the race angled out at the head of the stretch to engage MAIUS through the lane steadily cut the
margin and edged clear inside the final sixteenth. MAIUS was quickest away from the gate and was able to get to the rail before the first turn carved all the
fractions and dug in when challenged in the stretch but could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth. JU JU GUY was also able to get to the
inside before the first turn and chased the frontrunner for much of the race came out a bit at the head of the lane and had to settle for third. CONVENTION
was allowed to settle well of the early pace along the inside began his move up the backstretch and into the second turn but lacked the needed response in
the stretch. TUFF WILLY TE raced three wide the entire race and dropped back as the field went into the second turn. COWBOY DON raced four wide for
most of the race and was never a serious factor in the outcome. KEARNEY raced four wide throughout and had nothing left for the stretch run.
