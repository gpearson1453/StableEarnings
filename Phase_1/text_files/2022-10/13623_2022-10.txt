PRINCESS KAIRA lagged at back of the pack, advanced swiftly wide on the turn then drew away eagerly while not asked for run late. PEARLBDANCING
pursued the loose pacesetter, moved inside in the stretch to gain the place. SEA PINES hustled to a narrow lead, shook loose on the turn then came up
empty in the stretch. HIT A HOMER HONEY settled off the leaders inside and lacked a rally. LOVE THAT FACE forced the pace inside to the far turn and
gave way. MISS ALEX dropped back early saving ground and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DESERT DALLIANCE awaited room inside, moved out in the stretch and pulled away quickly under steady handling. GOLD EXCHANGE forced the pace
outside, led between calls in the stretch, was no match but finished willingly. SWEET FURY settled off the pace inside and lacked a solid rally. CUP OF
LIFE lacked speed, chased wide and passed rivals without menacing. KA KAW urged to the lead inside and faded in the stretch. SUPER DUPER FLY raced
just off the leaders three wide and gave way. RANDOM LUCK dropped back early and trailed losing contact with her field. PER RULING #230759PP FROM
THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, GOLD EXCHANGE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PAGEANT PRINCESS far behind for five furlongs, advanced inside, was bumped late and finished well to earn a dead heat. GIRL'S ON FIRE reserved off
the pace inside, bid in the stretch, rallied with PAGEANT PRINCESS, came in and bumped that foe and dead heated. AZIZA controlled the pace inside,
widened into the stretch, then shortened stride. A RING THING forced the pace outside to the stretch then came up empty. MISS BETH'EL settled inside,
moved wide in the stretch and closed well. MISQUILLO trailed far behind, rallied very wide in the stretch. MUSAMAHA was well placed inside dueling
leaders then flattened out in the stretch. MONSTER RISING chased wide off the leaders and faltered. LENTEN ROSE fanned wide into the first turn then
stopped after half a mile. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE raced close up inside briefly then stopped abruptly. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and the rider of
PAGEANT PRINCESS lodged an objection against the rider of GIRL'S ON FIRE but the result stood.

LORD UHTRED quickly clear inside, repelled repeated challenges and edged away through the final furlong under a drive. HARLEY'S CHARLY close up
from the outset, went after the leader on the turn then weakened late. PRINCE OF CHILL broke poorly, advanced through traffic and closed well to gain
show. CAPITAL CONQUEST raced off the pace inside, moved briefly closer on the turn then faltered. JOHN DUTTON raced wide off the pace then proved
empty in the stretch. RESPIRATOR broke alertly and chased between foes then weakened. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE raced very wide throughout and
lacked a rally. CHIEF FORTY dropped back after the start and was always outrun.

HIDDEN PROMISE urged to the front, repelled challenges by the runner-up and drew off in the final eighth. JUMP FOR ALEX prompted the winner to the
stretch then proved no match in the final eighth. SKILLFUL stalked the pacesetters inside then faded through the stretch. JUST NOD AND SMILE saved
ground off the pace and lacked a solid rally. MISSISSIPPI dropped well behind, angled inside through the stretch and was no factor. SCOTCH ROCK'S
chased wide, made a brief bid on the final turn and flattened out. PARADISE PRIDE raced within striking range outside then faded after half a mile. STRUM
AND PLUCK dropped back early and weakened steadily. SPEEDY ZEPHYR raced far behind throughout.
