Footnotes
TWO EAGLES RIVER stalked the clear leader from the inside, smoothly tipped outside of him turning for home, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage
at the three sixteenths, then shifted inwardly and across his inner counterpart part's path while clearing at the sixteenth pole. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS sped
clear early on, met TWO EAGLES RIVER's bid entering the lane, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, fought on through midstretch, but checked while
giving way as his outer counterpart cleared and crossed over at the sixteenth pole. OLAZABAL chased three to two wide as the leader's closest pursuer into
the turn, got floated three wide again turning for home while getting outkicked by an inner bidding foe for place, then failed to keep pace with the top pair in
upper stretch, and remained clear of the rest. J J'S JOKER broke slowly while hopping a bit at the start, saved ground far back, shifted four wide and
between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. MIDNIGHT PRANKS broke forwardly and chased the clear leader two wide and from between
horses early on, but failed to sustain that position after a furlong, dropped back to midpack nearing the turn, chased three wide around the bend, then drifted
out in upper stretch while tiring. TOP D'ORO lacked speed despite rider's urging, took the turn four wide and between horses, and failed to factor while
moving up late. TALLADEGA was void of early speed behind rivals, settled far back two wide, relegated to trail entering the lane, then moved up between
horses. FUNNY UNCLE laid off of the pace five wide, and tired. BIG HAT WILLIE broke slowly, trailed three wide, and made little impact. GABE hopped
slightly and brushed the inner part of the gate while off slowly, then saved ground in midpack, but tired. ISLAND SWAGGER chased from midpack two wide
and between horses under steady urging, and weakened.

Footnotes
PARODY stalked three wide, bid entering the lane along with an inner HIGH CLASS, then sparred with that foe through midstretch, flopped back to his left
lead while forging an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead late. HIGH CLASS got brushed by an inner rival at the start, pressed the
leader into the turn, bid entering the lane as an outer PARODY did the same, wrestled a lead at the three sixteenths pole, then dueled gamely with his outer
bidding counterpart through midstretch, but was headed a sixteenth from home, and held place. BRU NA BOINNE chased along the inside, pursued from
the three path in upper stretch, then belatedly closed in on the top pair in the final sixteenth. SURE CAN stalked four wide, but subtly failed to keep pace
with the leaders in upper stretch, and kept on. MIDSUMMER SOIREE set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids entering the lane, got headed at the
three sixteenths pole, and weakened coming to the furlong grounds. INVENTING ANNA tracked from midpack three wide, tipped five wide entering the lane,
but lacked a rally. SHARP TAP bobbled slightly at the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, and moved up between horses. LADY OCEAN broke out
and brushed a foe, lacked speed despite heavy urging, laid off of the pace four wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but lugged in severely in
midstretch. AMERICAN FAIRYTALE tracked two wide and between horses, bumped an inner foe entering the turn, and faded. DOUGHTY tracked along the
inside, but was bumped and jostled along the rail by an outer rival entering the turn, and faded turning for home. FAIRY HAIR broke a step slowly, raced far
back in the three to six path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TINY TEMPER broke slowly before being bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, tipped to
the four path into the far turn, took aim outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage approaching the final furlong,
and edged clear. TOWHEAD set a pressured pace in the two path, met a pair of bids turning for home, got headed approaching the furlong grounds, then
held place. MO SHIRO trailed in the four to two path around the first turn, gained three wide and between horses around the far turn before tipping to the
five path in upper stretch, grinded away outside of the leading quartet through the final furlong, reached show in the late stages, and ran out of ground to
reach place. ALPHA BELLA stalked three wide while in the four path, moved forward to press entering the far turn, sustained position outside of the pace
setter while tucking to the three path, bid entering the lane along with an outer looming TINY TEMPER, vied through upper stretch, but yielded approaching
the furlong grounds. ROSES AND ROZAY stalked along the inside, awaited racing room from the pocket around the far turn, but only managed to chase
through the lane. METAPHYSICAL broke out while off slowly, raced far back while remaining in the six path around the first turn, steadily gained outside of
rivals down the backstretch to lay with striking distance in the five path into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. THE ALYS LOOK shifted off of the
inside early on, stalked in the three path and between a pair of rivals while in the bit behind the pace-setters, tucked to the two path nearing the far turn, but
failed to sustain position while being shuffled back behind a stopping foe around the far turn, then altered course outwardly entering the lane, and failed to
factor. NOMADIC PRIDE tracked in midpack three to four wide, and gave way. SUN VALLEY ROAD broke inwardly and bumped a rival while off a step
slowly, then never got involved three wide. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE hopped at the start and spotted the leaders multiple lengths, then tracked along the
inside, but faded at the three furlong pole. MENDED WE STAND vied two wide and in the three path, but wilted between horses with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
RED CARPET READY bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way as an outer rival pressed turning for home, yet
swiftly disposed of that one entering the lane, widened under moderate urging, and was geared down through the final sixteenth. PATTY VAN TWINKLE
tracked in midpack three wide, then stayed on, and reached place between horses at the sixteenth pole. LEMON BOMB chased along the inside, claimed
show turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole along with an inner rival, but was outkicked. BO DEREK
bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, weakened, and lost place
entering the final sixteenth. OKAY FINE took a hard bump from an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the four path and between horses around the turn,
shifted five wide entering the lane, and moved up. BOARDWALK QUEEN bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced far back along the inside, shifted
four wide and between horses entering the lane, and stayed on. TOUGH LEGACY broke slowly while getting floated out at the start, laid off of the pace four
wide, gained mildly around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch without menacing. MARKET PROFILE laid off of the pace in the three path and
between horses, and failed to factor. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE broke in and squarely bumped a rival at the start, tracked two wide, but faded under urging
along the inside turning for home. PETERPAM bumped with an inner rival at the start, took up slightly from crowded quarters among foes at the five furlong
pole, then laid off of the pace along the inside, and made little impact. FIRST HILL took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, emerged from the group
to stalk the leading pair three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane. TESHIMA raced at the rear in the five path,
and was outrun.

on. MAGNIFICENT MILE was wrangled back early on, tracked along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. ACCIDENT bumped an
inner foe before being severely pinched and steadying hard in the opening stages, tucked from the four path to the two path while far back around the first

Footnotes
HOOSIER PHILLY broke half a beat slowly, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair and to the five path entering the far turn, ranged up to
those rivals while well in hand entering the lane, assumed command under her own power in upper stretch, then splashed away while playfully changing her
leads through the final furlong. T MAX stalked two wide, pressed the leader from the four path around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in
upper stretch, chased PEACOCK LASS for place into midstretch, shifted inside of that drifting foe at the furlong grounds, stayed on to re-bid for place at the
sixteenth pole along with an inner rival, and prevailed. FUN AND FEISTY tracked along the inside, shifted outwardly in upper stretch before deciding to dive
back inwardly at the furlong grounds, stayed on to bid for place along with an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, but was bested for that position.
PEACOCK LASS set the pace, showed the way from a pressing foe while in the three path around the far turn, repelled her as an outer HOOSIER PHILLY
menaced in upper stretch, proved no match for that one soon after, drifted out while maintaining place in midstretch, but yielded through the final furlong.
STELLAR LADY lagged behind along the inside down the backstretch, and improved along the rail in upper stretch. EAST SHORE was allowed to settle off
of the pace in the three path, and never got involved. DRE ME LESS tracked three wide, but weakened entering the far turn.

Footnotes
JOKING WAY cleared early on, set an uncontested pace in the two path around the turn, widened under light urging through midstretch, and was geared
down through the final sixteenth. BRAZEN BOY was off a step slowly while breaking a bit inwardly to open space, improved to track along the inside, gained
place with three furlongs to go, pursued the clear leader from the three path turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and managed place
thereafter. BACKSIDE BUZZ stalked three wide and from the five path around the turn, then battled for show through the lane, and prevailed.
DREAMWITHINADREAM stalked two wide, but yielded while getting floated to the four path around the turn, sustained stride to continue to vie for show
with an outer rival through the lane, but was bested. GORDY'S LABEL spotted the field many lengths after breaking very slowly, lagged behind, shifted four
wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on. GLOBAL PRIDE laid off of the pace three wide, shifted out to the five path at
the five sixteenths pole, and failed to menace. WINNEMAC AVENUE hopped while off slow, lacked speed two wide and between horses, and made little
impact. BEAU DAY took up without incident at the start, raced far back in the three to five path, and failed to factor. CREPE YARNS raced far back and
never got involved. RIDGEPOINT ROAD tracked four wide, but faded three wide and between horses around the turn. MOON OVER DUBAI saved ground
off of the pace, but faded.

PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS tracked four wide, vied with three furlongs to go, led in upper stretch, then inched clear entering the final sixteenth before flopping
back to her left lead and lugging in through the closing stages. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL cleared off approaching the five furlong pole, met a trio of bids at the
three furlong marker, got soon after, yet fought on through the lane, and reclaimed place in the final sixteenth while chasing the leader home. PROMISE OF
HOPE stalked along the inside while just off of the rail moved forward to press two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole as outer foes
produced bids, vied among rivals entering the lane and through upper stretch, but yielded to the leader and an inner rival entering the final sixteenth.
CHIQUITA MOSCA trailed in the four path around the turn, and improved inside of rivals at the sixteenth pole. JOKES ON BLUE laid off of the pace in the
three path, shifted outside of the leading quartet in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. PIONEER PARADE stalked in the five path, bid for the lead three wide
and between horses at the three furlong pole, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides in upper stretch, and gave way while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
TWO PHIL'S jostled with an outer rival entering the first turn, tucked to achieve an inside tracking position around that bend, gradually shifted outside of the
leading trio down the backstretch, ranged up well in hand to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command entering the lane, drew off,
greenly flopped back to his left lead and lugged in at the furlong grounds, but kept on well once back on task. HAYES STRIKE was moving about when the
gates opened, came out a step slow and bumped an inner rival, raced at the rear three wide around the first turn, steadily gained between horses down the
backstretch, tucked to track along the inside into the far turn, failed to match bidding strides with an outer rival turning for home, tipped two wide entering the
lane to bid for place as the leader kicked away, then gained place at the furlong grounds. FLIPARINO stumbled severely at the start and was lucky to
maintain his rider, settled off of the pace along the inside, crept closer between horses in the three to four paths around the far turn, tipped to the five path
entering the lane, and stayed on to claim show nearing the wire. TOP RECRUIT set the pace in the two path, clung to an advantage from a pair of vying
rivals down the backstretch, shook clear of them at the three furlong pole, but offered little resistance to TWO PHIL'S bid approaching the lane, gave way,
and lost show late. RED ROUTE ONE jostled with an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack two wide and between horse, got outmoved by an outer foe
into the far turn while under coaxing, and sustained his chase through the lane. HONED was bumped and pinched between horses at the start, rated at the
rear in the two path, then failed to gain in the six path around the far turn, and failed to factor. FROSTED DEPARTURE broke out and bumped a foe at the
start, stalked in the five path around the first turn, pulled to vie outside of the top pair entering the backstretch, but weakened entering the far turn. JACE'S
ROAD dropped his rider when the loading commenced, jogged a furlong up the stretch while trying to get away from the out-rider, then was remounted and
loaded without further incident, stalked three wide and between horses while in the four path around the first turn, but failed to sustain that position entering
the backstretch, retreated to midpack soon after, then faded in the five path around the far turn. BOPPY O pressed two wide and between horses, vied
down the backstretch, but weakened at the three furlong pole. WESTERN GHENT raced off of the pace in the five path, and was outrun.

DENINGTON tracked three to four wide, loomed a danger in pursuit of the new leader nearing the lane, bid in upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole,
and drove clear in the final sixteenth. CREATE TROUBLE stalked two to three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, but was outkicked
by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best. PARKWAY laid off of the pace along the inside, chased from behind rivals in the three
path around the far turn, then stayed on between horses in upper stretch, and surpassed outer rivals for show at the sixteenth pole. HUNTER'S DRIVE
broke a beat slow, tracked two wide and between horses, tipped four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. DESERT WOLF stalked along the inside,
slipped through to attempt a bid entering the lane, but faltered and drifted out in upper stretch. TAPIT SHOES was slow into stride, trailed, moved forward in
the three path around the far turn before encountering traffic entering the lane, and improved. COAL BOSS raced far back in the three path, lagged behind
around the far turn before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and moved up. MO SATURDAYS laid off of the pace in the three to five paths, gained six
wide turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened. FIGHT'N READY raced far back in the two path and never got involved. MACHO
VILLA dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened entering the lane. SIR ROCK dueled for the lead along the inside, but wilted turning for home, and
stopped.
