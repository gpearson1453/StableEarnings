Footnotes
KEY TO SUCCESS stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair nearing the far turn, ranged up to bid outside of TESTRAL with a quarter mile to
go, led entering the lane, but failed to kick clear while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds before meeting his inner
counterpart's rebid, sparred to the wire, and lasted desperately via a narrow photo. THESTRAL pressed two wide, gained an advantage around the far turn
before before meeting KEY TO SUCCESS's turning for home, got headed by that foe entering the lane, but fought on as that foe hung, rebid in the final
furlong while sustaining a duel, but just missed while being driven through the wire. GOODBETTERBEST set the pace inside of a pressing foe while tugging
in the bit, got headed at the five sixteenths pole by that rival, and weakened. FREE SPIRITED laid off of the pace along the inside, pulled two wide
approaching the backstretch, checked when running up on rivals heels at the three quarter pole, then settled, and improved position inside of foes entering
the far turn. UNDER THE BED trailed three wide, improved to a tracking position down the backstretch, but was done entering the far turn. SHE HAS THE
LOOK stalked three wide, but weakened into the far turn. UNESCORTED lacked speed two to three wide, and was done early before being outrun around
the far turn.

Footnotes
KEEPCALMCARRYON was squeezed back between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, gained turning for home, tipped outside of the embattled
leading pair while brushing an outer rival in upper stretch, sustained his run to bid between horses at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. GARMENTO
pressed three wide, chased the inner leading pair around the far turn while gradually failing to keep pace, yet sustained stride while getting brushed four
wide by an inner rallying rival, got outkicked by that foe leaving midstretch, and kept on to reach place. MR CREED prompted the pace two wide and
between horses, sparred with his inner counterpart around the far turn, gained an advantage turning for home, led through midstretch, but was confronted
by a pair of outer foes in the final furlong, got outkicked at the sixteenth pole, then was outfinished for place. OFFICIAL BUSINESS bumped an outer rival at
the start, set the pace inside of a pair of pressured, dueled with only his most immediate counterpart around the far turn, but was headed turning for home,
and gave way in the final furlong. BLUE NORTHER made contact with rivals on both sides at the start, stalked behind the leader from the two path, pulled
under firm restraint around the first turn and entering the backstretch, shifted outside of the leading trio with nine sixteenths to go, but came under urging
nearing the far turn to keep pace, and came up empty. MR. CUNNINGHAM bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, got floated five wide
down the backstretch, and faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
FREEZE POP managed a loose lead in the two path around the first turn, remained in hand while feeling moderate pressure from a single outer foe around
the far turn, kicked away from that foe when set down in upper stretch, and drew off. BRIGHT SPARK was slow into stride after leaning inwardly at the start,
trailed along the inside, improved inside of foes into the far turn, left the fence to split rivals at the five sixteenths pole before swinging four wide entering the
lane, rallied while hanging on his left lead to claim place at the furlong grounds, then drifted outwardly severely leaving that juncture, lugged back in after
behind corrected entering the final sixteenth, and failed to threaten the leader. MAASAI WARRIOR tracked in the two path while under a snug hold around
the first turn, tugged between horses at the five furlong marker, then tucked to the rail while clearing an inner foe entering the far turn, chased the leaders
turning for home, then stayed on while one paced along the rail to reach show leaving the sixteenth pole. AWAY FROM HOME stalked two wide while in the
three path, applied pressure around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and yielded. MINT lost his hind footing at the start,
tracked three wide, chased the leading pair around the far turn, then was outkicked for minors in midstretch and lacked a bid. VALE was bleeding from the
mouth moving to post, took a bump from an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace four wide, then in the three path around the far turn, and failed to
factor. RA'S AL GHUL broke a beat slowly and bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked from the three path and between horses, but faded approaching
the far turn. GRAND JURY stalked along the inside while under a firm hold around the first turn, then steadied into the far turn when an outer foe crossed
over, and was eased around that bend.

Footnotes
SPEED BIAS settled off of the pace, swiftly gained four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL turning for home,
mildly brushed that foe while sparring in upper stretch, shifted off and created separation with his inner counterpart while forging an advantage entering the
final sixteenth, then took a bump from that foe soon after, and prevailed while exchanging contact with that foe again at the wire. UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL
got floated to the six path while prominent into the first turn, tucked to the three path around that bend before pressing the leader from the outside down the
backstretch, gained an advantage with five sixteenths to go, dug in to resist SPEED BIAS's bid turning for home, battled gamely while being brushed by that
foe in upper stretch, clung to advantage while hanging on his left lead before headed entering the final sixteenth, came out and bumped his outer
counterpart leaving that marker, then failed to regain even terms while making contact again at the wire. LUPO'S LEGACY got floated to the five path
entering the first turn while outside of the pace setter, altered course inside of that foe around that bend before settling into an inside stalking position
entering the backstretch, got outmoved by an outer bidder around the far turn before aiming to split foes turning for home, but steadied in tight quarters
between those rivals leaving the quarter pole, recovered and shifted ground outwardly entering the lane, and improved. REDEMPTION TIME tracked along
the inside before tipping two wide nearing the backstretch chased outside of the top pair around the far turn, but was outkicked for minor rewards turning for
home, and tired. WAR ROOM bobbled at the start while subtly last away, moved forward to set the pace inside of foes, but bore out to the four path entering
the first turn, corrected and tucked to the rail entering the backstretch, showed the way before being headed by his pressing counterpart with five sixteenths
to go, and weakened turning for home. RAMPATIOUS was outrun. THE RIDER OF UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
SPEED BIAS FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
KAUFYMAKER was tough to load, briefly detached his rider after mildly rearing in the gate before the start, then broke well and set the pace inside of a
pressing pair of foes, shook clear when let out in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead while feeling a right handed crop entering the final furlong, and
held sway safely thereafter after the rider put his stick away. SUTHERLAND saved ground in midpack, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch, chased to
bid for place inside of a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed. MUMAYAZ tracked two wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the
lane, grinded away while chasing the clearing leader to bid for place a sixteenth from home, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that position. APACHE
TEARS pressed two wide and between horses, failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased while managing place through midstretch, but
was bested for that position by rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth. STRIDE laid off of the pace in the two to four paths around the turn, swung to the
seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. WILLTORUN broke a beat slowly, tracked four wide, inched closer turning for home, but yielded while being
floated five wide entering the lane. BADGEBALL checked slightly among rivals after the opening sixteenth of a mile, tracked in midpack two wide, came into
the lane in the five path, then failed to menace between horses in the final furlong. YOU VEE CEE stalked along the inside, shifted off of the fence in upper
stretch, but faded. SWITZER lacked speed in the three to five path around the turn, floated to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact.
OXWOOD broke a step slowly while keen at the start, and was outrun. RUM 'N TONIC chased three wide, but weakened four wide and between horses
entering the lane, and faltered while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
JULIA SHINING failed to respond to strong urging while climbing from kickback behind rivals in the early stages, faltered leaving the chute before shifting
ground outside of foes at the three quarter pole, picked up stride under urging approaching the turn, rallied four wide and outside of rivals around the turn,
produced a bid while drifting five wide entering the lane under a full head of steam, swept past the leading pair in upper stretch, shifted in while driving clear
at the furlong grounds, and held sway safely from an outer chasing foe. POSITANO SUNSET tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped four wide while
getting outmoved by an outer JULIA SHINING turning for home, yet rallied outside of foes thereafter, claimed place while taking aim on that clear foe
entering the final sixteenth, yet failed to progress through the late stages while mildly shifting in. ROMAN GODDESS vied for the lead two wide, but was
outkicked in upper stretch, lost place while hanging on his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over her inner counterpart for show.
THEROANRUNNER set the pace inside of a vying rival, got outkicked by another bidding foe in upper stretch, sparred with his outer counterpart for show in
the final sixteenth, but lost that battle. GHOSTLY GIRL stalked two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by outer rivals turning for home, and kept
on mildly. ACRIMONY stalked along the inside, but faded. WITH THIS RING stalked three wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. TWO
MINUTE LICK broke slowly while being bumped by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. MO DIVINE broke slowly,
lacked speed two wide, and made little impact. PENNY ARCADE lagged behind the field early on, and passed tired rivals. VOGELSANG never got involved.
MORAL TURPITUDE laid off of the pace three wide, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
CARAVEL stalked three wide, loomed a danger turning for home, produced a bid outside of TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) entering the final furlong, gained
an advantage leaving that marker, and kicked clear entering the final sixteenth. THUNDERING CREED bobbled a bit at the start, laid at the rear along the
inside, came into the lane just off of the fence, split foes two wide at the furlong grounds, shifted out while sustaining a charge entering the final sixteenth,
and rallied to reach place at the wire. STAR DEVINE (IRE) broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path entering the lane, grinded
away while tipping three wide in midstretch, reached place while not threatening the leader inside the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire for that
position. TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) vied two wide, led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, and faltered in the
final sixteenth. HAVE A GOOD DAY (IRE) broke a beat slow, saved ground in midpack, chased before shifting out in the final furlong, and moved up late.
CREATIVE CREDIT vied along the inside, but yielded in midstretch. BROOKE MARIE laid off of the pace four wide, floated five wide entering the lane, but
lacked the needed punch. TOBYS HEART tracked two wide and between horses, but failed to progress in the four path through midstretch, and yielded.
QUEROBIN DOURADA tracked three to four wide, but faded. BOUT TIME laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and faded. ELLE Z got
hung five wide while off of the pace, and tired.

Footnotes
RUN CLASSIC stalked three wide, loomed large while bidding well in hand turning for home, gained an advantage in the four path entering the lane, swiftly
responded when set down in upper stretch, spurted away under hand urging in upper stretch, and continued to widen when put to wraps entering the final
sixteenth. SPANKSTER pressed two wide and from between horses, vied around the turn, but proved no match for his outer bidding counterpart entering
the lane, gave way while left in that foe's dust in upper stretch, yet saved place late. NO SHIRT NO SHOES laid off of the pace three wide, then stayed on
through the lane, attempted a bid inside of SPANKSTER for place in the closing stages, but missed. BRIEFCASE BULLY raced at the rear along the inside
despite steady urging, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and moved up. A C EXPRESSWAY rated at the rear four wide, shifted to the six path
entering the lane, and failed to menace. UBER KIRK laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, but lacked a rally. GAGETOWN tracked four wide,
but yielded in the five path entering the lane, and gave way on his left lead. RISING EMPIRE tracked along the inside, but faded. HIDDEN SCROLL set the
pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of foes turning for home, and caved in the two path through the lane.

Footnotes
JUNIPERMARSHMALLOW acted up mildly in the gates, required a veterinarian examination before being cleared and re-loaded, tracked from midpack
along the inside, swung six wide and outside of the leaders entering the lane, rallied to bid leaving the furlong grounds, drove clear a sixteenth later, and
held late. BOTANICAL broke a step slowly and settled far back in the two path, swung six wide entering the lane before being floated seven wide in upper
stretch by the eventual winner, chased that foe with a grinding charge while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over inside the final furlong,
quickened and surged in hopes of producing a late bid, but came up short. MISS PEABODY hopped and bumped the inner part of the gate while breaking
slow, rated far back in the three path, shifted to the six path passing the three sixteenths pole to be inside of BOTANICAL, then stayed on along with that foe
through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, and got outkicked for place by that rival late. STAY LOST tracked two wide and between horses,
inched closer four wide and among foes turning for home to bid in upper stretch, vied through midstretch, but yielded to outer rivals in the final sixteenth.
MRS. ASTOR broke forwardly, but steadied from between horses in the early stages, recovered to track in midpack three wide and among foes, wrestled
four wide entering the backstretch while pulling to a stalking position with five furlongs to go, gained again five wide and outside of foes around the far turn to
bid in upper stretch, vied into the final furlong, but flattened out while getting outkicked. WORDS OF PRAISE vied two wide, but was outkicked by outer
bidders in upper stretch, and yielded at the furlong grounds. BEST PERFORMER stalked along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home, failed to
progress while shifting out in midstretch, then steadied when stymied behind traffic through the final sixteenth. AUDACIOUSNESS stalked two to three wide,
bid in upper stretch, but faltered among foes at the furlong grounds. MO NEDA shied from an inner foe early on, laid off of the pace in the three path, then
yielded while floating to the seven path entering the lane. PIGEON CAY trailed along the inside, and failed to factor. PSYCHEDELIC vied along the inside,
got headed down the backstretch before regaining an advantage into the far turn, then weakened in upper stretch. DOT MARIE broke a beat slowly before
shying from an inner rival early on, raced in midpack four to five wide, advanced to stalk down the backstretch, but faded in the six path around the far turn.
