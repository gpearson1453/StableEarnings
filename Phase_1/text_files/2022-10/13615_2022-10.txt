Footnotes
SOUPSTER stalked the leader in perfect rhythm into the turn, raced outside rival through the turn, quickened easily through the stretch, clear late under a
steady drive. LAMBEAU LADY nice early speed, took control of the tempo into the turn, came under outside pressure leaving the quarter pole, held on in
deep stretch to secure the place money. SCAMPER ALONG raced off the early pace, always between runners around the turn, raced inside and between
runners through the stretch, moved up willingly late. NOTION INTERRUPTUS slow to start, raced off the pace in the three path entering the turn, moved
inside for clear run around the turn, finished even late. MIZZEN slow into stride, raced along the inside around the turn, asked leaving the quarter pole, no
late bid. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY bumped, and veered way outside at the start, slowly recovered from the outside, raced seven wide through the lane, no
gain late. TAK E LADY broke last, never a threat.

Footnotes
PALLOTTA SISTERS set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane, dug in gamely, turned
back a bid from MO BILLS, edged away and then held off the runner up for the win. TALL GIRL raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced inside
entering the far turn, waited briefly for room at the five sixteenths marker, angled off the rail, swung wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run
and finished well. MO BILLS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of the winner in
upper stretch, stayed on well and lost second late. KAKE'S TAP DANCER was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced
inside on the far turn, moved up between rivals in upper stretch, then rallied mildly inside. WATER FIGHT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
inside, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. STRUT tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and failed to rally. VAGABOND PRAYER
stalked between rivals, chased two wide on the far turn and had no rally. QUANTUM LIGHT was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, settled two
wide off the pace and failed to threaten. ONE OF THE ONES raced off the pace inside, between rivals on the far turn and failed to threaten. BELLA
PALOMA raced three wide early, stalked three wide and faded. MISS KRISTY raced off the pace inside, then two wide and did not factor.
