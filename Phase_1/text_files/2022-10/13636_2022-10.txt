BRADITUDE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up late. RAINAS ROLLIN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the final sixteenth, then was outfinished and
held the place. GOLDBAR broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. SLENDER BETSY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened.
CHANGE THE HOUR steadily lost ground. TIDDLY WINK allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain.

HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO tracked the pace, raced boxed through the turn, waited, angled three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew off
under steady pressure. FAST MULE allowed to settle, gained position four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, evened and held the place.
E Z TOLL well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then weakened
late and held the show. YOU LOOKING AT ME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the
final furlong. WINE WITH A ROSE never far back, saved ground on the two path exchanging bumps with ESTABLISHMENT, then ran evenly in the lane.

RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
WATERLOO SUNSET well placed and between, rated back and angled in into the turn, angled back out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could
not threaten that one and held the place safe. GRAND MAMOO unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, made a steady gain and
missed the place. SONG OF INDY tracked the pace, angled out and held position on the two path through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
flattened out. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE passed a tiring rival. LAWN DART well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded four
wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
CHIC N WILBUR sprinted to a clear lead pulling, turned back a bid into the stretch, then shook clear late and held. MR. MAGICO tracked the pace bearing
out early, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. K. K. ICHIKAWA mid pack,
moved up inside through the second turn, angled out three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. INCLUSIVE mid pack,
looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the show. GREAT stalked the
pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch and weakened late.
GOLD WING allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the lane and improved his position.
NAMARUNU (GER) allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. THIRSTY
ACTOR well placed and off the rail, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. LEBASI
unhurried, looped two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. RED CAT (CHI) mid pack, gained position
four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. PLEASE SIT DOWN was a brief factor.
