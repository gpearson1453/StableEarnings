ONLY BELIEVE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up in time. VERMONT HOLIDAY set
the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. MISS SCHILLER was in touch, roused on the turn
and from the three path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. DAISY DANGLES was in range but chased on the turn and from the four path at
the top of the stretch was not a factor. SUNDAY VISIT settled off the pace, showed little and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat.
MISS LEGS broke awkwardly, trailed on the turn and was outrun.

factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. READY AT DAWN tracked the leaders and was roused on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. ARTIE MY BOY was in touch and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. PEPPERONI was in range but
chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
MONASTERY LANE was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. MUSICAL RIDE stalked the
leader and had the lead on the far turn but failed to hold. BABY LUNA was in touch and had a good position on the far turn but from the five path at the top
of the stretch needed more. PACENZA was in range and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. NEW YORK
COMMANDER was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. PRINCESS MORO was
well back, showed little in a dull effort. WHATSWRONGWITHYOU set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA showed speed from the outside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. TRAJEC
HOLIDAY was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. BEA MAJESTIC G G showed no speed
and had a mild gain on the turn but finished evenly. SUPER FOLLOW was hustled early, bothered by a loose horse on the turn and from the three path at
the top of the stretch needed more. DEFOGGER was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. EL BANDOLERO was in range but
chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. OLA BRO stumbled at the start and lost his rider. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
