KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO dueled for the early lead three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then widened in the lane under a hand
ride. SECRET ADDICTION was away alertly and crossed over to the inside, then was well placed behind the duel at the half mile marker, then advanced
two wide on the turn and moved back to the inside leaving the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. SPEAK OF THE
DEVIL dueled for the lead on the inside and then fell back on the turn, then folded in the lane and lasted for the show award. EASTON E was reserved
early, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. ROUND ROBIN chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

SWITCHRATTLENROLL wads well placed throughout on the inside, made a inside bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the three sixteenths, then
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS was rated along four wide, then was three wide on the far turn, came
four wide into the lane and made a bid but needed more late. WHATRUWAITINGFOR set a pressured pace while in the two path, then was headed nearing
the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. ARCTICA was four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide and tired. RIDGELYSREDHOT lacked a
rally.

TRUE SUCCESS was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased off the inside on the far turn, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then closed on the
outside and wore down the front runner late to get up, driving. LOUIE'S LAW chased the pace three wide, then was between rivals three wide by the quarter
pole, then rallied in the drive between rivals but was outfinished by the winner late. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY set the pace while clear and racing in the two
path, remained clear leaving the turn and was put to a long drive, but gave way grudgingly late to just miss. UNCLE YUDI was off a step slow, then settled
four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and then offered a late rally. GALLINIPPER chased the pace along the inside and lacked the
needed bid.

stalked the winner three wide and proved to be no match for that rival late while being clearly second best. SHADOW BOAT was reserved early, came six
wide into the lane and had a belated rally to gain the show award. CRYPT lacked a rally. DEFIBRILLATOR was settled early and tired.
