Footnotes
WAR FIGHTER was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, was given two pops of a left-handed crop between that point and the sixteenth-pole then was placed
under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. CAPTAIN QUICK settled towards the rear, saved ground while roused on the turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path then moved out around the three-sixteenths and got up for the place while no match for the winner. CLEAT was forwardly placed on the
outside, came under urging in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened then lost the place but earned the show. CHUCKA MOON
settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR bumped with a
rival at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, was put to a drive into upper stretch and came up empty.

the stretch and was no factor. CAPLETON was rated just off the pace, saved ground while given his cue on the turn and capitulated. CLASH A. J. settled on

Footnotes
FREEDOM TRAIL went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved while unhurried towards the rear, traveled around most of the far turn in the three
path, shifted five wide while asked inside the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up
in the final sixteenth. DANDY HANDYMAN went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the
stretch, drifted out under pressure from that point into the final furlong, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to preserve the
place. NOBLE HUNTSMAN rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, chased three
wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch, came out slightly while shadowed out by foes in front inside the three-sixteenths, kept on well to
the wire and finished willingly to just get the show. LET'S GO BIG BLUE was taken in hand early, went three wide around the opening bend, settled
comfortably down the backstretch, raced four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, steadied behind a foe inside the three-sixteenths, dropped
in in pursuit of the vanguard into the final furlong and also finished willingly. SENDERO settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, gained in pursuit of the leader but lacked a winning kick. CONMAN stumbled at the start, saved ground at the rear, was roused on the
far turn and lacked the needed response. EL DE CHIMI established a forward position early, rounded the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace on the
outside, was urged along in the two path on the final turn then carried four wide into the stretch, moved out some in pursuit of the drifting leader inside the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NOBLE HUNTSMAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THIRD AND PLACED FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH

GOGO SHOES was urged along on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the
three-sixteenths, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MRS. GREEN was well placed just off the pace on the
inside, shifted to the three path while asked at the quarter-pole, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, dueled with the winner to the wire and was denied while
clear for the place. MISCHIEVOUS DREAM was last to commence, settled at the rear, saved ground around most of the turn, angled four wide late on that
bend, moved out in upper stretch and improved for the show. STRONG ODOR came away in good order, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the
two path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. STOP WAR showed speed from the outside
post, moved in while going to the front, vied inside on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave
way. SECRET TIME (GER) brushed with a foe shortly after the start, settled off the pace, was asked while two to three wide on the turn and lacked the
needed response. MADEMOISELLE NOVA was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, saved ground while let out on the turn, was roused for more at
the five-sixteenths and came up empty.

Footnotes
INFLATION ADJUSTED was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, chased along the rail into the final furlong,
made an inside bid at the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling to prevail. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) was taken back between horses nearing the first
turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path while let out on the far turn, was roused four wide into the
stretch, rallied outside to make a bid at the sixteenth-pole but just missed while able to get the place. ROYAL SPIRIT prompted the pace on the outside in
the three path, came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled with RELATE into the final sixteenth and missed while just able to get the place. RELATE was
hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled with ROYAL SPIRIT into the final sixteenth and also
missed while holding the last spot in the superfecta. SIX MINUS was rated off the pace, came under urging near the half-mile pole, went two then three wide
between foes on the turn, chased in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. FATIMA'S BLESSING brushed with a rival at the start, went
three to four wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. SONIC SPEED broke out and brushed with a foe, went around the first
turn in the two path, settled near the back, went three then four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SHINSUN
broke a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, raced three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no
factor. SELL SOMETHING traveled around the first turn in near the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, angled out in
upper stretch, moved in inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR brushed with a rival at the start, settled off
the pace, saved ground through the far turn and failed to respond. FRENCHBORO brushed with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, raced three wide early on the far turn, shifted five wide near the five-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. CAGNEY was
restless in the gate, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn and capitulated.
