Footnotes
FATHER O'FLAHERTY rated well off the pace, took closer order in the far turn, roused four wide into the lane, battled through the lane inside of EL NOBLE,
and inched up for the win. EL NOBLE trailed five to six wide, gained closer order, engaged in challenge from FATHER O'FLAHERTY, dueled through the
stretch and was out finished after a determined effort. QUINTO SOL chased the early pacesetters, fanned three wide to challenge the lead, rallied inside of
EXPLODE under urging, inched away then was edged out in the final yards. EXPLODE tracked outside in the four path, prompted action nearing the three
eighths marker, was headed into the lane but flattened late. THESHACK vied between foes leaving the chute, urged along leaving the backstretch, and
failed to threaten in the drive. SMART PLAY assumed the lead early, set the pace just off the rail, steadied nearing the quarter pole, then checked at the
three sixteenth pole and yielded.

IT'S A FACT raced three wide leaving the opening turn, sat just off the flank of CUBAN COBRA, was given cue after passing the quarter pole, drifted in
under right handed encouragement, and drew clear. CUBAN COBRA set the pace from just off the rail, was under pressure into the final turn, rallied inside
but was no match for the winner late. MUDINATOR away slow, settled in the five path, chased the leaders through the final turn, closed the gap in the
stretch and finished third best. MOHAMAD saved ground inside, and lacked a bid. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE trailed early, and lacked a serious bid. KISS ME
HELLO in tight in the first turn the was allowed to settle in the backstretch, chased three wide, and yielded from between foes.

Footnotes
MONOPOLIZE sat mid pack, shifted out leaving the backstretch while four to five wide, was set down at the head of the stretch, and won driving. BIG HUG
stalked the pacesetters in the far turn, swung four to five wide at the top of the lane, drifted in under right handed urging and was out finished. CATCH THE
DREAM moved up leaving the opening to contested the early pace, pressured BOOTIFUL ROSE in the final turn, kept on gamely inside and weakened in
the final sixteenth. BOOTIFUL ROSE saved ground while setting the pace in the two path, roused at the quarter pole, was in tight then checked from
between foes in the stretch drive and finished evenly. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN stalked the pace from the four path, moved up fanning three wide near the
three eighths pole prompting action, and came up empty for the drive. GOLDIE SOCKS was never far back, and lacked a bid. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of BOOTIFUL ROSE against the rider of BIG HUG alleging interference in the stretch run was upheld. BIG HUG was
disqualified and placed fourth for interference to BOOTIFUL ROSE.

Footnotes
GLAVA exchanged bumps with MARIA'SONG in the backstretch, drove four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside in the five path, and won driving.
BON PRIX angled in to the four path leaving the backstretch, challenge the lead after the quarter pole, matched strides outside of LINCHPIN STORM, was
out finished by GLAVA and won the nod for place. LINCHPIN STORM hustled away, responded to challenge from BON PRIX in the final turn, dueled under
heavy urging and was bested for place. HARD TO COME HOME hurried inside, dropped back nearing the quarter pole, launched an all out bid inside and
was out kicked. BACKSTREET BOBBY offered a late mild bid. SPOT ON DUDE chased outside into the lane, and yielded from fallen horse and rider.
MARIA'S SONG exchanged bumps in the backstretch, moved up into contending position, took a bad step, fell losing rider, did not finish and was vanned
off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch involving MARIA'S SONG but made no change after review.

MI REYNA saved ground while showing the way, responded to challenge from FLORAL near the three sixteenth pole, and held firm under a drive. FLORAL
stalked the pace in the four path, moved up menacingly alongside MI REYNA but was unable to get stall the winner. WHISKARITA raced four to five wide
into the opening turn, roused around the final turn, dueled through the stretch and inched clear for show. ADDYDIDIT saved ground along the rail, rallied
inside of WHISKARITA and was bested for placing. CONVINCE allowed to settle outside, chased the leaders, and lacked a closing response under heavy
encouragement. IT'S ALEXUS trailed and showed a mild interest in the later stages. SKY DESTINY failed to threaten. TAKE CHARGE GWEN sat mid pack
and tired early.

MR. ARTISTIC was quickest to the turn, drove clear down the lane, and was kept to the task. BARE BACK JACK tracked inside, made a bid, proved no
match for the winner, but got by COMMON KNOWLEDGE for second. COMMON KNOWLEDGE hurried outside, race three wide in the far turn, rallied four
wide into the stretch and was bested for second. IRISH TRICK hustled wide in the final turn, and improved through the stretch. PUMP THE BRAKES lodged
a late bid. YORKTOWN showed some early speed inside, and faded. FAST EH pressed the early pace while four wide, was unable to move on with the
eventual winner and gave way. FIRST PRINCE never reached contention.

Footnotes
AGENT C raced four wide leaving the backstretch, rallied steadily through the stretch and got up just in time. CARPIQUET sprinted to the front, drove clear,
responded to looming threat from WIZARDOFMENLOPARK, and was nipped in the final strides. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK rated off the pace while three
wide, loomed boldly at the head of the lane, but was unable to improve position and was bested for place. LENT ME FIFTY fractious in gate, settled five
wide then made a mild bid but was no factor. FULLOUT FIRE passed tiring rivals. CLEVER CONNECTION tracked inside in the early stages, and failed to
menace. JOKERS R WILD lacked early speed need, and was outrun. GRACE TOO saved ground and lacked a bid. FLASHING JOKER showed little.
REGIMENT was not a factor.

Footnotes
ORANGE THEORY rated off the pace inside, found clear running room inside at the head of the lane, gained a slim advantage and edged clear under a
strong hand ride. PLUM BLUE unhurried early, advanced quickly in the far turn, roused four to five wide, kept on gradually into the stretch getting by DANCE
SHOES and missed after a determined effort. DANCE SHOES settled in stride racing in the four path, moved up outside WE B THREE, SOLARITY and
ORANGE THEORY prompting action around the three eighths pole, was headed into the lane, and was out finished. MANGOTANGO raced at the back of
the pack, offered a late bid and improve contending position into the stretch. SOLARITY tracked three wide, commenced a bid near the five sixteenth
marker, and had nothing left in reserve for the stretch. TONE IT UP showed little interest. WE B THREE showed the way to the opening turn, was under a
snug hold through the backstretch, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and wilted.

Footnotes
AT ATTENTION attended the pace in the three path, battled for the lead amongst rivals through the far turn, gained a slim advantage nearing the final
furlong, went gamely under steady pressure from SOY TAPATIO throughout the drive and refused to relinquish control, holding firm. SOY TAPATIO stalked
outside in striking range, battled gamely outside of AT ATTENTION in the drive but lacked that needed late punch. GREEK GEEK raced three wide passed
by the front side, prompted the pace while five wide, roused off the final turn driving three wide, and weakened in the final furlong.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT tracked the pacesetters inside, launched an all out bid into lane and finished evenly. PARKING PERMIT saved ground inside in
the early stages, and improved late stretch. BOITANO attended the pace from the rail, was urged along inside in the final turn, and lacked the closing
response that was needed. VIATURE was never far back and faded. MY COLLEGE FUND sat mid pack but was not a factor. COUNTRIFIED trailed
throughout.
