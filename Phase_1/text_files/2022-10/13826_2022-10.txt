Footnotes
MELTDOWN vied for the lead two wide into the far turn, cleared nearing the five-sixteenths pole, widened into the lane then was kept to the task to hold.
RAMPAGE chased the duel into the turn while two wide, bid into the lane from the three path and could only chase the winner home. FOREVAMO was in
the four path through the turns and into the lane, bid after straightening, was a serious threat for the place spot with an eighth to go then could not sustain
the effort. HERE COMES DOC vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, lost contact with the dueling challenger near mid-turn, stayed on while near
the inside and weakened. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER saved ground through the turns, was in position with an eighth to go then lacked a closing kick.
JERRID trailed throughout while in the two or three path through the far turn. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON
FOR CHANGE OF FINISH POSITIONS.

out six wide at the quarter pole, rallied and missed. SURLEY vied between foes, bid at the quarter pole to be clear, lost the crop inside of the eighth pole
and was outfinished. LIZZSAIDNO raced in the four path, rallied late and missed. EMPIRE DANCER raced in the two path, then closed late. I MATTER
raced in the three path and rallied belatedly. ANNIE'S LEGACY pressed the pace in the three path and then gave way in the stretch. DREAMERS DREAM
was not a factor. WOO WOO GIRL vied inside before fading in the stretch.
