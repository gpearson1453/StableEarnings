Footnotes
STARQUIST broke in then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the
turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under the crop in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. BOURBON CHASE broke in and
brushed with a foe, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, gained under a drive to take the lead into upper stretch, shook
clear under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken late while clear for the place. DR. KRAFT was brushed by a foe at the start then
hustled, chased the pace on the inside of a rival, raced in the three path while still inside that foe on the turn, moved out while chasing the leader into the
final furlong and weakened while able to secure the show. CENTRAL LOVE was forced in at the start, moved up while coaxed along on the inside, steadied
despite nobody near him at the half-mile pole, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed response. STORM THE EMPIRE was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on
the turn, lost the lead under a drive into upper stretch, fought inside of the runner-up into the final furlong then tired. LT. MITCHELL veered in at the start,
settled at the rear, was urged three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NEST was hustled from the gate, saved ground around the first turn, moved out behind the leading duo onto the backstretch, tracked outside into the far
turn, issued a challenge in the four path around that bend, gained the lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear while spinning six wide into upper stretch,
moved in while drawing away under a hand-ride outside the furlong marker and widened under a very light hand-ride to win handily. FIRST TO ACT was
hustled from the start, moved from the two to three path early on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along in the three path while
between foes on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. HYBRID ECLIPSE dropped
from the three path to the rail early on the first turn, settled off the rail down the backstretch, was roused with a half-mile to run, went two then three wide
under strong encouragement around the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. TRAVEL COLUMN broke
awkwardly but with the field, went to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the opening bend, showed the way down the
backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the quarter-pole and tired. THE GRASS IS BLUE
stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to respond.

the finish to score. GASLIGHT DANCER coaxed from the start, pressed the pace of VACATION DANCE from the outside three then two wide, got set down
spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive staved off by the leader until seventy yards to the finish then got up for the place honors
in a blanket finish on the wire. VACATION DANCE came in at the start bumping INFLATION NATION and was coaxed from the gate, showed the way along
the inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside through swift splits every step of the way, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat stubbornly clinging to command fending off GASLIGHT DANCER narrowly until they were
overthrown as a tandem by the eventual winner, dug in to preserve the show honors over a pair on the line. INFLATION NATION (IRE) bumped at the start
by VACATION DANCE, who came inwards, tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
briefly before pausing spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, came under urging once more straightened away and was behind GASLIGHT DANCER,
angled out to be behind NAGIRROC a furlong out before tipping to clearance nearing the sixteenth marker, steadily made headway but was out-finished in
the final jumps. DUNEDIN coaxed from the gate, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to latch on the top one at the finish but was ran out of real estate at the end. DETERMINED JESTER four then three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. POWER ATTACK coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, tipped out four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SWEET MYSTERY contested the pace on the inside of a foe while off the rail, vied along the rail on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled
with the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three then
two path around the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner to the wire and missed while well clear for the place.
CARAMOCHA brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the turn, chased into the stretch and weakened while able to
get the show. MIA BEA STAR settled well back while on the far outside, was urged four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, bumped with a
rival while out of contention around the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. NEW YORK BANKER tracked the pace on the outside, went four then three wide
on the turn, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, bumped with a foe while out of
contention around the sixteenth-pole and had nothing left. GRINGOTTS was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn
then chased, moved out in upper stretch, shifted further out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and capitulated. MELISSA'S SMILE bobbled slightly at the
start then brushed with a foe, settled near the back, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
BUNTY WINDERMERE went to the front, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when asked for more in upper stretch,
shortened stride significantly while still clear into the final sixteenth and just lasted. CERRETTA broke a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, moved from
the rail to the three path around the turn, gained into the final furlong, moved out then came between foes around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good
energy to just get the place. LAUGHTER was urged along off the pace, dropped back and lost position in the two path around the turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and finished with late energy to just miss while narrowly up for the show. ROBYN AND ELI settled between horses, bumped with a foe
leaving the backstretch, steadied behind horses in the two path near the three-eighths, shifted four wide late on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, moved out near the furlong marker and finished with good energy to just miss the trifecta. ELI DANCER broke out then was hustled, chased the pace
on the outside then in the two path around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. TREAT STREET bumped with a foe at the
start, settled on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, moved out near the furlong marker and finished with late energy but missed the superfecta.
MO DAMORNINGGROUCH settled on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to impact. CRICKET
WEST was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. SEEMS TO
WHISPER settled on the inside, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. SHESADANCINGQUEEN bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the
pace, moved from three to five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TONIGHT WE LOVE settled off the pace, bumped
with a rival while along the rail leaving the backstretch, steadied behind horses near the three-eighths and came up empty. RENT CONTROL was forwardly
placed on the outside, went four wide while roused on the turn and capitulated.
