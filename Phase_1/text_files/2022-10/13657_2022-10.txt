Footnotes
FACTOTUM set the pace inside facing pressure by an outside rival, dispatched that one turning for home but was then mildly challenged by another in the
lane, held that one under steady handling. ANSELMO stalked two wide early, tipped out from three to four wide on the far turn, reached striking distance in
upper stretch, was held at bay but second best. MAYOR OF ESSA broke a step slowly, raced toward the rear off the inside, moved out to go four then five
wide on the far turn coming into upper stretch six deep, gained mildly. SOCIAL JUSTICE settled in the back half of the field two to three wide, angled seven
wide turning for home, gained mildly. ALL TIME CLASSIC tracked from inside, came out a path turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. NGABE
brushed a rival lightly at the start, pressed the winner three wide, weakened at the top of the stretch. ULTIMATE ANSWER was lightly brushed at the start,
shifted in early, saved ground on or just off the rail, failed to rally. SMART SOCIETY lacked early speed racing off the inside, moved back to the rail late on
the first turn, saved ground on the far turn, had no rally. VELOCITO was mid-pack two to three wide early and three to four wide on the far turn, dropped
back and tired.

Footnotes
FOREST MAIDEN tracked inside behind the dueling leaders through the turn, shifted just outside at the quarter pole to begin to reel in the frontrunners, took
command at the three sixteenths marker and drew off when asked at the eighth pole. CELTIC REVIVAL battled outside for the lead through the turn, put
away her speed rival at the quarter pole to lead momentarily, was headed by the winner at the top of the stretch and finished up gamely to the line to be a
clear second. SAKE AND SUSHI broke sharp to engage for the lead inside down the backside, battle on the turn for supremacy, gave way two furlongs
remaining and had enough to hold for third in a strung out field. TAMANA tracked outside in the second flight into the turn, began to bear out with three
furlongs to go, continued to get out through the turn to be in the ten path for the drive and showed interest to the wire to get a minor placing. MUCHO
MISSTIQUE was asked while in mid pack all alone at the half, saved ground inside running through the turn and finished up only evenly to the wire. ONLY
AT MIDNITE stalked near the rear down the backstretch, put in a mild run inside nearing the quarter pole and levelled out through the lane. CHRISTINA'S
RING settled near the back after the start, was roused on the turn, offered little response and was a non factor for the drive. PARDONNEZ MOI broke with
the field but was void of any early speed and trailed, could not get interested on the turn and was not a presence to the wire.

A TOUCH OF RED was getting out while in control of the early lead, joined by a rival after the opening quarter who forced the pace inside, dueled outside
that one, drifted out in the stretch while joined by an outside rival, dueled with that one, was headed at the furlong marker, dug in gamely to be resurgent
and prevail. ANCIENT SPIRIT stalked from just off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch, hooked up to duel while on even
terms in mid-stretch, was outfinished but clearly second best. ANAM CARA brushed lightly in the early going without ill consequence, tracked in behind two
to three wide into the turn, moved out five wide turning for home, could not kick on with the top pair while moving nearer inside but was best of the rest.
STRIKE THE POSE raced at the back off the inside going two to three wide on the turn, was put to urging coming to the quarter pole but failed to rally.
HOLIDAY WITH AMY was rather difficult to load, brushed lightly in the early going then moved forward inside to force the pace after the opening quarter,
dueled into the turn, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
BROWNING ISLAND broke a bit slow at the start, tracked the dueling leaders on the rail down the backside, waited patiently inside throughout the turn, shot
up the fence to take command around the furlong marker and won going away in the end. AWESOMECREST trailed the field in the early stages, advanced
between horses at the three furlong pole, was in the mix at the top of the stretch racing five wide and while no match for the winner ran on well to get up for
second place. I'M A CHI TOO dueled for the lead outside on the turn, began to edge away from his speed rival two furlongs from home, was surrounded by
challengers at the top of the stretch, gave way to the winner at the eighth pole and battled on stubbornly just getting caught for the place award at the finish.
BOKERMIN broke sharp and was reined back to watch the frontrunners duel at the half, was shuffled back with rivals on either side running on the turn and
could not make enough of an impact in the late stages of the race. BEYOND BORDERS made an early move four wide around runners commencing three
furlongs to the finish, loomed six wide turning for home and flattened out with an eighth to go to be a non factor in the late stages. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE
pressed for the lead inside throughout the turn, began to give way at the quarter pole and tired in the final sixteenth while between runners.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE KNIGHT settled in behind the leaders tracking inside, began to advance gradually two wide past a tiring rival nearing the quarter pole, bid inside
foes in late stretch and edged clear under steady handling. DOLDER GRAND stalked just off the leading pair four wide early, continued four wide on the far
turn, came into upper stretch five deep, bid at the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. COLLECTIVE FORCE steadied just slightly in behind a rival soon after
the start, moved forward to press that one three wide leaving the first turn and forcing the issue a bit early up the backstretch, reined in to continue press just
off the leader, moved clear turning for home, was overtaken a sixteenth out. READY FOR THE LADY settled toward the back near but just off the inside,
was encouraged along at the three-quarters, advanced inside a rival on the far turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, gained mildly but too late.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed inside early, switched out and raced wide up th backstretch, went four deep on the far turn, moved out seven wide in
upper stretch and ran on evenly. GUESTIMATION shifted in while moving clear early, set the pace on or just off the rail, came up empty for the stretch.
CONGLOMERATE was taken back and in behind a rival three wide early, dropped back two to three deep on the far turn, tired.

CHANCEL tracked kindly just behind the engaging speedsters into the turn, was roused five sixteenths from the finish to go after the leader, bid for the lead
at the top of the stretch and while under left handed urging poked his nose in front at the eighth pole and began to inch away at the line. BLACK SUN
pressed the pace outside into the turn, put away the other speed rival three furlongs from the wire, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and battled
courageously through the lane giving away nearing the finish. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) was situated near the back in the early stages, took closer order
creeping up on the leaders inside on the turn, split foes in the two path for the drive and put in a strong finishing rally to be a clear third in the end. LUCYS
CHILD tracked inside behind the contesting frontrunners into the turn, asked for run on the rail at the quarter pole, angled to the three path between rivals in
upper stretch and held well to be a fringe player at the finish. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN settled near the back in the beginning, was ridden on the turn but
could not advance, angled out widest in the seven path for the stretch run and finished up well outside showing good energy in the late stages. SUPER
HEADLINE trailed the field leaving the chute, continued to see them all two furlongs from the finish and passed tired ones outside running to the line. DIXIE
BOUND was allowed to settle near the back early, advanced up the rail through the turn, angled off tired foes at the quarter pole to be three wide at the top
of the lane and could only give an even effort down the lane. MYSTIC POINT was in range tracking the leaders into the turn, at the top of the stretch was in
the hunt for a smaller share of the prize and faltered between horses at the furlong marker. EXECUTIVE GIANT was brushed at the break, settled midfield
outside through the turn and had little to offer down the lane. JMR PURE SENSATION broke outwards to begin, rated mid pack between foes at the half,
was asked for run on the turn and tired to the wire. STYLISH GENT broke out at the start, recovered to duel on the pace inside down the backside,
surrendered the lead with three furlongs remaining and wilted in mid stretch on the fence.

Footnotes
POULIN IN O T attended the pace from outside, edged away willingly late on the turn, asked for run in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in the drive, was eased
up nearing the wire when safely clear. SILENT FORTUNE tracked from inside, came out two then three wide leaving the turn and under urging, moved out
further to be six wide by mid-stretch, was kept busy to the wire and closed the gap on the winner while no real threat but clearly second best. POSTURING
lacked early speed, was encouraged along on the turn, swung five to six wide for the stretch run, kept on to get up for show honors. BOSS HOLIDAY hit the
gate, was brushed and shuffled slightly about the half then steadied slightly near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, came out three wide in
upper stretch and ran on. HALF TO RELOAD was mildly coaxed forward from the break, contested the pace inside, weakened. GEM QUALITY brushed a
foe about the half-mile marker, went two to three wide and between foes on the turn, failed to rally. CRIMSON COMET broke outwardly a bit, raced
forwardly outside foes going four wide on the turn, failed to rally for the drive.

Footnotes
SMART COVERAGE broke sharp to lead from the outside, took off on inside pace rival entering the turn, had a clear advantage on the field in mid stretch
and cruised in for the easy winning finish. SOUPED UP rated in mid pack at the half, was shuffled through the turn to be near the back turning for home, lost
his path in mid stretch and battled on stubbornly to the line to rally getting up for place right at the finish. TORY'S HOLIDAY hopped at the break, settled
near the back in the beginning, began to pick up rivals midpoint through the turn, shifted just outside to the three path for the drive, finished up well just
getting caught while losing the nod for the place share at the line. UGOTAFRIENDINME travelled near the back outside at the half, rallied three wide
midpoint on the turn, was pushed out to the seven path at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly to be involved in the end on the losing side of the place
photo. MANETKA stalked mid pack on the rail throughout the turn, edged up on the fence at the quarter marker, tipped outside four wide for the stretch
finish and had some late energy to be involved for the minors in the end. HEEZESPEEDY offered no speed early and trailed at the half, was urged while
floated out to the nine path turning for home and finished up passing tired horses the last sixteenth. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE stalked midfield outside into the
far turn, roused while between foes two furlongs from the finish, angled out for the drive in the five path and stalled the final eighth. SEATTLE APPEAL had
a good position early tracking behind the dueling leaders inside into the turn, advanced up the fence to contend for the minors in upper stretch, could not
find anymore on the fence at the furlong marker and backed away in deep stretch. FRANKS RELOAD pressed the lead down the backside inside, could not
keep pace with the frontrunning winner three eighths from home, chased in vain through the turn and in upper stretch and retreated at the furlong marker.
ZIPPY HOLIDAY tracked behind the pacesetters outside in the beginning, was ridden hard to keep up with five sixteenths left to run, faltered at the quarter
pole and had nothing left in the stretch.
