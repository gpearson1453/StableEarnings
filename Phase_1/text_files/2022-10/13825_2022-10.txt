Footnotes
PUDGE BOY PALACE stalked the early pace two deep then took the nod at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled from that point and kept the edge off the rail on
the far turn, drew clear into the stretch and held on under steady handling. TARAASHOQ settled back toward the inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole
and steadily improved, eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane, took second past the eighth pole and finished well. NEVER FOR SPEIGHT
settled off the pace saving early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth.
GREYSHOTT rated the early pace inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase, continued close at the rail on the far turn but weakened into
the lane. IRISH MCDOUGAL stalked the pace about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the five path of the far turn.
GO GO GONE raced well back, was eased leaving the quarter pole and walked off.

Footnotes
JACK THE RIPPER (FR) took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the
rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. LOST IN MANHATTAN settled back off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and improved off the rail on the far turn, took second mid-stretch and was gaining quickly on the winner. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA settled off the rail on the
first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, but flattened stride the final sixteenth. BRUTUS rounded the first
turn in the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened stride in the three path of the far turn. FIND YOUR BOAZ was not a
factor. RISING PERRY showed little response through the backstretch. STRETCH THE TRUTH stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
HOLY SYNCHRONICITY stalked the pace two deep on the first turn, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and was pressured to draw clear of
Auburn Mill into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn and was steadily encouraged to widen. SUGAR DADDY settled off the rail on the first turn, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. AUBURN MILL ducked in leaving the
gate then hustled along to set the early pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught approaching the three eighths, continued
in chase from that point but dropped back at the rail into the far turn and was outfinished in a later duel for second. TIP FOR TAP saved ground, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. MARK DID IT rounded the opening turn in
the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. NOVA BOY saved ground on the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BIG DADDY D R was pinched back at the start, ran in the three path of
the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

the far turn, dueled clear leaving the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. MAY MAYS CASTLE rated close in the three path, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a slight disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dropped back leaving the eighth pole but finished
evenly. I SHALLBE RELEASED rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased outward into
the stretch and finished evenly. HOOK THE CHAIN settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase approaching the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS stalked the earlier pace two deep, gave chase nearing

BUDDY BUDDY rated a short lead inside, kept the edge over ROAD PARTY leaving the half mile pole, was urged away from the mid point of the far turn
then kept alert in the lane. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then tapered in to stalk two deep, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, proved no match
for the winner and settled for second best. JUBA BOUND settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn then flattened the final sixteenth. ANGELA'S ROMEO saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
and ran evenly in the stretch. AIR MEDAL saved ground well back on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail
and showed little further. ENTRY TIME broke out and made contact with Road Party then stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. SARGENT KOBE raced off the pace in the three path the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch.

TREJO was hustled for early control then rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the
far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. CHROME HEIR settled just off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving
the half mile pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and finished well to take second later yards while gaining on the winner. ISLAND D'LITE broke a bit
awkwardly then stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but flattened the
final sixteenth. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground leaving the five eighths pole and settled off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, improved in the three path of the far turn but showed little in the lane. BAYTOWN BEAVER rounded the first turn in the six path, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened. CHET'S PACKIN HEAT checked at the rail off the inside flank of Only Get'n Better
leaving the five eighths pole and raced well back. TIZNOW TIME rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but

BUBBA GRUMP tapered in to stalk two deep through the front stretch, challenged leaving the half mile pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took
the nod toward the three eighths, drew clear approaching the quarter and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. COMMAND THE CAT settled off
the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in to take second leaving the sixteenth

sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished evenly to take third late stretch. HERO'S MAN rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the
challenge of Bubba Grump leaving the half mile pole and dueled at even terms from that point, gave up the nod toward the three eighths pole but dropped
back approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened in the lane. OUT OF CENTS rounded the first turn in the four path, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. BOASTER saved ground on the first turn, bid
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. OFFICER APPEAL settled inside on the first turn and
showed little response past the three eighths pole. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS broke a bit rank then angled in and never factored.

Footnotes
AARON'S TAP settled close to the early pace inside, eased out with a bid nearing the quarter pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. EISELE rated a short lead inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave
up the nod to NEVER COMPROMISE approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn but held well for second. The latter
stalked two deep from the five eighths pole, challenged past the seven sixteenths pole and took a brief lead toward the five sixteenths, was caught midway
on the far turn and flattened in the lane. ELLIE'S LIL MAN rated close in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened off the
rail on the far turn. STEP OUT DANCING raced well back saving ground and showed little.
