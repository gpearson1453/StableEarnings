Footnotes
BUTCH'S BEST cleared early then was soon joined by two others into the turn, dueled while those rivals through the turn while near the inside, shook clear
into the lane then extended the margin through the lane. JENNY'S BEIGNET vied for the lead while between rivals through the turn, could not keep up with
the top one through the lane and settled for second best. NINE POINTER settled off the pace while in the two path through the turn, shifted from the two to
the five path for the drive and moved up for the minor share while not a threat to the top two. ROCK THE RED chased the pace from near the rail through
the turn, angled into the four path for the drive, looked to be a serious threat with an eighth to go then weakened. BACKYARD JUSTICE chased the pace
early, moved to challenge three wide through the turn then faded in the lane. BENITO was off a step slow and brushed the gate, raced several lengths
behind the field early, moved up in the two or three path and was never a factor. MYSTERY IMPACT never a factor while in the two path through the turn.
SAN RONIN was never a menace while along the inside.

Footnotes
FRIDAY NIGHT RIGHT was unhurried while near the inside through the turn, gained momentum in late turn, angled into the five path into the lane,
continued with good energy through the final eighth and was up in time under strong handling. RILEYS REDEMPTION chased the pace from the two or
three path through the turn, bid from the two path into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go, led very late and just was caught. WIN ME OVER
vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, continued to duel with two others inside the eighth pole then yielded late. NOT PLAYIN AROUND saved
ground through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild bid from the two path. DEALER vied for the lead two wide through the turn, continued to duel
into the lane then faltered. ADDICTED TO LOVE stepped in at the start, raced in the two path through the turn while near the back and never was a factor.
MACHO JUSTICE raced in the four to the three path through the turn and steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
NO MORE FAKE NEWS chased the pace from the three path through late turn, came into the lane from the three path, engaged the pacesetter outside the
eighth pole, dueled with that one through the final eighth and inched up late. COMPRESSED ENERGY set the pace from the outset, was under pressure
down the backstretch and into the far turn, cleared in late turn, was joined by the winner outside the eighth pole, dueled with that one while along the rail and
gave ground grudgingly. AMAZINGNESS raced along the inside through the turns, gained momentum through the far turn, shifted into the three path for the
final eighth and was slowly gaining to the end. SKYS IMAGE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, continued in contention
into the lane then faded once straightened in the lane. FAIRE EXPRESS raced in the two path, was close up into the far turn then was done entering the
lane. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE bobbled at the start, raced in the two path through the turns and never was a factor. SKIPPINJUSTICE chased the pace
from along the inside into the far turn, angled into the six path for the drive and was empty.

Footnotes
IMAGINE THE MOON vied for the lead two wide through the turn, dispatched of dueling rival into the lane, was joined soon after by TIZZY JOJO, dueled
with that one outside the eighth pole until approaching the sixteenth pole then drew clear. TIZZY JOJO settled off the pace early, advanced in the two path
through the turn, bid into the lane while near the inside, dueled with the winner outside the eighth pole then could not keep up late while well clear for the
place spot. WILDCATJUSTICE void of early speed, raced in the three path through the turn, gained momentum into the lane and moved up from the four
path while not a threat to the top two. BRITTANYSGLDNFAITH was in the three or four path through the turn when in the back flight, came into the lane
from the six path and moved up while not a menace. TWIRLING JUSTICE in the two path through the turn, swung into the lane from the four path and never
was a threat. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE in the two path through the turn when near the back, raced in the six path through the lane and passed tired ones.
NIGHT LIVIN chased the pace from the three path into the lane and was empty with an eighth to go. JURADICIAL vied for the lead with the winner into late
turn then gave way. PASSIONFORJUSTICE never a factor while along the inside. EMPIRE SUNRISE steadily faded while racing in the two path through
the turn and in the six path after entering the lane. FAIR FOLLY was outrun while along the inside. DULCE VICTORIA chased the pace along the inside
through the turn then faded through the lane.
