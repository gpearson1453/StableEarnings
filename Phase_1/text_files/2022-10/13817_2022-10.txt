DAKOTA OUTLAW dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid to shake clear leaving the quarter pole, then held sway late to prove best under left
handed crop urging. THE LITTLE SPROUT was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and closed well but could not get to
the winner. MISTER GARY dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the drive, bested rest. ACT OF VALOR pressed the early pace four wide, then
tracked the pace three wide on the turn and weakened. WINNERS WIN was allowed to settle three wide, came five wide into the lane and had no rally.

PEACH BE WITH Q set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane under strong crop urging. MORGANS
COVE chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to gain the place award. MADISON COUNTY
chased the pace and saved ground on the turn, made a mild bid leaving the turn and shifted off the inside nearing the furlong marker but flattened out, held
show award. TOUCH OF MADNESS was off slowly, outrun early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and had a belated
rally to just miss the show award. OUTSPEND pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the drive.

ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT prompted the pace on the inside, then shifted out on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and edged clear by the
sixteenth marker and then remained clear to prove best, driving. TRADERS LUCK reared right before the gate opened, appeared the assistant starter may
have had a hold of him for split second, off ten lengths last, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and closed full of run.
COAST TO COAST set a pressured pace two wide early, drew clear on the turn, then faded late. BOYS OF QUEENS chased the pace three wide and
weakened.

LUSCIOUS LOLA was away alertly and crossed over, then set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn and was in the three path leaving the
turn, then drew clear to prove best under a drive. RAECHEL'S RISK was bumped at the start, then went up to press the pace three wide, then rated off the
pace entering the turn, then made another bid four to five wide by the quarter pole, then finished willingly late for the place while not being able to match
strides with the winner. SHATTER ME was rated early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out. PARANOIA stalked the pace four wide and
stopped.
