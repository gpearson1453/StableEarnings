Footnotes
MARZ EXPRESS took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at
the rail on the far turn, bore out and made contact with JUBA'S PARADE into the stretch, exchanged repeated further contact with that one through the
stretch and held on under a hard left rein. The latter settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on
the far turn, was carried out and brushed into the lane, exchanged repeated contact with Marz Express through the stretch then steadied late. LUCKY
BLONDE raced well off the pace in the three and four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path
and ran evenly in the lane. SAIL ON BREEZE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened
inside the eighth pole. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK saved ground racing well back on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran two
deep on the far turn, eased out leaving the eighth pole and finished well. BOUNDTOBEGREAT stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
but flattened off the rail on the far turn. BELLA MELA settled close inside on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at
the rail on the far turn. STRONG WILLED rounded the first turn in the five path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in
the seven path of the far turn and showed little more. MUSIC LASS saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened
at the rail on the far turn. CAT WITH A NOTION rounded the first turn in the six path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened in the five
path of the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Marz Express for interference leaving the far turn and through the stretch,
lodged by the rider of Juba's Parade, but determined there was equal responsibility.

Footnotes
JUBA'S NOTION became a little anxious in the gate then settled close in the three and four paths on the opening turn, bid past the quarter pole, eased
slightly out leaving the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and inched ahead of HONEYQUIST through the final yards. The latter rated a slim lead inside,
pulled clear of Lord Of Cork approaching the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded later yards.
PAYMENGOLD rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, got up for third
mid-stretch and finished well while gaining on the top two. NEVERPOPTHECORK saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, eased out past the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. LORD OF
CORK stalked from the two and three paths, challenged into the backstretch and gave chase, but dropped back toward the quarter pole, ran in the three
path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. AREYOUGONNAKISSME rounded the first turn about the five path and left the turn outside, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. STROLLINGINTHEWIND rounded the first turn in the four and five
paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and passed rivals. TEACHINTHERELEASE rated close
to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. XCELLENT START rounded the first turn in the
five and six paths and made only a mild middle move. PINNACLE REEF became fractious in the gate and settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase from
the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
HESSICA rated close off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter and dug in under steady
stretch handling to hold on. THE SKY IS FALLING settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in between horses leaving the turn, eased out mid-stretch and finished well at the outside girth of the
winner. AZZURRA saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, ran three wide on the far turn then flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. MOONLIT SHADOW bobbled leaving the gate then stalked the early pace inside, dueled at even terms from the half mile pole,
was caught at the rail nearing the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. GRACE ELIZABETH was not a factor.
BOUNDTOBEOK set the early pace off the rail, was met at the half mile pole and dueled from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and
faded off the rail on the far turn. Per HISA Ruling # 7, The Sky Is Falling is disqualified from earnings - mds

Footnotes
MUAD'DIB settled unhurriedly just off the pace in the three path, was urged from the three eighths pole and took the lead toward the quarter, dug in to the
challenge of MARTIN MAN leaving the eighth pole and kept that one at bay through the lane. The latter settled off the early pace toward the inside, crept
closer to the front through the backstretch, started a bid into the far turn, eased to the outside of Muad'dib into the lane and dueled gamely, while needing a
bit more. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the rail then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the five path and dueled for third
mid-stretch. CANDY INVASION saved ground off the pace, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the six path then flattened in the lane. ALLEN CAN DO IT stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then weakened. ISHIHARA stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the nine sixteenths pole and took the
lead two deep nearing the half, was pressured at the five sixteenths, gave up the lead at the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. OUT OF
CENTS settled back off the rail, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase but flattened in the three path of the far turn. HERO'S MAN rated the pace
inside, was pressured leaving the nine sixteenths, met and dueled into the backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn.
