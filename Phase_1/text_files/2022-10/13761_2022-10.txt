PRINCE CAIRO away well and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run
down the backstretch, bided his time behind the leaders while racing out from the rail in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly from along the inside through
the turn, slipped through at the rail entering the lane, and finished determinedly to get up in the closing strides. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE broke sharply and
dueled for the lead into the first turn from the outside of Y VEE R, continued to press that rival through the second turn and in the run down the backside,
rallied two wide from between rivals into the final turn, was tackled from both sides entering the lane, and finished three wide in the drive to just miss. PAY
MY WAY trailed the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, shifted off the rail and began to advance three wide in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. SLOOP JOHN B settled off the contested early pace while racing
one out from the trail, bided his time well off the leaders in the run down the backside, and needed more when called on over the final furlong. Y VEE R
away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival through the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of RACING
RIVER in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and held that determined rival safely
at bay late to prevail. RACING RIVER away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of KHAIKY'S COMMAND entering the first turn, forced the issue
from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and into the final turn, struggled to keep tabs with that rival entering the lane, but battled gamely
two wide in the drive in a solid effort. WISE MARKET tracked the dueling leaders from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid
from along the rail entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while closing three wide in the drive. SANAWAR unhurried early while dropping back
to trail, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed steadily from along the rail in the drive. QUAGMIRE broke sharply and stalked
the early pace into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide late while unable to
mount a serious late bid. RING OF KERRY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
struggled to hold his position midway through the turn, and faded in the late going.

SUNBIRD raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BAK TO LIBERTY through the second turn and
in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, continued to battled from along the rail through the final turn, was collared by LEGACY
SQUARE entering the lane, and repelled that bid following a stretch long battle to prevail. LEGACY SQUARE away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, engaged the leaders three wide
entering the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to just miss. LOGICAL AL stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while
saving ground at the rail, saved ground entering the second turn while pulling his way into a tracking trip, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn,
and finished willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. BAK TO LIBERTY pressed the pace from the outside of SUNBIRD entering the stretch the first
time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was no match for the top pair leaving the turn, and finished
four wide in the drive. TIME TICKER broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ASKMENOQUESTIONS away well, but was taken in hand and allowed to
drop back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, and failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.

NEIGHNEIGH away alertly and dueled for the lead into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, took control from along the rail entering
the second turn and controlled the pace in the run down the backside, maintained her advantage into the final turn, held a clear lead into the lane, and held
off a late bid by MATSQUI in deep stretch to prove best. MATSQUI settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first
time, bided her time well off the leaders in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four
wide in the drive to prove 2nd best. AIR FORCE settled at the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to
advance four wide midway down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share.
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND away well and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to track the
pacesetter two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. ARUNDEL CASTLE
settled off the early pace while saving ground through the stretch the first time, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more while
finishing two wide in the drive. ABOVE AVERAGE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, eased off the
leader to assume a tracking trip entering the second turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong. HIGHER

ABRIERWIN tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to get up in the final strides to prevail. MISS THE HYPE away
well and pressed the pace from from the outside of SHOWMAN through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch, assumed control midway through the final turn, and just failed to last. SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along
the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three
wide in the drive to be along for a share. I GOT VISION unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the
final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive while improving her position. SHOWMAN away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of MISS THE HYPE in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but
weakened in the late stages. STRIKING VALUE tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while being carried three wide, held a stalking trip in
the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. OKANAGAN GOLD settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and was never a serious factor.

BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, eased of a pace challenge to take a tracking trip in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily two wide in the drive to prove best. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR away well
and tracked the leader into the first turn before assuming command entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backside and into the
final turn, was no match for the winner late, but battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to hold the pace. FOOT SOLDIER stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide from between rivals in the drive to finish on
even terms with ANAAMY. ANAAMY broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through
the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to finish on even terms with FOOT SOLDIER. DO YOU WANNA GO settled off the early pace while racing
two wide into the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while needing more.

closing response in an even effort. DONE THAT lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the final turn, was always well back
and never menaced. SILVER ARROW lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a
late impact.
