Footnotes
LAHUN quickly took command, saved ground through the backstretch, turned back challenge from TAPFERSURE near the quarter pole and drew away
through the stretch. TAPFERSURE raced four to five wide entering the backstretch, moved up to challenge LAHUN nearing the quarter pole, but was no
match for the winner, and just held under a late drive. VIRAL chased outside in the backstretch, closed gradually and just missed. UNION MAN stalked the
pace, and faded steadily. ICETECA was gapped early, and passed tiring rival. AWESOME MEMORIES tracked inside, and was done early. MONETARY
MISHAP saved ground and was unable to keep pace with the field.

Footnotes
BOOKIE tracked inside, shifted out to the four path, responded to encouragement then improved steadily outside and dug in through the lane to get up in
the final strides. ROLLIN SEVENS showed the way into the backstretch, was under attack into the stretch, turned back challengers and was run down in the
final yards. REALLY SLOW allowed to settle early, rated well off the pace, gained closer order nearing the final turn, circled the field into the stretch, and
closed with good energy to score show. LANNY MAC raced three wide into the opening turn, sat in range while four wide, was set down into the stretch and
was out kicked. ALL THAT GOLD sat in striking distance, moved up menacingly after the quarter pole from along the rail, and lacked the rally needed.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE was never far back, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SMARTY RIVER PANTS broke alertly, raced off the pace in the four path, chased the leaders through the final turn, rallied determinedly, matched strides
outside of AWESOME SATURDAY and won the nod. AWESOME SATURDAY reserved off the pacesetters from the three path, split rivals at the head of
the stretch, continued to battle late stretch and was denied by the nose. SHORTY THE SWEDE contended the early pace from a rail position, dueled
through the lane inside of DELVECCHIO, gained a slim advantage mid stretch and was out finished. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES advanced quickly in the final
turn, angled out to the five path at the head of the stretch and closed well. SPIRE trailed the field, and closed steadily late. DRILLER fanned three wide
leaving the backstretch, and rallied belatedly. DELVECCHIO contested the pace outside of SHORTY THE SWEDE, and weakened late stretch.

Footnotes
NO BAKK TALK sat mid pack, drove four wide off the final turn, steadily gained and drew away. WITT'S TENNY TEN vied inside for the early lead, showed
the way through the far turn, was collared in the final sixteenth and held safely for place. NO COLLUSION broke in bumping SUGAR MOON, stalked four
wide, rallied outside nearing the stretch, drifted in while improving position late. FLORIST raced four wide leaving the backstretch, lacked running room late
stretch and finished well. SUGAR MOON sat in striking position, set aim on WITT'S TENNY TEN at the head of the lane, and gave way late.
SAVEITFORARAINYDAY unhurried early, raced five wide leaving the backstretch, and offered a late mild bid. SARATOGA STYLE hustled away, fanned
four wide, and lacked a closing response. CHATTY GAL broke outward, showed some early speed inside, and tired.

TAKE NO PRISONERS raced four wide leaving the chute, set the pace then angled in the two path, responded to threat from HE'S THE CHAIRMAN, and
drew away. DURITZ trailed the field, lugged out leaving the backstretch, hustled in the final turn, closed steadily late stretch to earn place. TRICKY
SPEEDSTER reserved off the early pacesetters, was asked to quicken outside, drove four wide into the lane, was no match for the winner and was worn
down in the final strides. IMPERIALITE raced wide leaving the backstretch, and offed a late bid. DARK STORM COMING chased inside early, dropped back
and came up empty in drive. SPECIAL INCLUSION offered little. HE'S THE CHAIRMAN stalked the pace in the four path, moved up menacingly nearing the
quarter pole, and faltered. DR A TO D stalked from the rail, steadied in the backstretch and retreated.

ENTITLED STAR chased from second flight, gained closer order nearing the stretch, kept on improving steadily and dug in late getting by in time. BELLS
AND WHISTLES pressured the early pace from the rail, overhauled KISSABLE U in the stretch and was caught late stretch. ROTTEN TO THE CORE
saved ground inside, and passed tiring rival. WHOOP IT UP trailed the field early, and offered a late mild bid. KISSABLE U quickly went to the front setting a
pressured pace in the five path, gained an advantage in the final turn, and faltered in the stretch. MUSICAL RELOAD offered little. KENSINGTON MARKET
stumbled badly from the gate, rider lost irons, was pulled up, did not finish and walked off.

Footnotes
VALUE DANCER angled inside entering the first turn, sat in striking distance in the three path, moved up to challenge the lead, drew clear in the final turn,
and was kept to task with a few intermittent reminders. LITTLE DIEGO unhurried early, gained closer contention in the final turn, lacked room inside then
shifted out, lodged a rail bid into the stretch, gained inside and held for place. GOLD'S UP raced at the back of the pack, raced wide into the lane, drifted in
entering the stretch and finished with good energy but was out finished for second. VALENTINO ROSSA raced four wide through the opening turn, saved
ground through the backstretch, chased under urging, angled in then steadied in traffic, and finished evenly. CHESTER SLEW broke alertly, dueled inside of
GREAT VISION, was unable to keep pace with the field and came up empty in drive. GREAT VISION contested the early pace, dueled leaving the
backstretch and tired early. AMEER chased the pacesetters while three wide, angled to the rail and faded steadily inside. CAROLINA GENT shifted out to
the five path entering the backstretch, chased and tired.

Footnotes
SHIP'S CREEK tracked outside, challenged the lead leaving the backstretch, gained a slim lead into the stretch, and kicked away. CAPA BELLA pressed
the pace from the rail, was unable to move on with rival dropping back, roused into the stretch and finished well. LITTLE ROSALYN unhurried early in the
five path, hustled on the final turn, and closed gradually outside. SAVYSKYE set a pressured pace, was overtaken in the final turn, chased on into the
stretch, and flattened out. SHE'S EXPENSIVE tracked inside, and rallied mildly. WICKED WOMAN passed tiring rival. SOPHIE MCTROPHY chased in the
four path, and was unable to improve position in the drive. BEAUTIFUL BABE was gapped early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and showed
a mild interest late. RUBYINTHESTARS raced wide through the backstretch, and was outrun. SCARLETT'S FLOWER went wide through the backstretch,
and had no response when called upon. ANN OF WAR saved to no avail.
