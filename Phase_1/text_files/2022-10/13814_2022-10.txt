FORTUNATE FRIENDS allowed to settle, rallied three wide through the far turn and into the stretch, responded under left handed urging and got up in the
final strides under confident handling. DYRDEK chased the pace into the stretch, drifted to the six path, made the lead before the furlong marker then
couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. ZERO GRAVITY unhurried early, closed four wide on the far turn and into the stretch and finished
determinedly in the middle of the racetrack. SMASH was sent to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then
weakened. IMTHEPRINCE was outrun. STORM RISK inside, was through after a half.

Footnotes
CALL PAPA trailed down the backstretch, circled his field while closing rapidly three wide under right handed urging, made the lead past the furlong marker
and drew off to win in hand. KAPHAVATA pressed the pace three then two wide, gained a narrow lead in upper stretch then was no match for the winner
while well clear for second. AS DE ORO COCO battled for the lead two wide then along the inside until mid stretch then weakened. STOP MAKING SENSE
settled in the four path down the backstretch, angled inside entering the turn, moved closer before the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. DIAMOND
MONEY failed to menace. CONNECTED was no factor. HEY SACH away alertly, dueled for the early lead along the inside, shifted out to the four path on
the turn then the six path entering the stretch then was used up.

Footnotes
TOY TIGER always within striking distance, rallied three wide through the turn to engage the leader nearing the top of the stretch, made the lead before the
furlong marker in the six path and finished full of run under brisk handling to win going away. SABELLE broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to
the five path then was no match for the winner. HALF LEGEND never far back, finished with good courage three wide. LITTLE DUTCH GIRL failed to
menace. NINJA KITTEN had no impact. AWESOME WONDER chased the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. EVIL OF COURSE had
brief speed. O K BABY trailed.

NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT stalked the pace from the five path down the backstretch, dropped inside midway on the turn, drew on even terms for the lead in
upper stretch, dug in gamely under left handed urging late and proved best. SPICE ICE allowed to settle, rallied three wide through the turn, gained a
narrow advantage nearing mid stretch, matched strides to the wire and finished second best. ROCKY CHANNEL slow early, found her best stride late in the
five path. LADY FORTUNE dueled for the lead three then two wide for nearly a half then faded in the lane. BODE'S ROSE battled for the lead two wide then
along the inside into the turn, edged clear then came up empty. COSTUME JEWELRY was no factor. PENNIESANDDIMES had brief speed inside.

KISSINGER unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed two wide through upper stretch, made the lead near the sixteenth pole and just lasted under left
handed urging. IMA BELIEVER slow early, closed rapidly four wide through the stretch and just missed getting up in time. DEXQUIRE chased the early
pace, rallied to wide to make the lead in upper stretch then was outfinished. THE PINK Z stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide past the quarter
pole then failed to sustain that bid. HONKY TONK MUSIC well placed, failed to respond. TURNING PAGES broke in front and quickly opened a daylight
lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. ZAROSHA was no threat. MAYNARD G. KREBS was no factor. COOLER reluctant to load, was
through early.

A SMILE A DAY chased the early pace three wide, rallied under right handed urging to make the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew off under strong
handling. STAR MABEE never far back, dug in through deep stretch four wide and got up for second. SOLE FACTOR trailed into the stretch, swung wide
and closed a gap late mid track. WINDY LU WHO unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground late three wide. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY vied for the lead
from the start, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch then was outfinished. THE DEVIL'S DREAM sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace
for a half, battled until deep stretch then weakened. PERFECTINGTHEVIEW close up early, swung wide entering the stretch and lost ground. THE

Footnotes
SHEISTHEHERO pressed the early pace two wide, took command and shook clear before a half, drifted to near mid track entering the stretch, set the
balance of the pace and proved best under strong handling. ROSE KNOWS chased the pace, dug in four wide and was steadily cutting into the winners
advantage late. FOREVER HOME had speed from the start, moved up three wide while outside on the turn, swung out to the middle of the racetrack and
finished with good courage. PURDY PUMKIN allowed to settle, finished determinedly two wide. GRAY ROYALITY failed to menace. SKY offered a mild bid
along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. LUCKY TUESDAY was outrun. STORM CHARGING reared at the start and was no factor. ORBIT BOUND
was through early.

Footnotes
RUN ROCKY away alertly, set a pressured pace into the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out. MY
TICKET pressured the winner early then was no match while well clear for second. PLAYING BALL stalked the pace and went evenly along the rail through
the stretch. NOSEY POWER failed to menace. JUST INSPIRED passed tiring rivals in the path. RUNAWAY RUSSELL improved position into the stretch
then came up empty. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS had brief speed. ORLEANS STORM was through after a half. BAD BACK was no threat.
JOHNSBUCKEYEBADBOY was outrun.
