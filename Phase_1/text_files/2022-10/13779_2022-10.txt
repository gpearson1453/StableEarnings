Footnotes
TRIPLE CHROME angled inwards while prompted to a forward placing three deep attending the pace to the turn, continued with a steady bid in that path
into upper stretch to wrest command, then shifted out while going clear late in a mild drive. TOWN CRIER was urged along the inside prompting the
pacesetter into the turn, kept on into the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. COAL TOWN ROAD, urged between foes dictating the pace on
a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled for command off the rail inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no match and couldn't save the
place honors late. WILDCAT HAGRID, off slowly, was prompted to advance three wide between into the turn gaining a position off the first flight nearing the
lane but had no late bid. KING ZION settled outside foes, was fanned four wide on the turn and offered no closing bid. GRUMPA settled inside foes in early
stages and failed to menace thereafter. SMOKEONTHEHORIZON dropped back early.

Footnotes
DAIGLE was urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, held sway in that path to upper stretch and fended off
rivals under firm handling. NORTHERN ALLIANCE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch then
continued with a steady effort between foes to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. SILVERA, forwardly placed along the inside prompting
the pacesetter, tipped out racing through the stretch and continued willingly to finish on terms with the top pair. ZANDREA'S was rated off the second flight
inside, responded to advance nearing the far turn, shifted out to the five path racing through the lane and continued to gain position to the end. COME ON
SWEET PEA settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled six wide entering the lane and continued to make some belated
progress. SHE B GLAMOROUS settled last along the inside to the far turn and passed some tiring rivals late. RENTAL POOL was urged to a position
tracking off the first flight outside a rival to the far turn, was urged to advance four wide into upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. LIZZ A BEE tracked
off the second flight near the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. LAUNCH AWAY settled outside foes to the backstretch, was
fanned seven wide racing into the lane and proved no threat. ROMANTIC ATTACK, urged three wide prompting the pace from the outset into the far turn,
gave way into upper stretch. LINDALOUIMAGE retreated early.

Footnotes
DOLLY'S LINE broke readily to dispute the pace between foes, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage into the lane, forged clear
through the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. BELLS OF JOY tracked off the first flight between rivals on the backstretch, shifted out four wide
racing through the stretch and continued with interest to narrowly prevail for the place honors. QUEEN EKATI settled off the pace along the inside on the
backstretch, tipped out racing into the lane, split foes just off the inside displaying solid late momentum and just missed for second. TAP N TWINE, urged
along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in the lane but had no final bid. BOOZIN AT BOZOS settled off the
second flight in the opening quarter, angled to the rail racing through the turn to gain position saving ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid.
HEY MA tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing into the turn and gave way after a half. DELTA LADY was urged three wide pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn and emptied out nearing midstretch. HARD LIKE HOLLY broke slowly, raced wide into the stretch while proving no threat.

Footnotes
STACY ATTACK was urged setting the pace between rivals on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, maintained that margin a bit off the rail into
upper stretch and held sway to the end under some right handed pressure. RUNNERS HEAT, in touch with the pacesetter in the three between foes
stalking just off that rival into the bend, continued with a steady effort to narrowly prevail for the place honors in late stages. FRIEND tracked off the second
flight four wide racing to the turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane but continued with interest to gain position while edging rivals for a share.
MEDWAY QUEEN, off slowly, was urged four deep between foes pursuing the leaders into the turn, to contest second to upper stretch but faded leaving the
furlong marker. WICKED GOOD, forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final
response. GREEN BANANAS, a step slow into stride, was reserved along the, saved ground on the turn, tipped off the inside while being prompted to gain
some position entering the lane but came up empty midstretch. READY AT MIDNIGHT proved no factor. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) switched off the inside
tracking off the second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch.

WAVE OF GOODNESS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out of close quarters nearing the far turn to race outside
foes on the second bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and produced a stout rally to edge KATIE M'LADY in time under firm handling. The latter,
reluctant loading in the gate, was urged to a forward placing stalking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far
turn, was getting to the leader leaving midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. MO CLARE'S sped to the lead along the inside to the first turn, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, dueled for command past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. TIMELESS ROSE tracked off the second
flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled to the rail entering the far turn while being prompted to close the gap on the leaders nearing the lane but had
no closing bid. SEAWARD tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide into the far turn but faded in
the drive. RUSSIAN MAFIA settled outside foes, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but offered no rally. VEZPA (BRZ) reserved along the inside early,
never gained contention. HOT DAME tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and emptied out after a half. MORRIE'S JOY, reserved
last early, trailed the field to the stretch.

HONEY MUG set the pace inside, saved ground around the turn, was engaged by LONG TALL WOMAN to her outside near the three eighths and was on
even terms with that foe near the quarter, kicked away into the top of the stretch, was reengaged by that foe near the furlong mark, drifted out while vying on
under a drive, and held. LONG TALL WOMAN tracked the pace, engaged outside of HONEY MUG while three wide past the three eighths, drew even with
that foe approaching the quarter, let that foe briefly get away in upper stretch, drifted out midstretch, reengaged near the eighth, battled to the wire but just
missed. AVASARALA tracked the leader between horses, was in close range between horses around the bend and into upper stretch, was outfinished from
the three sixteenths and chased on mildly and best of the rest under a drive. MAUREENLOVESFRANK chased inside down the back straight, continued
midfield in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, lacked the needed kick and flattened out late. I THINK I KNOW YOU settled at the
rear of the main group, chased in the three path on the turn, swung out to the five to six path in upper stretch, and offered no rally. MORNING LINE NEWS
veered out in the opening strides, soon trailed, raced in the six path on the turn, floated out toward the center of the track into upper stretch and had no
response in the lane.

Footnotes
KIERKEGAARD tracked the pace behind the leading line in the pocket down the back straight, continued to track in the two path on the turn, swung out four
wide to the lane, was driven to engage outside the leading trio in upper stretch, continued to vie outside of GAME BOY BENNY past the furlong mark, and
kicked away in the final sixteenth. GAME BOY BENNY was sent for speed and vied between horses on a quick pace, kept on inside of KIERKEGAARD past
the eighth when COMISKEY PARK and SWISHAWISH gave way, but was no match in the final sixteenth. BEEALEA settled, raced in the rear pair in the
three path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track to upper stretch, chased on, found his best near the sixteenth, and got up for show in the last
jump. COURTHOUSE COVE was bumped by CLASSIC BET in the opening strides, settled at the rear early, raced on the rail at the inside of the rear pair
around the turn, swung out into upper stretch and drifted out toward the center of the course, nonetheless rallied, but was caught in the last jump for show.
COMISKEY PARK attended the pace three wide early, engaged the leading flight in earnest and battled on the pace three wide around the turn and into the
lane, and gave way in the final furlong. SWISHAWISH was sent for pace, vied at the inside of the leading flight to midstretch, and emptied out in the final
furlong. CLASSIC BET came out and bumped COURTHOUSE COVE in the opening strides, chased outside of KIERKEGAARD early, was driven in the
three path on the turn, weakened past the three eighths, and had no further response in the lane.

Footnotes
BERAVINA was urged between horses early, tracked inside of BELPERRON as that one went for the lead, stalked patiently in the two to three path on the
turn behind the leading line, was driven for a bid inside of YANKEE AGATE into upper stretch, fought on under a drive between horses while drifting slightly
out, headed BELPERRON with about forty yards remaining, and outfinished WILDWOOD BYE to secure the win. WILDWOOD BYE chased outside of
POSITIONDUMONI early, bid into the turn, engaged outside of YANKEE AGATE and BELPERRON past the three eighths in the five path, loomed
approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked by BELPERRON into upper stretch, continued to give chase under a drive five wide in upper stretch, kept on
outside of BERAVINA late but was outkicked by that foe. BELPERRON was a bit keen between horses early, set the pace, cleared approaching the half,
raced in the two path on the turn, was engaged past the three eighths by YANKEE AGATE and WILDWOOD BYE, drove clear into upper stretch, was
reengaged past the furlong mark, kept on under a drive inside but was caught in the final forty yards. YANKEE AGATE tracked the pacesetter, bid outside of
BELPERRON near the three eighths in the four path and loomed near the quarter, came four wide into upper stretch, continued to chase on in the tracking
flight after BELPERRON cleared again, and flattened out past midstretch. POSITIONDUMONI chased inside foes early, continued to chase midpack in the
four path on the turn, raced into the lane in the five path and lacked the needed rally. WILDWOOD GHALY broke slowly and trailed early, took closer order
along the rail around the turn, continued to rally under a drive in the two path in upper stretch but flattened out late. CRYSTAL SNOW settled at the rear of
the main group, chased in the six path on the turn, came six wide into the lane and proved empty. BAILOUT KELA settled well behind the main group, raced
in the four to five path on the turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch and had no rally.
