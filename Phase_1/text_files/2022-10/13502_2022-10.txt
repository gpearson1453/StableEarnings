Footnotes
NEW MEXICO JEREMY pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear. PAGOSA DREAM
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished well to
gain the place. READS CODIGO disputed the pace with HENNESSY LOOKER RF while racing four-wide, drifted in to bump that rival repeatedly late and
gave way. HENNESSY LOOKER RF dueled for the lead from between foes, raced three-wide through the turn, was bumped by READS CODIGO
repeatedly late and gave way. RYDERS UP settled off the leaders throughout and failed to threaten. PAINTED SMOKE was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EL RAFA Q was off a step slow and lagged throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE BUMPING BETWEEN READS CODIGO AND HENNESSY LOOKER RF IN THE FINAL YARDS AND AFTER REVIEWING THE
FILMS CONCLUDED THAT READS CODIGO HAD DRIFTED IN TO BUP HENNESSY LOOKER RF REPEATEDLY AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.
