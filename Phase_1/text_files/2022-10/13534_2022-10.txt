Footnotes
LANNY MAC sat in striking position under a snug hold, went to the lead willingly leaving the backstretch, responded to looming threat from BOOKIE nearing
the three sixteenth pole, and won going away. BOOKIE sat mid pack while saving ground along the rail, loomed boldly nearing the stretch but was no match
for the winner and finished clearly second best. WHERE'S THE GOLD trailed early and offered a late mild bid. FROBISHER BAY was under a snug hold
leaving the opening turn, chased and failed to threaten. VISION QUEST stumbled leaving then led the field into the backstretch, was overtaken leaving the
backstretch and was done early.

THRILL OF THE NITE went five wide leaving chute, contended the pace from outside, dueled into the final turn outside of LIGHT FAST FEET, lugged in
through the stretch and held under a drive. SASSY CINDERELLA trailed the field, angled inside gaining closer order, and closed well. CUVEE TEE sat in
range while five wide, chased the pacesetters in the final turn, and rallied mildly to earn show. LIGHT FAST FEET prompted the pace from the rail, dueled
for the lead in the final turn, and gave way inside. SASSY BUT CLASSY hurried between foes leaving the chute, shifted outside in the backstretch, and was
outrun.

UNBRIDLED'S SKYE broke alertly to take command, took pressure in the final turn from just off the rail, and held firm through stretch. MAKE GOOD
CHOICES rated just off the pace outside, fanned three wide in the far turn, drove four to five wide at the quarter pole, chased under urging but was unable
to reach the winner. PROOF IT raced wide through the backstretch, gained closer order in the final turn, and finished well to take third place. MY LUCKY
MARK stalked the pace while five wide, moved up alongside UNBRIDLED'S SKYE nearing the three eighths pole prompting action, but lacked the rally that
was needed. KENSINGTON MARKET lacked a serious bid. MADE FOR MORE chased inside early, and failed to menace.

ESTIFRAAD rated close outside, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, was headed into the lane and was kept to task under heavy handling.
AMUSING WAY checked leaving the chute, shifted out to the five path, gave chased nearing the stretch and missed after a determined try. KISS AWAY
tracked inside, swung four wide into the lane, rallied through the stretch outside of CHRIS'S COMMAND, and edged away. CHRIS'S COMMAND was under
a strong hold early, contended the led from the rail, and flattened in the stretch. MUSIC HOUR pressed the pace in the three path, and dropped back
nearing the final turn. DUKE OF DEWINTON was not a factor.

Footnotes
A LOT OF SPUNK allowed to settle just off the pace, challenge the led near the three eighths marker, gained the advantage at the head of the stretch and
drew off under a drive. BELLS AND WHISTLES set the pace in the three path, responded to challenge from A LOT OF SPUNK, dueled into the stretch but
was no match late and finished second best. SARATOGA STYLE chased in the second flight, and held firm for show. TALA unhurried early, rallied three
wide into the stretch but was unable to improve position after a determined try. KISSABLE U chased outside, and came up empty for the drive. WITT'S
TENNY TEN broke awkwardly losing irons leaving the gate, hustled four to five wide off the final turn and stopped.

Footnotes
QUICK DIAL contended the pace outside of DIPLOMATICA, gained the advantage in the far turn, and just held under a late drive. DRAMATIC FLAIR rated
off the pace, chased three wide into the lane, closed gamely missing out. AMBER PRINCESS saved inside early, advanced quickly along the rail nearing
the stretch, and improved late. DIPLOMATICA pressed the pace from the rail, was in tight in the far turn then checked, swung five wide at the quarter pole,
and flattened in the stretch. VIVIEN'S CHARM broke alertly then was reserved off the dueling pacesetters, and rallied belatedly. LILBITSPICY went four
wide leaving the backstretch, and played no factor in the stretch. QUEEN RHONDA chased wide and was outrun. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards
conducted an inquiry in the far turn but made no change.

Footnotes
PERDITION bumped leaving then sat just off the flank of FAST EH, dueled in the final turn, took over into the stretch, and held under steady pressure. WYE
CROSS gained closer order into the final turn, closed gradually under handling and dug in the final yards to earn place honors. PHANTOM MAC sat in
striking distance while five wide in the backstretch, moved up three wide into the far turn prompting action, responded to encouragement at the head of the
lane and was edged out for place. FAST EH quickly went to the front, was joined nearing the quarter pole, dueled inside of PERDITION, and weakened late.
NEVVARE chased inside, lacked running room along the rail near the three sixteenth pole, shifted out and closed with good energy. FULL VELOCITY
sandwiched leaving and never threatened. STRONG BELIEF broke inward bumping FULL VELOCITY, and never reached contention. AMEER broke inward
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RYANWATER settled in the five path, roused outside nearing the quarter pole, rallied determinedly while five wide into the stretch, dueled in the final
sixteenth and won the nod. WHISKEY BOUND unhurried early, made good progress inside, angled down to the rail after meeting traffic, rallied along the rail
and was out nodded. MAJESTIC CAFE was reserved off the early pacesetters, took closer order along the rail, found running room at the head of the lane,
and lacked the rally required. SIR BRONX engaged NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE in a speed duel early, inherited the lead in the far turn, and flattened out
late stretch. CHARMING VINTAGE chased four to five wide into the final turn, battled in the four path into the stretch and yielded late. OUR DANDY'S BOY
tracked the dueling pacesetters in the four path, and yielded. SHIMSHINE trailed and passed tiring. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE vied three wide leaving the
opening turn, dueled outside of SIR BRONX through the backstretch, then retreated promptly with three furlongs remaining, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
TAKE NO PRISONERS vied between rivals, gained a short advantage nearing the quarter pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. PUMP THE BRAKES
chased four to five wide leaving the backstretch, drove three wide in the final turn, came under urging near the three sixteenth pole, and along in time for
place. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS closed steadily under light handling, and dug in late to score show. ICE BOX INDY attended the pace from the four path,
challenged TAKE NO PRISONERS in the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late stretch. RATTLESNAKE JACK closed well late. FIRST BASE lacked the
early speed needed and came up empty in drive. VICTORY AT LAST showed some early speed, lacked running room nearing the quarter pole, angled to
the rail then raced in close quarters and retreated. HE'S THE CHAIRMAN failed to threaten. GREAT VISION pressed the pace from the rail, and wilted
abruptly nearing the quarter pole. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of VICTORY AT LAST against the rider of PUMP THE BRAKES
alleging interference in the stretch run was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.
