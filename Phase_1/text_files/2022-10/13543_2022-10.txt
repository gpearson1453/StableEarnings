WICKED MERCURY stalked the pace, advanced three wide leaving the turn, gained a short lead near the quarter pole and dug in tenaciously to prevail.
DIXIE CANNON , rated behind horses to mid turn, eased out four wide leaving the bend, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and hung. MO FIRE lacked
speed, swung out leaving the turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and failed to sustain her run. HOT CHOICE , along
the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch, failed to rally and passed tired foes. SURREAL FANTASY gained the lead outside
PLEASE MARRY ME near the half mile pole and gave way in upper stretch. MONGOLIAN MISSION bobbled leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the
turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch and gave way. PLEASE MARRY ME showed speed along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
OLD ALLIANCE pulled his way forward to join FEELING WOOZY from his inside, took over nearing the five eighths then cleared while off the rail, set a
rated pace three wide into the lane, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, wandered a bit but held firm while kept to task. FEELING WOOZY led
early then was headed from his inside heading to the five furlong marker, prompted three wide outside the winner, came under pressure leaving the five
sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane and continued on well to be clear of the rest. MCMAGIC broke outward and was a bit sluggish early, came under
ride into the turn, circled four wide with some progress entering the lane then flattened out. URBAN BANDIT drifted in at the break and soundly bumped with
PARACHUTE, corrected and raced within range while off the rail early on, dropped back around the turn, came five wide for the drive and got past fading
rivals. SNEAKING SUSPICION saved ground with early pursuit, dropped back some mid turn, angled out and came up empty. PARACHUTE , jostled at the
break, edged up after regrouping and stalked outside of a rival, failed to kick on under a ride entering the stretch and gave way. LONGWORTH lagged back,
saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to respond.

MY FLICKER had speed and prompted the pace outside MAIL CALL leaving the five eighths, moved in hand and secured command near the three eighths,
met an outside challenge from BOSS ANGEL and dueled three wide into the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling
and on her left lead and held sway. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE tracked behind rivals, eased out under a ride nearing the five sixteenths, shifted four wide for
the drive and kept on with good energy to steadily bridge the gap. LOVING CUP lunged at the break, regrouped and moved up four wide under asking mid
turn, was fanned six wide for the drive but flattened out in the final furlong. TOSS A COIN chased in the clear, raced two to three wide in upper stretch and
churned on. BOSS ANGEL tracked three wide, moved to engage the winner mid turn, dueled four wide outside that one into the lane, stayed on to mid
stretch then weakened'. MAIL CALL accelerate to the inside of foes and took command near the five eighths, went clear then took pressure leaving the far
turn, ceded command three furlongs out, faded and was reported by the stewards to have bled. FISHERS , sluggish from the gate, dropped far back, came
three wide for the drive and finished under some hand coaxing.

Footnotes
RED QUEEN , rated outside HONOR YOUR MOTHER down the backstretch and on the turn, took over from that one in upper stretch, gained a clear
advantage in mid stretch and lasted under brisk urging. STARTWITHABANG lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail to
mid stretch, altered course to the five path inside the eighth pole and rallied. IMAGINE THE MOJO hugged the inner rail on the turn, raced inside horses in
the stretch and rallied. ALONG THE WAY , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. CAGED PIXIE , five deep leaving the
turn, lacked a rally. HONOR YOUR MOTHER showed speed along the inner rail and weakened late. MY SUPER SALLY , never a factor, drifted to the nine
path in upper stretch. SHEMADEMELUCKY , three wide on the turn, weakened. DIAL EMMA REILLY was outrun.

when put to some asking soon into the stretch, wandered about while sustaining past mid stretch, took over inside the sixteenth marker, kicked clear and
was under minimal encouragement through the final yards. LANDON JACK sped top the front, dropped in when clearing, set a rated pace around the turn,
kept on under pressure past mid stretch, stayed on with effort but was no match late. PRINCE OF JERICHO stalked outside, moved up three to four wide
into the lane and continued on with effort. B WEST leaned in at the break and brushed with a rival, corrected and was hard sent to contention, pursued
between runners into the turn, failed to kcik on past the three sixteenths and faded. HERE'S LIAM saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to menace.
INDYBOUND stalked inside, eased out past the five sixteenths, ranged up to loom a presence into the lane, chased to mid stretch then gave way. MO EH
HENNESSY , brushed at the break, raced off the pace and three wide around the turn but failed to kick on. MASTER OOGWAY steadied at the break and

MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole, gained the lead outside rivals near the sixteenth
pole, drive clear and drifted out late. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN prompted the pace outside NOMO RUN around the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and
gave way grudgingly. NOMO RON set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. JETTIN OUT , along the inner rail around the turn,
swung wide in upper stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON WILDCAT cruised up to the inside of rivals and took command, moved clear around the turn and set a rated pace, responded when asked two
wide in upper stretch and widened under a drive. FUHGEDDABOUDIT , taken to rate outside, moved up five wide mid turn, loomed a danger into the lane,
saw the winner get away in the final furlong but dug down to narrowly save the place. WHO KNOWS WHAT saved ground, moved up past mid stretch, kept
on with good energy but was edged for the place. SWIFT ACTION , off a bit slow, saved some ground while off the pace, edged up between runners near
the quarter pole, angled out but came up empty late. NYMPH drifted in at the break and steadied to be away last, rushed up between rivals soon after,
chased the winner two wide around the turn and weakened. FORTES , four wide outside rivals heading to the turn, gave chase between runners past the
five sixteenths and faded. UTTERLY ENCHANTING dropped off the early pace and failed to threaten. LA SAMANA LAURA stumbled at the break, rated
close four wide early on, lightly steadied nearing the turn and weakened. MISS REMMIA forced the early pace three wide between foes, failed to kick on mid
turn, faltered past the quarter pole and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET GAL hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, eased out to the two path at the head of the stretch, bid for the lead outside BAD TEMPER
inside the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. BAD TEMPER hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace with HARPER'S DO, disposed of that one on the far
turn, dug in tenaciously through the stretch and just missed. SHE'S A TRIPP , three wide both turns, challenged for the lead approaching the stretch then
tired. HEART LIGHT broke awkwardly, checked in tight quarters entering the far turn then finished willing. SALAGADOOLA stumbled leaving the starting
gate, was four deep on both turns, advanced approaching the stretch and weakened. VIOLET JESSOP , outrun, was four deep entering the stretch. BLESS
AND HONOR , no factor, fell back. HARPER'S DO dueled outside BAD TEMPER down the backstretch, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased.
