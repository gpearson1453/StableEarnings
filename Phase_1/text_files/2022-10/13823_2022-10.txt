speed, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and got up late for second. FIRE OF GOLD pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and
was caught late for second. ENDURING PEACE lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide gain, but was no real factor. PRINCESS
TRINA raced within contention, made a bid up the rail and hung. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY pressed the early pace and faded. SALACIOUSACUSATION void
of early speed and was never close. CLASSY AND FAST challenged on the front end in the beginning, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

GLORY TO ME stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the second turn, took command and was going away at the end.
COME WHAT MAE vied for the early advantage, took the lead, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner down the stretch, but
held on for second. OVERLY SWEET hopped at the start, racing in the rear, made a late wide gain and got up for show. BOSTON LUCILLE raced evenly
near the back in the early going, saved ground around the final turn, made a late bid and was outfinished for show. ST MARIA raced near the middle of the
pack, came around the first turn five wide and put forth an even effort. KATIE'S C challenged for the early lead and faded. DEVASTATING BEAUTY
pressed the early pace, saved ground and dropped back. SANDY'S WAGER void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
HONOR MY SPEED pressed the pace, took the lead down the backside, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. HUMPHREY void of
early speed, racing outside around the first turn, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TENSAS TODDY raced within
striking distance, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. TOUGH COMPANY raced near the middle of the pack, waited
around the final turn, blocked, found room to run, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. SILVER N LAI vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout and faded down the home stretch. CORVETTE SPIRIT challenged on the front end and was finished early. KING FORD raced evenly near the
back, came around the final turn on the outside and was never a threat. U COMPLETE ME raced in the middle of the field and retreated. GOBLER always
raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
GUITAR SLIM pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, moved up around the second turn, took the lead, pulled away and proved the best. PINCH
ASSAULT raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got by LIKE MIKE for second. LIKE MIKE
lacked early speed, moved up, made a bid, dueled and was outfinished for second. BAYOU JAM raced evenly near the back in the beginning, came around
the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MEDITATE raced in the middle of the pack in the early part, eased back, improved position
late, but was no threat. BINDING raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, finished wide and was never close. FORESTDUNGONE dueled on the front
end, drove clear, saved ground and faded. UNANIMOUSLY always raced near the back and showed little. CYPRIANO raced within contention and made a
steady retreat.
