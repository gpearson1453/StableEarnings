Footnotes
VARTON gained the lead soon after the start, widened to the first call, remained on a open lead into the lane, was under strong handling through the final
sixteenth while the lead diminished and held. CACTUS FLOWER chased the winner through the turn while in the two path, moved into the three path for the
drive, inched up on the top one to the wire and missed while second best. DESTINY'S DARLING raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane,
had aim for the drive and finished evenly. PREMIER WISH saved ground through the turn and lacked a closing bid. PISTOL was never a factor while in the
three path through the turn. MY MY MUNNY was never a menace while in the four path through the turn.

Footnotes
LITURGIA hustled up to chase the pacesetter through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, raced three abreast near the eighth pole, continued with two
others approaching the sixteenth pole then edged away and widened. HAPPYSECRET chased the pace through the turn while in the two path, bid two wide
and between rivals into the lane, continued to duel with two others while brushing with inside rival just past the eighth pole then could not keep up with the
winner while settling for second best. JULIA'S CHARDONNAY set the pace through the turn while near the inside, dueled with the top two through
mid-stretch, brushed after the eighth pole and yielded. BELLE ELENA was close up early then settled back to chase the pace while saving ground, came off
the rail for the drive and turned in an even effort on debut. LILY'S HOME raced evenly throughout while in the two path. THIS IS ANFIELD was bumped at
the start, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and never factored. BEVERLY DREAMING was outrun while in the two path through the
turn. CLOVERTOWNE steadily faded while in the four path through the turn.

LOUDER THAN WORDS raced along the inside through the far turn, waited behind the pacesetter from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, found space to
the inside, quickly gained momentum to moved to the lead then was all out to the wire when others were closing in. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was four wide
through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path then gained momentum through the final sixteenth to be closing in to the wire.
SKIPPINJUSTICE was unhurried while just off the inside through the far turn, straightened in the lane from the four path, guided to the seven path and
finished with good energy. STORMY WAGER set the pace along the inside into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go but could not keep up. MAMALA
KAMALA raced in the three or four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. JUST HUMMING steadily lost
ground through the far turn and into the lane, angled to the five path after straightening in the lane and showed a belated gain and was subsequently
vanned off. PRESCIENCE chased the pace from the three path through the turn then faded after entering the lane. STARLET EXPRESS chased the pace
from the two path through the turn and was empty. TOO CROWDED lacked a response through the lane.

Footnotes
FASHION DIVA vied for the lead two wide down the backstretch, cleared after entering the far turn, continued on a clear lead while moving closer to the
inside then held. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH chase the pace from the two path into the far turn, moved closest to the winner in mid-turn then chased that one
home while clearly second best. MAKE OVER was in the two path through the turns when never far back, was no match for the top two through the lane
while staying on and gaining the show spot late. KISSES SO SWEET was in the three path through the turns when moving to contention, lacked a response
in the lane and lost the show place late. TIZ ABBY raced in the three path through the turns and never was a threat. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT never a
menace while saving ground. CATCHAFALLNSTAR trailed through the turn while off the rail, came into the lane from the six path and passed tired ones.
WEST COAST JUSTICE bothered at the start, raced near the inside through the turns and never factored. SWIFT RITHMS pressed the pace along the
inside into the fare turn then retreated. WILADENE raced in the three path through the turns and was empty in late turn. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

EPIMYTHIUM raced near the rail into the far turn, shuffled in mid-turn, came into the lane from the two path, gained momentum after straightening and ran
down the leader through the final sixteenth. FIREWATER JAKE chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, tipped into the three path into the
lane, rallied for the lead with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe late while well clear of the others. LORD REVELSTOKE was unhurried
while off the inside, angled into the seven path into the lane and moved up while not a threat to the top two. EVIL EYE raced in the three or four path
through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and lacked a closing bid. TIZ OUR TURN pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, led
into the lane then weakened after straightening. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME raced in mid-pack while in the three or four path and lacked a response. FLY

the three path, was still a serious threat in late far turn and tired in the lane. CALIFORNIA SWING outrun while in the three path through the turns. CLEAR
