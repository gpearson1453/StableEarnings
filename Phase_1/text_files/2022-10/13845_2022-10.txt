Footnotes
TIZ A PRINCE bore in leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path leaving the far turn, gained the lead in
upper stretch, was challenged inside the eighth pole, dueled inside PRINCE OF CAPS and narrowly prevailed. PRINCE OF CAPS , pinched back leaving
the starting gate, was four deep leaving the far turn, bid for the lead approaching the sixteenth pole, dueled and missed by a bob of the nose.
UNORTHODOX , four wide the first turn, trailed to the far turn, was very wide leaving the final bend and rallied outside foes. MARYLAND PRIDE , inside
horses down the backstretch, steadied lacking room near the three eighths pole, steadied in ttaffic in mid stretch, altered course to the outside and finished
gamely. HIGH PRINT , four wide the first turn, advanced three wide leaving the far turn and flattened out the final furlong. STRAIGHT UP GUY , outside
horses in the stretch, passed tired ones. OUR SWEET PEA , a forward factor along the inner rail, gave way through the stretch. BADGER TOOTH , caught
in close quarters leaving the starting gate, was no factor. STREET LAMP gave way. VINNY set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
ESPERANNNA , bumped at the break and in a bit tight, pulled her way to contention outside a rival then went clear in hand five furlongs out, set a rated
pace around the turn, responded and increased her lead when roused three wide heading to the three sixteenths, switched over to her left lead while well in
front and coasted home through the final seventy yards. LUCKY LORRAINE saved ground while well back early, remained inside for the drive, gathered
momentum past the three sixteenths and finished with good energy to gain the place. MARTHARITA , two wide and to the inside of a rival early, edged up
between runners mid turn, altered outside a foe in upper stretch, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds, flattened out late and was out kicked for the
place. DIA DE SOL , four wide, circled under pressure into the lane and faded. BAD TEMPER sped up to the inside early on and stalked the pace, angled
out into the turn, gave hard chase three wide and weakened. SHE'S A TRIPP , three wide, was hustled along around the turn and gave way. HARPER'S DO
, bumped with the winner at the break, rushed up and cleared leaving the chute, was overtaken heading to the five eighths, stayed on to pursue a bit around
the turn then faltered. BLESS AND HONOR , rank at the break and away slowly, stumbled badly soon after and was outrun.

Footnotes
JOHNNYFRENCHFRI broke sharply and cleared soon after the break while off the inside, was joined from his inside near the three quarter pole and sparred
briefly with HOME SCHOOL, kicked away from that one heading to the far turn, was coaxed along two wide into the lane, kept on under right handed asking
through the final furlong and turned away ROTTERDAM. ROTTERDAM rated kindly while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn and advanced
between foes, moved up and was in closest pursuit of the winner while three wide into the lane, offered a game grinding run to steadily bridge the gap but
was kept at bay through the final yards. HOME SCHOOL rushed up early and bid inside the winner nearing the six furlong marker, vied for a sixteenth
before backing off, chased while saving ground into the lane and faded. OVER THE BORDER settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the
drive but lacked a serious kick. LONGWORTH , off the pace, came four wide into the lane but failed to menace. DUKE OF DOOLY hopped at the break,
regrouped and moved up outside a rival to chase, failed to kick on leaving the half mile marker and retreated.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF JERICHO rated kindly three wide and outside a rival early on, responded to coaxing and moved to the attack nearing the quarter pole, wrested
command from LANDON JACK entering the lane then kicked away in emphatic fashion while kept to a strong drive to deep stretch. FEELING WOOZY , four
wide between runners nearing the half mile marker, circled five wide under a ride entering the lane, straightened away and leveled off nicely through the
final furlong to earn the place. SPINZAR rated between rivals nearing the turn, angled four wide to make progress into the stretch, kept on between horses
leaving mid stretch and continued on with interest. GENERAL NOOZ hopped slightly at the break, regrouped and was taken five wide outside rivals, rushed
up under urging to advance into the turn, shifted in to be about three wide pursuing past the five sixteenths, raced between runners in mid stretch, shifted in
while on his left lead and gave way grudgingly. LANDON JACK cleared in the initial strides, set the pace towards rail, was confronted by the winner after a
half mile, dueled briefly then faded in the final furlong. MCMAGIC , off the pace and three wide mid turn, swung six wide for the drive and offered a mild kick.
SNEAKING SUSPICION broke a bit slowly, edged up inside soon after, eased back behind a rival leaving the three eighths, angled out but needed more.
BORUFF chased two wide and weakened. BILLYKUS moved up soon after the break and took a stalking spot, failed to kick on under pressure past the five
sixteenths and retreated. SAGE RUNNER was steadied at the break, dropped well back, swung seven wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten.

GASTOWN BABE hit the outside of her starting gate stall at the break, was in hand between horses entering the turn, worked between rivals in the stretch
and was up approaching the finish. FRENCH KISSING , shuffled back soon after the start, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path in the stretch
and rallied between horses. QUEEN SHEBA saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, hugged the inner rail in the stretch, gained the lead near the
sixteenth pole then weakened late. BLAZING STAR (GB) , four deep turning for home, failed to rally in an even effort. EIFS lacked speed, raced between
horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. FAST LANI sped to the front, set the pace off the rail, weakened and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. R B'S
STAR , well off the inner rail chasing the pace, gave way the final furlong. AWESOME JAZZ , five wide on the turn, was not a factor. MISPELLED MOOON ,
four wide on the turn, gave way. LA SAMANA LAURA gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE , taken wide early, edged up outside rivals while under a light hold around the far turn, took closer order without much insistence then went
after the leader approaching the stretch, took command soon after, responded to stout encouragement and pulled away to be much the best. ANTIPOISON
, in tight at the start, recovered and was taken five wide to advance, poked a head in front heading to the six furlong marker, cleared into the turn and set the
pace three wide, failed to resist the winner past the quarter pole, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. LOST MY VOWCHER , unprepared at the break
and was away a few lengths behind the field, settled well back, angled five wide for the drive and churned on. GHOST STALKER saved ground, angled four
wide between foes into the lane but lacked a solid bid. IT'S GAME TIME , between foes nearing the half, steadied briefly off heels nearing the three eighths
and faded. MONYINTHEBANKSEY stalked three wide, failed to kick on approaching the stretch and tired. KRACHENWAGEN sped to the early lead while
saving ground, ceded command past the three quarter pole, gave futile pursuit past the three eighths and faltered. ONE TWO KID saved ground, faltered
nearing the stretch, eased when distanced and walked off.

Footnotes
SINGALONG worked between horses on the far turn, eased outside in upper stretch, took command outside BALI KUTA in mid stretch and drew clear. BALI
KUTA , quickly clear, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in mid stretch and gamely held the place. CANDLESTICK MAKER raced inside horses
around the far turn, eased outside in upper stretch and had a slight rally. LIKE N' EAGLE lacked speed, was four wide turning for home, raced between
horses in the drive and passed tired ones. TIME GOES FAST stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, was well placed three deep on the far
turn and weakened in the drive. CHASING ARTEMIS was not a factor. AMARETTO SOUR , four wide the first turn, drifted six wide leaving the far turn and
was no factor. EMERALD LACE , two wide down the backstretch and on the far turn, chased the pace and gave way. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT hopped at the
break and was outrun. SEARCH hugged the inner rail, raced forwardly to the far turn, faltered and was eased.
