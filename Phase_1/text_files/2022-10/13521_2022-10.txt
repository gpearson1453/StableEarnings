Footnotes
HELEONORTIZ dueled from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, kicked clear while racing in the two path around the far turn and drew
off in the lane. MERCURY TEN raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, came around the second
turn still in the two path and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the winner. SO THERE hopped up leaving the gate, saved ground around the
first turn, tracked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch
while finishing evenly. ARE YOU HAPPY chased the leaders from the four path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path and
flattened out in the lane. RAYO NEGRO saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing on the
rail around the second bend and continued to fade in the stretch. ELLAROUGE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders between
horses up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the far turn and tired from there.

Footnotes
STALKING off the pace at the start, moved up around the first turn from the four path, very keen to run on leaving the first turn, dragged himself into perfect
position, shifted inside foe clear running room nearing the three eighths pole, quickly went past the pace setter, shook off outside foe nearing the furlong
marker, went clear late. VIOLENT PASS tracked the leader from the outside, nice placing just off the pace and clear down the backside, queued up from the
three path around the second turn, moved past pace setter nicely, could not match strides with inside rival, finished willingly through the wire. NIANGUA
raced off the pace and along the inside, saved all the ground into far turn, moved up late for the show money. CODE NAME BRODY slow to start, raced off
the pace and five wide down the back stretch, asked from the outside into far turn, outrun through the wire. SHIELD OF FAITH nice early speed away from
the gate, controlled the tempo into the far turn, collard leaving the three eighths pole, had no answer for top pair, faded through the lane.

Footnotes
PICTURE THIS led the way between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to
the wire. GUAPONESS pressed the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, dueled from the three path around the turn, could not go with the
winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. HALF BROTHER raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path
and improved position mildly in the final furlong. RENEWING VOWS brushed with the horse to his outside at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. SECRET ADDICTION raced in the middle of the pack in the opening stages,
navigated the turn from the three path and was empty in the stretch. WHISKEY MISCHIEF brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off
the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. SERGEANT WILD BILL dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to
drop back while saving ground around the turn, fell near the eighth pole and was vanned off. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE
STRETCH. NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DRAMA'S PRAYER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole
and kicked clear in the stretch. MR. CASH dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground
around the turn, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival home. LILTONYTWOPHONES tracked the front runners up the
backstretch, began a five wide bid coming around the turn and kept on in the lane. GUTHRIE HALL raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, saved
ground around the turn and finished evenly. EXAGGERATEDDEFENCE dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path
around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. JOE BRAINS raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in
the two path and was empty from there. IMPERIAL JET trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a threat.
JAKE'S A WINNER raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. YARDMAN raced off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was never a factor.

GRAN RUNNER raced off the pace early, four wide move around the turn, shifted out six, seven wide through the stretch, all out drive under the wire.
CHIEF RON slow into stride, raced off the pace while in the three path into the turn, shifted out quickly leaving the quarter pole, between runners through
the stretch, gaining good ground late. DEFEND early speed, controlling tempo around the turn, came under heavy outside pressure leaving the quarter pole,
drifted out in deep stretch bumping rival to his outside, willing late. GOLDEN JUAN clean start from the outside post, tracked the leader into the turn, sent to
the attack nearing the quarter pole, checked between runners in deep stretch, finished even through the wire. QUICK TEMPO raced just off the early pace,
saved ground around the turn, could not stay with outside foes, no late gain. CAERUS slow into stride, never a threat. There was a riders objection in this
race, rider of GOLDEN JUAN claimed foul against the riders of the CHIEF RON AND DEFEND, the stewards ruled that DEFEND drifted out during the
stretch run interfering with GOLDEN JUAN, and disqualified DEFEND from third and placed him fourth.

Footnotes
CLASSY NANCY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the
far turn and drew off down the stretch. LOUISE BROOKS raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the
outside, improved position while racing in the two path around the second bend and chased the winner to the wire, no match for that rival. PHARIBE raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and kept on in the lane. ELLIE
DELI raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, led the way while saving ground around the far turn and
weakened in the final furlong. ONE CLEAR MOMENT saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the
three path and improved position in late stretch. ARROGANTE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from
the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. X Y LADY dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the second bend and tired further in the stretch. EXCLUSIVE CHAMPION raced in the three
path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded in the lane.
SHAYMYNAME raced in the five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, raced in the two path around
the far turn and was empty in the stretch. TOUGH GAME saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and was not a factor from there.

Footnotes
AWESOME BIRDIE sent away with a purpose, found what she wanted clear running room into the turn, solo leader leaving the quarter pole, kept to task
through the wire. STYLE broke behind the field , raced well off the pace into turn, shifted out four wide around the turn, moved out seven wide top of the
lane, steadily picking off opponents through the stretch. MURUMBI raced off the early pace, moved up between runners into the turn, under a constant ride,
moved up nearing the quarter pole, shifted inside nearing the furlong marker, tried through the wire. PRACTICALLY THERE tracked the leaders early, nice
three wide move around the turn, could not keep pace with top flight finished even late. AKEMI always in range of the leader, moved up nearing the quarter
pole, shifted outside for clear run, faded through the stretch. ILLUSION OF HOPE raced off the early pace, moved up into the turn along the inside, split
rivals nearing the quarter pole, had no late kick. JOE MIKE JIM raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, no late kick. GORMAN clean start,
nice inside tracking position into the turn, outrun through the stretch. ROSY APPLE off slowly, never threatened.
