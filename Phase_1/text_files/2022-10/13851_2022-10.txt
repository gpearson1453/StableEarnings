Footnotes
CLARA BELLE raced well off the pace on the outside through the opening lap, began to improve position on the second lap, launched a proper bid a half
mile from the finish and pulled clear in the lane. HAIL TO THE CHIEF raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the two and three paths and gained ground late to grab second. BRAVE DEACON chased the leader through the opening lap, moved up to challenge
the second time around, dueled up the backstretch and around the last turn and was outkicked by the winner. HERO'S RETURN raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside, saved ground throughout and finished evenly. THOMOND PARK raced off the pace on the outside early, angled in to race on the rail for
lap two and never threatened. TWENTYONEGUNS led the way through the opening mile, dueled on the inside the second time around and faded entering
the stretch for the final time. ROYALE stalked the pace setter in the early going, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack from there and flattened out
further in the lane. PULL RANK raced off the pace between horses the majority of the race, was pulled up before the last fence, crossed the wire and
walked off. SHAOLIN trailed the field on the outside throughout, was pulled up approaching fence nine and was walked off.

Footnotes
SORAMOND (GER) opened up a commanding early lead the first time by, continued to show the way up the backstretch, stumbled and nearly unseated his
rider at jump six, recovered and continued to expand his lead from there, in command throughout. SHAKA chased the leader well clear of the rest of the
field through the opening mile, turned back a challenge for second half a mile out and kept on to the wire, no match for the winner but the best of the rest.
CRITICIZE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, moved up to make a bid approaching the half mile pole and was outkicked in
the lane. HARD GAME raced far back in the middle of the pack on the inside and finished evenly. PLEASECALLMEBACK raced at the back of the pack on
the outside and made no bid. JUMP SHIP trailed the field on the inside the entire way around the oval and was eased in the stretch. SEB'S WELCOME (FR)
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening lap, fell approaching fence eight and walked off.
