Footnotes
DRAKON , rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out turning for home, swept to command outside CROSSLAND near the eighth pole then
drew out. CROSSLAND set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. DYNA MAST worked between horses and rallied mildly. CASAMO prompted
the pace outside CROSSLAND and weakened. SEE OUT stalked the pace, waited for room in upper stretch then lacked the needed response. HANFORD ,
three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. FROG PRINCE , no factor, was very wide entering the stretch. HENDERSON , between horses the
far turn, lacked a rally. PHOTO COPY , wide the far turn, weakened. ICANDOTHAT , four wide entering the first turn, was outrun. NATTY BIRD , outrun,
unseated his rider when ducking out to avoid the spill past the finish. HOOKY PLAYER worked between horses on the far turn, eased out a bit in mid
stretch, moved up to second but fell near the finish when sustaining a catastrophic injury and was euthanized on the track. There was a stewards' inquiry
concerning the incident near the finish but no action was taken.

Footnotes
GERRYS GEM , away in good order, moved up to the inside of rivals early on and contested the pace, went clear past the five eighths and set a rated pace
towards the rail, kept on under right handed asking past mid stretch, wandered outward and held sway. HEADS OR TAILS , with the early pace three deep,
dropped in nearing the half mile pole and stalked, eased out with run heading towards the lane, gave hard chase from upper stretch, floated out and steadily
gained. STONE COURAGEOUS bobbled at the break, lagged off the pace while saving ground, stayed inside for the drive and closed willingly.
JASONTAKESLONG stumbled at the break, recovered and went to the early lead, was headed from his inside nearing the five eighths, prompted the pace
outside the winner, failed to kick on under pressure past the five sixteenths and gave way. CAPTAIN CARDO was outrun.

Footnotes
THAT'S SOME KISS broke slowly, recovered and pulled her way forward to the inside of rivals and joined BLOCK PARTY for the lead near the five eighths,
took command heading to the half then went clear leaving the far turn, set a rated pace around the turn, responded when shaken up entering the lane,
remained on her left lead and steadily widened while kept to task. BLOCK PARTY was sent clear early and dropped in to about the two path, was engaged
from her inside by the winner near the five eighths, ceded the lead then gave hard chase around the turn, was under a hustling ride from the quarter pole
and stayed on willingly to hold down the place. COFFEE BEAN stalked inside early on, dropped back a bit after a half, shifted out three wide for the drive
and churned on and saved the show. FASHIONISTA , shuffled back soon after the break, lost ground when edged up four wide past the three eighths,
remained outside for the drive and closed steadily. LUNAR ICE drifted out a bit at the break and bumped with a rival, edged up behind foes to stalk,
steadied when in a bit close entering the turn, chased inside a rival mid turn and faded. POET IN MY HEART stumbled at the break and was bumped,
regrouped and moved up outside foes and chased four wide, failed to kick on under pressure after a half mile and retreated. MAKO MISS , bumped at the
start, was outrun.

Footnotes
TAM CHAR edged up early then bid inside rivals past the five eighths, dueled inside a pair of runners around the turn, emerged in a tussle with ICY REPLY
in upper stretch, gained a short advantage a furlong out and held tenaciously under a drive. ICY REPLY had speed to contest the pace, dueled between
runners from the half mile marker, held a slim lead into the lane, was headed nearing mid stretch, fought gamely outside the winner from there and just
missed in a sharp effort. MERAVIGLIOSO broke slowly, was taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, continued towards the rail into the lane and
rallied. ESPERANNNA broke a step slow, edged up outside rivals early and bid three deep, dueled three deep around the turn, failed to go on with the
leaders past the three sixteenths and faded. BOSS ANGEL chased inside rivals mid turn, angled out three to four wide but failed to seriously follow through.
GREAT BARONESS , bumped at the break, raced three wide nearing the turn, chased between foes mid turn, angled four to five wide for the drive but
came up empty. BELLA BETTINA , four wide outside foes around the turn, shifted six wide for the drive but lacked a bid. FOUL BALLS , bumped at the
break, rated behind foes, angled very wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. POLISH COOKIE , bumped at the start, raced two wide and faded.

Footnotes
BANDITS WARRIOR quickly went clear, dropped in and set a rated pace, responded when roused soon into the lane, opened up under a solid drive in mid
stretch then continued to widen while kept to solid hand pressure the final sixteenth. NO MORE MASK rated forwardly and inside rivals early on, eased back
leaving the far turn then dropped back to last, swung extremely wide in upper stretch, straightened and came back on with good energy to nab the place.
MERCURY HEAD stalked the pace, was under coaxing past the three eighths, slipped through along the rail to make progress in mid stretch then flattened
out late. BUCKEY'S CHARM , in tight between rivals leaving the five eighths, angled five wide entering the lane but lacked a solid response.
FACTORINTHEHEAT , bumped at the break, lost ground four wide, was under pressure around the turn and faded. JESTER CALLS NOJOY , awkwardly
away and towards the inside, bumped with a rival then steadied, regrouped to advanced four wide outside foes heading to the half mile marker, stalked the
winner mid turn, failed to kick on under asking past mid stretch and faded.
