Footnotes
AIR FORCE RED sprinted clear early and moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, inched away around that bend and into the stretch, urged left
handed through the final furlong and stayed clear to the wire. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) sat off the pace along the inside, coaxed through the far turn while
staying on the rail, moved off the fence in the drive and finished determinedly but could not reach the winner. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) settled along the
inside early, moved off the rail on the far turn and came three wide into the stretch, kept on through the lane and outkicked CARMELITA'S MAN for third.
CARMELITA'S MAN dropped back and trailed early on the rail, continued at the back inside to two wide on the far turn, showed a mild response along the
fence in the drive but got outkicked for the show honors. LAMBEAU was closest in pursuit a bit off the rail early, rounded the far turn in the two path and
flattened in the late stages. MR. IMPOSSIBLE sat off the pace early on, traveled two wide then three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN AGAIN stumbled badly leaving the gate but still came away with the rest, traveled in range two wide into the turn, angled to the rail then tipped
back out and took aim at NIGHT PARTY in the two path leaving the bend, engaged that rival from outside at the eight pole, took over soon after and
powered clear under right handed urging and steady handling. NIGHT PARTY away quickly in the beginning then drifted out and back in while tossing his
head when corrected but still remained in front, showed the way into and around the turn along the inside, challenged by GOLDEN AGAIN with a furlong left
to run, failed to offer much resistance and relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on to hold the place. TIME TOGETHER stalked outside a rival up the
backstretch, traveled three wide around the turn, bid three deep in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR broke well then
tracked from inside out of range into the turn, steered out in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. WINK WISH AND PARK stumbled leaving the gate and
dropped back to last, passed a rival into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. SWEET HELLO got bumped from inside early then
raced up close outside the pacesetter early on, started to weaken around the bend and shifted three wide nearing the stretch and had little left for the drive.
ONLY LIGHTNING drifted out and bumped rival early, took an awkward step nearing the nine-sixteenths pole then drifted out on the backstretch, went three
wide into the turn, angled down to the inside while trailing around the bend and tired in the lane.

GOING GLOBAL (IRE) stalked the leader in the two path then moved inside, bid between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, took over late on the far turn,
put away BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) in upper stretch and held safely under steady handling. ENGLAND'S ROSE was off slow to begin, sat off the pace in the
two path around the first turn, angled to the rail on the second bend, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly but had to settle for second best.
KARAKATSIE forwardly placed three then two wide early, pushed on while three deep around the far turn but could not keep pace past the quarter pole,
continued to keep trying through the lane and was able to regain the show. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) stepped to the front quickly and set the pace on the
inside, led clear into the far turn, pressured midway around the bend, headed at the quarter pole and lost command shortly after, then weakened along the
fence in the stretch. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) stalked a bit off the rail early, moved out on the backstretch, angled outside the top trio on the far turn but
weakened in the stretch run. COVER VERSION broke a step slow, trailed along the rail on both turns and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT NO CHASER veered in leaving the gate then went up to clear the field from inside, set all the pace to the stretch and remained clear under mild
urging to the wire. TRAEGAR was closest in pursuit from the two path into and around the turn, chased the winner willingly through the lane but failed to find
the needed late kick. ALBIZU tracked off the rail outside a rival, took the turn two wide, swung out into the stretch and rallied for the show. LOVESICK
BLUES settled off the pace, traveled four deep around the turn and into the stretch, could not summon the needed rally and got edged for the show.
REDLINE settled early then moved into range in the two path, found the rail on the turn and saved ground to the stretch but lacked a bid when asked right
handed in the drive. SAFFA'S DAY chased three deep around the turn and weakened. JOKER BOY jumped a shadow early and dropped back, trailed wide
then angled in nearing the turn, saved ground around the bend, moved off the fence in upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FIRST PEACE sped clear and moved inside, challenged at the three-eighths pole, disposed of that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, drew away in upper
stretch and held safely under a drive. EASTBOUND was off slow to begin, sat outside a rival in the two path early on, angled four wide 2nd, rallied through
the lane but could not reach the winner. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) broke a step slow, settled inside, split foes at the quarter pole, tipped out upper stretch
and gained the show. VALIANCER stalked between and bumped into the first turn, was closest pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside the leader into the far
turn, failed to sustain the challenge past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. MUCINO was off slow in the beginning,
moved inside while at the back, trailed into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. ZIO JO got bumped while chasing four deep
into the first turn, entered the far turn three deep, stayed off the rail into the drive and weakened. GLENDALE stalked the pace on the inside, lost ground
around the far turn and faded. THE SLAP got bumped chasing three deep into the first turn, raced between foes into the far turn, dropped back around the
bend and tired.

CAST MEMBER pressed three deep up the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn and took aim two wide into the stretch, steered out at the top of the
lane, engaged the leader past the eight pole and edged away. CHOLLY stalked on the inside into the turn, coaxed along past the five-sixteenths pole,
launched a bid inside the top pair midstretch and got up for second. FUN MONEY came away well and pressed SELL THE DREAM from inside early,
moved up onto even terms and took over past the half-mile pole, drew clear around the bend, shifted out at the top of the lane, met challengers from both
sides in the final furlong, clung to a short lead with a sixteenth remaining and yielded late. SELL THE DREAM sped to the front and led early while under
pressure from both sides, was overtaken by FUN MONEY past the half-mile pole, pressed that rival to the five-sixteenths pole then failed to keep up nearing
the quarter pole, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. BIG CELEBRATION stumbled badly leaving the gate, chased wide up the backstretch,
went five wide into the turn, entered the lane three deep and weakened.

Footnotes
CABO SPIRIT bumped with outer rival at the start, reserved in the early going on the inside, moved into range in the middle stages, waited for an opening
past the quarter pole, steered out and rallied four deep to drive past SPEAKING SCOUT in the closing moments. SPEAKING SCOUT broke a step slow
from outside, stalked outside a rival in the early going, traveled three wide around the far turn, bid three deep into the stretch, took over past the eight pole
but was run down by CABO SPIRIT nearing the wire. PERFECT FLIGHT pressed the pace from outside while in hand, dueled around the far turn, bumped
at the top of the stretch, fought between rivals to the sixteenth pole, could not match strides late but was able to hold on for the show. GO JOE WON set the
pace under pressure on the inside, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, clung to a narrow lead with furlong remaining, lost command in
midstretch and got edged for the show honors. HANDY DANDY stalked the pace from inside, lacked room and steadied into the stretch, moved off the rail
but lacked room again with a sixteenth to go, altered out and kept on between rivals to share a minor award. DEGREE OF RISK settled in the two path,
moved out three deep on the backstretch, moved closer while tipping four wide but lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong. STAYINCOTAI (IRE)
broke slow and bumped with inner rival, raced two wide outside a rival at the back, roused around the second bend, angled out in the stretch and failed to
threaten. SEVEN WONDERS scrambled leaving the gate, unhurried early on from inside, saved ground through the far turn, paused behind a rival into the
stretch then moved out, could not summon the needed rally and lost his path late.

drove clear. CONNIE SWINGLE broke out and bumped rival, pressed inside then chased the leader into the turn, re-engaged from outside at the half-mile
pole, took over entering the stretch, maintained a short lead into deep stretch but was run down by the winner. LADY JAE bumped both sides leaving the
gate, dropped back off the pace, went two wide into the turn, eased out around the bend, put in a late run and missed second. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE)
bumped inner rival at the start, brushed the rail early on the turn, kept on near the inside the tipped out to go between rivals late and earn a minor award.
AQUA SEAFORM SHAME set the pace outside a rival early then moved clear, met the challenge from CONNIE SWINGLE at the half-mile pole, lost
command entering the stretch, fought back from inside to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. FREEDOM FLYER steadied behind a rival on the inside early
on the turn, came off the rail into the lane, drifted in upper stretch, steered back out and needed to find more late. LEXINGTON HUMOR stalked along the
inside then two wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. STELLA NOIR was off a bit slow to begin, raced three wide into the turn off the pace, came out
crossing the dirt and failed to menace. ACT OF SERENDIPITY got sandwiched between rivals and had to take up at the start, trailed inside then moved off
the rail and never got involved. SHE'S SO NICE (IRE) stalked three wide early, came five wide into the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
RHEA MOON (IRE) chased three deep into the first turn then had to check off heels, raced outside a rival off the pace up the backstretch, closed in while
angling five wide on the far turn, tipped out further in the drive and rallied five deep, then drew clear in the final sixteenth. NADETTE (FR) was off a bit slow
to begin, trailed on the inside into the first turn, went between rivals at the quarter pole then tipped four wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane
and closed well to get up for second. KITTY KITANA (GB) forwardly placed four deep on the first turn, stalked outside a rival in the middle stages, launched
a bid four wide into the stretch, took over past the eighth pole but was no match for the top pair late. GIMME MO BABY keen early under a hold, went three
deep around the first turn, traveled in mid-pack outside rivals into the second bend, angled out while commencing a rally and entered the lane five wide but
failed to find the needed late kick in deep stretch. CAIRO MEMORIES pressed the pace from outside in the early stages, moved up to take control with three
furlongs remaining, led three wide into the drive, was overtaken past the eighth pole and flattened in the final sixteenth. PAMMY'S READY rated on the
inside in the early going, tipped two on the far turn, lost her path in upper stretch, tipped out and could not regain momentum. LADY CLEMENTINE (GB)
broke a step slow, pulled on the first turn in the two path, traveled between rivals in mid-pack, came three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. TEZZARAY
(GB) broke well then settled on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, found traffic in the lane and could not threaten late. HELENS WELL (IRE) shifted
out briefly at the start, lost her path and had to take up soon after, was reserved near the back in the two path, traveled three deep at the quarter pole then
moved out and came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) pulled in the early going while taking command and crossed to the
inside, set the pace under pressure still under a hold up the backstretch, lost command at the three-eighths pole, fought back along the rail to the stretch
and weakened in the final furlong. GRACELUND GRAY broke a step slow, checked soon after, pulled near the back early on, came two wide into the stretch
and never threatened.
