wide turning for home, was gaining ground and was second best. EXCITING chased the pace while inside into the turn, made a bid to mid stretch but came
up empty in late stretch. SMOOTHEE LEE raced three wide into the turn then made a bid but was no menace in the stretch drive. MAXI MOON was saving
ground into the turn then made a bid but came up empty in the drive. TROY OUNCE chased the early pace while two wide, was hard used then gave way.
LARCH was two wide on the turn and no factor.
