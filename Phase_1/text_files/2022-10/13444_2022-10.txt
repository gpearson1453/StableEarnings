Footnotes
HEY BOSS lagged behind the field into the far turn, picked up stride while saving ground turning for home, offered a rail rally through the lane to take aim on
an outer clear THACH in the final furlong, and reached that foe nearing the wire. THACH took a bump from an outer rival in the opening stages, stalked the
leader from the outside, vied around the far turn, drove clear in upper stretch, but was caught by a rail rallying rival in the final sixteenth. ON SPOT broke in
and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, sparred with a bidding THACH around the far turn, but gave way to that foe in upper stretch,
and weakened. GO VIRTUAL broke a step slowly while leaning out at the start, tracked four wide and outside of rivals, then three wide entering the
backstretch, moved forward to stalk the top par nearing the far turn, but required urging to keep pace into that bend, yielded to the top pair with three
furlongs to go, and kept on through the lane. COMMAND CENTRAL bumped an inner rival soon after the start, tracked three wide and between horses
around the first turn, but failed to sustain that position nearing the backstretch, raced off of the pace in the four path around the far turn, and failed to make
an impact. LITTLE RED RIFLE hopped slightly before being bumped and crowded by rivals on either side at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path,
then two wide and between horses turning for home, and failed to factor. BIG PETE bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but faded
around the far turn.

Footnotes
MINUTE WALTZ prompted the pace three wide, sparred while bidding turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off under heavy
hand urging. SHANIAH tracked along the inside, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. IN MY OPINION
broke a step slowly, tracked while outside of SHANIAH around the bend, got floated to the five path by that foe in upper stretch, then surpassed tiring inner
foes in the final sixteenth. COMEDY ACT set the early pace along the inside, dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals turning for home, proved no match
for her outermost foe entering the lane, then gave way through the late stages. ICY RIVER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, around the turn,
but was outkicked by her outer counterpart in upper stretch, and yielded between foes through the final furlong. SHELL SHOCK popped open the starting
gate pre-race without leaving, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CUPIDS PAYDAY pressed two wide, took aim in the three path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds as an
inner rival presented a challenge, and held sway from that foe thereafter. UNKEPT SECRET laid off of pace three wide while between horses, commenced
a gain two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, tucked to the rail entering the lane, then sustained a rail rally to attempt a bid inside of a newly
leading CUPIDS PAYDAY, but was kept at bay by that foe through the late stages. TENACIOUS LADY stalked two wide, tipped three wide and outside of
the top pair at the half mile pole, pursued those rivals before floating to the four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leaders evenly
through the drive, then just saved show from an outer oncharging rival late. GRAY FROST acted up in the paddock, laid off of the pace along the inside,
vacated the inside turning for home before swinging to the five path entering the lane, then offered a belated surge outside of foes in the closing stages, but
just missed show. MS HAYLEY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, yielded while getting floated to the four path at the five sixteenths pole,
then sustained stride to surpass tiring rivals in the final furlong. FABULOSITY set the pace inside of the pressing eventual winner, shifted to the two path
while holding a margin entering the lane, but weakened between horses approaching the final furlong. FLY CONDOR raced off of the pace four to three
wide, then tired on his left lead. LONG BLACK VEIL chased along the inside, and weakened. TWELVE SHARP hopped a bit before being brushed by an
inner rival at the start, was void of early speed in the four to three path, tucked to the rail turning for home, and made little impact. CHIPMUNK dropped his
rider leaving the tunnel without being released by his handler, then broke out, chased three wide, felt a right handed crop while getting floated four wide at
the half mile pole, then weakened five wide entering the turn. ROYAL BELLE failed to keep pace with the rest of the field in the early stages despite strong
rider encouragement, and showed little.

Footnotes
MEAN MACHINE trailed in the three path, picked up stride turning for home, shifted inside of the leaders in midstretch, and sustained his charge along the
rail to drive past them inside the final sixteenth. RUNWAY MAGIC set the pace inside of a vying rival, drew clear of that foe at the three furlong pole, shifted
to the three path entering the lane as an outer AMERICAN PURE loomed a danger, held sway from that drifting foe through midstretch, but was caught by
an inner rallying rival nearing the wire. AMERICAN PURE broke a step slowly, pursued two wide, stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail into the
turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane to take aim outside of the leader, but failed to gain in upper stretch before lugging inside of that foe at the
furlong grounds, then was outkicked for place by an inner rival in the final sixteenth. EL FRANCO tracked four wide, pursued to the leading pair from the four
path turning for home before being floated to the five path entering the lane, then chased them before yielding in the final furlong. UNDECODED raced
forwardly three wide and between horses, but yielded at the three furlong pole. TACHLIS sparred for the lead with an inner RUNWAY MAGIC nearing the
turn, but weakened with three furlongs remaining. WEST WARPATH acted up in the gate while awaiting the start, tracked along the inside, but faded around
the turn.

Footnotes
TAPIT'S CONQUEST got bumped by a rank inner rival while in the six path into the first turn, vied with that foe while in the four to three path around that
bend, backed off to stalk three wide after an inner rival joined the fore at the three quarter pole, loomed a danger outside of them entering the far turn,
assumed command nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, then held sway while wandering about a bit through
the final furlong. PYRENEES laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, came under a drive while floated back to the four path at the
three furlong pole, inched closer while fanning to the six path entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes to gain place at the furlong grounds while having
many lengths to find on the leader, and proved second best. ESCAPOLOGIST rated at the rear two wide, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and
stayed on outside of foes in the final furlong to reach show at the wire. PRAIRIE DUNES broke a beat slowly, saved ground off of the pace, shifted from the
four path to the six path in upper stretch while inside of ESCAPOLOGIST, then stayed on with that foe through the final furlong to improve position late.
MAGNIFICENT MILE broke a step slowly while being bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack in the three to two path, came under
urging inside of a rallying PYRENEES turning for home, fanned to the five path entering the lane, gained along with his outer counterpart to bid for place in
midstretch, but was outkicked entering the final furlong, and faltered late. DENINGTON broke a bit out at the start, tracked in the six to four path around the
first turn, chased in the three path around the far turn before tipping back to the four path entering the lane, but yielded between horses in midstretch. O
GANGSTER stalked along the inside, bid entering the backstretch, vied into the far turn, but proved no match for an outer foe turning for home, and
weakened. NO EASY DAYS got keyed up while prominent inside of foes passing the wire for the first time, shfited out and bumped a pair of foes entering
the first turn, showed the way while tucking from the five path to the two path around the first turn while inside of the eventual winner, resisted O
GANGSTER's challenge entering the backstretch, vied with that foe entering the far turn, but proved no match for an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened between horses through the lane. MILLERS RITE shied from an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside, and was
outrun. FORTUNE pressed among foes early on, but was jostled between rivals while in the five path entering the first turn, settled into a two wide stalking
position around that bend, but came under a drive at the five furlong pole, and weakened along the inside turning for home.

O BESOS bumped an outer rival soon after the start, tracked in the four path around the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane to set up shop
outside of the leading trio, rallied in the final furlong with a game SURVEILLANCE to catch, ranged up to him inside the final sixteenth, and gained an
advantage at the wire. SURVEILLANCE showed the way inside of a pressing FORE LEFT early on, vied inside of that rival down the backstretch, sparred
around the turn, gamely clung to an advantage while tipping out to the three path entering the lane, battled through midstretch, tenaciously shrugged off his
outer counterpart nearing the final sixteenth, but shifted ground outwardly as an outer O BESOS presented a challenge in the final sixteenth, and got nailed.
FORE LEFT vied two wide, sparred in the four path entering the lane, sustained the long duel with his inner counterpart through midstretch, but yielded
nearing the final sixteenth. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR took a solid bump from an inner foe a few strides out of the gates, trailed the field in the two to three
path, then moved up between horses inteh late stagesw. MY MAN FLINTSTONE stalked in the three path, took aim on the top pair from the five path
entering the lane, but failed to progress before being outkicked at the furlong grounds, and kept on while one paced. LYKAN tossed his head while breaking
a step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, and chased through the lane without making an impact.

Footnotes
FRANK'S HONOR set the pace along the inside, felt light to mild pressure from an outer ELDEST SON around the first turn, shook clear of that drifting foe
and other chasing rivals entering the lane, and drew off. DESERT WOLF tracked four wide, gained place in upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the
clearing leader, and held that position from inner foes through the late stages. SPIELMAN stalked along the inside while a bit off of the inner railing, bid for
place inside of DESERT WOLF in upper stretch while no match for the leader, but was kept at bay. TEN DAYS LATER rated far back in the three path
around the first turn, tucked to the rail approaching the far turn, saved ground before producing a rail rally turning for home, altered course outside of foes at
the three sixteenths pole, then stayed on to attempt a bid for place between horses in the late stages, but missed. ELDEST SON stalked outside of the pace
setter, applied meager pressure to that foe around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival while drifting to the three path and inside of another foe
entering the lane, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. RECKER POINT stalked three wide and between horses, came under urging to sustain
position into the far turn, but yielded turning for home. GAME WARDEN laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path entering
the lane, and failed to menace. CURLINS INCHARGE settled off of the pace three wide, was required intermediate coaxing approaching the far turn to
sustain position, then faded in the four path at the three furlong pole. PAPPY WOLFE rated off four wide, then was hung in the five path around the far turn
and made little impact. MANO DURA was void of early speed along the inside, and never got involved. BIG POPPER showed little and was distanced, then
walked off.

Footnotes
OPEN ROAD pressed the pace setter from the outside, bid for the lead while well in hand turning for home, dueled gamely with his inner game counterpart
in upper stretch, determinedly inched an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed in the stretch-long battle. STRONG QUALITY set the pace
inside of a pressing OPEN ROAD, dug in under a drive to meet that foe's bid turning for home, dueled while gamely clinging to a narrow margin through
midstretch, but was headed entering the final sixteenth, and fought on doggedly. TIZ RYE TIME laid off of the pace along the inside, moved forward
between horses entering the turn, shifted to the three path turning for home, then sustained his charge to gain show at the sixteenth pole. TEPEU stalked
the leading pair from the inside, tipped off of the rail while pursuing them in upper stretch, but failed to progress while hanging on his left lead, and yielded
through the final furlong. ELUSIVE TARGET checked into the first turn when an outer rival cut across his path, tracked three wide, then four wide entering
the backstretch, and failed to menace. THE PRINCE'S SPUR saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide in upper stretch, and failed to threaten.
COMPLETE AGENDA was brushed by rivals on both sides in the opening stages, settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, moved forward to
track the leaders down the backstretch, but required coaxing in hopes of sustaining his advance at the three furlong pole, and tired. FENWICK tracked in
midpack while hung four wide, and faded. TIWANAKU tracked two to three wide entering the backstretch, but chased the leading pair under urging around
the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. HAPPY BOY ROCKET broke slowly, trailed the field, and never got involvd. O P FIRECRACKER laid off of the
pace three wide, but was hung in the five path around the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
SENOR BUSCADOR bobbled a bit while breaking a step slowly, tracked three wide, ranged up to loom a danger turning for home, bid for the lead entering
the lane, struck the front in upper stretch, but drifted outwardly approaching the furlong grounds, but an inside bid from INJUNCTION leaving that station, yet
kept that foe at bay before edging away from that foe once again nearing the wire. INJUNCTION pressed two wide, but was outmoved by the eventual
winner turning for home, kept on to take aim inside of that drifting foe in midstretch, attempted a bid approaching the final sixteenth, but was fended off.
THREE TECHNIQUE rated at the rear two wide, gradually inched closer four wide around the turn, but leveled off in upper stretch, vied for show entering
the final sixteenth, and prevailed. SURLY FURIOUS set the pace along the inside, shook narrowly clear into the turn, but met SENOR BUSCADOR's
challenge entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. FULSOME raced at the rear along the inside, trailed the
field in the three path around the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, but only produced a mild kick, and ran on meagerly between horses late.
SILVER PROSPECTOR saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide entering the lane, but failed to progress before fading. SPEAKER'S CORNER
leaned in at the start, laid close up along the inside leaving the chute, got keen while just behind the leader down the backstretch, steadied lightly
approaching the turn, then chased under strong urging around the turn, got outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, and weakened. UNTREATED
tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but retreated turning for home.

Footnotes
HOT ROD CHARLIE prompted the pace setter from the outside, vied with that foe around the far turn while taking that bend in the three path, forged an
advantage in upper stretch, led as an outer RICH STRIKE loomed a danger nearing the furlong grounds, met that foe's bid at that juncture, got headed
leaving that station, yet fought on gallantly, gamely regained even terms while getting leaned on nearing the wire, and prevailed via a tight photo finish.
RICH STRIKE laid off of the pace three wide, moved forward to a tracking position down the backstretch, pursued outside of the top pair around the far turn,
took aim on those rivals in upper stretch, exchanged brushes with an inner HAPPY SAVER while keeping that foe hemmed in as they inched closer,
sustained a bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage from HOT ROD CHARLIE soon after, but failed to kick away from his inner game
counterpart late, shifted in and leaned on that re-bidding foe nearing the wire, and got outfinished. KING FURY trailed along the inside early on, moved out
of last entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn as well, then sustained a rail chase through the lane to reach show inside the final
sixteenth. HAPPY SAVER stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted a path off of the fence entering the backstretch, chased the leading pair
around the far turn while under steady urging and inside of RICH STRIKE, shifted course outside of the top pair entering the lane, but exchanged brushes
with his outer counterpart as they inched closer to the top pair, got outkicked while hemmed in behind those foes at the furlong grounds, and yielded. ART
COLLECTOR set the pace, sparred inside of HOT RODE CHARLIE while just off of the inside around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper
stretch, and weakened through the late stages. CHESS CHIEF tracked two wide and between horses, but retreated to trail the field entering the backstretch,
and made little impact thereafter.
