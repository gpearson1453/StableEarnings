Footnotes
LADY DEMAREE set the pace along the inside, lost the lead while straightening in the lane, stayed on well to come again and edge clear through the final
seventy yards. FOUR DAWN pressed the pace while two wide through the turn and into the lane, gained the lead straightening in the lane, was still in front
with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. IRISH TAP was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up for the show spot
while not a threat to the top two. MI CRESCENDO was in the four path through the turn and into the lane and showed some mild late interest. HALAGA
never a factor while saving ground. SELENA SING chased the pace from the three path into the lane, was well placed at the top of the lane then was empty
approaching the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
IDAREYOUTODANCE stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane, made the lead while under minimal urging, cleared before
the eighth pole and was geared down late when a comfortable lead. NEVER TO MANY HUGS set the pace along the inside through the turn and into the
lane, was no match for the winner and was all out late to last for the place spot. C F V TU BRUTUS was in the three path through the turn and into the lane
and raced evenly through the lane and just missed the place spot. EMPIRE DANCER was in the three path through the turn when near the back, swung into
the lane from the five or six path and moved up while not a threat to the top ones. OOMPH GIRL was never a serious threat while in the two path
throughout. MYGALJUSTICE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and faded. GIODORABLE saved
ground through the turn and into the lane and was empty after straightening in the lane.

Footnotes
BLOODY MARY MORNIN stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, gained the lead outside the eighth
pole then cleared and slowly widened to the end. HAT TIP chased the pace along the inside into the lane, looked for room after straightening, steadied
nearing the sixteenth pole then no gap appeared, split rivals inside the sixteenth pole and finished well for the place spot. WHATS UP SWEETS was in the
two path while racing between rivals and in the second flight, continued in the three path for the stretch run and gained mildly. THE BEAUTY'S TALE raced
in the three path through the turns, was between rivals through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up while not a serious threat.
HOT HEELS set the pace while under pressure from two others throughout, continued with a short lead in late turn then yielded through the final eighth.
ANTALYA was in the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn, moved four then five wide when asking for more, swung into
the lane five wide and lacked a closing kick. SOUTHERN SKY saved ground throughout, cut the corner into the lane, was no room along the inside, shifted
to the five path looking for paths and moved up while not a serious threat. FIGHTING ZELDA was four wide through the far turn when never far back, came
into the lane from the four or five path and lacked a response. JORDAN'S KITTEN pressed the pace two wide through the turn, gained a short lead with an
eighth to go then gave way to the field.

Footnotes
FRIDAY NIGHT RIGHT veered out at the start, moved to stalk the pace into the turn, moved to press the leader two wide, gained the lead in late turn,
maintained a short lead into the lane then edged clear late. ANCHOR MANNE raced along the inside through mid-turn, guided three wide in late turn, bid
from the four path into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go, could not stay with the winner and settled for second best. FOXY BOXY settled off
the early pace while off the inside, continued in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path then moved up for the show spot and
best of the rest. MAS ORO vied for the lead two wide through the turn then weakened after entering the lane. VICIOUS RUMOR saved ground through the
turn and into the lane and moved up while not a threat. IMPLODING raced in the three to the two path through the turn and into the lane and tired.
CROSSING THE ROAD never a factor while in the four path through the turn and into the lane. BUCKLE UP raced along the inside into the turn when never
far back, was attempting to get out through the turn, continued to drift out through the lane and was not a menace. LOONY was in the three path through the
turn when near the back and was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
MILITARY FORCE was void of speed while off the inside, began gaining momentum through far turn while in the four path, continued in the five path in late
turn, swung into the lane five wide, continued with good energy after straightening then drove past the others and cleared inside the sixteenth pole. MY
FAVORITE UNCLE was in the three path through the turn and into the lane, shifted out a path nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy to
be up for the place spot. TRICOLOUR saved ground through the turns, came off the rail looking for room after straightening in the lane, angled in sharply
nearing the eighth pole to move to the rail then missed the place spot. KEEP ON was in the three path through the turns when never far back, came into the
lane from the four path, gained the lead in upper stretch then could not sustain the effort. NO LIMITATION was in the two path through the turns, when
always close up, bid into the lane from the three path and weakened late. FIERCE ASSAULT was in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane
from the four path and was never a threat. Z FORCE MAJURE vied for the lead two wide into the turn then faded. WHITE SILVER SANDS chased the pace
while along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and was empty. ASHWINS ORB raced in the four path through the turns and
tired through the lane. WHISKEY WEEKEND vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside, was tiring when taken up sharply nearing the eighth
pole and dropped back. A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #1 WHISKEY WEEKEND AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5
TRICOLOUR FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN #5 BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED LAST (10TH). A
TRAINER'S OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3 Z FORCE MAJURE AND THE RIDER OF #5 TRICOLOUR FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH RUN WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
JOYFUL APPLAUSE was jostled at the start, stalked the pace in the two path, split rivals at the three-sixteenths pole and rallied inside to prevail under
steady urging. ROYAL BLUSH was jostled at the start, stalked the pace between foes, bid at the eighth pole and missed. WHAT'S TO DO raced inside,
angled five wide at the five-sixteenths pole and rallied belatedly. LENNI BE LUCKY pressed the pace in the four path before giving way late. MY
SWEETNESS stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the eighth pole and faltered. IRISH KITTEN raced evenly outside. LANTERN'S CANDY was off
awkwardly, then rallied five wide. SUFFICE saved ground to no avail. HOLD ME GIRL pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole,
dueled inside, then faded. GET STORM AWAY was not a factor. TRUST FUND BABY led inside in the two path, then gave way at the three-eighths.
