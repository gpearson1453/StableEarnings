rallied at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner late but was second best. IMA SURE BET was allowed to settle early, swung wide and had mild bid.
IRON WILMA dueled with and chased the winner, gradually weakened. KRISTIN had good position three wide and lacked a rally. JANES HOPE was

Footnotes
BACKSPLASH was never far back while saving ground, angled out four wide in the stretch, split horses and drew off under firm handling. SIERRA
DIAMOND dueled on the early lead, gained a clear lead on the turn, remained clear in mid stretch and could not hold off the winner late. INDY PRINCESS
KOKO was never far back, rallied in the stretch and was up for show. JAIL HOUSE CODE vied for the lead and weakened slightly. RADIANTRITHYM
allowed to settle, failed to menace. BLUE SAGE pressed four wide and tired. COWGIRL KIMMIE broke outward at the start, contended three wide for a half,
then gave way.
