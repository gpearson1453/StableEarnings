Footnotes
MY MAN VITO was caught in the six path around the first turn, stalked from three wide, took over the lead around the far turn, opened up while drifting back
out to the six path in upper stretch, and held sway. SPEAK UNITY chased from the six path, was driven into the lane, and kept on down the center for place.
SAGRADA RAY prompted the pace from inside, was driven from the two path into the stretch, but finished evenly for show. I AM THAT I AM rated from
inside, trailed into the stretch, and never threatened. HANEY BOYS set the contested pace from two wide but gave way around the far turn.

Footnotes
COAL MINE tracked the leaders from the start, steady progress around the turn from the four path, went clear while running on the left lead, all out drive to
the wire. QUANTICO CREEK slow into stride, raced five deep when making his move at the quarter pole, drifted in under a right handed drive, finished
willingly through the wire. UNBRIDLED SASS raced off the duel into the turn, picked up ground while splitting rivals leaving the quarter pole, between
runners late, gained ground through the wire. CREATIVE CADENCE outside dueling start, in range around the turn, no late gain. CLASSY NANCY dueled
along the inside early, between runners around the turn, faded through the stretch. SALTWATER GYPSY step slow to start, moved up along the inside,
outrun stretch.

inside, got floated out to the six path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. SAINTS VICTORY tracked in the five path, was hustled from the four path
into the stretch, but was one paced. PRIME COAT rated from the rail, swung out to the five path into the lane, but was tired. CREME CARAMEL trailed from
the four path early, moved up while three wide into the far turn, but faded. MAY BEAU chased from two wide early but was never a factor. EXPECT A

get up late. INTREPID DAYDREAM set the pace from inside, was hustled along and lost the lead mid way around the turn, cut the corner and dug in to
retake the lead in upper stretch, but was caught late to place. BUY THE BEST tracked from the three path, tipped out to the five path into the lane, and kept
on for show. HEY MAMALUKE pressed from two wide, took the lead around the turn, was cued from the four path into the lane, but hung and flattened out
late. DECO STRONG chased from the three path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, and finished evenly. WE MISS SUSIE prompted the pace
between foes early but gave way around the turn. HONEY MONEY stalked from inside but was done going into the turn. PHILADELPHIA BELLE broke

Footnotes
MASTERFUL ONE outside dueling early on, scrubbed on around the turn, always outside rivals through the stretch, got up late driving. RAYO NEGRO
dueled inside early, roused leaving the three eights pole, clear at the quarter, outside pressure nearing the furlong marker, finished willingly through the wire.
SEVENTYTIMESSEVEN dueled between into the turn, lost ground around the turn, even strides late. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH bumped hard start, three
wide turn, outrun. OUT THE WOODS slow into stride, never a threat.
