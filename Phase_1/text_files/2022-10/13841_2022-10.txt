Footnotes
UNCAPTURED FAITH stalked from inside, was ridden along while three wide around the turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch, bid passing the
eighth pole, and drew clear. HOLIDAY PRINCESS prompted the pace in the three path, was hustled from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for
place. RANSOMS REWARD led from the three path, was cued from the four path turning into the lane, but evened out late to show. WHAT A KNOCKOUT
tracked in the five path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. SWEET BRODY rated from inside early, floated out to the seven path
into the stretch, but was tired. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY trailed from the six path into the stretch and never threatened. SONG OF THE HEART raced in
midpack from the four path but was no menace.

Footnotes
CHARMING CHARLIE prompted the pace in the three path, slowly gained through the lane and was up on the wire. ASTRAL WEEKS set the pace in the
two path, fought on inside of the winner and was caught on the wire. WATCH FOR THE LUTE saved ground in range, angled three wide, leaving the eighth
pole and lacked the needed rally. THE TWINS SNEAKERS chased the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane. FEDERAL EXCHANGE broke
in a tangle, rushed up outside and faded three wide around the turn. CUPID'S GHOST was keen between foes early and retreated inside around the turn.

Footnotes
SWEET PEARL raced from wellback in the six path, was coaxed from the five path around the far turn, swept to the lead at the top of the lane, but hung in
late stretch and just held on. SHE'S SO PRETTY prompted the pace in the three path, was cued to take over the lead while two wide around the far turn,
was headed and lost the lead in upper stretch, but dug in and ran on to place. KHOSEA stalked from inside, was roused from the four path around the far
turn, and kept on down the lane for show. ISLA BONITA chased from inside, was hustled along while shifting out to the four path into the lane, but drifted out
through the stretch and finished evenly. HARDLY SOCIAL rated in the four path, dropped back to last around the far turn, swung out to the seven path in
upper stretch, but was no factor. SERENADE A KITTEN tracked in the three path, was driven two wide around the far turn, but was empty into the stretch.
CENTSLESS DRAMA led from the two path but gave way around the far turn.

Footnotes
OH DARLIN prompted the pace inside down the backstretch, angled to the three path to stalk around the turn, reached the front near the eighth pole and
drew off under a drive. TWINNING N WINNING set the pace in the two path, was collared near the eighth pole and held on for the place. VAI BELLA raced
off the pace four wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. SEEKING STARDOM lacked early speed, raced five wide around the turn and rallied belatedly.
LADY HAMILTON chased the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. REE hopped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. MISS M M chased
the pace four wide and faded through the stretch. PAWKY was in range while racing two wide and tired through the final furlong. BLAH BLAH WORLD failed
to menace while racing three wide. COLOR THEORY trailed in the three path.

ATTHECROSSROADS stalked the pace two wide, took over near the three-eighths pole and drew off under mild urging. COFFEE HOUSE saved ground off
the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and was up for the place between foes late. APPEAR gave distant chase three wide and bested the rest. ASHFORD
GIRL set the pace along the rail, was collared near the three-eighths pole and tired inside. SAWEETIE GIRL had her head turned at the start, raced two
wide and made little impact. SISTER'S DUTY broke awkwardly but toward the front, had some speed outside and retreated four wide around the turn.
POSHLY played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
FLASHY TOO settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over between rivals leaving the eighth pole
and edged ahead. KIZZY veered in at the start and bumped CHESS NOT CHECKERS, pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths
marker, battled inside of the winner to deep stretch and was second best late. CHESS NOT CHECKERS was bumped and shut off at the start, raced off the
early pace two wide, made a four wide move around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch but was one-paced through the lane. J'S STAR JET chased the
pace in the two path and lacked a closing bid. LILY'S LEAD saved ground and failed to menace. SOUPER DUPER READY set the pace along the rail and
tired in the lane. KILLARGUE'S GIRL played no factor while racing four wide. SOPHIA'S STORM stalked the pace three wide, stopped around the far turn
and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ A GIANT raced in midpack from the five path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, took over in the final furlong, and drew clear. RACKET led
from the two path, was roused from inside going into the lane, yielded in the stretch to the winner but held place. DUNKLE raced from wellback in the three
path, was hustled from the five path into the lane, and kept on for show. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY tracked while three wide, was ridden from the two path
into the lane, but finished evenly. PLAYERO chased between foes, was coaxed from the three path into the lane, but was one paced. TRAPPE THE WIND
stalked from inside, was hustled along while swinging out to the five path into the stretch, but was empty. KALINBA steadied into the first turn, rated from
inside but was no threat. RUBY ROAD trailed from the five path early and was no menace.
