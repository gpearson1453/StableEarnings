Footnotes
SUPERDUTY JUSTICE pressed the pace from the outside of rival while racing two wide, dug in deep stretch and prevailed under all out pressure.
MYDADSBETRTHANYURS vied for the early lead from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE stalked the top pair, raced three
wide around the far turn, raced four wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. GO RODNEY was rated in the early stages to race in
hand, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and no closing run. PURE TAP raced off the early pace, raced along the inside through the far turn and
lacked a bid. INDY REBEL was allowed to settle early, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. NO MAN CAN was off slowly, lost
ground to race far back, was eased up on through the stretch run and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
LOFTHOUSE stalked the pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to be well clear late under steady handling. OFF WE GO
showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced off the rail in the stretch run and held the place position late. HAZY COMMAND chased the pace from
the inside, raced five wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and made a good late gain. PATNA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four to
five wide in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. PRINCESS ELIN settled off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no
late rally. EASYONMYEYES broke awkwardly, raced near the back of the pack early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
KEEN ICE SIGHT was rated early on to race in hand, asked while racing three wide through the far turn edged clear late under strong handling. DIAMONDS
N DENIM showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside, dug in inside the eighth pole while racing near the rail to finish second best. SWEET
JUSTICE was bumped at the start, chased the early leader and kept on willingly while racing two to three wide. DEEP DISH chased the pace from the
inside, raced near the two path past the quarter pole and raced evenly late. WILD TAPIT settled off the early pace, swung six wide into the upper stretch
and had no rally. GIFT WRAPPED raced in tight near the half mile pole, raced five near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in through the stretch run and had
not enough.. JERSEY GOLD was bumped at the start, raced four wide through the far turn and never threatened. MAMA LOU dropped back early, saved
ground and never was a factor.

handling. DUCHOSSOIS was allowed to settle early, made a steady advance through far turn, raced along the inside into the upper stretch, angled three
wide to race outside of the winner and got up for the place position late. COUNTER OFFER was unhurried early on, moved up three to four while racing
between rivals and rallied gamely to the wire. SCARLET CITY showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace while racing under a firm hold
and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MARV'S MAGIC dropped back early on to race near the back of the pack, advanced through the far turn from the
outside, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. DUEL FUEL was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside past the
quarter pole and weakened a bit in the drive. TEXAS GANO was slow early on, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in and had no late
rally. STEWARDS RULES showed good early foot to race from the outside of Scarlet City and faded the final eighth of a mile. JAMMERS JUSTICE stalked
the pace while racing three wide and weakened. BAD BOY failed to respond. HERE COMES TREY stalked the pace, raced six wide near the three

Footnotes
ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) chased the pace from the inside, shifted three wide through the upper stretch to race from the outside of Catcha Later Mo while
racing three deep and finished strongly to draw clear under steady handling. CATCHA LATER MO was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside
but was no match for the winner in the drive. GOLDBLOODED was hustled along, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled four wide and kept on to
the wire. VIVID EXPOSURE chased the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn, angled to race near the rail and had not enough.
TIZ ERIN was hustled along early, raced near the two path through the far turn and was even late with no closing run. ADALINDA raced off the pace, was
four deep around the far turn and moved up to improve position. EYE OF THE STORM dropped back early, made an advance through the far turn, waited
for racing room into the upper stretch, raced near the rail and had no closing run. COMPASS RISES was off slowly, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK raced off the early pace, waited for racing room through the upper stretch, raced three deep while
between rivals and lacked a rally. CHROME DESSERT was off slowly, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. LILY'S HOME
was coaxed along between rivals early, checked sharply near the three eighths pole, drifted a bit through the far turn and faded. ONE STORMY LADY
chased the pace from the outside and faded.

Footnotes
DOSSIER was rated early on, moved up from the outside of foes through the far turn and finished well to edge clear late under steady handling. CHA CHA
LARRY stalked the pace while racing outside of foes in the four path, took command nearing the three sixteenths pole, was clear near the eighth pole and
was wore down to finish second best. GENTLEMAN LOGAN sowed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened in the drive.
BUMPY chased the pace from the inside and weakened. GO EARLY STAY LATE raced off the early pace, was two deep near the quarter pole and passed
tired foes late. JUST A NOTION coaxed along while racing two wide between foes and faded. LOOKING SALTY was coaxed along three deep, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and was empty in the stretch drive. MAJESTIC ZEUS was off slowly, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
ALTERNATING IMPACT raced near the inside, lost ground to race far back and never threatened.
