Footnotes
CHASING JOY prompted the pace from the four path, took over from the three path around the turn, opened up into the lane, and held sway.
ELLIEREESEASTON raced from wellback in the three path, was hustled into the turn, tipped out to the seven path into the lane, and rallied down the center
for place. ARROW SHAPE stalked in the five path, ranged up to bid from the four path around the turn, drifted out slightly in upper stretch, and kept on for
show. KENYA SUN tracked in the four path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but finished evenly. CHUTZPAH chased from the rail, was roused
from the three path into the lane, but was one paced. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN rated in the five path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, but
flattened. CSILLA trailed into the stretch and was never a factor. ADIOS DIXIE pressed between rivals but faded around the turn. HOTLINE TO HEAVEN
led from the two path but gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. RIPPLE prompted the pace in the three path, took over around the turn, opened up into the stretch, and was much the best. IL MIRACOLO rated from
inside, was driven from the three path into the lane, and kept on to hold place. SIR DANIEL trailed early, saved ground into the stretch, and improved late for
show. DREAM KNIGHT chased in the three path, was ridden from the six path into the lane, but finished evenly. MAJESTIC PHAROAH led from the two
path but gave way around the turn. COPPERMASTER chased in the four path but was empty going into the stretch. DEPOLI tracked in the five path, was
coaxed around the turn, but faded. CAROLINA TRAFFIC stalked in the two path but was done early.

Footnotes
TONE FEELIN set the pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the half-mile pole, widened in upper stretch and held firm late. HIERRO stalked the winner
three wide down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, slowly gained through the final furlong but was held at
bay. REBELDE raced off the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied for the show. HERE COMES BULLET chased the pace three
wide and was one-paced through the lane. CAUSALISTIC hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. GO MIKE failed to
menace while racing three wide. PROSPECT PROJECT chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. TRIPLE JEOPARDY played no factor
while racing five wide. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN was outrun while racing two wide. NEW YORK STYLE was in range while racing three wide and had no
response. ESPECIALLEA veered in at the start and was never involved. INCITATUS vied between the top two finishers early and was through after a half.

Footnotes
DOMINICAN ICE broke out and bumped at the start, stalked from inside, was cued through an opening around the turn, drifted out in the stretch, but held.
STARSHIP RENEGADE pressed in the three path, was driven from the four path into the lane, and ran on for place. GREENPOINT chased from inside, was
hustled around the turn and into the lane, and kept on for show. ADMIRAL'S WAVE prompted the pace in the four path, floated out to the seven path going
into the stretch, but finished evenly. WINGING IT trailed from the four path, shifted out to the six path into the lane, and improved position late.
WHEATSHEAF led from the two path but faded in the stretch. TACTICAL FORCE rated in the five path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, but
flattened. READIER tracked in the five path, shifted into the three path for the stretch, but weakened. FIGHT was off the pace in the four path but was no
menace.

SHORT CIRCUIT settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over nearing the eighth pole and drove clear.
LANIAKEA STORM stalked the pace inside, was blocked by a wall of horses around the far turn and in upper stretch, finally found a seam leaving the eighth
pole and finished willingly to gain the place. MONEY FACTOR saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and was
outkicked for the place. KATIESDREAMGIRL raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn, tipped six wide turning for home and improved
position widest. LA COSTA stalked the pace two wide, took the lead midway around the far turn, vied between rivals past the eighth pole, weakened and
bumped with GREY CHARLOTTE in deep stretch. GREY CHARLOTTE set the pace along the rail, gave way in midstretch and bumped with LA COSTA in
deep stretch. YOUR INHERITANCE stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole and faltered in the lane. PROVOCATIVA
failed to menace while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MY MAN IRA tracked in the three path, bid from the four path into the lane, and drew past late. POINT LIAM led from inside, was driven into the stretch, and
fought on but yielded late to place. INSTINCTUAL bumped at the start, stalked from inside, was ridden out to the five path into the lane, and kept on for
show. SILVER N BLACK broke in and bumped an inner rival, chased in the five path, drifted out to the eight path into the stretch, but finished evenly. MR.
RHODIUM steadied at the start, rated in the three path, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. PRAIRIE HAWK pressed in the three
path but flattened in the stretch. PIKE PLACE raced in midpack from the four path but weakened down the lane. NAGA'S BOY was wellback in the two path
and was never a factor. BOLD MAJESTIC broke in and bumped, trailed from seven path and never a threat. AWESOME HONOR was wellback in the two
path but never menaced.

SEPTEMBERTEN raced well off the pace, edged closer four wide around the turn, closed outside and was up on the wire. AVANT GLORY pressed the
pace two wide, drew clear nearing the three-eighths pole, drew off in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out under left-handed
urging and was nailed. PRINCE OF IRON was in range inside, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole and was one-paced through the lane.
ADVANCE CASH failed to menace while racing three wide. INTER MIAMI stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. BRACCIO DI
FERRO was outrun inside. ROYAL ATTITUDE set the early pace along the rail and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
EASY COME EASY GO chased in the four path, was driven from the six path into the lane, and rallied down the center to get up late. POIEMA pressed in
the four path, took over while two wide around the turn, opened up into the stretch, but was caught late to place. THREE WITCHES stalked in the three
path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and kept on for show. OFFALY FAST hopped at the start, raced off the pace inside, was hustled from
the three path into the lane, but finished evenly. AMERICAN OF COURSE led from the two path but faded in the stretch. ELUSIVE MOLLY raced from
behind in the three path, swung out to the eight path into the lane, but was one paced. JUMEIRAH rated from the five path but was never a factor. SEA ART
was wellback in the five path but was never a threat. FRANKLY MY DEAR tracked from the five path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
WHAT KNOT settled off the pace along the inside, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole, kicked in outside and was up late. KATZ THAT GAL trailed
inside early, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole and was narrowly outkicked by the winner. STARE IF YOU
MUST settled off the early pace three wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the head of the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch,
led to deep stretch but could not withstand the top two in the final strides. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS raced well back two wide, went four wide around the far
turn and rallied belatedly. DISCO QUEEN set the early pace along the rail, chased inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the
lane. KAREN'S REVENGE chased the pace four wide around the first turn, moved up outside down the backstretch, vied two wide around the far turn and
tired in the drive. THE CUBAN MISSILE prompted the pace three wide and retreated around the far turn. FLAT OUT COOL advanced to the lead three and
four wide around the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around much of the far turn and wilted in the lane.
