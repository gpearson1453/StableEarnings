Footnotes
HORACE MANN led or forced pace from the inside into the backstretch, pressured leader from the rail to final bend, regained command midway on that
turn, moved clear and safely held under right handed urging. HEARTBREAK KID settled off the pace, chased two or three wide into the stretch, moved up
and dueled three abreast in the lane and inched ahead in final yards to gain second. THE SLAP angled over early and secured the inside, continued along
the fence, moved up some under asking around that bend and into the stretch, dueled inside pair of rivals in the drive and was out finished for the place. MY
PARTNER GLEN forwardly placed from the inside into and thru the backstretch, was pulling a bit into far turn, shifted out to two path, battled between rivals
in the drive and went willingly to the wire. STONKS was off a step slow then was slow into stride, chased off the rail then three wide to second turn while
lacking room, remained bit wide and lacked late response. CORAZON DE LUCIA bobbled leaving the gate, unhurried early, traveled inside, remained on the
rail to last turn, came out slightly and did not threaten. ALEXANDER HELIOS three deep and between rivals early, remained on same path to final bend,
was fanned out seven wide exiting that bend and never recovered. GIACOMETTI caught four wide into first turn, moved up and gained lead early on
backstretch, lost command on second turn, drifted out nearing the top of the stretch and weakened. GLENDALE lost footing to come away a bit slow,
reserved early, chased outside foe, stalked 3wide on second turn, took aim later on that bend, was fanned out six wide into the stretch and weakened.

the turn, vied between rivals into the stretch, could not keep up with MANITOWISH at the top of the stretch but stayed on well to prove second best.
ESTABLISHED bumped leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside, vied with outside pair leaving the turn and faltered in the stretch.
HEARTFULLOFSTARS trailed off the inside, went two then three wide around the turn, passed tired rivals in the lane but failed to threaten. EL DIABLO
ROJO was off a bit slow to begin, tracked outside a rival, entered the turn five wide, moved down into the three path. PERFECT CUT tracked well off the rail

FLAME MCGOON was off a bit slow to begin, climbed early chasing inside a trio of rivals, waited for room behind the leader on the turn, tipped out and
chased between into the stretch, moved outside and collared the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SUPER RENEE got bumped early then raced
up close outside the leader, bid two wide around the turn, cleared in upper stretch, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and held the place. ROSES
AND CANDY dropped back early, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, bid in the furlong grounds but could not find
more in the final sixteenth. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY stalked outside rivals early the early going, moved into the three path around the turn and flattened in the
stretch run. BIG SHAMROCK broke out and bumped rival at the start, got forced into SUPER RENEE and steadied between early, angled down to the
inside, lacked room leaving the bend, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. VA VA VOOM took a bumped leaving the gate, stalked three deep,
angled into the two path on the turn, steered out in the lane and lacked a rally. TWENTYSEVENTROUTS broke through the gate and was reloaded, sped to
the front from inside, held a short lead through the turn then lost command entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BOWL OF CHERRIES was closest in pursuit off the inside, bid two wide at the quarter pole, quickly took over leaving the bend, kicked clear under right
handed urging and drew off under steady handling. WILD ARCH chased on the inside, tipped out with a quarter mile left to run, chased between at the
eighth pole and outfinished ROSES R BLUE for second. ROSES R BLUE was off slow and veered out leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival and four wide
leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and got edged for the place honors. ARDIS sped clear to establish the front, drifted out leaving the
chute, showed the way along the rail into the turn, challenged by the winner at the quarter pole, lost command leaving the bend, drifted off the inside twice in
the lane and faded. ORISSA stalked between rivals up the backstretch, traveled three wide then dropped back between foes on the turn, came four wide
into the drive and had little left.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FOREVER sped to the front inside a rival the cleared around the clubhouse turn, set all the pace to the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and
remained clear. MOBOU stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, was asked three wide on the far turn, could not reach the winner but bested the rest.
WORSE READ SANCHEZ bumped in the beginning, pulled a bit off heels of a rival before the first turn, settled on the inside then pulled again near the
nine-sixteenths pole, tipped to the two path for the far turn, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly to earn the show. OUBABE prompted the pace
from outside into the first turn then chased the pacesetter two wide to the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. BUD KNIGHT coaxed to a
forward position and moved inside, pulled a bit early on the clubhouse turn, coaxed on the second bend, moved out in the lane and lacked a bid. WARRENS
CANDY MAN tossed head head and came away slow, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail, traveled four then three deep on the far turn,
steered out in the lane and could not rally. BIG TALKER was off slow and bumped at the start, raced two wide outside a rival at the back on the clubhouse
turn, rounded the far turn three wide, angled out in the drive and failed to find more.

Footnotes
ROCKY GIBRALTAR pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the quarter pole, took over leaving the far turn, disposed of ECONMICAL in upper
stretch then met the challenge from GRANADA FLAVOR, held a short advantage through the final furlong and would not be denied. GRANADA FLAVOR
trailed on the inside early on, advanced along the rail into and around the far turn, tipped out with a quarter mile remaining, took aim three wide into the
stretch, fought alongside ROCKY GIBRALTAR through the final furlong and missed. ECONOMICAL set the pace under pressure from ROCKY
GIBRALTAR, dueled with that rival on the far turn and lost command nearing the stretch, then flattened to third. OCULUS chased four deep then five wide
on the first turn, remained wide and entered the lane four wide, improved position but failed to threaten for the major awards. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM
tracked on the inside early, moved to the two path on the far turn and was coaxed along then failed to respond to the crop in the drive. WESTPHAL stalked
in the two then three wide early, raced three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. ME MACHO chased three
then four wide on the first turn, was along the three path through the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BIG SUMMER stalked three deep around the turn, came out and bid five wide entering the stretch, cleared and lugged inward in upper stretch and stayed
clear under a drive to the wire. BIG BEAUTY raced three deep at the back into the turn, chased four to five wide entering the stretch, drifted inward in the
lane and finished gamely but could not reach the winner. SUNSHINE BABE lost her path and steadied nearing the turn, got blocked behind a rival then
tipped to the three path on the bend, kept trying through the stretch run and got up for third. ISSA COURT stalked the pace on the inside, failed to produce a
bid in the lane and got edged for the show. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS chased between rivals then in the two path, steadied behind a rival in upper stretch,
tipped out then angled in and could not rally. SMILING MOLLY pressed the pace from outside, led four wide into the lane, came in and bothered rival in
upper stretch, then weakened through the drive. LAUREL CANYON set the pace early under pressure in the two path, dueled inside SMILING MOLLY
around the turn and lost command approaching the dirt, was forced to check by that rival in upper stretch and faded. CURRENT MOOD threw her head and
got shuffled at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in the lane and failed to threaten.
