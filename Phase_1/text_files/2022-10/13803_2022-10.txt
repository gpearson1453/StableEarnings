Footnotes
GOLOVKIN tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and drove clear late. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the late going, then was
no match for the winner and held the place safe. LUCKY NINETEEN well placed, angled out and moved to position two and three wide through the turn, bid
three wide outside the leader into the stretch and evened out, holding the show. MY BOY BLUE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn,
bid four wide into the stretch, flattened and missed the show. JAMA DILLON allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, angled out and had a mild gain. EAGLES PALACE passed tiring rivals, inside. SQUIRREL stalked the pace on the outside, lost some
ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch. HOUSE LIGHTS never far back, faded four wide through the turn.

ADIOS BOBBY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without cfhallenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. YADI drifted in
and steadied on heels into the first turn, was allowed to settle, saved ground through the second turn on the two path, bid on that path into the stretch, made
a steady gain and edged up for the place. POLLOCK angled in saving ground through the first turn, moved up three wide through the second, angled four
wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. AULT pushed out and forced to steady into the first turn, gained position quickly outside, held position
three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and weakened the final furlong. SIDE TRACKED pushed out and steadied into the first turn, saved
ground tracking the pace through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. GOLD FELLOW hard to
rated, angled out into the first turn, pushing out and causing a chain reaction, tracked the pace to the second turn and faded. CHIC N WILBUR pushed out
and forced to steady into the first turn, gained position four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. WHEREWEGOIN feeling pressure for
the outside, steadied into the first turn and was no factor. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE FIRST TURN, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
T REX unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. MARK
THE MOOSE set the pace inside, shook clear through the second turn, drew off in the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the place.
PREGAME mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, dueled with LOVERTY BLUE and outfinished
that one for the show. LIBERTY BLUE unprepared at the start, reared, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, then drifted in, dueled, and and lacked the needed late kick. SKYDIVING allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn,
angled widest in the stretch and improved his postion. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY mid pack, moved up four wide through the second turn, came three wide
into the stretch, drifted in and flattened out. GOLDEN OAK well placed and outside, faded three wide through the second turn. UP FOR THE CHANCE well
placed, held position three wide through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. AMERICAINAED mid pack, gained position inside through the second
turn and had no stretch rally. RUBINSTEIN showed little. HUNTIN' THE RUT stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the

Footnotes
STARSHIP EMPIRE mid pack, gained position four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain drifting in and drove
clear. EXPRESSED broke a step slowly from the gate, was boxed and steadied along waiting through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, angled out late for racing room and edged up for the place. FLAWLESS BOURBON well placed and inside, angled out and moved to position three
wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, edged ahead, then could not sustain the bid and held the show. CUZ well placed and
outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. TEMPLET mid pack, moved
up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. UNCLE ANDREW set the pace on the outside, shook clear
down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT was no factor. CITY PLAN unsettled
in the gate, rated inside the leader pulling, then faded through the second turn. AN OBJECTION LOGED BY THE RIDER OF FLAWLESS BOURBON
