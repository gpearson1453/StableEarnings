Footnotes
AFY KID broke a bit awkwardly, trailed in the five path rounding the first turn, cruised up four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off while ridden out. NOBLE AND KIND disputed the pace two wide, could not keep pace
with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths, continued on the left lead in the lane and lasted for the place. RAGMAN raced off the pace four wide between
foes around the first turn, went five wide around the far turn and was along for the show. MATEO was reluctant to load, tracked the pace two and three wide,
bumped with HEART BOY in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. HEART BOY raced off the pace six wide around the first turn, moved up a bit four
wide around the far turn, bumped with MATEO in upper stretch and lacked any further bids. FLORIDA STAR was in range while racing three and four wide
and came up empty in the lane. ST ANDRES was fractious behind the gate, raced three wide and never threatened. FAST LIVIN stalked the pace three
wide and retreated through the lane. IMDABESTINTHEWORLD vied inside and stopped around the far turn.

OPEN CARRY stalked from inside, tipped out to the six path while under rousing going into the stretch, and drew clear. SOLOMONS GOLD raced in
midpack from the six path, took the lead from the four path heading into the stretch, and ran on but was caught late to end up with the place. NATIONAL
UNITY dueled from the two path, lost the lead while being ridden along from inside around the turn, floated out to the five path into the lane, and held on to
show. R ADIOS JOE tracked in the four path, was hustled from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. MAKIZAN dueled for the lead from the three path
but gave way into the stretch. TIZADUKE was wellback in the two path and was never a factor. SALUTE THE TROOPS rated from the four path but was
never a threat. MAXX MAGIC trailed from the six path early and was no menace. ADIOS YOUR HONOR chased from inside but was empty going into the
stretch.

Footnotes
NO NAME DUDE stalked the pace in the two path, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, inched ahead leaving the
eighth pole then dug in between foes to prevail. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS was lightly bumped at the start then steadied not long after, raced off the pace
three and four wide, closed outside and ran out of ground. CHEERFUL CHARLIE raced off the pace three and four wide, rallied between foes and just
missed second. WIDE WEST (IRE) pressed the pace three wide, led nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and fought
on inside of that foe to the wire. BORIS broke out and lightly bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide between foes and lacked a closing bid. FACE
ABARRIO set the pace in the two path, steadied nearing the quarter pole and retreated inside. SWAN LAKE trailed outside.

Footnotes
ROYAL SQUEEZE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, tipped four wide nearing the quarter pole, swept to the front nearing the eighth pole
and powered clear under a drive. VINNIE VAN GO dueled two wide between foes and held well to preserve the place. NORTH CAUCASUS hit the starting
gate, trailed inside for a half, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. UNCAPTURED KING raced off the pace two wide and passed tiring rivals
in the lane. POSITIVELY AWESOME dueled along the rail to the eighth pole and tired. NACHO PAPA had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace
three wide, fanned six wide turning for home and lacked a rally. PALADIO chased the pace inside, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole and faded.
ROCKYSBUCKAROO pressed the pace three and four wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
NIC'S BRO stalked from the two path, was coaxed from the four path into the lane, took a narrow lead passing the eighth pole, and held on gamely.
AWESOME CRUSADER chased from inside, was ridden along while swinging out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on for place. PAPA JOJO
raced in midpack from the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. REGIMENTAL COMMAND dueled from two wide,
was cued from the four path into the lane, but finished evenly. CLEVER ENOUGH rated in the four path, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but was
one paced. ROYAL QUALITY tracked in the path, bid form four wide into the lane, but weakened. SIR ALFREDTHEFIRST was unhurried from inside but
was never a factor. SONG RUNNER dueled for the lead just off the rail but faded in the stretch. KISLOVODSK trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MUDSHAFT stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up late. WIN OR CELLAR hit the starting gate, advanced five wide
around the turn and closed widest. BRIMAGE hesitated at the start, raced far back inside, tipped out near the five-sixteenths pole and finished well between
rivals. MUGURUZA set a clear pace inside, led to deep stretch and was swallowed up late. YEGUITA QUEEN chased the pace four wide, slowly gained
through the lane but was outkicked. SHE'S OUTTA HERE was in range while racing three wide and lacked a rally. CAJUN SPICE was outrun inside.
LITTLE BELITA had brief speed inside. THE JOKES ON ME steadied soon after the start, raced three wide and made little impact. RIDE ON BEAUTY
played no factor while racing four wide. RAHTID had early speed between foes but was through early.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH led from the two path, was roused when challenged going into the lane, opened up slightly in upper stretch, and held sway. STAT stalked from
inside, was cued from the three path into the stretch, and ran on to secure place. FARM BOY raced from wellback in the two path, was ridden along while
swinging out to the six path going into the stretch, and kept on to show. THE MAR chased from inside, tipped out to the four path going into the stretch, but
finished evenly. IMPRESSIVE SPEED rated from three wide early, was coaxed from the six path around the far turn, but flattened. CAPTURE MI raced in
midpack from the three path but faded in the stretch. L. E. GRAY tracked from the three path but was empty going into the lane.
