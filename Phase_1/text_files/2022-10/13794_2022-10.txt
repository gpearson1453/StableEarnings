FLOR DE SOMBRA well placed and outside, gained position quickly into the turn, gained a short lead three wide through the turn, shook clear into the
stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. SCOTTISH SYMPHONY broke a step slowly from the gate, gained position three and four wide through the
turn, bid four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then lacked the needed late kick, while clearly best of the rest. WARRIOR'S RANSOM broke out,
bumping a rival hard at the start, moved up while angling out through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. CHEAP AND
CHEERFUL hard to rated inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three and four wide into the stretch and weakened. PACHELBEL improved her
position, widest. QUEEN WIGGY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded into the stretch. ORGANIZED CHAOS bumped hard and knocked off
stride at the start, tracked the pace from between, then faded two and three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
SONG OF INDY tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drew off the final furlong. RUN LAUGHING well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
closed well for the place. WILD LOOKER mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out and evened
out. AMAZON LIZZIE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and edged up for a share. LOOKING FOR
LOVE sprinted to a clear long lead soon after the start, held sway to the stretch, stayed on when challenged and weakened late. LUCKY DAY DIVA well
placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. CYBERBURG mid pack,
moved up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and ran evenly. TEQUILA MARY was no factor. YES IT'S ERIE was never
involved.
