Footnotes
JAMA DILLON never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged ahead in the
final strides. GOLDEN SURVIVOR bumped at the start, tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. DUN RIGHT sprinted to a clear lead quickly after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was outfinished and
held the show. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, evened and held
a share. GOLDEN OAK allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, had a mild gain to be up for a share.
SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled out and improved
position. UP FOR THE CHANCE well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and
faded. BUMMER was no factor.
