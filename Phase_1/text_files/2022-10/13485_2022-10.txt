Footnotes
GOODASIWONSWAS stalked the pace inside, rallied on the turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch, chased the leader and surged late to be
clear under mild handling. JEALOUS EYES was bumped at the start, led in the two path, then couldn't hold off the winner. MR. MARIAH stalked the pace in
the four path, rallied five wide on the turn, but couldn't gain in the stretch. LONGER VIEW broke outside, bumping a foe, then raced evenly. PYRITE
pressed the pace outside of the leader, then gave way on the turn. UNCLE BUFF faded. PAPA RED was not a factor. MIGHTY RIOT faded.

vied three wide, then dueled briefly inside of the winner in the stretch but was no match. SWEET VALERIA saved ground, bid in the two path at the quarter
pole, then faltered. ADMIRAL'S GARNET vied between foes, then gave way in the stretch. MRS. K raced in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, then
faltered. SAUCY CAT was not a factor. ROCK OUT vied inside to the quarter pole and gave way.

GHENT was clear early and drew off to win handily. IRISH ACES was bumped at the start, bid in the two path on the turn, clipped heels when
TALKSCHEAP drifted in at the top of the stretch, then rallied late while no threat. VADER pressed inside while no match. GOD OF WINE raced in the two
path, angled five wide into the stretch and bid belatedly. GO MAMBO raced inside, angled four wide on the turn, bid, then faltered. CODE ONE was off
slowly, then saved ground. SOFT PANTS stalked the pace in the four path, then lacked a late bid. DE BERARD stalked the pace between, was steadied at
the three-sixteenths pole, then lacked a late bid. TALKSCHEAP pressed the pace at the three path, faded, then drifted in at the top of the stretch, causing
IRISH ACES to clip heels. ALWAYS SPRING bore in at the start and bumped a foe.

well clear late under strong handling. LILMISS SASSYPANTS dueled for the early lead from the outside of rival, was clear near the eighth pole was no
match for the winner late. DEPUTY STAR was bumped at the start, chased the pace from the outside, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and
kept on to the wire. RUBY SKY was allowed to settle early on, raced along the inside around the far turn, continued with a rail bid in the stretch run and
showed late interest. MYGALJUSTICE settled off the early going, raced three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY
was bumped at the start, void of early speed, raced along the inside into the lane and never threatened. SANTIVA DIVA dueled for the early lead from the
inside of rival and faded. VENYATTA chased the early pace while racing three wide and gave way. JANE'S A DIVA raced off the early pace, raced well off
