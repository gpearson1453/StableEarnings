AVE'S IN COMMAND raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while continuing to save ground through the second
turn and in the run down the backstretch, turn back mild pressured from MUSTACHIO in the run to the final turn, held a clear lead into the lane, and was
never serious threatened late. APPELLANT unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the
run down the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, circled four wide leaving the turn, and closed with a rush two wide in
the drive to prove clearly second best. WE'RE IN COMMAND settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time,
continued to save ground through the second turn to gain a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and
closed from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early
pace while racing three wide into the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive
while unable to mount a serious late bid. MUSTACHIO tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue
from the outside of AVE'S IN COMMAND in the run to the final turn, was unable match strides with that rival entering the final turn, but faded in the late
going. ACE DEUCE broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, raced three wide in the run down
the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. The one mile split for this race was currently

MONTE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, and was all out to hold off a late surge by ROLLIE'S SPIRIT late to prevail. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush one out from the rail in deep stretch, but steadied off heels in the
closing strides. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed best of all five
wide in the drive to get up for a share. STAY ALL NIGHT away alertly and stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backside, continued to save
ground while commencing his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the inside in the stretch drive. GROOVY GIRL
stalked the leaders while racing two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide
in the drive. CHAMPIOSA settled off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and
finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ATOMIC HAZE lagged well back of the early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EH TEE EM lagged
well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an impact. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stalked the
leaders three wide in the run down the backside, continued two out from the rail into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
