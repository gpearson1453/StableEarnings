Footnotes
MAGIC SPIN was taken back to trail the field down the backside, rallied between foes midpoint on the turn, engaged for the lead four wide turning for home,
took control at the furlong marker and drew off coming to the finish. THREE MILE LIMIT stumbled at the break, recovered to assume command outside at
the half, set the pace throughout the turn, was collared by the winner an eighth to the finish and had enough late to just hold on for the place award.
BELENTIME tracked behind the contesting trio in the early stages, was shuffled through the turn to trail the field at the quarter pole, angled out three wide
for the drive and was gaining steadily through the stretch to just miss getting up for second. FORITTABLE broke sharp inside to be on top leaving the chute,
surrendered the lead at the half, battled between rivals for the top spot entering the stretch and weakened under the pressure the final sixteenth. WHY NOT
BOURBON pressed three wide in the beginning, tracked just behind the leader through the turn, was asked with rivals on either side two furlongs from home
and raced evenly through the stretch. MIA AND ME settled near the rear inside down the backstretch, waited on the fence running through the turn, tried to
rally inside to the wire but needed more to be a factor late. SNOOKERED pressed the early pace between rivals at the half, was asked racing in mid pack to
keep up three eighths from home, offered little response and could not make an impact through the stretch.

Footnotes
JEGOS FIRE bumped the inner rival at the start, moved clear and shifted in to the two path to dictate terms, drew off under hand urging and was geared
down late. DR. SHANE was under a hold while appearing to be getting out early, settled in entering the first turn racing outside three to four wide off the
pace, continued four deep on the far turn and asked for run past the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but secured the place. TAOS (FR) raced off
the pace three to four wide, came out six wide turning into upper stretch, won the battle for show outside WILEY O'RIELLY, who was reluctant to load, broke
a half-step slowly and angled in early racing on or just off the rail, came out five wide in upper stretch and ran on. PERLARANA raced mid-pack just off the
rail, advanced inside a weakening foe about the seven-sixteenths, lacked the needed late kick. CALL HER JOEY was bumped at the start, raced two to
three wide through the first turn, moved in and saved ground on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. OUR ZUMA switched off the inside
pursuing the eventual winner, dropped back tired.

MIGHT BEE SPEEDY was bumped at the the break, taken back off the early pace foursome midway down the down the backstretch, waited patiently while
saving ground through the turn, slipped up the fence at the furlong marker and took over the final sixteenth edging away at the wire. ONE TRUE
GENTLEMAN circled four deep to contest up front at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command at the quarter pole outside, opened up briefly in mid
stretch and was caught late the winner closing up the fence. JIM'S HOPE was off slow to trail the field at the half, angled out to rally five wide turning for
home, closed belatedly outside of runners in the stretch and finished up a clear third in the end. BARWICK broke out at the start, engaged for the lead
between runners through the turn, was ridden to keep up two furlongs to the line and levelled off the final eighth. WILD CONVERSATION broke sharp to
lead inside in the early stages, battled on the rail for the lead at the quarter pole and retreated the final sixteenth. SEATTLE POINT pressed the pace early
between rivals in the three path, took closer order to bid for the top spot three wide midpoint through the turn, was ridden to keep position two furlongs from
the wire and gave way in mid stretch.

RELOAD'S RASCAL was coaxed clear to set the pace shifting in, raced on or just off the rail throughout, held from a rallying rival under steady handling.
TEMPO MADNESS rated in behind the leader early while inside, switched out about the half, went two wide on the turn, was back inside in behind the
leader in upper stretch before forcing his way out three wide for room in mid-stretch, gained slowly but was not enough. BEAU GUEST broke outwardly but
recovered quickly and stalked from outside three wide, was forced out four wide in mid-stretch, ran on evenly. RAISE A PROFIT broke outwardly, raced off
the pace near the inside, swung out six wide for the drive and finished with good late energy. RUM CUP was forced out at the start, raced well back early
coming into the stretch three wide and passed rivals while gaining too late. MR. DE chased from outside, went three wide into the turn and was ridden along
more stoutly about the three-eighths, failed to rally. CHUNKY MONKEY raced outside foes mid-pack four wide into the turn, came out eight wide in the
stretch, failed to menace. WAR SAFE was off the pace near but off the inside going three wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and ran on.
UPTOWN LIGHTS chased from inside rivals mid-pack, came out in upper stretch as a rival came in, failed to rally. WELLWORTHTHEWAIT was in tight at
the break, lacking early speed, raced off the inside and was never a threat. NITEINSHININGARMOR chased briefly from between rivals, dropped back and
faded.

Footnotes
SO SUAVE (IRE) was away alertly to be alone up front down the backside, dictated the pace throughout the turn, opened up on the pack at the top of the
stretch, was kept to the task in the late stages and won comfortably in a well rationed front running score. SUNRISE DRIVE tracked mid pack just off the
fence in the beginning, was roused between foes in the second flight three furlongs still remaining, lost his path three sixteenths to the finish, angled out for
clear run at the furlong marker and closed well to besting the rest at the wire. TIMESKIP settled mid field inside early on, crept closer to the leaders on the
rail through the turn, rallied in the three path through the stretch and showed good late energy inside to get up for the show money. LAPOCHKA was
unprepared at the break and trailed, took closer order four wide around runners at the half, contended in the six path at the quarter marker, stalled the final
sixteenth losing some positions late and had to settle for the minor share. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS pressed outside soon after the break, was taken back
travelling three wide into the turn, lacked room between rivals at the quarter pole, angled to the inside three sixteenths to the wire, shifted back outside off
runners at the sixteenth pole and finished up evenly at the line. TYCOON tracked under a snug hold behind the frontrunning winner early, angled just off the
fence to force the issue midway on the turn, bid for the lead in the four path at the top of the stretch, was asked for more at the eighth pole and was empty
running between foes late. COLEYVILLE was allowed to settle at the back to trail the field running on the turn, was pinballed between foes looking for
running room six wide at the top of the stretch, finally had a clear path at the furlong marker and could offer little finish. MNEMBA ISLAND settled near the
rear on the rail down the backside, angled outside for the run through the turn, was in the seven path turning for home, was bumped in upper stretch and
could not find more for the drive and faded.

NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) moved forward from between runners to get clear, set the pace in the two path, held off a bid from an inside rival under stout urging.
GHOUL (BRZ) had brief speed from between runners, dropped back off the leader into the turn, tracked from inside, bid up the rail in mid-stretch but
couldn't get past and held second. FEELTHEBEAT had brief speed inside, dropped back, shifted out a bit turning for home, came out a little further later in
the stretch for room, finished strongly but missed second. OCELOT pursued the pace from outside going mostly three to four wide, ran on evenly.
SUNSPEAR was outsprinted early racing toward the back and outside, went four to five wide on the turn, came out seven deep in upper- to mid-stretch and
ran on. AL HEYBAY chased from mid-pack going four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five deep, failed to rally. CELEBRATORY shifted in early,
went two to four wide on the turn, swung seven to eight deep for the drive, was never a threat. GRAND ALLIANCE broke through the gate and ran off a little
bit before being restrained by the rider, raced off the pace near inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
U S ARMY CORPS tracked behind the leader on the rail down the backside, waited kindly inside through the turn, slipped up the fence to bid at the quarter
pole, took command to open up in mid stretch and drew off comfortably at the finish. EXECUTIVE SEARCH broke sharp to clear runners for the early lead,
was surrounded by challengers two furlongs to the finish, gave way to the winner in upper stretch but fought on stubbornly to the wire and rebid nearing the
line to retake the place share. ENJOY THE MUSIC broke in and was off slow at the start, followed the winner through the turn on the rail, shifted just off the
fence between horses at the furlong marker to try the winner but could not gain and weakened late to lose the place award at the line. EMICRACK (CHI)
was close to the pace between rivals tracking at the half mile marker, had to wait briefly midway on the turn, shifted outside in the four path with an eighth
remaining and showed late energy to get a small share at the wire. SELFMADE put in a rally four wide at the three eighths pole, loomed into contention five
wide at the quarter marker and offered only an even finish in deep stretch. THE SINNER IS YOU was situated close to the rear in the beginning, advanced
up the rail saving ground on the turn, was in the three path for the stretch run and needed more to be a factor running to the finish line. SPEEDY BOLT was
bumped by his inside rival at the break, settled near the back at the half, was ridden for more on the turn and could not be a presence for the drive. SEA
SCOUT broke out at the start, trailed the field down the backstretch, angled out while last to be eight wide at the top of the lane and passed tiring horses in
deep stretch. HALLIE'S HERO pressed outside three furlongs from home, was in the mix for a share five wide at the top of the stretch, offered no finish for
the drive and faded to the wire. ANALYZER settled mid field outside at the half, was urged through the turn and could not get involved to make an impact in
the stretch. RACE FOR PINKS was bumped at the start, recovered to track three wide into the turn, was ridden to keep position midway through the turn,
gave way while four wide turning for home and stopped in mid stretch.

Footnotes
JUMPIN JUNIE shifted in heading to the first turn to track the pace, inherited the lead outside the seven-sixteenths, edged clear by mid-stretch under urging
and held foes while just eased up nearing the wire. ME AND MY SHADOW settled off the pace, raced three to four wide throughout, was forced out and
bumped into a rival in upper stretch, could make no headway on the winner but won the battle for second over. FORTYFIVESEVENTY , who settled inside
early, took closer order turning for home while moving out a bit, angled out further and was put to strong urging in upper stretch, missed second.
WICKENHEISER rated off the pace three to four wide early, advanced four then five wide on the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch and ran on.
COURTLY RO saved ground through the first turn racing toward the back, swung six wide turning for home, finished up with moderate late interest.
FLYSOFREEASHLEEB saved ground on both turns and ran on evenly. BIJOU BABY raced off the pace two to three wide between runners, came out four
deep in upper stretch and ran on evenly. SOUPER SINCLAIR stalked three wide in the early going, pressed the pace into the far turn, was in a bit tight and
moved out in upper stretch bumping a rival, weakened thereafter. MERITAMEN raced toward the back just off the inside before moving out four to five wide
into upper stretch, failed to rally. FRIENDS FOR LIFE set the early pace, was steadily getting out through the backstretch and on the far turn, taken hold of
in attempt to correct while dropping back to last. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SOUPER
SINCLAIR AGAINST FORTYFIVESEVENTY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS
IS.

DREAM JEREEM settled near the back of the field on the turn, rallied circling around runners at the quarter pole to bid six wide at the top of the stretch,
finished up strongly under left handed urging to lead at the furlong marker and began to inch away late for the victory. YORKVILLE broke sharp for the lead,
put away his early speed rival in mid stretch and battled on gamely only to give way grudgingly to the closing winner nearing the finish. TWO RIVERS OVER
was off a bit slow inside at the start, settled near the back down the backside, rallied between rivals with three sixteenths to go, weaved through horses late
and finished up well for third. HEY CUE tracked with runners on either side in the second flight three furlongs from the finish, angled out five wide to contend
turning for home, was in tight quarters in upper stretch and finished up with intent to be on the fringes at the wire. MESA SPIRIT contested for the lead just
outside through the turn, bid for the top spot between runners at the furlong marker, gave way under the drive the final sixteenth and faded late to lose
positions. AURA OF GOLD tracked on the rail behind the contest frontrunners into the turn, save ground through the turn and offered little finish in the
stretch drive. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA was under restraint to sit off the dueling leaders at the half, was in contention with a four wide move at the quarter
pole, steadied between horses at the top of the stretch and could not recover to be a threat late. BEYOND TALENTED was near the back in the beginning,
trailed the field at the three eighths marker and lost contact with the pack on the turn. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #5 HEY CUE

Footnotes
HYPERFOCUS switched out in the early going settling off the pace, advanced outside foes four wide up the backstretch, moved four then five wide on the
turn, took the lead past the three-sixteenths, was soon clear and held sway under steady handling. VELOCE raced mid-pack outside a foe three wide early,
went three then four wide on the far turn, came out a bit further for the drive, gained the place but was only second best. DANI'S VICTORY stalked three
wide, took a brief lead at the top of the stretch but had no extra. GENDRAGON bumped the outside rival at the start, settled off the pace inside, angled
seven wide into the stretch and improved position. SAILOR'S PASSION was bumped at the start, tracked in behind the leaders near but just off the rail,
lacked room turning for home, came out a bit, found some room and ran on. DOCTOR UPTOWN was reluctant to load, broke very awkwardly and slowly,
settled at the rear racing off the inside, swung seven wide into the stretch and ran on mildly. SOCIETY JOE moved up outside the leader on the first turn two
wide, took a narrow lead soon after heading up the backstretch, was overtaken by that same rival about the seven-sixteenths, continued to contend on the
far turn then weakened. CHASING VINNY moved clear and shifted in, contested the pace inside, gave way.
