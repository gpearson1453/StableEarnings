Footnotes
NOTJUDGINJUSTSAYIN allowed GREAT ROAD to dictate terms throughout, at times racing just off his flank, at others allowing a large margin of lead. At
fence 14, moving up the hill he was asked and responded. Capitalized on the leader's stumble at fence 15, took command and never had a need to look
back. ADJUTANT (GB) allowed his foes to race up front for all but the last three-quarters. Moved to the inside and advanced when requested. Joined the
leaders and also made most of leader's 15th fence stumble. Drove well late but no match for the winner. GREAT ROAD broke on top and led the way
throughout the event, met with a challenge briefly two miles in but never pressed. Slight stumble over fence 15 changed his momentum, relinquishing the
lead to ultimate winner. He did cross the wire and finished.

Footnotes
MASTER SEVILLE allowed MERCOEUR to take, and maintain, a measured lead, rating nicely throughout. Continued that way until the last half mile when
he responded immediately to asking, moved outside at the last jump, held off late challenge from. WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) who sat well off the two
pacesetters and settled in along the inside. With three fences left he closed the gap with two lengths separating the trio. At the last jump, while still inside, he
took advantage of MERCOEUR leaving the course, drove hard late but got bested by the winner. MERCOEUR (FR) had it all his own way every step, not
challenged at any point, enjoyed a five length advantage at the far turn when unexpectedly moved inside the last fence leaving course. He walked off. IT'S
NOTHING was behind all others, never posing a threat. Pulled up at 14th fence and walked off.

Footnotes
ANDI'AMU (FR) swapped leads with POCKET TALK, the latter edging the former in the first mile, but then took command at fence 14 of 19 then dictated
terms at his own pace. Drew clear when rounding the far turn, took off and was never going to be caught. SHOOTIST was well back until the last
three-quarters when he moved into contention and made his biggest threat. At that point the winner drew clear leaving he and POCKET TALK racing heads
apart for second spoils. He capitalized on foe losing rider and was an unchallenged second. GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) raced far back early, never got going
whenever asked and stayed there. POCKET TALK (IRE) raced very well throughout until the last fence. Guided the field in the first mile and more until
ultimate winner took over and he looked poised for second spoils until stumbling at final fence, unseating the rider. Walked off.
