Footnotes
GOOD SAM moved out while going to the front, showed the way under pressure down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, spun four wide
into upper stretch while moving clear, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride to the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead when given
one tap of a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, raced under a strong hand-ride into the final forty yards then was eased up while much the best.
SEDUCTION moved out while just off the pace, chased three wide early on the turn, shifted five wide near the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner while six
wide into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. SPELTERINI stumbled at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four
path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and weakened while able to get the show. RISK FREE came
outward just after the start then was taken in hand, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved a bit further
out and came up empty. FIRELINE broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn, angled seven wide later on that bend then
dropped to the five path outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. RELAY was hustled from the start, settled on the outside, was asked while five then
six wide on the turn, dropped to the four path nearing the quarter-pole and had nothing left. MAGIC MISS settled off the pace, dropped back after going a
half-mile, fell well behind in the four to five path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
DUBYUHNELL lunged slightly at the break, raced seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked five wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, rallied outside rivals coming inwards to get a look at the top pair
nearing the sixteenth pole, took over command just inside that station and edged away to the finish to prevail. CONVERSING five paths off the inside just off
the top trio in the early stages, advanced to vie between foes nearing the half mile pole, knocked heads tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling with CERTIFIED LOVERBOY through to the sixteenth marker when in the
midst of taking command when overhauled as a tandem by the top one, then battled on to procure the place honors by a nostril on the wire. CERTIFIED
LOVERBOY coaxed from the gate, vied four wide early with a ARI GOLD and ENZO'S WORLD, tucked three wide shaking off ENZO'S WORLD and was
joined by the aforementioned foe to cling to command over a pair once more, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs
from home under pressure from that pair, spun three wide into upper stretch shaking off ARI GOLD, dug in dueling through to the sixteenth marker
stubbornly before grudgingly giving way at that station just before being overhauled in concert with CONVERSING by the eventual winner, fought on
tenacious to the line but was ultimately bested for the place honors. ARI GOLD vied from the seven path down the backstretch with a pair to his inside,
tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and
weakened in the late stages. PLEASE BABY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing midway,
went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. KAON coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SCAT TU TAP six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. KID AMERICA chased two to three wide before tipping four wide through the turn getting put to coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tired. ENZO'S WORLD coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed vying four to five paths off the inside
early on before fading near the half mile pole, tucked three wide through the turn and was ridden along at the seven-sixteenths, tipped four to five wide into
upper stretch well behind and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
WAR STOPPER tracked the pace on the far outside, went around the turn in the four path, was roused five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the
final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth then moved clear under good handling to prevail. NO BURN prompted the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path around the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, gained the lead in the four path at the quarter-pole, fought outside of OCEAN
ATLANTIQUE into the final furlong, lost the lead to the winner into the final sixteenth and proved no match late while able to get the place. OCEAN
ATLANTIQUE brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way with company to his outside, was asked in the two path on the
turn, lost the lead in the three path at the quarter-pole, fought under a drive while drifting out into the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for the
show. ROYAL PRINCE was well placed just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths then moved to the two path,
shifted three wide into the stretch and came up empty. WILL SING FOR WINE was hustled from the gate, settled between horses, bumped with a rival
inside the half-mile pole, chased three wide around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. NATHAN DETROIT broke in and brushed with a
foe, settled at the rear, moved closer with three-quarters to run, bumped with an opponent inside the half-mile pole, chased in the two path for most of the
turn then dropped to the rail and had nothing left.

BLU GROTTO chased just off the inside briefly early on before tipping three then four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and advanced quickly surging into contention through the latter portion of the turn briefly tucked to the rail
before tipping back out to swing five wide into upper stretch outside the leader, collared the front at the three-sixteenths before MISBEHAVED could even
brace for the challenge and drew clear under a drive to prevail. MISBEHAVED showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three then two wide through the turn and came under challenge when placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch,
got displaced from the front with three-sixteenths to go, proved no match for the top one while holding safe for the place honors. IRON LION IN ZION seven
paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide
into upper stretch and kept on well clear for the show honors to be along best of the rest. SOUTHERN PASSAGE coaxed from the gate, chased five wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. EMINENCY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four
wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped seven wide into upper stretch and tired. ALITE chased three then two wide until tucked
inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun three wide for home and faltered. JAY'STALKER coaxed from the gate, showed
speed for the opening half mile five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and retreated coaxed along from the half
mile pole, went five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
FLAWLESS CAT bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop,
drew off under the crop into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. BLAME D RULE MAKER chased the pace on the outside then
four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. WINNING CONNECTION was
bumped hard at the start then taken up, spotted the front several lengths, went four then five wide on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and improved
for the show. SECRET THUNDER broke out and bumped hard with a rival, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, spun into
the stretch under a drive and weakened then lost the show. CHURRO was bumped hard at the start then forced strongly into another foe, raced off the pace
under urging, bumped with an opponent leaving the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
SECOND AND REED was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back late on the backstretch then bumped with a foe into
the turn, went three wide on that bend, was driven seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. CARA'S PRINCE bumped with a foe at the start then
was hustled, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, had the rider lose his crop outside the quarter-pole, floated six wide into the stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
ROCKY SKY (IRE) was reserved on the outside under a snug hold while two to three wide, ranged up on the final turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole,
shook clear while set down into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) was reserved
at the rear while inside to the two path, moved closer while two then three wide on the final turn, was roused four wide at the quarter-pole, pursued the
winner in the stretch and finished with good energy while clear for the place. COASTANA moved from the rail to the three path around the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, traveled in the two path around the second turn, was urged along in the two path on the final turn, made a bid between horses
outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. TASS went to the front, was well rated while setting the
pace inside to two path, came under pressure on the final turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. GLADYS was taken in hand early then rated
on the inside, came under urging near the three-eighths, spun three wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LOVELY LUCKY was reserved towards the
rear in the two path, shifted four wide midway through the second turn, settled outside without cover down the backstretch, was urged three then four wide
on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE GELATO shied in at the start and was corrected, raced four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the compact
field, tucked three wide through the turn and nudged her way out to a clear path nearing the five-sixteenths when THE GREAT MAYBE couldn't keep pace
outside to keep her behind VEDAREO, came under light coaxing inside that station and quickly advanced to poke a head in front swinging four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, held sway kept to task to the finish. YOU'RE MY GIRL showed the way in hand three
then two wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under threat for the initial time and was headed for command swinging just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly to chase the winner home while clear for the place honors. LEAVE NO TRACE broke open the stall
door prior to the start, broke in at the start brushing the near side stall before being corrected, advanced after the break and chased four paths off the inside
down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch at the quarter pole before tipping out straightened away to the four path, then kept on to procure the show honors. AMERICAN ROCKETTE
chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch, tipped out five to six wide straightened away and weakened in the late stages. VEDAREO stumbled at the start
recovering outwards and bumping THE GREAT MAYBE solidly, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked three wide
through the turn, then got steadied and paused losing her lane near the quarter pole when CHOCOLATE GELATO came slightly inwards and YOU'RE MY
GIRL slightly outwards to eyeball one another, swung four to five wide into upper stretch re-engaged by the rider and tired through to the finish. THE GREAT
MAYBE got bumped solidly at the start by the aforementioned foe who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased five to six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home and lost position to the eventual winner when fading as that
rival nudged her way through near the five-sixteenths, angled six wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MAJOR DUDE went three then four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, made a bid in the three path on
the far turn, gained the lead into upper stretch, responded well when challenged by the runner-up outside the furlong marker, drifted out and brushed that
foe inside the furlong marker, was carried in late and gamely prevailed. I'M VERY BUSY bumped with a rival early, went three wide on the first turn, was
reserved on the outside but with cover, went four then five wide on the far turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the furlong
marker, brushed with the winner inside that marker, drifted in while fighting outside to the wire and missed while able to get the place. LACHAISE was
brushed in the hindquarters early, went five then four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, swung seven
wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy near the center of the course to garner the show. NOBLE HUNTSMAN was rated on the inside,
moved off the rail near the five-sixteenths, was roused three wide into the stretch, chased while still on his inside lead in the drive and weakened. RAMBLIN'
WRECK moved in early, settled in the two path, was asked on the far turn, moved to the three path near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. DATAMAN was reserved on the inside, came off the rail at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. BATTLE OF NORMANDY went four then three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, spun five
wide into the stretch and came up empty. MOVISITOR was hustled from the gate, angled in while showing speed, tracked the pace on the outside in the two
path, issued a challenge on the far turn, gained a short lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and tired. BRAMBLE
BLAZE settled towards the rear, raced in the two path on the turns and was no factor. FLY RIGHT was last to commence, moved up on the inside to take
the lead on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while asked on the far turn, lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths and faded.
TORIGO bumped with a foe early, went six then five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced four to five wide on the far turn and showed little.
