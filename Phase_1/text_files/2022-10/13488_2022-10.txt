Footnotes
TOTAL DISTRACTION bumped at the start, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide in the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off late under steady
pressure. ANOTHER SOFTBALL unhurried, angled in and saved ground through the turn, angled three and four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up for the place. DONALD stalked the early pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside of that one into the
lane, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match late and held the show. SAVE THE DRAMA mid pack, lost some ground three and four wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and evened out. HYMN'S SYLVIA set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then weakened the final furlong and could not hold a share. LADY MARVEL broke out, bumping a rival at the start, was rated back from between into the
turn, then faded three through the turn.

VIDEO STAR well placed and inside, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside, waited, split foes, made a steady gain and edged up in the final
strides. YOU LOOKING AT ME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the final yards and was outfinished. LA PANDA
unhurried, saved ground through the turn, blocked, waited, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. MOM'S
TOWN well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. PARISIAN
SUMMER well placed and off the rail, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded. BE SHARP lost ground,
inside. SPYENTIST was never involved.

FUEL THE BERN set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and held under steady pressure. BEAR CREEK tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and could not gain. SAINT GOAR unhurried, moved up two and
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed willingly and missed the place. BLAKENSTEIN stalked the pace on the outside, lost
some ground three wide through the turn, the evened in the lane. QUARTERMASTER ran evenly. SAMAY passed a tiring rival, widest. KING ECLIPTICAL
led in the early going, vied between to the turn, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SUN DADDY tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, angled out into the stretch, exchanged bumps, made a steady gain and drove
clear. SPEED WAY well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged
up for the place. RICHARD HOOTY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up for the show. SUMMER PALACE mid pack, angled in to save ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
made a steady gain, angled out late for clear racing room and could not gain. CREATIVE CHOICE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off
down the backstretch, then weakened the final furlong. NOT SO EASY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five
wide into the stretch and ran evenly. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL stalked the pace on the outside, tracked that one through the second turn, then exchanged
bumps into the stretch and faded.

BACK TO OHIO set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then drew off and was kept to the task. A NITE IN CAIRO allowed to settle, saved
ground through the turn on the two path, came through on that path into the stretch, angled in, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. YES DAY
tracked the pace, saved ground through turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, drifted out and lacked the needed late kick. GRAND OAK (IRE)
well placed and between, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain for a share. JUSTA
WARRIOR allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and flattened out. JILL JITTERBUG never far back, lost some ground
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. BEL PENSIERO stalked the pace from between, lost some ground on the two
path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. DAMASO well placed, held position three wide through the turn, then faded the final furl. ELSA'S ROCKET
well placed, held position three and four wide through the turn, then faded five wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
MY BOY BLUE vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then lasted
under steady pressure. GOLDEN SURVIVOR hopped at the start, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled widest into
the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the show. BUMMER well placed, held position on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, steadied for
racing room, then had a mild stretch gain. AMERICAN CHAOS mid pack, held position three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch
and ran evenly. GOLDEN OAK well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly. GENERALONAMISSION
well placed, faded three wide through the turn. OLE G MAN well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then faded five wide into
the stretch. ABE HONESTLY set the pace on the inside and faded into the stretch.
