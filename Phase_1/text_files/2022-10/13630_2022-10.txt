PARLAY PETE went to the front, saved ground around the final turn and was going away at the end. AKHNAS unhurried in the beginning, racing within
striking distance, made a late inside bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. POSEIDON WRATH raced within contention, came around
the second turn on the outside, made a wide gain and missed second. DREAMS OF VALOR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a
late kick. HONOR MY SPEED lacked early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, improved position, but was no factor. SWEET RACHEL
vied for the early lead and faded. HOT LE ROY void of early speed and was outrun. LITTLE TOE always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane with DUEFORADATE and prevailed for
the win. DUEFORADATE vied on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch with ZYDECO MUSIC and was outfinished for
the win. GREEN MONSTER raced within striking distance, evenly behind the leaders and proved no match for the top two. TOTAL MALICE lacked early
speed, came around the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MAYAPRETTY void of early speed, came around the second turn on
the outside, made a wide gain, but was no threat. GIRL THIRSTY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. MISS JAMIE dueled on the front
end, saved ground around the final turn and faded. LOVE TO LEARN pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. SUCRE lunged out at the start, left
at post and was never close. ALBERTA MOON raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and faded.

MONGOLIAN DIAMOND went to the front, saved ground, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. SUE HAPPY lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, saved ground around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GALAXY AFFAIR showed early speed,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. IT'S TIME BABY raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and put forth
an even effort. BRADEE CASH raced in the rear and was never a threat. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA raced within striking distance and faded. KORAT QUEEN
lacked early speed and was outrun.

was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. DUST EM unhurried in the early going, made a wide rally and finished willingly.
EXTIRPATOR vied for the early lead and weakened late. WISE VERDICT lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. PACIFICISLANDTIME void of
early speed and was outrun. GAME DAY PLAY had an awkward start, racing in the rear and was never close. TAPIT WISE always raced near the back and
showed little.
