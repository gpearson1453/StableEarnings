in the lane. HUFFLEPUFF bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, dueled through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leader
from the three path around the turn and kept on to the wire. MS. MALEVOLENCE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground in the
middle of the pack around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. NOTION INTERRUPTUS was reluctant to load, trailed the field through the early
going, saved ground around the bend and never threatened. MRS. CREWS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the three path and faded in the stretch.

BEAUTIFUL TIZ raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, raced into traffic and steadied while
coming around the far turn, began a proper bid approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win in the final strides while drifting out late. THEA'S THEME
saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, challenged from the rail nearing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in
upper stretch and was caught late. LADY TEUFLESBERG led the way from the three path through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around
the far turn and faded in the lane. NURSE RACHETT raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the second bend and tired in the stretch. HELLO ROSIE SAY trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid.
