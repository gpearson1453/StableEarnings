sixteenth marker and edged away late. DONYA'S MAGIC opened up a commanding lead on the backside, showed the way on the far turn, raced off the
inside turning for home, was set down by the rider nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside of the winner and came up second best.
CONUNDRUM QUEEN raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. PRINCESS JAVONCIA tracked
the pacesetter, chased that rival on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. LULLABY LAND raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the
pace, moved up four wide on the far turn and closed belatedly outside. PANOTTI raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. FEETS OF FEATHER raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. TEXAS MAGIC settled off the

Footnotes
OH DONNA was bumped at the start, stalked the pacesetter, chased on the turn, commenced her rally nearing the furlong marker, gained a short lead
passing the sixteenth pole and then dug in gamely to prevail. SWEET TRACK was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, angled
to the rail at the eighth pole, closed willingly and dug in gamely to the finish. MOTOWN MIKA tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out at
the eighth pole, rallied between rivals in the final furlong and dug in gamely to the end. PINK PARTY PANTS set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed
the way into the stretch, then weakened at the sixteenth marker. BOOK AND CANCEL was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, chased three wide on
the turn and tired. CHALICE stalked two wide early, raced three wide on the turn and had no rally. COLLECTIVE GOLD raced off the rail, off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and faded. GUN OF GOLD raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and faded.
