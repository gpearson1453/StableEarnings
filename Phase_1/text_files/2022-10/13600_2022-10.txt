Footnotes
FUN MONEY raced up close in the early stages, challenged from outside around the turn, battled through the late and dug in late to overtaken the
runner-up. COCKTAIL PRINCESS broke super and established a clear lead quickly, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled with FUN MONEY around the
turn, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late. SMILING AMY stumbled a bit and got bumped on both sides, pulled and
became rank, saved ground through the turn, came out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. CHOLLY came in at the start, tracked four deep up the
backstretch, took the turn three then two wide and failed to produce a bid. BIG GIFT bumped leaving the gate, chased along the rail then two wide into the
stretch, moved out then angled to the inside and could not rally. THANK YOU KERA stalked three deep early, angled to the rail on the turn and weakened
down the lane. ALONG CAME JOANN was off a bit slow to begin, jumped and bobbled crossing the dirt, raced along the rail then tipped out into the stretch
and failed to menace. SPEAKING SPANGLISH was a bit fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped rival, raced off the pace two then three wide around the
turn and was not a factor. GREAT GIFT was off slow and broke in, dropped far back early on, saved ground through the turn and was not persevered with in
the stretch.

Footnotes
MERCY MERCY shifted in a bit early to bothered rival, stalked four wide around the clubhouse turn, moved up to press three deep on the backstretch, could
not keep up with the leaders on the far turn, re-engaged. WHISTLER'S STYLE tracked four wide around the first turn, drew up alongside the leaders four
deep at the half-mile pole, dueled outside FLAT OUT JOY around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared briefly midstretch but was soon challenged
by MERCY MERCY and could not fend off the winner. BRITTLE AND YOO stalked between rivals early, was coaxed two then three wide on the far turn,
tipped out into the stretch and got up for third. FLAT OUT JOY bumped leaving the gate, was forwardly placed early three deep, went up to press the pace
from outside on the backstretch, took over past the half-mile marker, dueled inside WHISTLER'S STYLE on the far turn, carried a short lead into the lane,
lost command in upper stretch, then flattened late and lost the show. A NEW PEACE stepped to the front and set the pace on the inside, got pressured on
the backstretch and relinquished control past the half-mile pole, chased the leaders along the inside through the far turn and churned on through the lane
while failing to find more. INVINCIBELLA (GB) stalked the pace along the inside, lost positions around the far turn while under coaxing, tipped out into the
stretch and failed to respond. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE got bumped and crowded between rivals short after the start, raced three wide at the back early then
began to pull a bit, went three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

OUTRIGHT broke a step slow then went up to press between rivals then outside the leader, dueled on the far turn and took over at the quarter pole, put
away inner rival leaving the turn, met the challenge from COLONEL BOWMAN into the lane, lost command at the eight pole but fought back from inside and
gamely prevailed. COLONEL BOWMAN stalked two wide outside a rival then between foes, bid three deep into the stretch, put a nose in front at the eighth
pole, battled through the final furlong and edged by the winner. NEW EAGLE bobbled at the start, tracked four wide or four deep early, bumped early on the
far turn, gained in tandem with COLONEL BOWMAN on the far turn, bid four deep into the stretch and was no match for the top pair in the final furlong.
JACKS OUTLAW bobbled then went up to take control and moved inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and
lost command nearing the quarter pole, could not keep up into the stretch and weakened. PERFECTO AMOR rated on the inside, coaxed on the far turn
while continuing to save ground and weakened in the lane. OF GOOD REPORT chased three wide around the first turn, angled to the two path for the
second bend and could not rally. ASARO dropped back on the inside and pulled on the first turn, trailed into the stretch, moved out in the lane and was not a
factor. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was off a bit slow, forwardly placed three deep into the first turn, stalked the top pair up the backstretch outside rivals,
bumped early on the far turn, dropped back and tired.

SEE THROUGH IT chased four deep early, bid three deep around the turn, took over past the quarter pole, kicked clear upper stretch and held under
urging. COSMO raced between foes at the back then moved inside leaving the backstretch, saved ground while on the move through the turn, tipped out
and split foes while bumping at the eighth pole, rallied inside the winner but was too late. GRIT AND CURIOSITY raced three deep at the back early, outside
a rival in the two path into the turn, tipped three wide midway around the bend, rallied four wide in the lane but lacked the needed late punch. TED pressed
the pace from outside early, could not keep up with a quarter mile remaining, drifted in and bumped COSMO at the eight pole and flattened to fourth. HEAD
FOR BUSINESS set the pace under pressure from outside, put away TED at the quarter pole but challenged and soon overtaken by the winner late on the
turn, then weakened along the fence in the stretch. LITTLE DEMON brushed leaving the gate, raced inside a pair of rivals at the back, moved out to the two
path for the turn, kept on to improve position but failed to make an impact. UNCLE WILBUR chased five deep to the turn, dropped back around the bend,
angled in and came three wide into the stretch and weakened. BLAMELESS brushed at the start, balked and shifted out approaching the dirt crossing, went
up to race three deep early, was no match past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the drive.

late. MIXTO chased three then four wide on the first turn, entered the lane four to five wide, put in late run and earned the show honors. RIVERSIDE tucked
inside on the first turn and stalked the pace, moved out to the two path on the far turn, tipped out into the lane, drifted in upper stretch then drifted back out
and got edged for the show. MUCINO got put in tight entering the first turn and steadied, moved into range off the rail on the backstretch, came four wide
into the lane, altered in then back out, then lacked room between rivals late and lost all momentum. FLEET FEET was closest in pursuit on the outside,
applied pressure midway up the backstretch, took over with three furlongs remaining, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. RICH GOLD
was off tardily, trailed to the far turn and passed tired rivals. NULLARBOR cleared and angled in, showed the way up the backstretch, lost command at the
three-eighths pole and gave way. CAPACITY chased two wide then dropped back on the backstretch, trailed into the stretch and had little left. THE RIDER
ABOARD PRACTICAL MOVE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST FORT BRAGG AND THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. FOLLOWING A
REVIEW, FORT BRAGG WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR LUGGING OUT INTO THE PATH OF PRACTICAL MOVE AT THE TOP
OF THE LANE THEN LUGGING IN AND MAKING CONTACT MIDSTRETCH WHICH COST PRACTICAL MOVE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
LIL RICHARDS BELLO stalked the lone leader from inside, angled out into the stretch, rallied between and got up in the final moments. IN VRONSKY
STYLE bumped outer rival at the start, sped clear and set all the pace inside then two wide into the stretch, remained clear under urging into the final
sixteenth and got nailed on the line. MOOSE MITCHELL was forwardly placed in the two path into the turn, lugged out crossing the dirt, rallied three deep
late and finished a game third. MISCHIEVOUS PATH raced off the rail, went two to three wide around the bend, came out crossing the dirt, shifted upper
stretch, rallied widest and earned a minor award. SINGLE ME OUT drifted from the outside rail a bit early, stalked three deep into the turn, got forced out
crossing the dirt, closed well in the final sixteenth but was not enough. SQUARE CAT got bumped on both sides at the start, pulled between early, came
four wide into the stretch, moved inside and kept on trying while needing to find more late. HEAVEN'S MUSIC bumped leaving the gate, saved ground at the
back and never found the needed response.

DRIZELLA stalked four wide into the turn, raced three deep then three wide into the stretch, showed a mild response to urging and gained the place. CAL
sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path on the turn, was challenged from inside past the quarter pole, lost the lead
the top of the stretch, flattened late and got edged for the show. SHE LOVES KARAOKE settled on the inside and lacked the needed rally in the drive but
kept on for a minor award. CHAO MAR lacked early speed, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, moved out in the
lane and summoned a mild response. SECRET MANEUVER raced near the back early, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path, moved
out in the lane and improved position. MAGICAL LADY broke out and bumped rival, dropped back early, took the turn three wide, angled inward in the lane
and improved position. SUNNY LANE bumped and lost path at the start, raced between on the turn then two wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane
and could not rally. ROYAL BLEND settled off the pace, raced three deep on the turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE

EXCEED SPEED LIMIT settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top trio, took
over midstretch and drove clear. THORNE HOUSE chased four wide into the turn, bid three deep near the half-mile pole, got bumped into the stretch, took
over at the eighth pole but was soon overtaken midstretch and stayed on to hold second. BIG HAND was off a bit slow then lost his path to begin, dropped
back early and raced outside a pair of rivals, took the turn three wide, summoned a mild rally and gained the show honors. BRIX traveled near the back on
the inside, tipped out into the stretch, angled out further in the lane and kept on for a minor award. COWBOY CHARLIE stepped to the front quickly, set the
pace two wide into the turn, got pressured from outside around the bend, resisted to upper stretch then lost command at the eighth pole and flattened late.
LIL NAS tracked three wide into the turn, bid from outside around the bend, bumped with outer rival into the stretch, fought between in the lane and faltered
in deep stretch. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS was off a bit slow to start, raced between at the back then two wide on the turn, angled out crossing the dirt and
failed to menace. GRAZEN SUN stalked inside down the hill and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
GAME TIME got bumped from inside early then went up to duel for the lead from inside, took full control around the bend, took some pressure from
REINCARNATE on the backstretch and far turn, led clear without being asked yet into the lane, roused in upper stretch then urged right and left handed
urging and remained strong to the wire. REINCARNATE stalked four then three wide early, raced outside the leader up the backstretch, chased two wide
into the lane, could not reach GAME TIME in deep stretch and held the place. VALIANCER settled early and tucked inside, moved out on the backstretch
and advanced four deep on the far turn, angled down to the tow path leaving that bend, tipped out in the lane and gained the show. ZIO JO dueled for
command from outside into the first turn then ceded control to GAME TIME, stalked in the two path then outside a rival, remained two wide into the drive,
moved out and finished willingly while unable to earn the show. POST FACTO pulled and checked early on the first turn, tracked off the inside, coaxed along
but lacked room on the far turn, split foes at the quarter pole and could not summon the needed rally. BLUEGRASS RYDER broke in and bumped rival,
pulled and ran up on heels the shifted out and bumped rival into the first turn, was forced to check around that bend, finally settled on the inside, tipped out
and failed to menace. BOLD BALI was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside early, tipped two wide leaving the far turn and was never
a factor. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, got bumped into the three path by inside rival entering the first turn, went two wide into the
second bend, angled out to the four path and had little left for the drive. FAST FALL hit the gate, got forced out and checked on the clubhouse turn while
four wide, moved into range leaving the backstretch, went three deep on the far turn then steadied between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole and
weakened. BUFFETT shifted out and bumped rival early, stalked on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and faded.
