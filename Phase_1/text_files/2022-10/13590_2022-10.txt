Footnotes
RAISE THE PURSES reared at the start, pressed to the turn, dueled leader to the stretch, roused in the drive and held sway to the wire. ROLLIN SO
PERFECT ducked in from the gate, inside run to turn, checked several times going to the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and may have been best
today. MIXTER JENSEN sprint to the front inside, held path through turn but came up empty in the stretch run.

ran on between horses for the place spot. CARDIAC KID unhurried, rallied far turn, four wide rush in the stretch run but faltered in the late going.
GENERATOR raced a wide trip throughout with mild improvement late. MR. BIFFLE no speed to the stretch, split horses in the lane mildly late. DAY IN THE
COUNTRY inside speed, set pace to far turn, gave way readily. KICK IT CHARLIE chased pace to the half with a steady decline from that point. SONIC

Footnotes
TRASHTALKINYANKEE perfect position to the turn, three wide run stretch to go clear while ridden out to the wire in impressive order. PLAY BALL just off
pace three wide to turn, led into stretch, best of rest. I'M MONEY rushed between horses to turn, angled out into the stretch run for show spot. SAMURAI
SAINT good position to turn, switched out for the drive with a clear run into stretch for show. BOLD ADVENTURE bothered at the start, raced back to turn,
improved only. GET HAMMERED pressed leader between horses to mid stretch, faltered late. UNCLE EARL quick inside speed to the front gave way
readily inside stretch. BRINK POINT never a menace throughout. DR. ZARNETT gave way readily after the start, dropped far back from inside.
