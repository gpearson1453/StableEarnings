KING'S HOUSE quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn and coasted home while kept to his business. MANOLETE pursued the winner inside and made
a gradual gain in the stretch. CALL FITZROY was urged close up outside then flattened out in the final quarter mile. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far
behind inside then passed fading rivals. MASTER OF WAR dropped back three wide and was never in contention. CLASSIFIED INFO saved ground within
striking range but gave way readily and returned bleeding from the nostrils.

the pace outside, led briefly in midstretch but was outfinished. JUST STUFF IT hustled to the front inside, dueled through the turn then weakened late.
PEARLS AND HEELS urged close up between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. CHAMPAGNE SISTER trailed briefly on the turn, angled out and
lacked a rally. POP THE CLUTCH advanced extremely wide on the turn then gave way. HALLIGIRL prompted the leaders four wide down the backstretch
and gave way.

Footnotes
SILVER EDGE controlled the pace inside then held off a challenger and remained safe to the finish. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE broke alertly and pressed the
winner throughout, loomed a threat but could not get by. HARD STING dropped far behind, began a wide rally on the final turn and closed strongly. YES SIR
COLONEL was well placed behind the dueling leaders and faded after five furlongs. SPARTAK chased along the rail and retreated on the final turn.
VIKRAM raced three wide off the leaders and weakened steadily. CIVIL WAR broke slowest and was never in contention.

SO SWELL trailed early, swung wide advancing on the turn and into the lane then bid clear in the final furlong. CATALON stalked the pacesetters outside,
bid midway on the turn and finished willingly. ROLIN N CONTROLIN angled near the inside after the first quarter then rallied mildly in the stretch. HOPS
PETUNIA prompted the pace along the rail and weakened in the stretch. DAYS REMEMBERED chased three wide off the leaders and faded on the turn.
ORB'S PARTY GIRL hustled to a clear advantage off the inside and gave way in the stretch. SCARF broke alertly but dropped back and stopped abruptly.

foes, eased back to the outside on the turn then made a gradual late gain. BRUNO BARBER GIRL lacked speed inside, moved wide into the stretch and
closed well. JETS' DREAM dropped back early, advanced very wide and flattened out late. SHE'S A LINO forced the pace between foes then inside and
weakened in the stretch. DESI'S REWARD flashed speed along the rail then began faltering on the turn. STONE IN LOVE was within striking range down
the backstretch and gave way.

HEIR PORT broke alertly and moved clear, widened with very little urging and coasted home under wraps. KOBE B lacked speed, raced in traffic and rallied
wide in the stretch. APPEALING FUTURE went after the winner on the turn and weakened. HIDE THE RANSOM saved ground close up then flattened out
in the stretch. GEEBERT trailed early, advanced wide on the turn and finished willingly. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY dropped back inside and was never in
contention. REJECTED AGAIN chased in midpack then gave way readily. MIDNIGHTCHARLY lacked speed, moved extremely wide on the turn and
stopped.

wide on the final turn then bid inside rivals late to gain the place. DILLY DILLY PHILLY hustled to clear advantage, was collared into the stretch and faltered.
MISS LOYALTY pinched back at the start, rallied wide on the final turn and was no threat. INDIAN BELLA settled off the leaders outside and faded on the
final turn. TIZ A SHARPIE lagged far behind then passed stopping rivals. MARIANNA QUEEN dropped back early, raced wide and gave way readily. GONE
DREAMING prompted the pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

RISQUE'S JEWEL close up from the outset, rallied wide to the front on the turn then lasted in a long drive. RELENTLESS RUBY eased back in the opening
quarter, split foes in the stretch and closed well. HEY IT'S TATI saved ground just off the leaders then continued nicely in the stretch. SHIRLEY GREENE
trailed early, moved wide in the stretch and rallied. B B'S ROCKET dropped back in traffic and made up ground while no threat. RED PEPPER GRILL
lacked speed, chased inside and offered a mild rally. SPIRIT OR SPITE dueled outside with a narrow lead to the stretch and faded. STARSHIP ROGUE
lacked usual speed, moved very wide on the turn and was no factor. GAVICHI prompted the pace between rivals to the stretch and faltered.
