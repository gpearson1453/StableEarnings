Footnotes
LITTLELADYISAWOMAN raced in midpack from the four path, ranged up to bid from the five path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path in upper
stretch, drifted in, but held on. TWO BEER BUZZ was caught six wide around the first turn, raced from wellback in the three path, swung out to the seven
path into the lane, and ran on down the center for place. GLADIATORA tracked in the two path, was driven from the three path into the lane, and kept on for
show. CAYMAN QUEEN rated from the seven path, was driven from the path into the stretch, and stayed on. MOVE TO ORDER prompted the pace from
the three path, was roused between rivals going into the lane, but gave way late. POETIC UNION was unhurried from inside, saved ground into the lane, but
flattened. SHEA D SECRET led from the two path, was roused from three path at the top of the stretch, but yielded. TESTED POSITIVE staked from the
four path, was ridden three wide into the stretch but was empty. ANTRIM was hard to handle from the five path in the first turn but was done early.

Footnotes
SHES ALL WOMAN stalked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off while ridden out. NINJA ABARRIO was off slow, raced off the
pace four wide and ran on to gain the place. OUR FANTASY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, was collared by the
winner near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and held well enough to hold third. SADE PURSE failed to menace while racing two wide.
RASPBERRY BALLET was outrun inside. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace along the rail and gave way readily nearing the three-eighths marker.

Footnotes
MARWAD (GB) came in and bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, surged between rivals
and was up in deep stretch. SIGRUN FAST BOY settled off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms in
upper stretch, battled outside of foes and was outkicked by the winner late. WICKED FINN stalked the pace in the three path around the first turn, moved to
the front down the backstretch, cleared entering he far turn, set the pace in the two path around that bend, battled inside of foes through the stretch, came
out under left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole and shut off GREAT KING then was outfinished by the top two. GREAT KING (FR) set the early pace in
the two path, settled off WICKED FINN down the backstretch, angled to the three path near the three-eighths marker, re-bid between foes nearing the head
of the lane, battled between foes through much of the stretch then was shut off near the sixteenth pole. RUTHLESS INTENT bumped at the start, chased
the pace three and four wide and lacked a rally. PARKLAND chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. THE BIG GREY was squeezed back at the start
and trailed while racing in the two and three paths. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM TEH RIDER OF GREAT KING, WICKED FINN
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FORUTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
DANNYHILL prompted the pace from the two path, was hustled around the turn and into the lane, took the lead lead inside the final furlong, and just held
on. R REPOSADO LOCA broke out, bumped with an outer foe, and slightly steadied thereafter, raced from wellback in the five path, was ridden from the
seven path into the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. UNCAPTURED HEART got squeezed at the start, stalked in the four path, was roused to
make a bid from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. PERFECT PROVISION led from the four path, tucked into the two path going into the
turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but yielded in deep stretch. KILLARGUE'S GIRL trailed from the three path, drifted out to the seven
path into the stretch, but was one paced. IT'S NORA NOW broke in and bumped at the start, tracked in the five path but was empty at the top of the lane.
IMAHONKYTONKGIRL got squeezed at the start, rated from the three path but was no menace.

MR MAC QUHAE saved ground well back, made progress at the rail around the far turn, split rivals two wide nearing the quarter pole, tipped three wide in
upper stretch, swept to the front near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. MY WAY OR NO WAY set a pressured pace in the two path, won the duel
inside of TOSCANITO but could not withstand the winner. GHOSTINYOU raced well back two wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn, shifted
widest in upper stretch and rallied for the show. TOSCANITO pressed the pace in the three path, dueled around the far turn and through the sixteenth pole
then weakened. MACK was in range inside, chased three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. BYE BYE DAVID saved ground off the pace, made
some progress two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the final furlong. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR chased the pace three and four wide and tired in
the stretch. PETER D was outrun inside. SONIC KITTEN played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
BLACK BELT BARBIE stalked from the three path, made a bid from the six path around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and drew
clear. DEFENDER GAL chased from inside, was coaxed while saving ground into the lane, and ran on for place. DA JOURNEYGIRL was hustled to set the
pace from the two path, was roused from the four path into the lane, and kept on to hold show. TOODALOO Y'ALL raced in midpack from the three path but
was one paced through the lane. WICKLOW GAL was bumped by an inner foe, raced from wellback in the six path but flattened in the stretch. LADY KITTY
broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated in the five path but was no factor. CHALCOLITHIC ducked out after the start nearly losing the rider, distantly
trailed, and was no threat. EXAGERADORA tracked in the four path but was done early.

Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH was bumped at the start, stalked the pace two wide while always in traffic, angled to the rail in upper stretch, found a seam inside
of the pacesetter, took over near the sixteenth poled and edged ahead under a drive. BLUEY pressed the pace in the three path and kept trying through the
lane while outkicked by the winner. MAJOR KING saved ground in range, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. DOUBLE WARRIOR veered
in at the start, prompted the pace in the four path and was outfinished in the lane. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path,
yielded near the sixteenth pole and weakened. HIDDEN TRUTH was pinched back at the start, raced off the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid.
CAPTURETHELAUGHTER was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. FORT ATTITUDE was bumped at the start then forced to check
soon after and made little impact thereafter while racing two wide. FORTY DREAMS was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground and played no
factor. SALTY BIRD was outrun while racing three wide.
