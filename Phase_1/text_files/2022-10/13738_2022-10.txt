Footnotes
MOVE IT raced within striking distance, came around the turn off the rail, angled out somewhat down the stretch and got up late for the win. BAYOU BEAUX
vied on the front end, came around the turn three wide, drove clear down the home stretch and was caught late for the win. PAY DIRT dueled for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a late kick and proved no match for the top two. SONIC CITY lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but was no
real threat. PAT ME DOWN raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. OH SNAP lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and
was never a factor. WARRIORS HAVEN raced in the middle of the pack and weakened. NASTY EXAGGERATOR broke out, raced near the back and was
never close. AUTOCRATIC had a tight start, racing in the back and showed little. GETTINHOT'NHERE showed early speed, saved ground around the turn
and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

NATE'S REVENGE unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide bid and drove clear. NINEJUANJUAN CALL
lacked early speed, racing wide around the first turn, made a late gain and closed willingly. LOUIS LE GRANDE dueled for the early lead, raced close
throughout, lacked a late kick and proved no match for the top two. DARE TO FAIL vied for the early lead, saved ground around the second turn and hung.
LOU'S ARROW raced in the middle of the pack, eased back and passed tired ones late. HALF A BUCK flashed early speed and faded. MR. SNOWFLAKE
raced within contention, being reserved, came around the first turn on the outside, faded and was no threat late. CAPTAINS COVE always raced near the
back and was outrun. 1/4 SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
DINAR pressed the pace, raced close throughout, dueled down the home stretch with EASY TO MISS and drove clear before the wire. EASY TO MISS
went to the front, drove clear, dueled late, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. GRAND LUWEGEE raced within contention, came around
the final turn on the outside, proved no match for the top two, but held on for show. JIMI'S A STAR lacked early speed, moved up outside around the second
turn, made a bid and was outfinished for the show. SEAU pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. MAGEEZ void of early
speed and was never a factor. HALF AGAIN hopped at the start, racing near the back and was never a threat. SNIVELING raced near the middle of the
field, came around the final turn on the outside and dropped back.
