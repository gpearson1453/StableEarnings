Footnotes
OSO NEGRO unhurried in the early part, moved up, racing four wide around the final turn, made an outside bid and was going away at the end. POLICY
LIMIT challenged for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn, couldn't match strides with the winner down the lane, but was a clear second.
IDE LIKE HAWAII raced in the middle of the field, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. WAR REPORTER pressed the early pace, while
racing inside, lacked a late kick and finished evenly. OUT MAKING TREBLE lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, improved position, but
was no factor. WITCH'S VOW raced within striking distance and weakened. WHISKEY GENT went to the front, saved ground and faded. MORO COOL void
of early speed and was never close. MONITOR MILLS showed early speed, while racing four wide around the first turn, faded, got in tight quarters down the
final stretch and was no threat late. FLIT N FLOT TIME always race near the back and showed little.

GOLDEN QUALITY challenged for the lead throughout, saved ground, drove clear late and won under steady urging. HESACALENDARBOY brushed at the
start, racing in the back at the start, rushed up, vied on the front end, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but was best of others. ROYAL DE BE
raced within contention, saved ground and proved no match for the top two. KISSMEISTER lacked early speed, had an outside trip, made a bid and was
caught late for show. VERDUNVILLE raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. ROYAL D D broke in, void of early speed and was never
a factor. TED STRIKER showed early speed and dropped back. VALENTORO always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
BEYOND THE HYPE pressed the pace, moved up on the inside around the second turn and pulled away down the stretch. ANIME DAY raced within
striking distance, had an outside trip, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but held off GLORY TO ME for second. GLORY TO ME pressed the early
pace, eased back, made a late bid, racing four wide and missed second. CAJUN ACES lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SUDDEN
IMPULSE raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and finished evenly. LAST DESTINY quickly went to the front and faded. OVERLY
SWEET void of early speed and was never close. COPPER BELLE challenged on the front end and dropped back.
