Footnotes
MR. CONNECTICUT angled in towards the rear down the opening straightaway, settled while saving ground at the back, was roused nearing the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner with a clear rail opening into upper stretch, rallied along the rail to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held sway from
the fast closing runner-up under strong urging in a beautiful trip. OUSTER was taken under a tight hold early, traveled around the first turn in the two path,
was reserved towards the back, brushed with a rival near the three-eighths, rounded the far turn in the three path, shifted five wide while inside of
DREAMPOINT at the quarter-pole, was kept in by that foe while trying hard to get out into upper stretch, steadied while blocked then moved in behind
horses nearing the furlong marker, came under gradually increased urging from that point while altering outside into the clear, was roused for more when
finding the outside approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished very fast for the place but was too late for victory in a tough trip. CONQUIST was hustled
from the start, tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, engaged the leader leaving the backstretch, took the advantage inside the five-sixteenths,
spun four wide into upper stretch, led under a drive until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to hold the show. DREAMPOINT went
three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside while given cover, came under urging late on the backstretch, brushed with a foe near the
three-eighths, was urged four wide around the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, kept OUSTER stuck in behind horses past the three-sixteenths,
chased into the final sixteenth then drifted in and was out-kicked but willingly earned the last spot in the superfecta. BIONDI was hustled from the gate,
showed the way on the inside, was challenged leaving the backstretch, lost the advantage inside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, fought
on well into the final furlong but was outfinished. BORN DANCER navigated the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, chased in the three path
around the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. VALENTINO'S HERE was pinched
back in tight between foes after the start, saved ground under a tight hold around the first turn, tossed his head keenly early on the backstretch, was let out
while continuing to save ground on the far turn, shifted three wide while roused at the quarter-pole and also lacked the needed kick. BERNARDINO was
hustled from the start, went three wide around the opening bend, settled outside without cover, was urged four wide around the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
PIONEER SPIRIT hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and edged clear under a drive to prevail. DARK STORM along the inside through the first turn, chased three to four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking to the two path near the half mile pole, came under coaxing and tucked inside at the three-eighths marker, swung three wide
for home and ran on to secure the place honors. BOURBON BAY coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then ran on to secure the show honors. HAMMERIN AAMER chased two to three wide until
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, continued along the inside into upper stretch and improved position by tired
foes. KUMAR chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. CARIBBEAN (AUS) hustled
from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered three wide into upper stretch and tired. CRYPTO CASH bobbled
at the break under coaxing, had the leader remain out in the two path and advanced along the rail through the first turn to be noses apart for command with
seven furlongs to run, got taken in hand and was backed off with five furlongs to go easing off to near the rear of the field, got guided outside nearing the far
turn appearing as though something was amiss and was eased up appearing ready to be pulled up in the turn losing action, then continued under a light
gallop through to the eighth pole displaying that poor action when met by the outrider and was subsequently escorted the rest of the way home and then
walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CORKMAN went three then four wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged in the four path around the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a strong drive, gained the lead outside the furlong marker, moved clear outside the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. UNCLE
WATER FLOW hit the outside of the gate then stumbled at the start and was slow into stride, went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably
at the rear, came under urging late on the backstretch, gained four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch and closed strongly to just miss
while clear for the place. MILLEAN stumbled at the start and bumped solidly with a foe, raced inside under a snug hold early on the first turn then shifted
three wide in front of ENDOWED, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader while in hand, was asked in the three path on the far turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, battled with two foes into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. ABUNDANT HONOR brushed with a rival
at the start then was hustled to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged
along in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch a bit closer to the rail, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. EMPEROR'S CAUSE
settled on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground around the far turn, came out and bumped with a foe inside the
three-sixteenths, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. ROYAL TRYST broke out and brushed with a foe, went two to three wide on the
turn and was no factor. ENDOWED started the first turn in the two path, was forced three wide by MILLEAN outside the seven-eighths then checked off
heels and dropped back, settled outside down the backstretch, was urged two to three wide around the far turn, bumped with a rival inside the
three-sixteenths and came up empty.

Footnotes
BE OF COURAGE was coaxed along on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, gained to take the lead
in upper stretch, shook clear of his mounted rivals outside the furlong marker but was directly outside of the loose horse, was kept off the loose horse by the
rider in the final furlong and widened from the rest under hand-urging. FACTUALLY CORRECT showed the way under some pressure to his outside, shook
clear of his mounted foes while inside on the turn but was joined on the outside by the loose horse and took pressure from that foe, was taken up by the
rider at the quarter-pole, steadied repeatedly while trying to avoid the loose horse from that point to around the eighth-pole, gave up the advantage in the
process, kept on in pursuit of the winner while on his inside lead in the final furlong and safely secured the place. DISARMED was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, jostled with a foe in the two path into upper stretch, moved out nearing the furlong marker and weakened while
able to get the show. KID EMERALD was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. TATER AND TOT broke out then was bumped in the hindquarters, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the two path around the
turn, jostled with a foe while three wide into upper stretch, moved out while dropping back approaching the furlong marker and tired. MAKAR broke in then
bumped with a foe and was off a bit slow, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, brushed with a foe near the
three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. JOYFUL GHOST broke out and bumped with a foe, tracked the early pace on the outside,
dropped back with a half-mile to run, raced between horses in the two path around the turn and failed to respond. NO REGARD bumped with a rival at the
start then dropped back, was urged along well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. ALWAYS HUSTLIN was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, traveled around the turn in the three path and was no factor. CAMM' DUKE ducked in sharply while also propping a bit at the
start and unseated the rider then was walked off after being apprehended. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
AMUNDSON was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was asked under threat outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when when given one pop of a right-handed crop in upper stretch then switched to a left-handed crop, fought with the
runner-up to the wire and held gamely under strong urging. RAGTIME BLUES stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path around
the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled outside of the runner-up in the stretch and was denied while well clear for the place. MOUNT
TRAVERS was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, was asked along the rail on the turn and came up empty while best of
the rest. LASTCHANCEATGLORY bobbled at the start and was off a bit slow, settled off the pace, was urged along in the four path around the turn and also
came up empty. NIGHT OPS was hustled from the start, angled in under urging while off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch, moved further out outside the furlong marker and was no factor. BRONX BOMBER settled off the pace, was urged five wide around on the turn,
spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. POPPY'S PRIDE broke a bit slow and was last to commence, settled off the pace, was urged while moving
from the rail to the two path around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DAUNT broke out a step at the start bumping EXULT in tandem with FIGHTER IN THE WIN, who broke inwards, chased three wide from just off the pace,
tucked to the two path put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong out,
dueled through to the finish with the runner up and gamely prevailed at the end. FIGHTER IN THE WIN broke in at the start bumping EXULT in concert with
the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under threat dueling through the final furlong in game fashion but was ultimately bested at the end. DRIPPING GOLD a bit rank
under restraint just off the inside through the first turn, settled tracking from the two path in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and missed at the finish. ORCHESTRATION two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit
from near the rear of the field, came under a ride with five-sixteenths to go, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid but was
out-finished in the late stages. EXULT got bumped between foes who each broke his way at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. HILLIARD coaxed from the gate, saved ground near the rear of the
field, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, went six wide at the head of the stretch made mild progress but was outkicked. GOOD
MEDICINE just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, swung three wide at the top of the stretch
and weakened in the late stages. SARANAC (FR) grew rank off the heels of the leader along the inside through the first turn and was steadied off twice
through that bend and once past the stands for the initial time, settled tracking along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MO REWARDS saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under motivation with
five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
