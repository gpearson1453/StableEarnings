REMARKABLE ANGEL away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of WIDE AWAKE in
the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of her pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. INDYGOGOLD unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, launched her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, swung wide leaving the turn, and closed steadily five wide in the
lane to get up for the place in the closing strides. WIDE AWAKE broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of REMARKABLE ANGEL entering
the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering
the lane, and just failed to hold the place in the final strides.

LAUGH WITH ME raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace throughout from the inside of FRANKIE MACHINE, got
the better of that rival leaving the final turn, and held ARTISTIC JEWLER safely at bay in deep stretch to prove best. ARTISTIC JEWLER tracked the
battling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail under snug restraint, continued to pull herself along in a tracking position through the
stretch the second time and in the run down the backstretch, tipped three wide to commence her bid entering the final turn, and battled gamely three wide in
the drive to secure the place. FRANKIE MACHINE pressed the pace from the outside of LAUGH WITH ME through the first turn and into the backstretch the
first time, continued to force the issue into the backstretch the final time, rallied two wide into the final turn while battling for the lead, was unable to match
strides with his pace rival entering the lane, but battled determinedly from along the inside in the drive, and just missed the place.

PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the uncontested early pacesetter while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid from
along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive, and assumed control late to prove best. ZETAMARIE lagged well off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed steadily from along the rail in
the drive to get up for the place. TOBESUNNY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn,
and finished with late interest from along the inside in the drive to get up for a share. ARIKARA away alertly and sprinted to the lead from just off the rail
entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside, maintained a clear lead into the final turn, but began to weaken entering the
lane, and had little left late. THE KAT'S BACK broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail from between
rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while being outfinished late.
ANOTHERSUNNYDAY away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn
while struggling to hold her position, and faded over the final furlong.

DANCING WITH LIL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of FILLY
FATALE in the run down the backside and into the final turn, drifted off the rail leaving the turn and was quickly overtaken by WELLSLEY, but finished
determinedly three wide in the drive to re-take the lead in the final stride to prevail. WELLSLEY away well, and tracked the leaders in the run down the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn while awaiting racing room, slipped through at the rail to
assume command entering the lane, but was unable to fend off a resilient DANCING WITH LIL in the final stride. FILLY FATALE away alertly and tracked
the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pace from the outside of DANCING WITH LIL in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to garner a share, while gaining late. ENGLISH BAY
TEDDY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly five wide in the drive while gaining late. DADDY'S PEPPER took an awkward step in the opening strides and lagged well off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the drive. ROARING
DESTINY stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, but was
outfinished in the late stages. DIVAANY clipped heels and stumbled while drifting slightly entering the first turn, held a stalking trip from along the inside in
the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly late while racing five wide in the drive. BETTER WITH TIME settled
off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, but failed to make a late impact when called upon. JUST MISTY dwelt at the start
to get away poorly, trailed the field into the first turn, lost touch with the filed in the run down the backstretch, and showed little. A stewards inquiry into an
incident entering the first turn as well as into the start of the race, resulted in no action being taken, and the original order of finish stood.

BELCARRA PARK raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and
fought on bravely from along the rail in the drive to repel the bid by PRETTY ARIA to prevail. PRETTY ARIA broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss.
WANDALITA away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch, began to advance midway
down the backstretch and smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. VIVA LA
VINO settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and improved her position
over the final furlong while finishing three wide in the drive. ALOBRAH tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied
from along the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS away well and settled off the early pacesetter while
racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. MARYS TAPPIN
SHOES unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

VALUABLE COWBOY broke sharply and dueled for the lead through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, assumed command midway down the
backstretch, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened his margin late under confident handling. COUNTRY COWBOY away well and
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive to prove clearly second best. WISELY PLAYED hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and vied for the lead from along the rail through the first
turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival in the run to the final turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. HANKY PRANKY settled off the early pace while racing four wide in the run down the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final
turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. BETTER TONE unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, commenced his bid
two wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest four wide in the drive. SHARPZAN settled well off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail entering he backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while lacking room late.
GREYTOGO away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering he final turn, but
weakened in the stretch drive.

AUNTIE J away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside
and into the final turn, shook clear of her pace rival entering the stretch, and was never seriously threatened late. DRILL BABY DRILL stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly
to get up for the place. SHE'S ON FIRE broke sharply and checked slightly nearing the wire the first time, before taking up the chase and pressing the
leaders two wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of AUNTIE J through the final turn, was unable to match
strides with that foe leaving the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. PERFECT PENNY settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground while commencing her bid entering the final turn, and finished from along the
rail in the drive. QUALITY PLUS was fractious prior to the start, and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when finishing from along the inside in the drive. JERSEYS IMAGE away alertly and
drifted four wide entering the first turn while carrying a rival out with her, settled off the early pace while racing three wide from between rivals in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, but failed to seriously menace. HARBOUR STORM was carried five wide entering the first turn before settling mid
pack into the backstretch with a four wide trip, continued four wide into the final turn, and was unable to make a late impact. CANADIAN THISTLE took a
couple awkward steps in the run away from the gate, before settling well off the early pace entering he backstretch, raced two wide into the final turn, but
failed to make a late impact when called upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of SHE'S ON FIRE lodged a
claim of foul against the rider of AUNTIE J for alleged interference approaching the wire the first time. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no
change was made to the original order of finish.
