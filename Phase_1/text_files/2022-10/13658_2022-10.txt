THIRTY THOU KELVIN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command at the three-sixteenths and inched away under a drive kept to task. COOKIE CRUMBS hustled from the gate, prompted the pace four then three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, ran on to secure the place honors. DESERT TEMPEST coaxed from the gate,
showed the way three then two wide under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off
the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and kept on to preserve the show honors. GUSTIAMO coaxed from the start, chased
five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, briefly tucked three wide before angling back out five wide into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive. TONIC got bumped between foes at the start and conceded two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside
growing detached at the tail of the field, went two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DANCING SOPHIA coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged clear under a drive kept to task. FIREWOLVES four then three wide in closest aim of the leader,
advanced to take over command just inside the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under
threat and was collared at the eighth pole, ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. TEKILA bobbled at the break, chased along the inside until
tipped to the two path midway on the turn placed to coaxing, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show
honors. TONIGHT WE LOVE bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, got bumped by CARLANN at the three-sixteenths and tired. REGAL REBEL broke out at the
start, showed the way in hand three then two wide, got displaced from the front just inside the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing inside the
three-eighths and faded, went three to four wide for home and folded in the stretch. KUKARO chased along the inside early on and then just off the inside,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CARLANN chased two to three wide
down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, went six wide into upper stretch, grew erratic near the
three-sixteenths overreacting under the direction of the rider bumping TONIGHT WE LOVE, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
COLORMEPAZZI established the top prior to making its way onto the main track, was kept on hold showing the way, planted along the inner border of the
two path, feeling some light pressure from the outside, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was given its cue, saw the second place finisher loom boldly
by the beginning of the last eighth, dug in good determination to fend that opponent off. BLITZ TO WIN pulled off his next stall neighbor after coming out
with its initial step, took up residence along the inside route, was under some encouragement keeping pace during the run around the bend, got set down
coming up to the quarter pole, launched his way into the contention during the next furlong, appearing poised to strike the front end with an eighth to go,
fought on fiercely but could not go by. DANGEROUS EDGE away without apparent mishap, angled over to the rail approaching the half mile pole, stayed
put until the end of the bend, shifted out gradually about five wide once in the lane, went on to secure the show. G MUNNING chased the pace three wide
on the turn, was slightly wider at the commencement of the stretch drive, rallied mildly for the final significant slice of the pot. FORTY TWO ACE a forward
factor from the get-go, raced from between rivals from the two path on the turn, was moved out slightly wider entering the stretch, gave way. SALUTE TO
AMERICA hung out three wide on the turn, ventured five to six wide in the stretch, never made his presence felt.

flicked off the aforementioned foe midway on the turn, was more towards path three settling onto the head of the stretch, extended the advantage, padded
the margin even farther when asked asked leaving the eighth pole, ventured onward in the last sixteenth with the pilot mainly flashing the whip from the right
side. WESTERN LANE off the inside, raced three wide on the turn, shifted out one path wider for the stretch drive, proved no match. DIAMOND STATUS
along the inside and pulling a bit on the bit from the left, vied with with the winner until the general area of the three-eighths pole, faded steadily after getting
shaken off. PRETTY PERSUASIVE set to some hand urging after springing from the starting gate failed to pick it up, angled over to the rail as the half was
being completed, continued to bring up the back of the pack, was sent out four wide making her way onto the top one, had no gain, then after being eased
was pulled up in mdlane and subsequently vanned off.

ROSSA VELOCE settled into the two path after the field had been sent on its way, disputed the pace, vying with BLAME IT ON MARY to her inside until
midway on the turn, had the second place finisher draw up as the primary pursuer soon afterwards, saw that opponent already under a hard drive stepping
onto the top of the lane, was right around the three-sixteenths pole when finally set down to a strong drive herself, shook free to a comfortable advantage
then got geared down with slightly under seventy yards remaining. THINKING IT OVER off the rail throughout, chased the front runners three wide on the
turn, crept up to the winner late on the bend, was under a drive taking the four path for entrance into the stretch attempting to issue a challenge in earnest,
got outfinished and had to settle for the place. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY at the rear of the pack, was maneuvered over to the rail before arriving at the end
of the backstretch, sat isolated from the others, lightly hand urged, flashed some interest as the half was being reeled off, moved to the outside for the
stretch drive, eventually getting worked into path four, went on to finish a non-threatening third. JILL'S A HOT MESS saved ground before slipping to the
outside at the five-sixteenths pole, got sent out spinning off the turn, ventured approximately four while tiring in the lane. BLAME IT ON MARY along the
inside, went at it on near terms with ROSSA VELOCE until midway on the turn, gave out.

SKIMS (GB) forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn, settled tracking in closest aim of the leader from the two path, advanced steadily given
a notch to work with three furlongs from home and took over command with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the stretch
drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the finish kept to task. VERGARA settled tracking the front along the inside from
the pocket, tipped out to the two path near the five-sixteenths nudging CANISY three wide, got let out spinning from the two path into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive chasing the winner home and cutting into her margin steadily while along willingly for the place honors. EMINENT VICTOR stepped inwards
hitting the near side stall at the start before recovering outwards to brush with CANISY, raced along the inside early on before tipping to the two path
through the first turn, tracked two then briefly three wide, came under light coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got asked angled three to four wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. PIZZA BIANCA settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until let out angled five
wide at the head of the stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, bumped with HAIL TO straightened away and offered up a mild bid but was
out-kicked to the wire. CANISY three wide through the first turn, tracked the front two to three wide from mid pack, tucked to the two path through the far
turn, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths and was nudged three wide by VERGARA tipping out to her inside, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. HAIL TO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way under rating just off the inside past the
stands the initial time and into the opening bend, tucked inside six furlongs from home, rode the rail down the backstretch and into the far turn awaiting a
challenge and got one nearing the five-sixteenths, yielded the front at that station and failed quicken cutting the corner into upper stretch, traded a bump
with SPIRIT AND GLORY with three-sixteenths to run and weakened through to the finish. LADY BAFFLED forwardly placed three to four wide in closest
aim of the leader, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths and went three to four wide through the far turn retreating to near the rear when swinging
five wide at the top of the stretch, then faltered in the drive and was eased home to the wire.

dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was just up on the wire to score. BREEZE EASY (GB) tracked the pace along the
inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped three wide at the eighth pole, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug
in and was nailed in the very last jump to the wire. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE broke in at the start commencing a chain of bumps down through to
FONTANAFREDDA, chased along the inside in aim of the leader early on, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors.
FONTANAFREDDA got bumped at the start and was pinched out and forced to check conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to steadily
gain to the finish after a rough start. GLITTER UP showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. STUCK ON KITTEN got bumped at the
start by RUNAWAY ROCKETTE and in turn bumped VIOLENT VIXEN into SHE'S THE ONE, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MISS TAPIRADO chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. VIOLENT VIXEN got bumped at the start by STUCK ON KITTEN and in turn bumped
SHE'S THE ONE, chased along the inside under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. SHE'S THE ONE
broke out at the start bumping VIOLENT VIXEN, then came inwards off pressure from outside and took over the lane of FONTANAFREDDA forcing that
rival to check off her heels when pinched out between foes, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. GET THE CANDY four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.
