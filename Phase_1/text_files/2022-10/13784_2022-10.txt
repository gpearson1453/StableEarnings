Footnotes
GRAZED MY HEART got bumped on both sides in the beginning, unhurried in the two path then angled inside a rival on the clubhouse turn, tipped to the
two path on the far turn, ran into traffic briefly behind a wall of rivals leaving the bend, altered to the inside then tipped out midstretch and surged by LOYAL
TO A FAULT late. LOYAL TO A FAULT stepped to the front and moved inside, controlled the pace through the early going, remained clear into the final
sixteenth but could not fend off the winner. VIOLET CROWN was crowded inside the leader early, stalked along the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the lane,
lacked a bid but finished a clear third. SMOOVE AS SILK brushed the winner shortly after the start then shifted out early, stalked the pace outside a rival,
tipped three wide around the far turn and failed to rally when called upon. BIG GIFT bumped with GRAZED MY HEART in the beginning, was closest in
pursuit from the two path through the early stages, remained in range two wide into the drive but weakened down the lane. MISS KALINE pulled and raced
greenly along the inside then moved off the rail, continued to fight the rider on the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn, drifted in and out
in the lane and failed to menace.

while moving off the rail, ran into traffic behind rivals in upper stretch and altered widest with furlong left to run and was along for the show. FIRST PREMIO

Footnotes
AMERICAN LILY was away well and pressed the pace from outside, traveled two wide around the turn, raced on even terms late on the turn, took over at
the top of the stretch, put away SECRET FIX past the eight pole and widened to the wire. SECRET FIX went up to take control from inside, set the pace
under pressure into and around the turn, dueled into the stretch, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane, could not go on with AMERICAN LILY
midstretch but stayed on to secure the place. AWESOME TAYLOR stalked the top pair two to three wide to the stretch and failed to summon the needed
response. SUPER RENEE stumbled leaving the gate, settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn and never threatened. FRIED ASPARAGUS was
off slow in the beginning, trailed three wide into the turn, continued off the rail into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS BETTINA reserved in the two path early on then moved inside, steadied when running up behind DIVINELY BOLT into the far turn, split foes at
the quarter pole then angled out leaving the bend, reached the front in upper stretch and cleared with a furlong remaining and held well. SUNSET GLORY
(IRE) was off slow to begin, raced between at the back into the first turn then outside a rival, traveled three deep into the second bend, came five wide into
the stretch, finished willingly from outside but lacked the needed late punch. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER traveled three deep at the back into the first turn then
dropped to last and angled inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, produced a mild rally but got outkicked by the top pair.
DIVINELY BOLT stalked the pace on the inside, waited for room on the far turn, could not progress through traffic in upper stretch, found room between
rivals then moved to the inside and kept on for a minor award. MONIQUE was off slow to begin, angled to the inside racing at the back into the first turn,
moved out on the backstretch, traveled two to three wide on the far turn and failed to menace. DASH AWAY dueled into the first turn then pressed from
outside, fought into and around the far turn, then weakened in the stretch run. LOANA tracked three deep into the first turn, raced outside a rival three wide
into the far turn, got floated out into the stretch and faded. SHIRLEY'S BANE dueled into the first turn then inched ahead around that bend, set the pace
under pressure up the backstretch, maintained the lead through the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. GOOD AS GONE broke well then
tracked in the two path, chased along the rail into the far turn then dropped back between rivals around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
HOPKINS quickly took control and showed the way up the backstretch, led in the two path then along the rail into the stretch, asked in upper stretch and
responded nicely by drawing away in the deep stretch. KRAHENBUHL raced in range from outside early on, inched closer four deep early on the turn then
bid outside HOPKINS with a quarter mile left to run, could not keep up entering the final furlong and stayed on to hold the place. PURIFIED chased along
the rail into the turn, tipped out into the stretch and kept on for a clear third. PIROLI brushed leaving the gate, tracked three wide into the turn, moved out
and got bumped four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, remained wide into the stretch and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. PRINCIP was off
slow to begin, rounded the bend four wide, moved out further in the drive and improved position. TENTH STREET DON was off slow to begin then pulled
while trying to be reserved off the pace, took the turn two wide then angled to the inside and failed to menace. OMERTA CODE raced off the pace in the
early going, entered the turn three wide, steered down to the inside and never responded. STORMING CHROME brushed with inner rival at the start,
chased between early, two to three wide on the bend and weakened. ANDROS was closest in pursuit outside the leader early, went three deep into the turn,
bumped outer rival at the five-sixteenths pole and faded.

CLASSICAL CAT chased three then two wide outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, roused two to three wide on the far turn, engaged the leader with a
furlong left to run and drove clear. KID AZTECA settled three then two wide early, closed in three to four wide on far turn, bid three deep approaching the
eight pole but got outkicked by the winner. CASTLEKNOCK sprinted clear and steered to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged by rivals with
a furlong left to run and yielded in deep stretch. TOP OF MY GAME hit the gate and came away last, traveled two wide then angled to the rail near the back
on the first turn, entered the lane two wide, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. MARDUKAS chased in the two path then along the rail early,
saved ground to the stretch, moved out and lacked further response. THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) was closest in pursuit on the inside early, roused in the
two path on the far turn but failed to sustain the momentum leaving the turn and weakened down the lane. POP D'ORO dropped back on the inside, saved
ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

late. TALKATIVE GAL broke well then chased along the inside, tipped two wide leaving the turn, drew alongside the leader midstretch, took over in the final

pace and steered to the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to make an impact. IT'S A RIDDLE bumped with outer rival at the start, chased two

Footnotes
KOLOMIO broke a step slow, raced three deep early then shifted four wide into the first turn, steered back into the two path around the bend, closed in two
then three wide on the far turn, rallied outside the top pair and edged BLUEGRASS RYDER in the final moments. BLUEGRASS RYDER was closest in
pursuit two wide then along the rail on the first turn, closest in past the half-mile pole, reeled in the leader and drew alongside leaving the far turn, reached
the front in upper stretch, put away that rival past the eight pole, then fought with KOLOMIO in deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. KEEN TO GO settled in
the two path then moved to the rail, came two wide into the stretch, produced a mild rally and bested the rest. ZOOKEEPER sprinted clear and steered to
the inside while opening up a large lead early, held a diminished lead leaving the backstretch, engaged by BLUEGRASS RYDER entering the stretch, failed
to offer much resistance and relinquished control, then weakened in the final furlong. SOUTH COAST ROUTE unhurried in the beginning and moved inside,
raced between foes leaving the backstretch, was in tight briefly near the five-sixteenths pole, went two to three wide into the lane, then tipped out and tired.
SCHMEAR was off slow and came out at the start, trailed two wide around the clubhouse turn, went three deep into the second end, angled out and came
four to five wide into the stretch, shifted ground near the eight pole and weakened. ICE STORM broke a step slow, tracked four deep then got floated five
wide into the first turn, moved back down to the three path, stayed off the rail to the stretch and weakened. CARRIZO SPRINGS settled along the inside,
asked around the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and came up empty.
