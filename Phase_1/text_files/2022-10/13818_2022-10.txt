Footnotes
AEGONTHECONQUEROR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, repelled a challenge from PAID THE PREACHER at the furlong marker, shook clear
and drew off while being kept to the task. PAID THE PREACHER tracked the pace, angled out into the turn and gained position on the two path through the
turn, came three wide into then stretch bidding outside the leader, lapped onto that one at the furlong marker while drifting in, then was no match, while
clearly best of the rest. CALL ME PEAK well placed, tracked the leader through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, then
drifted in and could not gain. BISHI never far back, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and ran evenly.
TUDOX I DON'T BRAG well placed and outside, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. MY FREEDOM broke
slowly from the gate, veering in and was never involved.

Footnotes
JETTIN OUT mid pack and between, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, dueled with
OLDZFOURFORTYTWO and edged ahead of that one in the final strides. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO mid pack and inside, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, dueled with the winner, edged ahead late and was outfinished. CLAW mid pack and between, steadied for
racing room into the turn, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and lacked the needed late
kick. CAPTAIN MAD JACK well placed and between, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, gained a short
lead, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. SUNSHINE CHARLIE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane, then weakened the final furlong and missed a share. K'S LITTLE BILL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked, waited, angled in and could not gain in the late going. STRETCH RUNNER allowed to settle,
moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DONALD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start
and faded the final furlong. ANOTHER BREEZE was never involved. WHISKEY DASH was no factor.

READY TO VENTURE (GB) tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady
gain while drifting out, edged ahead at the furlong marker and held. MISS MIKAELA sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held sway without challenge to the
stretch, stayed on when challenged, then was unable to gain on the winner, was best of the rest. LAKE LUCERNE allowed to settle, saved ground on the
two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then made a steady gain and evened out the final furlong.
GLADYS rated close up and off the rail, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, flattened and held a
share. DECIDING VOTE allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TASS mid
pack and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded the final furlong. DANA'S
BEAUTY well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn and faded into the stretch. CHRISTMAS DIAMOND (GB) ran evenly.

furlong marker. THISAINTJUMPSTREET well placed, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
lacked the needed late kick and held the place. MAMA LONGLEGS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged at the furlong
marker, then weakened late and held the show. FED UP FIRED UP allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled in and
came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain and got up for a share. MIDNIGHT LEAP ran evenly. MAUK'S TUFF well placed, lost some ground
three wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. BEE WINGS tracked the pace angled out to the two path into the second turn and faded.
