JUNE GLOOM rated off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on DR. TROUTMAN on the far turn, steadily
closed on that rival in upper stretch, confronted the runner-up inside of the furlong grounds, determinedly battled to the wire and prevailed in the final strides.
DR. TROUTMAN was away a step slowly and was hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions while on a long lead through the backstretch run, was
confronted by JUNE GLOOM in mid-stretch, battled gamely with that rival to the wire, was bested in the final strides and was clear for place. POUR ON THE
COLE was unhurried early on, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch run but was an easy third in the end.
HEY SEQUOIA was allowed to settle, came three wide into the stretch run and did not produce a late rally. GONE SOMEWHERE showed early speed,
stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run, lost contact with the loose pacesetter through the backstretch run, could not keep pace on the far turn
and came up empty in the drive.

for the lead in mid-stretch, dueled SALTO DE TIGRE to the wire and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. SALTO DE TIGRE was allowed to settle,
came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the second turn, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn, vied for the lead in
mid-stretch, dueled to the wire with MAGIC TIGER and was gamely bested in the end, while clear of the rest for place. KOWBOYKABIN broke in good order
and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while pressed through the backstretch run, shook free nearing the top of the lane, was confronted by the
top two nearing the furlong marker, met those bids to deep stretch, gave way in the final sixteenth and was well clear for show. SAFE COMBINATION was a
bit keen heading into the first turn, raced close up to the solid pace, lost ground on the far turn, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and faded in the
drive. AUTISMS WORLD was forwardly placed early on, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside entering the second turn, lost
ground nearing the top of the lane and tired late. ENJOY IT STRAIT showed early speed, pressed the solid pace through the backstretch run, dropped back
on the far turn and lacked a response in the stretch.

Footnotes
KETANJI showed good early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, battled with STANDFORGRIT to
mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth in a solid debut. STANDFORGRIT broke alertly and established the early lead, was confronted by
KETANJI along the turn, met that foe's bid to mid-stretch, could not match strides in deep stretch and just held for second. CREME DE MENTHE chased
from the second flight, came four wide to the quarter marker, was outkicked in the stretch drive but stayed on well late to just miss for place while securing
the show. MATCHLESS chased the quick early fractions from the rail, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but finished well in the final
sixteenth. DRAW NEAR raced close to the early pace, came in tight nearing the half-mile marker, raced two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. OTTER POP was a bit slow into early stride, improved position on the turn, swung five wide into the lane and
lacked a late rally. GIRL NAMED DORIS was away slowly and spotted the field early on, trailed through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC FROG was shuffled back leaving the break and was away slowly, settled off of the quick pace while saving ground into the backstretch run,
maintained position to the half-mile marker, made a quick inside move on the far turn and vied for the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear to
mid-stretch and pulled away in the late stages. FANTASTIC DREAM was away slowly and was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run,
improved position nearing the half-mile marker, loomed three wide on the far turn, was not able to match strides with ATLANTIC FROG in upper stretch,
was no match for the winner in deep stretch but held well in the final sixteenth to be second best. GEBO was unhurried, improved position three wide
nearing the quarter marker, was no match for the top pair late but passed tiring rivals in the final stages to be well clear for third. TIGER'S ARROW sent to
contest the early pace, was pressed through fast fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. AFRICAN
PRINCE was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace from a ground saving position to the second turn and weakened in the drive. NUMMY
NUM settled in the second flight early on, advanced on the backstretch run to stalk the pace to the far turn, could not sustain that run nearing the quarter
marker and tired in the stretch. MACHO SAM broke alertly, ceded the early lead but pressed TIGER'S ARROW through fast fractions to the half-mile
marker, dropped back on the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set fast fractions while extending the margin through the turn, drew away in mid-stretch and was
much the best in the end. MISS UNION chased the fast early pace, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in deep stretch but found her
best stride late to be second best. DULCE EMMA chased to the turn, advanced four wide nearing the top of the lane, could not make headway on the loose
leader in the stretch run, lacked a final response in deep stretch and just held for third in the final strides. HIIS REINA showed early speed and raced close
to the fast early pace, lost ground to the winner on the turn, gave way in the stretch run and was just edged for show. EMILY SMILES chased from the
second flight, lost ground three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. SPRING SPINNING was away slowly and spotted the field early on, came five
wide on the turn and was not a late threat.

Footnotes
RATTLEME broke in a bit but was quickest away, opened up on the field in the first furlong, was challenged by SHISH KABOB and SUMMER PUDDING to
the inside approaching the turn, ceded the lead for a moment to the latter rival, then quickened just past the three furlong marker and kept on well under
constant handling to the wire to win by a comfortable margin. RIVIERA SUNRISE came a way from the gate in good order, was pressed by her rider to keep
contact with the front runners, started a long drive from the half mile pole and made steady progress on the leader while racing wide but came up short.
FIRST TIME PLAYER was allowed to settle into a comfortable stride after the start, angled inward for better position down the backstretch, had a good
stalking position into the turn, launched a bid from the 5/16 pole and appeared to be a threat at the top of the stretch but flattened out. FLYING SYLVIA
settled in the back of the back in the early going, began a somewhat plodding rally from the 7/16 and continued one-paced the rest of the way to split the
field. MOTHERS DREAM was bumped on both sides after the break, trailed the field early, took a wide path around the turn and never found another gear.
SUMMER PUDDING threw her head just after the start, recovered quickly and moved to challenge for the lead, lost the inside path near the half, backed
away from the duel, then began a steady fade from there. SHISH KABOB was off a step slow, may have been bothered by RATTLEME in the first few
strides, hustled to challenge for early supremacy, took a brief lead from RATTLEME near the half-mile marker but was unable to keep up with that foe past
the three furlong pole and tired badly. CINDY broke a bit slow, chased from mid-pack through the first two furlongs, was done early and allowed to gallop
home behind the pack.
