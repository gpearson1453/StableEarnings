Footnotes
BON PRIX stalked the pace while four to five wide, moved up to contest the lead at the three eighth pole, drove three wide off the final turn, drifted in under
urging, inched clear and held sway. DREADNAUGHT sat in striking position while three wide, dueled inside of BON PRIX, lost path at the head of the
stretch, shifted outside and surged late to score place over ZICATELA. ZICATELA rated off the pace inside, waited at the head of the lane for running room,
shifted out to the three path at the eighth pole, closed steadily and missed. IRISH TRICK was never far back, hustled on the final turn, and failed to threaten
in the drive. BIG AL'S VISION set the pace, was unable to move on with rivals, and yielded inside. TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the
trainer of DREADNAUGHT against the rider of BON PRIX alleging interference in the stretch run was upheld after review of the Board of Stewards. BON
PRIX was disqualified and placed second behind DREADNAUGHT for interference.

TACOFLAVOREDKISSES hurried leaving the chute, took advantage along the rail in the final turn, continued to battle and prevailed. BARE BACK JACK
raced in the four path, fanned three wide on the far turn, was headed into the lane, was kept under encouragement outside and was narrowly denied. CATS
TOUCH sat in striking distance, swung three wide at the head of the lane, rallied between foes and was out kicked. SPORTSCARR trailed the field, waiting
for running room into the lane and flattened. INTENT TO STRIKE showed the way through the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the field and gave
way. ALL THAT GOLD settled outside, drifted out in the final turn and was outrun.

CONVINCE raced in the four path in the second flight, dropped back in the final turn, came under heavy urging and stormed outside under strong hand ride
to score the win. FLORIST settled outside early, drove four to five wide into the lane, and was out finished. GO MAMA lacked early foot leaving, tracked the
early pacesetters, roused into the stretch between foes, and got up late for show. NO COLLUSION contested the early pace inside of EDGE OF OKOTOKS,
disposed of rival nearing the quarter pole, drifted in, into the stretch, and weakened inside late. EDGE OF OKOTOKS vied outside for the early lead, took
pressure through the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival into the lane and faded. LETS GO ALL THEWAY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MANGOTANGO trailed racing into the backstretch, shifted out to the five path advancing outside quickly in the far turn, drifted out under left handed
encouragement, wore down rival and inched clear. LANNY MAC prompted the pace outside of GRAY ADMIRAL, drew clear in the far turn, was under heavy
handling into the stretch and was worn down in the final yards. FOREVER JIMMY reserved early while three wide, roused near the quarter pole, closed
outside improving position. LONESOME CAT unhurried early, and rallied belatedly inside. LONE PIONEER settled along the rail, chased in the last turn,
and lacked the closing response that was needed. GRAY ADMIRAL set the early pace, took pressure on the backside, and faded gradually. AWESOME
SATURDAY was under a snug hold in the early stages, saved ground in the three path, and tired.

Footnotes
PARKING PERMIT rated well off the pace from along the rail, gained closer order into the final turn, angled out to the three path at the head of the stretch,
battled inside of VIATURE to a slim advantage and refused to relinquish control after a hard drive. VIATURE saved ground from between foes through the
backstretch, drove four wide under urging, rallied determinedly outside of PARKING PERMIT and was denied by a nose after a game effort. WALKTHELINE
raced three wide into the opening turn, went in pursuit of the leaders into the final turn, waited briefly along the rail at the quarter pole, slipped through inside
to a slim advantage and was outkicked. NORTHERN DREAMIN vied outside into the first turn, sped clear in the backstretch, saw margins diminish nearing
the five sixteenth pole, and came up empty in the drive. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT trailed four wide, and lacked a kick. GLAVA was outsprinted to the
opening turn, chased the leader in the backstretch, moved up alongside NORTHERN DREAMIN at the quarter pole and yielded late stretch.

NIGHT FLYER vied inside for the early lead, gained the advantage, moved clear into the stretch, and held on under a late drive. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK
reserved off the early leaders, was set down at the head of the stretch and closed late missing out. CARPIQUET broke alertly, contended the early pace
outside of NIGHT FLYER, chased the leader through the stretch and was edged out for place. LENT ME FIFTY hustled outside, raced three wide into the
turn, closed well but was unable to improve position in the stretch drive. AWESOME MEMORIES lacked a kick. JOKERS R WILD settled outside leaving the
backstretch, and offered a mild bid. REGIMENT lacked interest. PRETTY PAULINE chased throughout. SUNDROP no menace.

SHE'S EXPENSIVE sat in striking distance of the pacesetters, drove five wide in the final turn, and won driving. FOREVER LADY saved ground along the
rail, swung wide into the lane, closed steadily under urging, and held safely for place. SAYGE'S SPIRIT chased early, swung four wide in the final turn,
rallied inside late stretch and secure a show finish. PERPETUAL BLISS chased four wide, gained closer order leaving the final turn, angled out sharply to
the five path, was kept under heavy urging, and finished well. MIDNIGHT TAKE broke outward leaving, advanced quickly inside into the final turn,
experienced traffic at the head of the stretch, shifted out to the five path, and closed late. LIL MISS MUD broke alertly to set the early pace, took pressure
inside of WHITEROSE SPIRIT, was overtaken into the stretch, and weakened inside. WHITEROSE SPIRIT pressed the early pace from the four path, was
unable to keep pace with the field after the three sixteenth pole and wilted. MUSICAL RELOAD bumped leaving the gate, saved ground, and lacked a
response when called upon. BETTIN ON BELLE showed a mild interest late. THE RIVER GREY broke inward bumping into MUSICAL RELOAD, chased
three wide, lacked running room along the rail in the final turn, and lacked the rally needed. IM A WHISKY GAL lacked clear path leaving, took a bad step
then stumbled at the three sixteenth marker, pulled up by the rider, did not finish and was vanned off.

Footnotes
VICTORY AT LAST stalked the pacesetters from the four path, moved up alongside OUTLAWED IN TEXAS to challenge the lead, edged clear into the
stretch under heavy urging and held. HIGH KELLY SONG pressed the early pace from the rail, dropped back leaving the backstretch, angled out to the
three path, closed gradually and gave one last surge late, missing out. LIGHTENING ANNA rated off the early pace, gained closer order nearing the three
sixteenth pole, rallied outside and edged away for show honors. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS set a pressured pace from the three path, responded to challenge
from VICTORY AT LEAST but could not sustain the bid that was required. BODYMOOR HEATH steadied leaving the chute, angled down to the rail, swung
three at the head of the lane, and improved late. AMEER chased wide leaving the backstretch, and passed tiring rivals. LITTLE DIEGO trailed early, lacked
room along the rail mid stretch and showed a mild interest late. CHARMING VINTAGE attended the pace from between foes, chased the leaders into the
final turn, and faded gradually. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR lagged early and failed to menace. PAULIE WALNUTS chased outside and gave way.
CHESTER SLEW chased inside, was in close quarters leaving the backstretch, and failed to threaten in the drive.
