Footnotes
MODELO RUBIA broke out to make contact with She's Mybuddybuddy then stalked inside, challenged Cowgirl Shine toward the three eighths pole and
dueled at mostly even terms from that point, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage nearest the rail, took the nod and ran clear past the eighth pole
and was steadily handled to hold on well. ANATH stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three
path, then dug in down the lane to get up for second later yards. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY was jostled at the break then saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased outward mid-stretch and dueled for third. HOVEL saved early ground, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased to the five path toward the head of the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel
for third. COWGIRL SHINE rated a slim lead off the rail, dug in to the challenge of Modelo Rubia nearing the three eighths pole and kept the edge over that
one two deep on the far turn, but was met into the lane and flattened the final furlong. BEETHOVEN FRIEZE rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and flattened in the lane. AMERICAN DREAMER rounded the opening turn
in the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. SHAKE IT GIRL raced off
the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. BEAUTIFUL
MICHELLE broke in and made contact with She's Mybuddybuddy then saved ground.

MIDNIGHT REGRET raced boxed at the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran at the rail on the far turn, then dug in just past
the eighth pole to get up later yards. JACK'S LILLY bobbled at the break then stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. QUEEN CADENCE surged clear toward the three quarter pole
then angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in under
steady handling from the head of the lane but was caught in later yards. VILLAREGGIA settled off the rail on the first turn then left the turn outside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. OVERCOOKED rated close two deep on the first
turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MAKE THE WAY CLEAR rated a clear pace inside, was urged away from the seven sixteenths pole, further extended his lead on the far turn and was
steadily handled through the lane. BLAMEITONTHEFUN saved ground off the pace on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced just off
the rail on the far turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to take second later yards. DIAMANTE DE ORO saved ground on the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole and raced four wide on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and finished evenly to get third late yards. ON SPOT rated
close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. DIVINAS
CONNECTION ducked in steadying at the start and rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran six wide
on the far turn and showed little further. SKIP THE BULL rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase into the backstretch but flattened three wide on
the far turn. DR WILL was never a factor. CHARGEITTOTHEGAME rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. RUSHIN COLLUSION raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and never factored.
