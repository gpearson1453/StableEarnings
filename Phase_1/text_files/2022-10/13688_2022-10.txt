Footnotes
FUNKENSTEIN bumped leaving the gate, tracked four wide early, traveled three deep into the far turn, raced between foes and three wide into the stretch,
collared the leader approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. BIG TALKER stalked two wide around the first turn, moved inside and was coaxed along
into the second bend, tipped to the two path to take aim at the leader, bid between rivals but got outkicked by FUNKENSTEIN in the late stages. ATOMIC
DROP away quickly from inside, set the pace under pressure then cleared at the half-mile pole, coaxed along into the stretch, drifted out a bit and clung to a
slim lead at the eight pole, was soon overtaken and got outfinished for second. CLUB CAL got knocked into outside rival at the start, chased three wide at
the back on the first turn, was on the move four then three deep on the far turn, took aim four wide into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong.
STONE'S RIVER veered out and bumped CLUB CAL, forwardly placed three to four wide on the first turn then applied pressure from outside, lost touch
past the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the far turn, got shuffled back between rivals at the three-eighths pole, came out into the stretch and was not
persevered with down the lane.

TANGLEDUPINGREY sped to the front from outside, cleared inner rivals and crossed over, urged right handed in the final furlong and held safely. CALI
KINETIC was off slow to begin, chased off the pace up the backstretch, raced along the rail then two wide leaving the turn, lugged in near the eight pole and
finished willingly to earn the place honors. REGULATION DAZED came away well then shifted out and bumped rival approaching the dirt, checked inside
the leader near the nine-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend two wide then moved inside and flattened to third. CLOUSEAU was off slow to begin, trailed off
the rail, angled to the rail around the bend and improved position. MONTANA was prominent early then got bumped hard from inside approaching the dirt,
chased the lone speed outside a rival to the turn, asked three wide around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
LEMON SUSHI dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, had the rider lose his left rein briefly and lugged out while moving clear,
then regained control and drew away. MAGNIFICENT RIDE chased along the inside into the turn, tipped out and came three wide into the lane, put in a mild
bid outside the leader then drifted out and was no match in the furlong grounds. AMERICAN CAT went up to duel for command from inside, fought with the
winner through the turn, lost touch into the lane and stayed on to hold the show. SMILE FOR GLORY raced in range up the backstretch, moved into the
three path on the turn, took aim four wide into the stretch, got floated out by MAGNIFICENT RIDE with a furlong remaining and faltered. IRONDALE chased
between rivals then climbed at the nine-sixteenths pole, settled into stride and took the turn two then three wide and could not offer the needed response.

Footnotes
FOUNDER'S DAY rated in the two path early on, went between rivals then tipped out on the far turn, rallied outside the top pair entering the furlong grounds
and drove clear. FAIRY TALE BLISS reserved in the early going and began to pull on the first turn on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, steered
out in the stretch and put in a late run to earn the place. DANCING DANA dueled for command on the inside early then cleared on the clubhouse turn, set
the pace under pressure in the middle stages, met bids entering the far turn, maintained command to the stretch, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go
and saved the show. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) tracked two wide early, bid three deep into the far turn, chased the leader into the stretch, re-bid past the eight
pole but got outkicked in the late stages. OCTANE (BRZ) reserved on the inside early then moved off the rail, took the far turn three then two wide, moved
out in the lane and summoned a mild response but needed to find more. TIZ A MACHO GIRL stalked the speed from inside, pushed on while saving ground
around the far turn, altered out near the sixteenth pole and lacked late punch. SKY ON ICE raced on the inside at the back, stayed along the rail to the
stretch, moved out and lacked room at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the wire. LADY NOGUEZ bumped leaving the gate and dropped back early,
raced two wide around the clubhouse turn, moved out and made a middle move to draw up alongside the leaders four deep, failed to sustain the bid around
the far turn and weakened down the lane. ISLA ROSE was fractious behind the gate, coaxed from the gate then began to pull early, pressed the pace from
outside then between foes into the far turn, was a bit rank in upper stretch and weakened.

STARSHIP DEFIANT stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and stepped to the front and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, roused in the
lane and put to right handed urging and widened through the final furlong. A BROKEN BREEZE broke out and bumped rival, chased three deep early, two
to three wide on the second bend, could not make any headway on the winner but bested the rest. STATEFOREST stalked the pace on the inside, lost
ground under coaxing through far turn, churned on next to the fence in the drive and was along for the show. LADY PROTONICO bumped leaving the gate,
chased five deep around the clubhouse turn, trailed while remaining off the rail in the middle stages, went three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and got edged for the show. JAMMINJL tracked between then began to pull early, dropped back off the pace on the backstretch, spun three wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. SUGAR KISSES bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, chased four deep around the first turn, went four then three wide on
the second bend and weakened. MEASUREOFDEVOTION raced up close in the four path into the first turn then angled in while outside the leader, stalked
up the backstretch, asked right handed past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the lane.

turn, kept inside to the lane, altered out in the stretch and gained the show. WELLSWORT (IRE) traveled three wide around the first turn near the back, got

Footnotes
EVERLYS GIRL sped clear early, showed the way two then three wide around the turn and held well to the wire. VEGAN stalked two wide between rivals
into the turn, moved to the inside around the bend, bid from inside in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. SHE'S BULLETPROOF threw her head and
stumbled a bit leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, swung widest into the stretch and put in a mild late bid to earn the
show. LADY MARYANN bobbled leaving the gate, chased five wide through the turn and failed to produce a bid. O'NEILL'S LEGACY off alertly in the
beginning, raced up close outside the pacesetter tot he turn, chased three then two wide around the bend and flattened. RESPECTFULLY turned her head
right before the start to come away a step slow, chased three deep then four wide around the bend and flattened in the final furlong. KEEP YOUR COIL
lunged at the start, stalked inside into the turn, lost ground around the bend and came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON was off slow to begin, settled off the pace, angled to the inside for the turn, moved out approaching the dirt, rallied there wide in the
lane, took over midstretch and drew clear. NONE ABOVE THE LAW tracked between early, angled out crossing the dirt, rallied four wide in the lane, lacked
the needed final kick and save the place. COAST OF ROAN settled three deep, suffered a mild shuffle approaching the dirt, angled out in upper stretch,
closed well and missed second. ALIGATO was off slow to begin, raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the stretch, had to pause for a second at
the top of the stretch, then gained a clear path and finished well for a minor award. HAIL FREEDOM got bumped from inside early, chased four to five wide
around the turn, challenged three deep past the half-mile pole, took over in upper stretch, lost command midstretch and flattened late. HOT BOX set the
pace under pressure off the inside, dueled three wide crossing the dirt, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened. SMUGGLER'S RUN traveled
near the back in the early going, went four wide into the turn, lugged out crossing the dirt and failed to rally. FINNEUS bumped in the beginning, dropped
back to last, angled to the inside, entered the lane two wide, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. JETOVATOR was off slow and bumped with
FINNEUS at the start, chased on the inside then took an awkward step crossing the dirt and weakened in the stretch run. STRAIGHT UP G pulled early and
drifted out to bump rival, stalked four deep into the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and tired. SUNRISE JOURNEY prompted the pace from outside
then between on the turn, failed to keep up four wide into stretch and faded.
