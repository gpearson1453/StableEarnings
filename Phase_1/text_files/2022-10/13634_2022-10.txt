Footnotes
FIRST GLIMPSE prompted the pace three wide, sustained pressing position under strong urging around the far turn, kept on to spar for the lead entering
the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. BLESS THE KITTEN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, led around the far turn, battled through
midstretch as his counterparts fought on, but was outkicked late. MIDNIGHT J J set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes, got headed into the far turn,
fought on to sustain vying position through midstretch, but gave way late. MY BARILEY tracked along the inside, chased the top trio under urging around the
far turn, but lacked a bid. CONTACT TRACING bumped with an outer rival at the start, got hung five wide while off of the pace around the first turn, and
made little impact. QUANTUM LEAP bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide around the opening bend, but was through early.

Footnotes
DOMITIA LUCILLA sparred for the lead inside of a vying rival, shook clear of that foe entering the lane, and held sway under driving pressure. DOOZY
BATZ vied for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart leaving the quarter pole, and was second best. KLIMT'S MUSE was void
of early speed along the inside, brushed the inner railing into the turn, saved ground before moving up inside of foes turning foe home, sustained his
advance to gain show leaving the three sixteenths pole, but failed to threaten the top pair. VERDANDI tracked in the two path around the turn, got outkicked
by an inner foe entering the lane for show, then shifted a path out, and kept on. YELLOW CREEK ROAD laid off of the pace inside of foes while a bit off of
the rail, got outmoved by a rail skimming rival turning for home, and failed to menace. KNELCOCK tracked in midpack five wide, and gave way. LA
CHAPEAU raced in midpack in the four path, and tired. STUPENDOUS laid off of the pace in the three path, and made little impact. YOU'RE AVOIDING ME
was fractious in the gates and required a veterinarian exam before being cleared to go, but was reloaded without further incident, then broke slow, and was
outrun. STAKE A CLAIM chased the embattled leading pair from the two path, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
SHEZZ KOLDAZICE dueled for the lead through a stern battle with an outer BOURBONWITHGINGER around the turn, drew clear of that foe in upper
stretch, tired in the final furlong with wide margin, saw an outer EDGEE ANGEL quickly close the gap in the closing stages, yet lasted. EDGEE ANGEL
bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, produced a rail rally through the lane to claim place entering the final sixteenth, tipped outside of
the clear leader while swiftly cutting the gap, but ran out of ground to reel her in. MOHAYLADY saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in
upper stretch, got outkicked by an inner rallying rival approaching the final sixteenth, and stayed on to claim show. BOURBONWITHGINGER dueled for the
lead outside of the eventual winner, but weakened through the lane while hanging on her left lead. NANA'S GRAY tracked in the four to three paths, and
tired. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL broke slowly before being bumped and bothered by an inner rival at the start, then lacked early speed in the four to three path
despite coaxing, came under stronger urging to keep pace into the turn, but gave way. SMILE AT THE STORM broke slowly and into the outer part of the
starting gate, rushed to prompt the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk the top pair after a quarter mile, chased them from the two path into the turn,
but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MO'S MOJO tracked from midpack along the inside, vacated the rail to surpass a weakening foe around the turn, shifted back to it entering the lane, rallied
to take aim on the wide leader in midstretch, gained an advantage a sixteenth from home, and drove clear. BIG THORN set a clear pace in the two path,
shifted out to the four path entering the lane, held sway through upper stretch, but was bested by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. CREATE AGAIN
stalked outside of the clear leader while in the three path around the turn, got floated to the five path while giving chase, and kept on. ROLLING FORK
settled far back along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane, and moved up. KING'S MISCHIEF tracked two to three wide, but failed to progress
through upper stretch before fading. ROCKING THE BOAT raced towards the rear in the three path and between horses, and made little impact.
MOTAGALLY bobbled just after the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, and was outrun. REAL NEWS chased along the inside, but weakened
around the turn.

Footnotes
NEPOTISM stalked the top pair from the three path, ranged up to them in the four path nearing the far turn, tucked to the three path before bidding for the
lead outside of the pace setter turning for home, led entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, and held safely from an outer rival late. COUSIN LARRY
trailed, took the far turn two to three wide, cut the corner while attempting to aim a rally inside of the top pair entering the lane, but decided otherwise in
upper stretch, altered course outside of a newly clear NEPOTISM approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on late. MIACOMET set the pace inside of a
pressing rival while a remaining a bit off of the inner rail, disposed of that rival before meeting another foe's bid turning for home, got headed by that
challenger entering the lane, and gave way. ICARUS tracked in the four path, chased the leaders under urging around the far turn, and yielded. NATIONAL
SECURITY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MINISTERIAL was last away, vied for the lead outside of the pace setter and in the three path, but
weakened between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
SAENZ bumped an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead two wide while well in hand around the turn, put away his inner counterpart while meeting an
outer challenge from DIVISIBILITY nearing the lane, readily repelled that rival when set down at the three sixteenths pole, then drew off under driving
pressure. DIVISIBILITY prompted the pace three wide, bid outside of SAENZ entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, and managed place
thereafter. MARSANNE dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but gave way entering the lane. DIVINE GRACE saved ground in midpack, shifted
off of the fence while claiming fourth in midstretch, and stayed on. PERFECT ROSE took a bump from an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside
around the turn, then improved along the rail through the lane. PEACEFUL MOMENT laid off of the pace in the three path, but failed to menace between
horses. I'M SO COZZE settled far back along the inside while just off of the rail, and failed to factor. RIGHT NOW remained in the four path while far back
around the turn, then failed to make an impact in the five path through the final furlong. SMOOTH LIKE ICE chased along the inside, drifted out when asked
to tip outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, then weakened through the final furlong. THROUGH THE CRACKS tracked in the three path, but tired in
the four path entering the lane.

Footnotes
EXTRA ANEJO broke inwardly, quickly sped to the front, set the pace from a pair of outer pressers, inched clear of those chasers entering the turn, showed
the way uncontested in the two path around the bend, then responded readily to a right handed shoulder tap when let out in upper stretch, swiftly spurted
away from the rest of the field, and widened under little-to-no urging. TSHIEBWE bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked the pace in the two path
around the turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, ranged up to bid for place outside of SUMMONYOURCOURAGE in upper stretch, then gained that
position at the furlong grounds while not threatening the winner. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE pressed two wide and between horses, chased the clear
leader into the turn while yielding place to an outer rival, kept on and regained that position in upper stretch, but was again outkicked at the furlong grounds,
and lasted for show late. LEVEL UP bumped with an outer rival at the start, was void of early speed along the inside, swung to the six path entering the
lane, and moved up. JUAN VALDEZ chased from midpack in the four path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. WILDERZAR laid
off of the pace in the two to three paths, and failed to factor. SACRED GROUND broke out, chased from midpack along the inside, and faded. FREEZING
POINT stalked three wide, chased the clear leader around the turn as that foe's closest pursuer, but caved among foes at the three sixteenths pole.
RELAMPAGO VERDE broke a step slowly before shying from an outer rival and into an inner foe at the start, lagged well behind the field, and was outrun.
MALIBU MENDELSSOHN broke slowly before significantly shying from an outer rival at the start, then was outrun and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
STATIC FIRE prompted the pace three wide, engaged the leader while tucking two wide approaching the turn, sparred while bidding for the lead in upper
stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear through the final sixteenth. DIVA TREVA bumped an outer rival at the start, set the
pace inside of a pressing STATIC FIRE around the turn, dug in to resist that foe's bid in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, then gave way
through the final sixteenth after the rider stood early thinking the first finish line was being used. PROMISES TO DANCE bumped an inner foe at the start,
laid forwardly two wide, took the bend in the three path, battled with his inner counterpart for show through the lane, exchanged a bump with that rival at the
furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position. ROSES FOR DEBRA took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, stalked along the inside, chased the
top pair from the two path while inside of PROMISES TO DANCE around the turn, then battled with that foe for show through the lane, but exchanged a
bump at the furlong grounds, and yielded. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR steadied from tight quarters among foes at the five furlong pole, trailed around the turn,
and never got involved. CHASING FIREFLIES tracked in the three path, but tired turning for home.

Footnotes
CANDY LIGHT settled off of the pace along the inside, came under a tight hold when getting too close to ahead rivals around the first turn, settled into stride
shortly after, saved ground around the far turn, searched for racing room behind the leading group while off of the fence, dove to the rail for clear sailing
when that whole opened approaching the furlong grounds, gained an advantage from an outer SAKE (FR) leaving that marker, and inched clear in the late
stages. SAKE (FR) tracked along the inside, tipped to the four path and outside of the leading pair at the three sixteenths pole, bid and wrestled a narrow
advantage at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner rival passing that marker, and kept on to prove second best. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) was
bumped and pushed inwardly by an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, got keyed up as the pace slowed entering the backstretch,
settled down shortly after, then got bumped by an inner rival and to the five path entering the lane, floated six wide a sixteenth later, yet sustained his chase
through the final furlong, flopped back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, and secured show. FAST AS FLIGHT broke a bit out at the start,
stalked along the inside and from the pocket, bumped an outer rival when tipping outside of the top pair entering the lane, got outkicked by a pair of inner
rivals while floated five wide nearing the furlong grounds, and kept on while one paced. CUZZYWUZZY was bumped and forced in by an outer rival at the
start, laid off the pace in the three path, shifted out to the seven path in midstretch, and stayed on. TOERIS pressed the pace two wide and between horses,
but yielded among foes at the furlong grounds. DAISY BEE broke a bit in, set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, clung to an advantage in upper stretch,
but shifted off of the fence nearing the furlong grounds, and weakened between horses at that juncture. BLISSFUL stumbled at the start, trailed along the
inside early on, shifted out turning for home before fanning seven wide entering the lane, but brushed an inner rival in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
LET'S DUET broke a step slowly at the start but avoided being pinched by doing so, laid unhurried in the three to four paths, but made little impact.
INTRIGUE squarely bumped with an outer rival right after the start, stalked three wide in striking range, but yielded five wide entering the lane. JUBILEE
BRIDGE tracked three wide while keen between horses around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, got floated four, then six, wide turning
for home, and was brushed in upper stretch while giving way. EXPLICATE exchanged a solid bump with an inner foe a stride out of the gate, tracked in
midpack four wide, but faded while floated eight wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
PETIT VERDOT stalked three wide, took aim on a leading CAJUN BROTHER in upper stretch, bid leaving the furlong grounds, dueled thereafter, and
prevailed. CAJUN BROTHER sparred for the lead along the inside, disposed of his outer counterpart in upper stretch before meeting PETIT VERDOT's bid
at the furlong grounds, gamely resisted him soon after, but was bested in the closing stages. SHACKS WAY dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded
between horses in upper stretch. HONORARY DEGREE rated far back in the four path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss
reaching show. FLEETRIDGE tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain position entering the turn, and kept on through the lane. THIRSTY BETRAYAL
tracked four wide, but failed to progress before yielding in the final furlong. MASAI MAN chased two wide, tucked to the rail entering the turn, then tired in
the four path through the finial furlong. FEELING IT was outrun.
