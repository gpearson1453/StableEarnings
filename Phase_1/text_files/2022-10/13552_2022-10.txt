COUNTRIFIED trailed the field in the early stages, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly in the final turn, drifted in under left handed
encouragement, and won going away. PULL THE PIN unhurried early, fanned three wide into the far turn, and closed gradually. HANDSOME HENRY
trailed the field at the head of the lane and lodged a late bid for show. MARIA'S SONG dueled inside of SANSOME through the backstretch, disposed of
rival nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in stretch. ETU BABOU reserved off the dueling pacesetters, and failed to threaten. SANSOME dueled for
the lead outside of MARIA'S SONG, was unable to move on with rival and wilted.

FLASHY BIZ saved ground early, moved up in closer range nearing the final turn, launched a bid at the head of the lane, and kicked away. CAPA BELLA
rated off the pace then shifted outside leaving the backstretch, closed gradually under urging, and got by late for show. CHATTY GAL stalked the pace in
the three path, moved up alongside EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken and rallied inside late stretch but out finished.
DAZZLING CHIC sat mid pack while five wide, and lacked a bid. CAGEY saved ground to no avail. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE showed the way through the
backstretch, and gave way inside with two furlongs remaining. WHOOP IT UP trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BIG HUG stalked the dueling pacesetters from the three path, was given cue at the head of the lane, swept the lead and drew off under a brisk hand.
BOOTIFUL ROSE pressed the pace from the two path, gained the advantage at the head of the lane but was no match for the eventual winner in the
stretch. KISS ME HELLO trailed early, gained closer order, and closed well late. SMART CAT vied outside for the early lead, set a pressured pace from the
five path, kept after BOOTIFUL ROSE in the final turn but was unable to move on with rivals and yielded. LILLY'S OF LONDON passed tiring rival.
MOHAMAD tracked inside and tired early.

Footnotes
HARD TO COME HOME contested the pace in the four path, was under attack in the final turn, dueled inside of CAB SAV into the stretch and prevailed
under a long drive. CAB SAV shifted out to the six path leaving the chute, fanned three wide into the far turn, dueled outside of HARD TO COME HOME,
dug in the final yards and just missed. TUCKER TIME saved ground early, rallied determinedly into stretch and was along late for show. SMARTY RIVER
PANTS sat in range, met traffic at the head of the lane, angled to the rail, lodged an all out bid and was edged out. FATHER O'FLAHERTY stalked four
wide, rallied five wide off the final turn, and flattened out. RAILWAY chased three wide, and offered a late mild bid. BACKSTREET BOBBY contended the
pace from off the rail, and faded gradually inside.

ASYOUBELIEVE pressed the pace from the three path, moved up alongside BANG ON to challenge the lead, and drew clear late stretch. MY COLLEGE
FUND tracked four wide, bid four to five wide off the final turn, closed in to steadily bid nearing the wire but needed more. BANG ON sat a pressured pace,
responded to challenge from ASYOUBELIEVE in the final turn then gave way inside. SPOT ON DUDE raced wide through the backstretch, drove four wide
into the lane, and improved late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE stalked from the rail, and lacked a closing response. ITSMYDAY trailed the field and offered a
late mild bid. THESHACK settled five wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ORANGE THEORY sat in striking position while in the three path, overtook the lead willingly at the three eighths pole, drew off through the stretch and was
ridden out under a brisk hand ride. JOY IN GRACE chased five wide in second flight, was roused nearing the quarter pole, and chased the leader through
the stretch to no avail. EXACTLY rallied late to earn show. MI REYNA broke alertly to lead the field through the backstretch, was overtaken quickly in the far
turn, and finished evenly. WHISKARITA chased inside early, and failed to threaten. KEKE KIMONO chased the pace from the rail, and faded gradually
inside. SKY DESTINY chased wide, and was outrun. SUDDENLY MISTY never reached contention.

MAMA'S PROUD JOKE saved ground early, rallied four wide into the and finished up with good energy securing a show position. NO MORE JO KING
brushed leaving, chased the leader into the opening turn, and lacked a closing response. AGENT C brushed leaving, lodged an all out bid inside into the
stretch, and finished evenly. COOL DOMINION chased in the two path, checked then bumped MONETARY MISHAP at the eighth pole, and flattened.
