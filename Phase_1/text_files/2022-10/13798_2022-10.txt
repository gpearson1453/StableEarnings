Footnotes
ORNAMENTAL chased the pace from the two path through the far turn, angled into the six path for the drive, straightened in the seven path, caught the
leader near the sixteenth pole then battled to the end while brushing late and edged up. MCMANSION chased the pace from the three path into the turn, bid
before mid-turn to gain a short lead, continued on the lead while entering the lane from the four or five path, dueled with the winner from outside the eighth
pole to late and could not hold that one safe while brushing late. WICKED ECSTASY set the pace while in the two path into the far turn, dueled with the
runner-up through mid-turn, could not keep up with that one and continued to chase the top two home. IRISH KITTEN raced near the rail and steadily faded.
WHITTLESEY raced along the inside through the turns and lost ground to the top ones throughout. LOOKINLY led into the backstretch while off the inside,
stalked the leader into the far turn then was done. D'ORO FOREVER refused to break and was walked off.

PIPELINE GIRL pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, cleared outside the eighth pole then held while being kept
to the task. RUNUP tracked the pace from the two path through the turn, angled into the three path into the lane then could only chase the top one through
the final eighth and settle for second best. EASYONMYEYES raced four wide through the turn and into the lane, continued in the four path through the lane
and gained the show spot late. WAY TOO SMARTE was in the three to the two path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. PRINCESS
ELIN was never a threat while along the inside. OFF WE GO set the pace along the inside through the turn then gave way entering the lane. Race was
hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.

EL PEJE bumped at the start, chased the pace into the turn, moved to press the leader through late turn, bid from the three path and two wide into the lane,
continued with a clear lead with an eighth to go then surged away. LIVINGONTULSATIME tracked the pace while along the inside into the lane, raced in the
two path through the lane and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. GOOD ONE stalked the pace from the three path through the
turn, bid into the lane four wide, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not sustain the effort while losing the place spot late. GOOD SUGAR
set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way. GET HAMMERED trailed through the turn while in the two path, shifted into the six path inside the
eighth pole and never was a factor.
