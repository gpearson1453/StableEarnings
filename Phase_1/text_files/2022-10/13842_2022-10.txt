BRUCE BANNER dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off down the stretch, under wraps at the
wire. BOONE'S PATH stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and chased on in the lane, no match for
the winner. BALADINE dueled on the outside through the opening half mile, entered the stretch in the two path, could not go with the winner in the lane and
kept on to the wire. DASH TO THE CASH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the turn in the three path and improved position
mildly in the final furlong. PERIPATETIC bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. AWESOME WILLY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and never threatened. SKIP AWAY CARTER raced off the pace on the through the opening quarter
of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. SENOR MIKE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and tired in the lane. I'M YOUR VALENTINE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, settled at the back of pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was empty from there. GRAND FESTIVAL hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two
path the entire way around the oval and was not a factor.

raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide into the stretch and gained ground
through the final furlong. DARK HEDGES chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, dueled gamely in the lane and gave way in the final strides. SUN SQUALL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in
the opening stages, came around the turn three wide, began a bid entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. DAAHERS BULLY led the way up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. LITTLE KANSAS dropped back to trail well behind the field up
the backstretch, raced on the rail around the turn and made up some ground in the stretch while never threatening. MY LITTLE TIPSY tracked the leader on

Footnotes
ITS A WRAP saved ground around the first turn, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and dueled
gamely down the lane to hold the victory. TONKA WARRIOR saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and dueled gamely down the stretch to just miss.
MEGAN'S HONOR raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the second bend and
weakened late. MAGOO tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the far turn and was outkicked in
the final furlong. GOING WITH STYLE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the
far turn from the two path and was empty from there. CALIBRATE trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path throughout and was
eased in the lane.
