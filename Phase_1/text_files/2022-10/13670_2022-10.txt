Footnotes
FROSTED GRACE stalked three wide, bid turning for home, led at the furlong grounds as an outer rival pursued, inched clear leaving that station, and kept
his outer challenger at bay. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON stalked behind the leading pair while a path off of the rail, tipped outside of the leading trio in upper
stretch as FROSTED GRACE struck the front, took aim on that rival entering the final furlong, but failed to progress through the late stages while getting
fended off. SECOND OF JULY broke a step slowly and nudged an outer rival at the start, vied two wide, led turning for home as an outer rival ranged up,
but failed to resist that foe's bid in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. CAROM bumped an outer rival at the start, showed the way inside
of a vying rival, then weakened entering the lane. MR. TIP saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. PIT BOSS hopped at the start and spotted the
leaders multiple lengths, raced off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF took a mild bump from an inner rival at the start,
then trailed the field in the four path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CURLY LARRY AND MO set a clear pace, met a pair of outer bids turning for home, gamely held a margin from SOLOMAN VANDY in upper stretch, shook
free at the furlong grounds, and held sway. SOLOMON VANDY stalked three wide, then two wide down the backstretch, ranged up to bid around the far turn
before an outer rival did the same turning for home, vied with his inner game counterpart through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace at the furlong
grounds, and held place. ROYAL SALUTE bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, saved ground in midpack tipped to wide in upper stretch, and
grinded away to claim show from an outer rival leaving the sixteenth marker. SPANISH DOUBLOON tracked three wide, bid outside of the top pair turning
for home, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, chased while yielding thereafter, and lost show to an inner foe passing the sixteenth pole.
EVALUATE broke slowly, settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, tracked while awaiting racing room behind foes around the far turn, found
clear sailing four wide in upper stretch, but only offered a mild kick. READ ON broke out, was prominent inside of the eventual winner early on, but steadied
into the turn as that foe crossed over, laid forwardly two wide and between horses approaching the backstretch, tracked shortly after, then chased under
urging around the far turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and chased while one paced. ICONICUS stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch.
GAME WARDEN tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, fanned six wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. JOINT VENTURE laid off of the
pace three wide, then in the five path around the far turn, floated seven wide entering the lane, and made little impact. BAYOU CHROME rated off of the
pace in the two to three path around the first turn, then in the four to five path around the far turn, and tired. GUCCI BOY broke out and bumped an outer foe
a few strides after the start, got rank behind foes through the lane for the first time, then steadied and bumped the inner railing entering the first turn, got
wrangled back to settled off of the pace along the inside, checked behind foes leaving the eleven sixteenths pole, then failed to factor. IRON CRUSADER
broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN set the pace inside of a pressing foe, shook clear of her in upper stretch, and held sway. LEGENDARY GIFT prompted the pace
setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and was second best. FOREVER HOME tracked along the inside, gained around the turn
before tipping outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole to take aim, but flattened out in upper stretch, and lugged in while hanging on her left
lead. WEEKEND FUN stalked three wide, but tired turning for home. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI broke out, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

LT. JUNIOR GRADE prompted the pace along the inside, stalked while just off of the leaders around the turn, slipped through and bid inside of MACRON
entering the lane, sparked a duel in the process, battled gamely through the lane, and forged a narrow advantage in the closing stages. MACRON pressed
three wide, then vied outside of the leader while in the three path around the turn, led turning for home, dug in to resist an inner rival's bid entering the lane,
sparred determinedly through midstretch, but was bested late. MONEY MIKE chased two wide, claimed show at the three sixteenths pole while not
threatening the top pair, and held that position. AGGRESSIVITY took the urn in the three path while far back, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and
moved up. EMERALD EXPRESS failed to factor. SHADOW MATTER trailed in the two path and was outrun. COST BASIS set the pace between a pair of
pressing rivals early on, vied with his outer counterpart while a bit off of the rail around the turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

KENTUCKY GHOST trailed, swung six wide entering the lane, shifted inwardly to prevent from fanning even further out in upper stretch, rallied through a
wide hole between horses in midstretch to bid at the sixteenth pole, inched clear soon after, and held from an outer rival late. IN LOVE (BRZ) broke slowly
and rated towards the rear, took the far turn two wide before swinging to the eight path and outside of foes entering the lane, rallied through midstretch,
lightly brushed with an inner MOUILLAGE (FR) while sustaining his charge in the final furlong, but did not have enough to reel in the leader late. MR.
WIRELESS tracked three wide, tucked behind foes and to the two path around the far turn before cutting the corner entering the lane, rallied inside of foes
in upper stretch as the leader bore out severely, produced a bid at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage shortly after, but was outkicked at the sixteenth
pole, and weakened late before saving show. MOUILLAGE (FR) tracked two wide before tucking to the rail entering the backstretch, gained place entering
the lane while tipping outside of the clear leader, took aim on that foe from the five path in upper stretch, but was significantly herded outwardly by that foe
while attempting a bid, got outkicked by an outer rival while vying for minor rewards entering the final sixteenth, and kept on to miss reaching show.
WINFROMWITHIN sped clear, showed the way in the three to two path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch as an outer MOUILLAGE (FR)
menaced, bore out many paths while clinging to an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, but was headed by an inner bidder at that juncture, and
yielded between foes. CURRENT saved ground in midpack, retreated into the far turn, and failed to factor. GREYES CREEK broke a step slowly, rated far
back two wide, darted to the seven path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally on his left lead, got outkicked for minors at the furlong grounds, and failed to
menace. MEGACITY stalked along the inside while watching the leader speed clear around the first turn, shifted outside of that foe entering the backstretch,
pursued before getting outmoved for place by an inner foe entering the lane, then floated out in upper stretch while fading on his left lead. SPECTACULAR
GEM laid off of the pace in the three to four path, improved to track down the backstretch, but faded in the six path and between horses in upper stretch.

INVENTING broke a step slowly, tracked in midpack in the two path, brushed an outer foe while shifting three wide with nine sixteenths to go, inched closer
to the top pair nearing the far turn, sparked a duel outside of SUNNY RIVER at the five sixteenths pole, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, clung to
a margin from his game counterpart while hanging on his left lead, and edged away late. SUNNY RIVER set a clear pace in the two path around the first
turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, resisted INVENTING's bid around the far turn, sparred turning for home before being headed in upper stretch,
fought on doggedly thereafter, but was bested. SWEET LADY IVANKA settled off of the pace in the three path, launched a rally in the four path around the
far turn, then sustained her run to be gaining on the leading pair through the final furlong. FOREVER AFTER ALL tracked in the four to two paths around the
first turn, got brushed and floated four wide by the eventual winner at the nine sixteenths pole, tucked back two wide into the far turn, and failed to factor.
FINE COTTON stalked outside of the clear leader while in the three path around the first turn, but weakened entering the far turn. MO HAPPY broke slowly,
and was outrun along the inside. OMA THE GREAT tracked along the inside, but weakened around the far turn, and was eased through the lane. SHA GIRL
hopped at the start while breaking slowly, raced far back while remaining in the four path, then failed to respond to driving pressure nearing the far turn, was
pulled up approaching the five sixteenths pole, then got vanned off.

WORTHINGTON in midstretch, changing leads and sustained his charge to bid in the final sixteenth, but was fended off late. SIX MISSIONS saved ground
off of the pace, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show at the sixteenth pole. ASHCROFT tracked from midpack along the inside,
chased the leading group from the rail while attempting to shift out through upper stretch, then failed t keep pace with the top pair while inching between
horses at the furlong grounds, and kept on. JUST FOR LUCK hesitated before shying from an inner rival at the start causing him to spot the leaders many
lengths in the opening stages, trailed around both turns, offered a rail rally through midstretch, then shifted out in the final furlong and stayed on. DARYL'S
BOLT laid unhurried along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, and failed to factor. HARDY CHOICE set the pace along the inside, resisted the
eventual winner's bid entering the lane, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. GIOVANNINO stalked two to three wide, but was
outkicked by an inner foe entering the lane, lugged in before being quickly corrected in upper stretch, but faded between horses coming to the furlong
grounds. MY SANCTUARY settled far back along the inside, swung six wide entering the lane, but drifted in behind rivals in upper stretch, then steadied
behind foes at the three sixteenths pole. TEAM LEADER lost his hind footing at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to two path, shifted five wide
entering the lane, and failed to factor. DUST STORM prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. TOLLGATE CANYON
was void of speed two wide, floated five wide entering the lane, and made little impact.

YOUR SO SILLEA vied three wide, then two wide around the turn, drew clear entering the lane, and held sway safely from an outer pursuing rival through
the late stages. AIN'T BROKE broke a step slowly while last away, stalked outside of the top pair around the turn, chased a clearing YOUR SO SILLEA
through upper stretch, grinded away at his margin in the late stages, but was only second best. CANCEL THIS vied along the inside early on, chased those
foes into the turn, failed to keep pace turning for home before shifting to the four path entering the lane, yet kept on again to regain show entering the final
sixteenth, and fended off an inner foe for that position. NAPA CANDY rated at the rear along the inside, then stayed on, moved between rivals at the
sixteenth pole, but failed to reach an outer foe for show. SCENIC MASTERPIECE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, cleared her inner
counterpart nearing the turn while her outer challenger sustained vying pressure, but yielded to that foe approaching the lane, and weakened while hanging
on her left lead. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY raced at the rear two wide, and never got involved. DAME JOVIALE lacked speed in the four path around the turn,
and failed to factor.

Footnotes
GINA ROMANTICA tracked along the inside, patiently rated in the pocket around the far turn, split the leaders two wide leaving the three sixteenths pole,
surged between them to wrestle an advantage at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. MCKULICK (GB) tracked three wide, ranged up outside of the
leading pair turning for home before being floated to the four path entering the lane, but chased inner rivals as her stable-mate produced a bid, failed to keep
pace with that one in the final furlong while taking aim on BELLABEL (IRE) for place, and reached that rival in the shadow of the wire. BELLABEL (IRE)
prompted along the inside early on, allowed an outer rival to move to the fore before tipping outside of that foe around the first bend, stalked down the
backstretch, inched closer turning for home, bid while tipping to the three path entering the lane, vied through upper stretch as an inner GINA ROMANTICA
edged alongside, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong grounds, clung to place from an outer bidder in the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire
while saving show. CALIFORNIA ANGEL broke in, trailed two wide, swung to the six path in upper stretch, failed to gain through midstretch while hanging
on her left lead, yet offered a belated kick in the closing stages to threaten for place late, but just ran out of ground. SHE'S GONE settled off of the pace
along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home before coming into the lane in the five path, and failed to factor. PARIS PEACOCK (IRE) broke out,
rushed forward to se the pace two wide, cleared around the first turn, showed the way before encountering a trio of bids in upper stretch, and weakened at
the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES tracked in the three path, grinded away in the five path through midstretch to take aim on the leading pair in the final sixteenth, then
reeled them in at the wire. DIVINE LEADER vied three wide and between horses, dueled with his outer counterpart after being headed entering the lane,
regained an advantage in the final furlong, but was nailed at the wire. BEVERLY PARK vied four wide, led entering the lane, dueled with an inner game
DIVINE LEADER thereafter, but yielded to him while getting bested for place late. DON'T FORGET laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide
entering the lane, and chased. ULTIMATE settled two wide, swung to the six path entering the lane, but failed to menace while hanging on his left lead.
ALEXANDROS vied for the lead inside of a trio of foes, but gave way turning for home. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT lagged behind and never got involved.
MONTAUK DADDY vied two wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
