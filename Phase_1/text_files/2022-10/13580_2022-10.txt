Footnotes
JUDY'S WAY tracked in midpack in the three to four path and outside of the leaders, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage leaving the
furlong grounds, and drove clear. KIMBERLEY DREAM cleared off around the first turn, managed an uncontested advantage down the backstretch while in
the two path, but failed to resist JUDY'S WAY's bid in midstretch, and held place. GUANA CAY stalked outside of the leader from the two to three path
entering the backstretch chased that foe from between horses as around the far turn as an outer JUDY'S WAY ranged up alongside, got outmoved by that
foe entering the lane, then switched out and kept on. TELLER TO SING tracked along the inside, then chased evenly along the rail. LADY EMILY laid off of
the pace in the four path and failed to factor. LA TOURISTA raced in the two path while settling off of the pace, but was outrun around the far turn, and
eased through the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HIT SHOW bumped an inner rival at the start before taking up mildly when crowded between horses due to an inner foe shifting across his path, tracked two
wide and between horses, rated patiently while among foes around the turn, split rivals two wide in upper stretch, bid inside of an inward lugging BENGALS
GO at the furlong grounds, then drove clear leaving that marker. BENGALS GO stalked four wide, bid five wide entering the lane, forged a narrow
advantage in upper stretch before lugging in while hanging on his left lead, bore to the two path before meeting HIT SHOW's inside challenge nearing the
furlong grounds, got outkicked at that marker, then held place while continuing on his wrong lead. MO SATURDAYS leaned in and brushed an inner rival at
the start, settled off of the pace, launched a rally while tipping five wide and between horses turning or home, floated six wide entering the lane, stayed on to
take aim on the top pair entering the final furlong, but flattened out. GIROOVIN bumped with an inner foe early on, raced forwardly three wide and between
horses, shifted out six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. CANAVALL was void of early speed despite heavy early urging from the rider, chased in the five
path, inched closer while getting floated six wide at the five sixteenths pole, then stalled out seven wide entering the lane, and failed to menace. SPOILER
took a brush from an inner foe at the start, chased along the inside, but failed to maneuver around traffic entering the lane, and played no factor. CREATIVE
STRATEGY took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then yielded three wide and between horses
in upper stretch. TOAST TO COAST bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged well behind around the turn, swung out in upper stretch, and improved.
NOTION vied three wide, but drifted four wide at the quarter pole while getting outkicked by an outer rival, then weakened as that foe cut across his path
entering the lane. BACKSIDE BUZZ vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes, and weakened on his left lead.

Footnotes
OLLIEMEISTER pressed two wide, vied turning for home, drifted to the four path entering the lane before gaining an advantage in upper stretch, and drew
away through the final furlong. CARBONITE set the pace inside of a prompting OLLIEMEISTER, but was headed in upper stretch, and remained well clear
of show. EYES OF GLORY chased three wide, got floated to the five path entering the lane, and was best of the rest. YONO bumped an outer rival soon
after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path, then caught a tiring rival at the wire for a minor share. SISAWAY
NOW tracked two wide and between horses, chased the top pair while under urging in the two path around the turn, and tired. WESLEYAN was washed out
moving to post, bobbled a bit and bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position and backed out from inside of
rivals entering the turn, then steadily faded. RIGHT OF RUSH was bumped by rivals on either side at the start, raced at the rear two to three wide, came into
the lane in the five path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CENTER AISLE prompted the pace two wide, struck the fore entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, met CHANDANA's bid in the final sixteenth, and
lasted to the wire. CHANDANA stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair from the two path turning for home, tipped outside of them in upper stretch,
grinded away with a clear CENTER AISLE to catch in the final furlong, ranged up to that foe in the late stages, but just ran out of ground. SARAH HARPER
set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that foe entering the lane, and gave way. BE LIKE WATER broke a step slow, trailed along the inside,
improved inside of foes entering the lane, and stayed on while one-paced. CURRENT CLIMATE was off a beat slowly, took the turn in the three to four path
while off of the pace, came into the lane in the five path, and failed to factor. RECODED chased in the three path, but faded in the four path and between
horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
FRIENDLYPERSUASION pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, assumed command entering the lane, drew off under driving pressure in upper
stretch, then pulled further away from tiring rivals while put to hand through the final sixteenth. CLOSED CAPTION tracked two wide, then from between
horses down the backstretch, chased the top pair from the two path around the far turn, then surpassed a tiring rival for place in the final furlong while not
threatening the leader. PLAY THE MUSIC set the pace inside of a prompting rival, sparred with that foe around the far turn, but proved no match entering
the lane, weakened, yet saved show late. UP TO SOMETHING laid off of the pace in the two path, but lacked a rail rally through the lane. AZTEC NIGHTS
broke a bit out, stalked outside of the top pair, chased them around the far turn, and faded. NEED SOME MONEY bobbled leaving the gates, then took up in
tight quarters among rivals after needing a few strides to regain balance, lagged well behind the field around both turns, and never got involved.
OUTOFNOTHINGATALL stalked along the inside, but faded into the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
PRIVATE CREED tracked three wide and between horses, tucked two wide into the turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch for clear sailing, rallied to take
aim on the leading pair in the final furlong, ranged up to them while subtly being herded out entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. MO STASH broke a
step slowly while bumping an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three wide, swung to the six path turning for home, took a brush from an inner
rival in upper stretch before rallying with a good kick outside of foes, aimed between the top pair entering the final sixteenth, but steadied when NO NAY
HUDSON (IRE) slightly shifted into his soon after that marker, yet sustained his charge to gain place from that foe while chasing the outer leader home. NO
NAY HUDSON (IRE) bobbled at the start while still breaking towards the front, vied for the lead three deep, dueled with a game GHENT in upper stretch,
sparred into the final furlong before PRIVATE CREED ranged up alongside, drifted out slightly as that foe bid entering the final sixteenth, then yielded to him
and another rival in the closing stages. GHENT set the pace inside of a pair of hounding rivals, dueled gamely inside of NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) through
midstretch, and yielded a sixteenth from home. MOUNSIEUR COCO took a bump from an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between
horse, shifted out to the five path in midstretch before getting outkicked by an outer rival, and kept on. BOURBON THERAPY broke out and was taken in
hand to be corrected, stalked two wide and between horses, tucked to the rail into the turn, then only managed to chase through upper stretch before tiring.
KBCYA LATER tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position into the turn, chased under urging around the bend, shifted off of the fence in
upper stretch, but paused mildly in midstretch, then lacked a bid thereafter. REVERE NOTE saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. NUMERO SEIS vied
for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane. CASTELMOLA chased from midpack in the four path, then tired in the five path
entering the lane. THE RIDER OF MO STASH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PRIVATE CREED FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL
FURLONG, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
RAISE CAIN prompted the pace three wide, vied entering the lane, shifted in and pinched his most immediate counterpart at the three sixteenths pole while
forging an advantage, then kicked clear entering the final furlong. FASHION KING vied for the lead two wide and between horses, subtly failed to keep pace
while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, then was pinched and steadied when put to tight quarters among foes at the three sixteenths pole, recovered
and regained stride approaching the final furlong, then wore down a tiring rival to reach place nearing the wire. PERFORM set the pace inside of a pair of
hounding rivals, shifted out subtly and shared the blame in putting his immediate counterpart to tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole, but proved no
match for his widest competitor at the furlong grounds, tired thereafter, and lost place late. WHAT A BLAST tracked in midpack four wide, inched closer into
the turn, but drifted to the six path entering the lane, and chased thereafter. AERATOR tracked two wide, then only managed to chase before tiring through
the final furlong. MACHO VILLA bobbled at the start, raced at the rear two wide and between horses around the turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on. MCENROE broke slowly, stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane. BEAU DAY bumped with an outer rival in the opening stages
causing his rider to briefly lose her irons, then was outrun along the inside. MONBA QUAKE bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, was void of early
speed three wide, then weakened around the turn. THE RIDER OF FASHION KING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RAISE CAIN FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE, BUT THE OBECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
ANDTHEWINNERIS settled three wide, swung six wide turning for home, produced a good kick in upper stretch, rallied stoutly to take charge leaving the
furlong grounds, and shot clear. DEER DISTRICT lunged in and brushed an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide, dueled in upper stretch,
gained an advantage inside the final three sixteenths, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, then held place. REALLY GOOD tracked three wide,
chased in the four path around the far turn before fanning five wide and between horses entering the lane, got outkicked by his outer competitor while
hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, kept on with a grinding charge thereafter while being repeatedly bumped by an inner RARIFIED FLAIR, bid for
show along with that foe entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed. RARIFIED FLAIR tracked in midpack along the inside, shifted off the fence to be next to
an outer REALLY GOOD in upper stretch, bumped that foe multiple times in midstretch while sustaining a grinding charge, bid for show along with that foe
in the late stages, but was denied. OUR DREAM RYE'D rated at the rear two wide, floated three wide around the far turn before fanning seven wide
entering the lane, took a brush from an inner foe in upper stretch, then stayed on outside of rivals in the final furlong. BOPPY O staked three wide and
between horses, but was rated back to track those foes at the five furlong pole, tipped four wide into the far turn, yet only managed to chase the leaders
before being outkicked in midstretch, then yielded through the final furlong. RECKONING FORCE broke a step slowly before being put to tight quarters
between foes at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, cut the corner while awkwardly striding into the lane, picked up the pace before darting
outwardly leaving the three sixteenths pole, but took a bump from an outer ACCIDENT at the furlong grounds without finding clear sailing, then improved
between horses. ACCIDENT saved ground far back, but drifted out many paths in upper stretch, brushed an outer OUR DREAM RYE'D before shifting back
in and bumping RECKONING FORCE at the furlong grounds, and failed to factor. B MINOR stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase from
between horses in midstretch without menacing. GIGANTE staked four w ide, then three wide around the far turn, but failed to progress between horses in
upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. PANAMA (GB) set the pace along the inside, dug in in upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong
grounds. HENDRICKSON tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT stalked the leading trio from the inside around the first turn, tipped off of the fence at the five furlong pole, pursued the leaders from the three
path while being lightly nibbled at by the rider down the backstretch, loomed a danger outside of the top pair while in the four path into the far turn, engaged
the leader from the three path turning for home, assumed command entering the lane, and drew off under moderate urging. ARMY WIFE trailed, launched a
rally in the four to five path turning for home, gained place in upper stretch after the leader kicked away, and proved second best. PLAYED HARD set the
pace in the two path while inside of a pair of pressing rivals around the first turn, backed off to stalk those foes with nine sixteenths remaining, chased the
leaders turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch, and surpassed a tiring rival for show late. LETRUSKA got outbroke by an outer rival, rushed to vie for
the lead between a pair of foes while in the three path around the first turn, reached the front approaching the five furlong pole, cleared an inner rival and
tucked to the two path nearing the far turn as an outer foe sustained pressure, disposed of that rival before meeting MALATHAAT's challenge turning for
home, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and weakened. PRINCESS OF CAIRO pressed the top pair from the four path around the first
turn, continued to apply pressure to LETRUSKA from the three path nearing the far turn, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
REIGNING SPIRIT bumped an inner foe before taking back from tight quarters between horses at the start, laid unhurried along the inside, trailed, swung
eight wide entering the lane, unleashed a powerful kick in upper stretch to take aim on a newly leading OFFLEE NAUGHTY in the final furlong, ranged up to
that foe to bid late, dueled to the wire, and just got up. OFFLEE NAUGHTY tracked along the inside, then two wide, then in the three path around the far
turn before tipping five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, inched clear soon after as an outer REIGNING SPIRIT menaced, dueled
with that bidding foe in the closing stages, but got nailed. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS was reluctant to load, laid off of the pace three to two wide, fanned six
wide entering the lane, produced a grinding rally, but was outkicked leaving the furlong grounds, and kept on to reach show soon after. MILITARIST tracked
along the inside, tipped to the three path entering the lane, shifted in to chase along the rail in upper stretch, then split foes at the sixteenth pole to gain a
minor share. ALWAYS ABOVE tracked in midpack in the three to four paths, then got hung in the five path around the far turn before floating seven wide
entering the lane, and produced a mild kick. MUD PIE tracked two to three wide, ranged up four wide turning for home to bid entering the lane, vied through
upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and faltered. CIBOLIAN vied inside of a pair of foes early on, backed off to stalk approaching the
wire for the first time, then chased three wide and between horsre in upper stretch before yielding. NO SLO MO prompted the pace three wide, led and
crossed over through the lane for the first time, met a challenge from CELERITY around the second turn, dueled with that foe into and around the far turn,
dug in gamely to resist another rival's bid entering the lane, but weakened at the furlong grounds. FULL CHARGE took a bump from an outer rival at the
start, rated off to he pace in the two path, and made little impact. CELERITY laid off of the pace in the four path, tugged outside of foes approaching the
second turn, bid and dueled for the lead outside of NO SLO MO down the backstretch, but caved between horse entering the lane. POINT ME BY vied two
wide and between horses before stalking, then three wide around the final bend before weakening between horses in upper stretch. BLANKET OF ROSES
was outrun.
