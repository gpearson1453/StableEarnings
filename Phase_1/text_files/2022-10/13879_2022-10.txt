Footnotes
MONGOLIAN BOX broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, went to rail entering the turn, stayed along the rail on
the turn, dueled with outside rival in the lane and proved best late. TORRID TOMMY squeezed back at the start, rushed up three wide to take command on
the backstretch, entered turn two wide, dueled with inside rival in the stretch and gave way late. HELICOPTER PILOT bumped at the start, tracked duo
along the inside, shuffled back entering the turn, eased out late on the turn and launched a mild bid three wide. MR BUG Z settled for a stalking two wide
position on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to respond well enough to improve in the lane. NORWESTER away cleanly, settled
along the inside on the backstretch, cautiously paused early on the turn when rival shuffled back, continued along the inside rest of the way and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
PARTY POLITICS broke out, within range early, asked passing the eighth pole, kept in a drive to the wire while drifting in a touch to surge and get up at the
wire. CYBER ATTACK fractious in the gate, broke out and bumped rival at the start asked approaching the gap, asked once again left handed past the
eighth pole, drifted in a path in the final sixteenth to get nailed at the wire. POLITICAL ROYALTY bumped start, tried to get out early when asked left
handed, asked right handed and kept to a drive in a game try. JERIKO sat in the gate a long time, slow to gather while breaking in, shied from rival when
rival lugged in at the gap, asked right handed midway and responded well to finish willingly. TEMPLE COURT came in and bumped solidly at the start, tried
to drift out early, was in a uncomfortable trip midway to the wire as eventual winner was drifting in on her path. HAY SHAKER away cleanly, lightly bumped
by outside rival shortly after, and failed to rally under a drive. WASTING LIGHT bumped around soundly at the start, asked right handed midway, bumped
on hind end in the final sixteenth. APOLLITICAL JET away cleanly, drifted a touch when asked left handed early, and weakened under right handed urging
and was vanned off. FLASH OF GOLD reacted to CYBER MONDAY getting fractious, subsequently broke thru gate, and flipped in front of gate, was
checked and reloaded, away cleanly, drifted in passing the gap and weakened under a hand ride. AJ BORN RUNNIN was never allowed to run, broke a bit
slow, bumped around early, lacked a path throughout and had to steady off heels when finishing with interest.
