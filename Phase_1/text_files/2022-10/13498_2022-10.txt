I'M OVER U was well rated early, shifted out leaving the three eighths, made a four wide move on the turn and took over by the quarter pole, then was given
one right handed pop with the crop and responded well, then another left handed by the furlong marker and drew off to prove much the best. TIZ
HANDSOME dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid on the turn, then was headed by the winner and angled off the inside leaving the turn and
proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best. FREEDOM'S START was bumped hard at the start, advanced on the inside on the turn and then
lacked a late response, bested rest. KNOCKDOWN KID was hustled early and dueled for the lead on the outside and weakened. LOYAL TO THE GAME
