Footnotes
CENTERFOLD ANGEL rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and held on under
steady handling. STYLISH PAINT stalked off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch
but came back to finish well and was gaining on the winner. CHIT CHAT GIRL came in and made contact with HAD THE NOTION leaving the gate then
stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened into the lane. The latter
was bumped twice then pinched back at the start and moved in to save ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. MORTAL STORM drifted outward and into Perkeo into the first turn then
settled close through the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. DUSTWHIRL
WONDER exchanged contact with Had The Notion after the start, was bumped outward by PERKEO into the first turn and raced wide through the turn,
gave chase past the half mile pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. PERKEO became a bit edgy in the gate, was bumped outward and into
Dustwhirl Wonder into the first turn then mostly saved ground. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Chit Chat Girl for interference
leaving the gate, lodged by the rider of Had The Notion and disqualified the former to fourth place. In addition, the rider of Dustwhirl Wonder lodged a
complaint against the rider of Chit Chat Girl for interference into the first turn, but determined the latter was not at fault.

Footnotes
MISS MIDNIGHT was hustled to the front nearing the half mile pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and dug
in under steady handling to hold on well. LOST ANCHOR veered in leaving the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn
and finished well in second. TOUGH ONE chased through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and dueled through the
stretch for third. SALTY SAUL chased through the backstretch, angled out midway on the turn and entered the stretch about the six path, then outfinished in
the stretch duel for third. SUZZETTE STAR chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. NOBODY'S SECRET chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled out leaving the eighth pole and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. KARATS AND
GOLD chased inside, raced close at the rail on the turn then weakened toward mid-stretch. LEAH'S LEGACY gave chase and faded off the rail on the turn.
