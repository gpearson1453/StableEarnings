Footnotes
MO MARIANO set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command on the turn, then kicked clear leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove
best. PLAYGROUND LEGEND was well placed on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive and had no kick while getting up for
the place award. SIX WHIPS moved up between rivals leaving the five eighths marker, then went up to press the winner three wide by the half mile peg,
dueled outside the winner on the turn and faded in the drive, bested rest'. THAT SUN OF A GUN was settled early, was behind rivals leaving the three
eighths, then was two wide by the quarter pole and had no rally while getting up for the last spot in the superfecta. LOCO CUGINO tracked the early pace
three wide, then was between rivals on the turn and weakened. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE chased the pace four wide and weakened.

on the turn, came four wide into the drive, could not go with the winner while getting the place award. RAVEN'S QUEST was away alertly to set the pace
while clear on the inside, then was in the two path on the turn, let the winner come up the inside nearing the quarter pole, then faded in the drive, held show
award. ARROGANTE stumbled at the start, then advanced five wide by the three eighths marker, then made a wide bid nearing the quarter pole and came
widest into the lane but flattened out. FEARLESS MAE was reserved early, then saved ground by the quarter pole and had a belated rally but needed more.

Footnotes
MY TRUE PASSION was away alertly to set the pace while in the two path, then kicked away leaving the turn and was kept to steady left handed crop
urging to prove best. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH was well placed along the inside, then was shuffled back on the turn, finished willingly on the inside to
gain the place award. FINE ALEIGH was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased off the inside midway on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn
and rallied but needed more, missed place award. DON'T TELL DEREN was reserved early, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came six wide
into the lane and rallied late. BELMAR SUMMER stalked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. LUCKY
FREEDOM was reserved early, angled out in the lane and had no rally. SHELL BELLE stalked the pace between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and
weakened.

PICTURE THIS clean trip up the rail at the start, controlled the tempo with ease around the turn, stayed clear under a drive through the wire. FREEDOM
ROAD slow into stride, five wide move top of the lane, closed willingly through the stretch. SWIFTY DEVIL tracked off the rail into the turn, shifted inside
around the turn, finished evenly through the wire. THE COLORA KID tracked the leaders from the four path into the turn, asked leaving the three eighths
pole, no kick late. WHISTLEJACKET stalked the leader from the outside into the turn, between runners nearing the quarter pole, faded through the lane.
COUNTRY CHARLIE slow start, inside into turn, outrun. SENTIR ZULIANO shuffled back after the start, sprinted up wide into contention entering the turn,
clipped heels top of lane, jogged home.

DOROTHY'S THE BOSS tracked the duel early on from the three path, outside pursuit around the turn, went clear leaving the furlong marker, steady drive
through the wire. I'M SO EXTRA clean break inside, dueled outside around the turn, stayed on well late to secure the place money. WIND TRYST stumble
at the start, tracked leaders from inside, gained ground willingly through the wire. MYGIDGETMARIE coaxed along the inside early, dueled inside around
the turn, flat though deep stretch. IVY WAY hopped bad at the start, could not recover around the turn, no late gain. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY slow to start, off
the pace and off the rail into turn, moved inside for clear run around the turn, outrun through the stretch. IRON BERTIE slow start, never threatened.
