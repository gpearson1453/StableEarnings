Footnotes
BELLA DONA broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with SOUNDOFME NOTCALLN while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going three
furlongs, opened a clear margin and raced in hand through the lane. DESERT SPIRIT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain on the winner in the drive. RIGHT FOR YOU raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further approaching the stretch but was not a factor. MISS ABILITY lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten.
SOUNDOFME NOTCALLN disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half.

SEVENTH ST DIAMOND was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up for the dead-heat.
BRYNS MARK sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when set down for the drive and held on well to be on even terms
with SEVENTH ST DIAMOND. MAMA WAS A ROCKET tracked the leaders from the inside throughout, could not gain on the top pair late but finished with
good energy. DOER NOT A FAKER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. BELLAMUNDO settled off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. ATILLAS ANGEL was forwardly placed from between foes and weakened in the drive. DIAMOND
MINE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. METROS LIL POLLIE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
BODIE GOT GOLD lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was up in the final yards. DIABOLICAL STORM pressed the pace while racing
three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied through a prolonged drive and just missed. I THINK I'M HERE was reserved just
off the leaders early, checked briefly nearing the half-mile marker, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the leaders with a furlong to run, vied and
finished willingly. MASSIVE ROAR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position and failed to gain late. GO
RED RASCAL set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. BYE BYE MATTY P raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MAJORWAYHOME showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
ZENFULLY ZESTY showed brief speed and weakened. THE RIDER OF I THINK I'M HERE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST DIABOLICAL STORM
CONCERNING THE CHECKING OF HIS MOUNT AT HALF MILE POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY WHISKY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with ALL CHROME through the final
sixteenth and proved best. ALL CHROME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the winner with a sixteenth to
run, vied with that rival but could not get by late. DELBERT TOO settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished willingly. MCTHANKS was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished evenly late. LARIAT disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. NO PASA NADA raced off the pacesetters early, moved
five-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. DIABOLICAL GATOR chased the leaders from the inside, steadied
nearing the three-eighths marker, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. IZERIGHT lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn,
was bumped approaching the stretch and failed to menace. CERVEZA dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened in the drive. DESERT
REWARD raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. ON A WARPATH showed brief speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and weakened. MONTEREY SECRET disputed the pace from between foes, weakened after going three furlongs, was bumped into the
lane and eased.
