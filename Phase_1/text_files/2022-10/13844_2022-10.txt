Footnotes
LUCKY BOSS was void of early speed along the inside, picked up stride in the four path around the turn, swung to the six path while producing a circling
rally, swept past the leading quartet approaching the final furlong, and drew clear. MAHAAMEL pressed the leading pair from the four path, chased those
rivals under steady urging around the turn, produced a bid in upper stretch, but proved no match for an outer bidder nearing the furlong grounds, and pulled
clear of show. FLINT RIDGE laid close up behind the clearing pace setter under a snug hold as that foe shifted down across his path, pulled to vie outside of
that rival and from the three path while between horses at the five furlong pole, sparred around the turn, but was outkicked by a pair of outer bidders in
upper stretch, and kept on. FILIPPO tracked in the three path, shifted in and brushed an inner rival approaching the five sixteenths pole, then split foes two
wide at the three sixteenths pole, and flattened out. EYES OF GLORY laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. WRITEITONTHEICE never
got involved. LANSDOWNE set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, vied with one while tucking to the rail from the two path into the turn, then weakened in
upper stretch. CHASING RAINBOWS raced forwardly along the inside, but faded into the turn, got brushed at the five sixteenths pole, and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN LUNA set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, spurted away from him entering the lane, and widened under moderate urging.
BOURBON ON FIRE bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, tracked along the inside, chased the leading pair around the turn, shifted to the four
path and outside of them entering the lane, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, straightened and surpassed a faltering foe inside the final furlong to gain place
while not threatening the leader, and fended off an outer bidder for place through the final sixteenth. SUPE broke a step slow before checking behind
troubled rivals at the start, ,lagged well behind into the turn, swung seven wide entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes to bid for place entering the final
sixteenth, but was denied. BUCKY BIK COIN vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner, gave way entering the lane, hung on her left lead until
awkwardly changing over at the furlong grounds, yet continued to falter. SILVESTRE bumped an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three
path, and lacked a bid. PERJURY was jostled between horses at the start, chased from midpack in the three path, drifted inwardly turning for home, and
failed to menace along the rail through the lane. WILLACY saved ground off of the pace, came into the lane in the three path, and made little impact
between horses. MR. MARIAH broke a beat slowly, lacked speed two wide, fanned to the six path while between horses entering the lane, but failed to rally
while lugging in. INFINITE ZEAL also was bumped and jostled between horses at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path approaching the turn, but
weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MR BOB prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, gained an advantage entering the lane, and kicked away under steady urging. ONE GIANT
LEAP tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the two path while right behind the leaders turning for home, chased the clearing leader while
bidding for place between rivals at the furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position a sixteenth from home. HILL OF TARA stalked three wide, failed to
keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, bid for place at the furlong grounds along with an inner ONE GIANT LEAP, but was outkicked by that
rival soon after. GOLDEN BANDIT set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that foe entering the lane, and gave way. SIR trailed in the two path,
shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and improved along the rail. WASHINGTON'S UNION broke a step slowly before taking up between horses at the start,
took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and made little impact. BOUDIN tracked four wide, but faded turning for home. A. P. AVATAR was
washed out moving to post, chased along the inside, but weakened entering the turn.

Footnotes
CEES GET DEGREES broke on top, gradually shifted out while establishing the front, floated an outer foe into others causing a chain reaction of contact at
the five furlong pole, showed the way from a pair of chasers while taking the bend in the three path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and kicked
away. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then stayed on between horses
to bid for place leaving the furlong grounds, and secured that position a sixteenth from home. FLAGS UP got pinched back between horses soon after the
start, trailed, tipped to the four path into the turn before tucking to the two path entering the lane, stayed on while shifting out in midstretch, and stayed on to
reel in an outer foe for show at the wire. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE escaped the incident at the five furlong pole unscathed after taking a light brush, stalked
the leader from the outside and in the four path, floated to the six path to remain outside of that foe entering the lane, but yielded in midstretch, and got
caught by an inner foe for show at the wire. MEAN JAKEY stalked along the inside, but failed to progress in upper stretch before fading. STONEVICIOUS
was prominent among foe early on, but was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the five furlong pole causing him to be jostled and bounced around
multiple times, steadied out and settled far back while shifting towards the rail nearing the turn, and failed to factor. WELLMAN was knocked off stride when
taking an bump to his hind quarters from an inner foe at the five furlong pole, failed to keep pace soon after despite strong urging, and tired. RUNAWAY
HARRY broke forwardly, but was floated out by the pace setter approaching the five furlong pole, bumped and jostled with an outer foe while in tight
quarters causing him to steady hard at that marker, then chased from the three path into the turn, and weakened in the five path approaching the lane.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY SUNDAY mildly nudged with an inner foe at the start, saved ground in midpack early on, improved between horses approaching the five furlong
pole, loomed a danger from the pocket around the far turn, slipped inside of the leader through a narrow seam at the three sixteenths pole, then kicked
away at the furlong grounds. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) tracked along the inside, retreated to midpack down the backstretch, searched for racing room
entering the lane before hoping of a rail seam in upper stretch, but altered course after that meager hole closed at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a
chase to bid for place between horses at the furlong grounds, and prevailed. STAR WISHER tracked in midpack two wide, then from between horses
around the far turn, shifted from the five to six path in upper stretch, rallied to bid for place at the furlong grounds along with an inner rival, but was outkicked
for that position at the sixteenth pole. ALL ABOUT ME set the pace, showed the way around the far turn with her ears picked, shifted out to the three path
entering the lane before being steered inwardly to deter inner bidders in upper stretch, but saw the eventual winner slip through at the three sixteenths pole,
then failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, and gave way. WAVE SKIPPER broke a step slowly, settled far back along the inside, took the far turn in
the three path, and improved between horses. C C CRUISE CONTROL was bumped by an inner foe and nudged an outer rival at the start, laid off of the
pace two to three wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. AROUND THE SUN bumped an inner rival soon after the start, rated far
back two wide, awaited racing room behind traffic in the three path turning for home, but lacked a rally once clear. KATIE GOT LUCKY lacked speed three
to four wide, floated to the eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SOUTHLAWN got keen leaving the wire for the first time, then saved ground off
of the pace, but to no avail. MURKY broke out and bumped a foe, stalked outside of the leader leaving the first turn, chased from between horses around
the far turn, then drifted out while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, and weakened between horses. BUTTONS acted up in the gates, then broke multiple
lengths slow while hopping at the start, trailed, and never got involved. AZTEC NIGHTS bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, stalked three wide,
then faded in the six path entering the lane. THE TRAINER OF ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HEAVENLY
SUNDAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SCARLET STRIPE set the pace inside of a pressing rival while remaining in the three path around the turn, then drew off in upper stretch, and was driven
home to seal the deal. PARENTS PRIDE broke a beat slowly, moved forward and shifted out to press outside of the leader and from the four path, inched
closer in hopes of bidding turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and held place from an inner chaser. SUNNY RIVER stalked along the
inside, but failed to progress in upper stretch, inched closer to place in the final furlong, but failed to bid. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX chased two wide, but
gave way through the lane. FIDDLE tucked to the rail entering the turn whilst midpack, then saved ground while tracking, but to no avail. RAVELLA lacked
speed along the inside, and never got involved. SEIZE THE MARQUET broke a step slowly, raced towards the rear two wide, and was outrun. SUPER
COOL STORM was last away after breaking a bit slowly, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KEY OF LIFE set the pace while well in hand around the turn as SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM applied pressure, swiftly repelled that foe's bid once set down
entering the lane, drew off before feeling a right handed tap in the final furlong, and was geared down through the final sixteenth. LADY RADLER bobbled
outwardly at the start, stalked along the inside, claimed place from a faltering foe approaching the furlong grounds, and was second best. BABY GOT
BACKSPIN bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the five path, stayed on to claim show at the sixteenth
pole, and lasted. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA laid at the rear along the inside, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and rallied willingly, but ran out of
ground to reach show. SATIN DOLL lacked speed along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home before shifting six wide in upper stretch, but failed to
menace. TWO MINUTE DRILL bumped with an inner rival before brushing with an outer foe at the start, chased the top pair from the three path, but failed to
progress before yieldin between horses in the final furlong. FLAMAND chased from midpack in the two path under steady urging, but weakened turning for
home. SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM prompted the eventual winner from the outside, attempted a bid nearing the lane, but was quickly turned away entering
the lane, proved no match while laboring in that foe's dust in upper stretch, and faltered through the final furlong. WILLOW BEND bobbled a bit at the start,
lacked speed in the three path, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. TIME FOR CHAMPAGNE was outrun.

Footnotes
SPARKLE BLUE tracked along the inside, pursued from behind the clearing leader in upper stretch, easily tipped outside of her at the furlong grounds,
sustained a bid soon after, and kicked clear. CALIFORNIA ANGEL threw her head while breaking a bit inwardly, then was slow into stride early on, rated at
the rear along the inside, swung six wide in upper stretch, then rallied outside of foes while hanging on her left lead through the final furlong, and reached
place at the wire. TURNERLOOSE tracked three wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, chased in pursuit of minor placings, produced a bid for place
approaching the wire along with an outer CALIFORNIA ANGEL, and got outfinished. BUBBLE ROCK cleared off around the first turn, felt pressure from an
outer rival around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, held sway before meeting SPARKLE BLUE's bid inside the final furlong, got surpassed
approaching the final sixteenth, faltered soon after, and lost place to a pair of foes nearing the wire. MAJESTIC GLORY (GB) was keen early on while
achieving an inside tracking position in midpack, settled into stride nearing the backstretch, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, delayed her lead change
to the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick thereafter. LADY PUCHI settled towards the back in the two path, shifted four wide turning for home before
fanning seven wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. BICAMERAL raced in midpack two wide, but retreated before tucking to the rail into the far turn,
and made little impact. MY PHILLY TWIRL stalked two wide, pressed the leader around the far turn, but chased her while failing to keep pace in upper
stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. SUNROOF raced at the rear two wide, and never got involved. HEAVENLY HELLOS laid off
of the pace three wide, but faded while getting floated to the six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
MOON SWAG tracked two wide and between horses under a snug hold, shouldered his way three wide at the nine sixteenths pole for clear sailing, ranged
up to the leader into the far turn to bid with five sixteenths to go, shifted down to the two path while sparring turning for home, gained an advantage entering
the lane, and edged clear through the final furlong. POWDER RIVER set the pace along the inside, met MOON SWAG's challenge around the far turn,
resisted his bid turning for home, but was headed entering the lane, gave way in the final furlong, but remained clear of show. PRINCESS OF CAIRO laid off
of the pace along the inside, improved between horses down the backstretch, continued to inch closer under steady urging along the inside around the far
turn to chase the top pair entering the lane, but leveled off in upper stretch, failed to sustain a bid, and held show late. TAP DANCING LADY trailed in the
two path, gained turning for home, shifted out approaching the final sixteenth, and stayed on be fended off for show late. GERRI B tracked three wide,
floated four wide with nine sixteenths to go, chased the leaders around the far turn, then tired turning for home. EMMELINE stalked two wide, but yielded
between horses around the far turn. XTREMA stalked along the inside, but faded entering the far turn. BIG BAD DIVA lacked speed in the four path, and
made little impact. MICROCAP laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and tired.

Footnotes
OUTADORE set the pace inside of a pressing foe, shook clear in upper stretch, and held sway. MARK OF THE Z vied for the lead two wide, but failed to
keep pace with his inner counterpart while hanging on his left lead through the lane, and safely managed place. BREAKING THE RULES tracked in
midpack in the three path, then stayed on in the two path through the final furlong to reel in an outer rival for show at the wire. CHARCOAL broke a step
slowly, rushed to stalk two wide, tucked to the inside into the turn, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but failed to progress, then lost show to
an inner rival at the wire. PROVEN STRATEGIES saved ground off of the pace, searched for racing room behind traffic while in the four path in upper
stretch, split foes five wide in the final furlong and moved up. UNIFIED REPORT tracked two wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally.
BOLDOR settled two wide, shifted six wide and between horses coming to the furlong grounds, and failed to factor. INHALATION (GB) tracked along the
inside, but faded. BOB'S EDGE broke in while off a step slowly, raced far back three wide into the turn, swung eight wide in midstretch, and made little
impact. TOTALLY BOSS tracked, came into the final furlong nine wide, and failed to menace. KNOCKER DOWN broke a bit slowly, raced in midpack four to
five wide before floating six wide entering the lane, and tired. FRANCATELLI stalked in the three path, but yielded between horses.
