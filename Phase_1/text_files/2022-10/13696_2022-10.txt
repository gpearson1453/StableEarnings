SPEIGHTSTER RED pursued the pacesetters outside, bid into the stretch collared the pacesetter and quickly drew away. JARLIAN lacked speed, angled
out in the stretch and closed well. FRENCH TOAST led inside, moved clear before half a mile then weakened late. TWO PRINCES trailed along the inside
then narrowed the gap while no threat. GRAZELY prompted the leader outside to the stretch and faltered. JACKS AMERICAN PIE was urged close up
inside for half a mile and stopped.

DADASHEV dueled outside, led into the stretch and edged clear through the stretch driving. STARSHIP GOTHAM settled outside, moved wide on the turn
and was up for the place late. MAJOR CAM moved inside the dueling leaders, was asked for run on the turn and had only a mild gain. TOUGH WORKOUT
prompted the pace three wide to midstretch and weakened. WHATA GUY alternated for the advantage inside and proved empty in the final furlong. ASH OF
MY ENEMY chased wide and lacked a rally. SWEET PARI lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. ALIGNMENT broke very poorly and was always
outrun. TOLEDO GOLD broke slowly, raced far behind and gave way readily.

SOCIAL GROUP rated off the pacesetter outside, led midway on the final turn, held off challenges from both sides and edged away late. SON OF A SAINT
settled inside, bid into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. WAGON BOSS stalked the pacesetter three wide, rallied into the stretch then
weakened slightly in the final eighth. PIGGYBANK broke awkwardly then chased inside with a mild rally. RELISHMENT lacked speed in the two path,
moved wide in the stretch. CANTSTOPRUNNING hustled to a clear advantage for five furlongs then faltered. KINGS HIGHWAY raced wide and weakened
steadily. AMERICAN FLEET lacked speed and was never in contention.

GREMLIN dueled three wide, took over midway on the turn then edged away under moderate pressure. THE MASE firmly rated off the leaders, advanced
inside and made a gradual late gain. AGELESS ENDEAVOR raced wide throughout and continued willingly while no threat. TITANIUM RECKAGE rushed
up in the opening quarter to duel inside, angled out in the stretch and tired. DRUNKEN BRIDGE well placed outside trio of duelers then flattened out in the
stretch. ENFORCER engaged in a heated duel between rivals down the backstretch and weakened. SOUL PROVIDER chased wide and gave way readily.
SONIC BLOOM stumbled badly at the break, raced inside and was no factor.

PEAK OF CHIC dueled briefly outside, easily moved clear on the turn then weakened in the final furlong and just lasted. FLASHING DIAMOND pursued the
pacesetters inside, angled out in the stretch, rallied gamely and just missed. AWESOME PAL saved ground early, moved wide on the turn then closed
strongly too late. FREE TO FLY raced off the leaders three wide, was asked for run on the turn but lacked a response. IMPERIAL MOON flashed speed
inside down the backstretch then gave way readily. SHE DAZZLE dropped far behind then passed a tiring opponent. PROSPERA raced wide under urging
in the opening quarter and retreated.

vied along the inside to the stretch and came up empty. GENGHIS trailed early, advanced between rivals and closed well. CUMBERLAND AVENUE raced
off the pace in the two path and faded in the stretch. SNEAKINESS was urged close up four wide down the backstretch and weakened. MI TRES POR

Footnotes
DAYTIME LOVER raced in closest pursuit of the loose leader, bid to the front near the quarter pole then rallied clear. TOMATER GATOR split rivals into the
far turn, altered the course in the lane and was up for the place. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY pursued the pacesetters three wide, bid closer turn then faded.
STAR LUCK shook loose in opening quarter mile then proved empty in the stretch. STRAWBERRY RED prompted the pace along the inside and gave way.
KOWBOY KARMA trailed far behind and was never in contention. IRONBOUND dropped back early and stopped abruptly.
