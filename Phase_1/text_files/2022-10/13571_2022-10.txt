Footnotes
WEEMISSGRAMMY broke out, stalked off the rail or three wide to the stretch, roused and rallied through the drive, reeled in leader and led past sixteenth
marker then just lasted from the inside. LOOKINTOGETEVEN settled either along the rail or two then three wide, tipped out bit in upper stretch, closed
strongly in late stages and just missed outside winner. CLASSY broke out, angled over early then checked off heels nearing first turn, chased three wide
into the stretch and was along late for the show. VERY SCARY was bumped by outside rival at the start, briefly dueled from the inside then gained
command, edged away and set uncontested pace to last turn, was overtaken in the drive and lost third late. TIZ MY PRINCESS bumped leaving the gate,
chased two or three wide to the second bend then between rivals, roused in upper stretch and went willingly to the wire. MARGOT'S GIRL pulled and
became rank early while moving to the inside, tracked leaders from along the rail, moved up bit around last turn then flattened in the drive. VIOLET STORM
chased from off the rail or three wide, angled five wide exiting the last bend and continued on the outside while no threat. BABY'S DREAM also crossed
over early, saved ground throughout but failed to seriously threaten. UNWHIRLED broke in and bumped rival, forced the early issue then was closest
pursuer to the second turn, moved up slightly on that bend then weakened. I GIVE UP broke out and bumped, reserved early, angled to the two path and
did not menace. CLEARANCE bumped at the start, forwardly placed from along the fence, chased slightly off the rail and weakened. BIG SEVEN unhurried
early from slightly off the rail, raced two wide into the backstretch then steadily dropped back into and around the last turn and faded.

Footnotes
APPREHEND bumped start, forced the pace outside leader into and through the backstretch, challenged outside that rival nearing quarter marker, gained
command entering the stretch and powered away under few right handed taps and in hand late. HOLDEN THE LUTE reserved from off the rail, stalked from
three path to final bend, tipped out four wide leaving that bend and was along late for second. BREAKFAST RIDE was sent to the front, under pressure
through the middle stages, relinquished control just past quarter marker, remained inside, weakened some and was tagged for the place. AMERICAN
ADMIRAL bumped back at the start, reserved three then four wide, traveled five then four wide on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and did
not threaten. MASTERING was three wide into clubhouse turn, stalked on same path to last bend, under bit of asking to remain close on that turn then also
weakened. IMPOSSIBLE TASK stalked leaders from the inside into the backstretch, remained prominent along the rail to the second turn but had little left
for the drive.

IZZY EM tracked leaders from off the rail, moved up three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed under right handed urging from
the outside and got up in well-timed trip. PHENOM shifted leaving the gate, settled well off the rail, chased four wide to the far turn, engaged leaders four
deep in the drive and gained second in final strides. CUBAN CRISIS (GB) was forwardly placed on two path, remained two wide on the turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, joined leaders later in the drive and could not stave off top pair late. AUTOMAX (IRE) reserved from the inside, saved ground but lacked room
to advance, came out slightly and improved placing. SIDE BY SIDE forced the early pace from between foes, bid past quarter marker, continued outside
same rival through the drive but was swallowed by outside rivals nearing the finish. DREAM A DREAM showed good early foot from the inside, fought back
when challenged nearing top of the stretch, continued gamely inside same rival then weakened in the late stages. REAL FIRE attended the early pace from
the outside then three deep, came four wide into the stretch and weakened some in the drive. TAKEMEBYTHEHAND (GB) chased from off the rail then
three wide on the turn, came out slightly in upper stretch but did not threaten. FIRST POINT chased while slightly off the rail, lacked room and altered out at
the three-sixteenths pole and lacked needed late response. BELLA VOLPE settled off the leaders, came in bit, chased three wide on the turn and lacked
needed rally. LAURA MARS (IRE) moved up early to force the pace from the rail then got crowded near the half-mile pole, waited behind the leaders on the
turn, then weakened when asked in the lane. AWSOME DONNA off very slow, dropped far back then lugged out crossing the dirt, trailed from the inside and
was never a factor.

BLESSED TOUCH broke out bit and bumped rival, was sent to the front, edged away late on the turn then spurted away in upper stretch and tallied
convincingly while just show the stick and in hand in final yards. CALIFORNIA ROCKET moved up inside to prompt the early pace, continued in two path,
tipped out three wide leaving the turn and moved past inside rival late for second. DANCING MO settled off the pace, chased three wide into and around the
turn, continued in same path but was no late threat. RILEY G broke in bit and bumped inside rival twice, forced the early pace outside foe, lost contact on
the turn and weakened. ALWAYS AT EASE chased while bit off the fence, was two wide into the bend, came in bit then angled out slightly later on the bend
and weakened. ROYALE FLARE was off a step slow, chased from the inside and failed to reached serious contention in the stretch. BOURBON GLAZE
veered out leaving the gate, reserved from well off the rail, raced four wide around the bend and faded. CARSON JEN was bumped from both sides at the
start, rushed up and was top pursuer to top pair early, fell back around the turn, dropped back further in upper stretch and also faded.

GOING TO VEGAS stepped to the front early, controlled pace while deftly rated into the backstretch, quicken pace approaching the final bend, shook free
under asking late on the final bend and in upper stretch and safely held under urging. FAMILY WAY content to stalk pacesetter while outside QUEEN
OFTHE TEMPLE, remained on same path into the stretch, came out some then angled out further in upper stretch, closed furiously from the outside in final
yards and nailed BELLAMORE for second. BELLAMORE tracked the pace while outside SCARABEA to the final bend, under asking while three wide
around that turn and into the stretch, rallied between rivals and gained second briefly nearing the wire but could not stave off FAMILY WAY. FLUFFY
SOCKS content to lag back while saving ground, remained inside to the final turn, shifted out three then four wide into the stretch and finished very willingly
from between rivals. SCARABEA prominently placed from the inside stalking the pace, remained inside to the stretch, responded to strong urging in the
drive but gave ground grudgingly in the final yards. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE hugged the rail chasing the pace, remained inside to the stretch, came out
some passing sixteenth marker and finished with interest from between rivals. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) pressured the pacesetter through six furlongs,
dropped back bit into and around the final turn, was under asking to remain close into the stretch and then weakened through the drive.

AND TELL ME NOLIES stumbled leaving the gate, reserved on two wide path early, chased three wide to final turn, angled out further entering the stretch,
reeled in top pair in upper stretch, edged away while coming in some then responded to strong hand encouragement in deep stretch to held off runner-up.
UNCONTROLLABLE reserved from the inside, moved up on two path on the final turn, went in a tight spot trying to split foes on the far turn, came out
further past eighth marker, whittled gap on winner approaching the wire and finished strongly outside that rival. JUSTIQUE was off a bit slow from outside,
unhurried while angling over early, moved back off the rail on the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and outside runner-up, could not match that
foe late in the drive but was along for third. ICE DANCING forced the pace from between rivals into and thru the backstretch, continued on same path into
the stretch, had little resistance for the winner in upper stretch and weakened in late stages. HOME COOKING was three wide around the initial turn, forced
the pace three deep, dueled outside rival around the final turn and into the stretch then weakened in the drive. NAUGHTY LOTTIE showed good early foot
from along the rail, resisted when challenged in middle stages, regained slim advantage, dropped back on the final bend and gave way in the stretch.
HUNTINGCOCO tucked in between dueling leaders from along the rail, pulling bit into the backstretch, lost contact around the final bend and also gave way
in the stretch.

prevailed in final yards. WHO'S CANDY quickly sped to the front, set uncontested pace into and on the turn, came two wide into the stretch, dug in when
challenged past sixteenth marker, fought gamely but was collared in final feet. DETROIT CITY stalked while outside rival, tipped three wide into the stretch,
could not match top pair later in the drive but was best of rest. MY SUMMER DREAM settled outside, raced four deep into the turn, continued on same path
into the ewstretch and gained a minor award. MORAWETH trailed early while outside foe, chased two wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. UNCLE
JEFF stalked from along the rail, angled off the fence late on the turn and into the stretch and finished between rivals. LUCKY BOSS reserved off the early
pace, angled over, found the fence, continued inside on the turn and through the stretch. MISSED CALL chased three wide or between foes to the turn,
remained on same path into the lane and weakened. GINSBURNED reserved from off the rail, traveled four wide around the turn, came out further entering

Footnotes
CAVE ROCK gained lead into first turn, was under pressure setting the fractions into last turn, inched away and came out slightly around that bend, rebroke
in upper stretch, quickly shook free and was never challenged in the lane while proving much best. NATIONAL TREASURE attended the early pace, was
closest pursuer to pacesetter to the second turn, under asking to remain in contact with leader around that bend, came three wide into the lane, had no
answer for CAVE ROCK in the stretch but was clearly next best. HEJAZI chased four wide into first turn, remained bit wide through middle stages, chased
three wide leaving the backstretch and around last turn, drifted out bit in upper stretch, came back in later in the lane and bested others. GANDOLFINI
chased along the rail early, came out bit, regained the inside on the backstretch and was no threat to the top trio. MAN CHILD bumped in the beginning,
between rivals early, chased slightly off the rail, continued between foes and two wide, tipped out three wide into the stretch and also weakened. SKINNER
settled off the pace, went four then three wide on the first turn, came three wide into the stretch and dropped back in the stretch. MACNAMARA broke in bit
then was squeezed back at the start, trailed along the rail early, continued inside and faded in the stretch. ODONATA broke in and bumped rival, caught
three deep into first turn, came in some in middle stages and later gave way readily in the stretch.

short lead later in drive but could not stave off SIGILOSO. GYPSY KING chased three deep early, drifted six then seven wide crossing the dirt portion,
challenged inside furlong marker and was up late for third. COMMANDER (FR) bobbled bit in opening strides, shifted out four wide nearing the dirt portion,
was forced out further into the lane, continued on far outside and gained a minor award. VANTASTIC broke a step slow, reserved early, later found the rail,
made bold move inside entering the stretch, loomed along the rail past eighth pole then lost the show in final yards. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) chased while
outside foe down the hill, was fanned six, seven and even eight wide into the stretch, remained on far outside and finished well. KENTUCKY PHAROAH
rushed up and dueled from the inside down the hill, drifted out some crossing the dirt portion, was between rivals and three deep in upper stretch then
weakened. NEPTUNE'S STORM stalked from between foes and bit off the rail down the hill, forced to steady off the heels of KENTUCKY PHAROAH
entering the stretch and finished with intrest. RIP CITY stalked from the inside, drifted three wide leaving the hill, bid between rivals passing eighth marker
but lacked needed late punch.

Footnotes
BALLY'S CHARM assumed control from along the rail on the first turn, dictated the pace from the inside, inched away around the final bend, remained
hugging the fence thru the stretch and dug in desperately in the final yards to hold. FIRST PREMIO chased from from the inside, advanced along the rail in
upper stretch, came out slightly passed sixteenth marker and barely missed from outside the winner. HAWK OF WAR stalked from along the fence,
advanced on the last turn, angled out slightly in upper stretch, battled between rivals in the drive and won decision for third. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
shifted out shortly after the start, forced the early pace from off the rail and outside winner, between rivals into the stretch, loomed three deep through the
drive and lost bob for third. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR stumbled leaving the gate, unhurried while crossing over, was pulling bit into backstretch, raced four wide
into the stretch, came out further in the lane and finished well. FLY THE SKY bothered from inside at the start, prominent early while three wide, raced
between foes into the lane, came out slightly thru the drive and finished well while four wide in late stages. RED KING between rivals early, chased on two
wide path into far turn, remained bit off the rail and weakened. ONE FAST BRO trailed from along the rail for most of the way, angled off the fence leaving
the last turn and was no late threat.
