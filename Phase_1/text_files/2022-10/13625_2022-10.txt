in and closed the gap on the winner late. AZTEC PRINCESS mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch,
then ran evenly in the lane and gained the show. LEVISA hopped at the start, hit the gate and was hard to rated inside, moved to position on the two path
through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened. HONEY HAULER well placed and off the rail, faded three and
four wide through the second turn. BRIGHTHILL was no factor. FREE SHOT was never involved.

Footnotes
FRANZ JOSEF sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was
kept to the task. BARNEGAT LIGHT rated close up, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then was
no threat to that one and held the place safe. READY REWARD mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, evened and gained the show. WEST NEWTON (GB) allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and
improved his position. BEACH HOLIDAY ran evenly. HARPOON HARRY broke out at the start, moved up to be well placed outside, gained position into the
second turn, held that striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader, lugging in, and weakened.

Footnotes
KITTEN AROUND allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear late.
WATCHOUTFORWEAVER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and lacked the needed late kick. WILD GUESS well placed and between, held position on the two path through the second turn, fanned four wide into the
stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the show. DR. HYDE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through
the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and got up for a share. CACTUS KEVIN mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. FALK set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch and maintained
command through the second turn, then steadied between at the furlong marker and faded. UWHARRIE broke sharply from the gate and was rated inside,
then faded through the second turn. GOTTA GO GATOR was no factor. BIALYSTOCK was never involved.

Footnotes
BOO BOO KITTY sprinted to a clear lead soon after start, held sway without challenge and lasted under steady pressure. FORGOTTEN PEACE well placed
and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one, while clearly best of the
rest. PUPPYMONKEYBABY allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through and flattened out.
SHE'S PEACHY KEEN well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and evened out, holding a
share. SHE'S DANCING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and ran evenly. MAGGIE'S BID
allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved her position. STAND BY YOU passed tiring rivals.
TOOLCAT well placed, gained position three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. SHEISTHEHERO tracked the pace and faded
through the turn.
