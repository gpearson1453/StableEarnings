Footnotes
MALIBU S S vied between through the far turn, was still in a duel entering the lane from the three path, shook clear inside the eighth pole, cleared and held
to the wire. RICH KINGDOM vied for the lead three wide through the turn, continued to duel with the winner through the lane, yielded to the top one nearing
the sixteenth pole and settled for second best. TITLE SHOT raced behind the three rival duel through the far turn, shifted from the two to the four path
through the lane and was up for the show. ENDLESS SUNSET was in the two path through the turns when near the back, came into the lane from the four
path and lacked the needed response. IRISH DECLARATION trailed through the turns and into the lane then showed energy too late. BRESLAU vied for
the lead along the inside of two others, remained a contender into the lane then was empty after straightening. PER THE INDIANA HORSE RACING
COMMISSION, MALIBU SS HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HERMANA chased the pace from the four to the three path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, was hand ridden to the lead near the eighth pole,
urged right-handed one time approaching the sixteenth pole then was kept to the task to the end. EDEN JANE chased the pace along the inside through the
turn and into the lane, came off the inside for the drive and gained the place spot late while not a menace to the winner. CAMI CAT was off alertly to gain the
lead at once, cleared well before the first call, raced in the two path through the turn while still clear, was challenged into the lane, could not keep up with the
winner then lost the place spot late. HONEYCOMB chased the pace from the three to the two path through the turn then weakened after turning into the
lane. MIRACLE SHOES never a factor while along the inside. UNDERCOVER LADY was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and tired.

BREAKUP WITH TITOS chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid two wide in late turn, gained the lead into the lane then widened while
being kept to the task. QUITE WHIMSICAL was in the four to the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path,
stayed on well and was up for the place spot late while under strong handling. EXPRESS LADY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid
three wide in late turn, could not keep up with the top one and lost the place spot late. FAIRE EXPRESS raced along the inside through the turn while near
the back, came into the lane from the three path and lacked a closing response. TRIP CHARGE never a factor while in the two path through the turn.
HOOSIER PREMIUM cleared for the lead along the inside into the turn, was caught after mid-turn then steadily faded. EULALIA was outrun while along the
inside.

Footnotes
TAPIT'S SPIRIT was two wide and between rivals through the turn, tipped three wide into the lane, found room while straightening, caught the leader inside
the eighth pole then drove past. UNPREDICTABLE BAY was three wide through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the four path, gained
the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while staying on to be second best. BROKEN RIB saved ground through the turn and
into the lane, was blocked and shuffled straightening into the lane, got clear just inside the eighth pole and finished with good energy albeit, tool late.
POLAR WIND was bumped at the start and settled back to trail the field, raced in the four path through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive then
flattened. FLAP JACK was four wide through the turn when not far back, came into the lane from the five path and weakened. A FEW TOO MANY gained a
short lead early, vied for the lead through the turn while in the two path, entered the lane close up then faded. KEEPIN IT CLASSY vied for the lead along
the inside through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. RUGGS was unhurried early while off the inside, raced through the three path on the turn

ULTIMATE MISSION was unhurried while off the inside, moved three then four wide through the far turn, swung into the lane with momentum from the five
path, gained on the top one while drifting in and was up in time. ATHENAIS set the pace along the inside while under pressure into the far turn, cleared,
widened into the lane and was just caught and settled for second best. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide into the
far turn, continued as a serious contender into the lane, was in tight with an eighth to go, steadied and continued on to offer a mild gain. AZAMANA EMPIRE
was along the inside through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane when coming off the rail and gained mildly. LOTTA ROSES stalked the pace
from the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. MORNING ANGEL trailed for half while off the inside, raced in the four path through
