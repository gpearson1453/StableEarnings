SPIN CYCLE vied for the early lead from the inside, dropped back a bit around the far turn, dug in through the stretch run and prevailed under all out
pressure. KUDURO raced off the early pace, made a four wide bid around the far turn and closed belatedly from the outside of rivals to narrowly get up for
the place position. DROSSELMOON was off slowly, stalked the pace from the inside, moved up two wide between rivals in the drive and made a good late
gain. I SEE THE STARS prompt the pace while racing three wide from the outside of rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. AGAINST THE ODDS
was slow early on to race at the back of the pack, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. WONDER IN vied for the early lead while
racing two deep and gave way.

BAZINGA C stalked the pace from the outside, hard ridden through the far turn, raced four wide deep near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to
edge clear under strong handling. EMPRESS DEONA sprinted clear early on, raced in hand through the far turn and was wore down in the drive to finish
second best. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. LEAKY CAULDRON
chased the pace from the inside and tired readily. GLOWING STAR lost ground to race far back and never threatened.

YOURINDENIAL was in pursuit of the early leader while racing two deep early on, took command near the quarter pole and widened through the stretch run
under strong handling. WENDY'S FINE WINE settled off the early pace, raced five deep near the half mile pole while advancing, raced four deep just past
the three eighths pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. SMART TART was void of early speed, raced four wide around the first turn while
trailing, advanced five near the quarter pole and moved up to improve position. GINGERONMYMIND raced off the early pace, made an advance near the
quarter pole while racing near the rail and lacked a bid in the drive. PEACEARELLA raced four wide around the first turn, stalked the pace while racing three
deep and was empty the final quarter of a mile. ESTA CHUCK showed good early foot to set the early pace and faltered while racing near the rail.

MIDNIGHT TRICK settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane and finished strongly to get up under
strong handling. SIMILAR TASTE rated in the early stages, raced five wide deep past the half mile pole, made a strong three wide bid near the quarter pole,
led narrowly near the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with Midnight trick late to finish second best. LTL BEAR SALOON was rated along while racing
between rivals, four deep near the half mile pole and weakened a bit through the stretch run while racing near the rail. SCYNTZ showed good early foot to
set the early pace along the inside down the backstretch and gave way. HOWARD'S ROCK forwardly placed to lay up close early, tired readily, eased in the
stretch and walked off under his own power.

LIKEUONLYPRETTIER stalked the early pace, made a good four wide bid near the quarter pole and finished well to prove best under strong handling.
CLOSET SHOPPER was off slowly, lost ground at the start, raced near the back early on, made a four to five wide advance through the far turn, raced six
wide into the upper stretch, surged and closed in belatedly. WILL TAKE ROSES showed good early foot set the early pace along the inside and weakened
the final eighth while racing two deep. FAVORITE DOLL settled off the early going, moved up strongly near the quarter pole, continued a rail bid in the drive
and flattened out. WICKED T was unhurried early, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, shifted out through the stretch run and lacked a bid.
MYSTERY ITEM tracked the early leader while racing two wide and faded in the drive.
