Footnotes
ADMIRAL'S GARNET gained the lead into the turn while under minimal urging, continued to widened through the turn and into the lane then increased the
advantage through the final eighth while in hand. MISS SOVELIA was in the two path through the turn, dropped closer to the inside for the drive and gained
the place while not a threat. FOX CREEK LADY led early while near the inside, gave no resistance to the winner when being passed in mid-turn, continued
to chase that one and lost the place spot late. UNTUTTABLE SPEED was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and never factored. SURE
FIRE inside throughout and never menaced. SECRET REVOLUTION was off slowly spotting the field some five lengths then never was in it. Race was
hand-timed due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
TAKE THE CHARGE chased the early pace into the turn, bid three wide in mid-turn, dueled briefly with another past mid-turn, cleared into the lane then
drew off while very close to the rail through the final sixteenth. CRACK THE MOON vied for the lead two wide through mid-turn, was no match for the winner
into the lane then could only chase that one to the wire while finishing clear for the place spot. TOP NOTE was in the three path through the turn when in
mid-pack, came into the lane from the seven path and moved up for the minor share while not a threat. GO ON GIRL cleared on the early lead into the turn,
was quickly passed by the top two before mid-turn, continued near the rail into the lane while chasing the top two then weakened. OUTSLEWTHEM was
along the inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. HINDOSTAIN FALLS raced along the inside and faded. LUCKY DAY A'COMIN
trailed throughout while in the two path.

Footnotes
ROOKWOOD tracked the pacesetters while near the inside, raced behind three dueling rivals past mid-turn, angled four wide approaching the quarter pole,
gained the lead into the lane, quickly cleared while straightening and kept on to maintain the advantage. JUST PHIL was in the two to the four path through
the turn, bid from the four path into the lane then chased the winner to the wire from mid-track. NATES HEARTTHROB bid four wide past mid-turn, gained a
short lead while continuing in the four path, was passed by the winner into the lane then stayed on well to save the show spot. COG moved three wide to
duel for the lead, was joined on the outside by the winner after mid-turn, could not keep up with that one and weakened after turning into the lane. MEMORY
IN MOTION was in tight at the start, raced on the inside into the lane and moved up while not a threat. BOLD BIZNESS set the pace into the the while in the
two path, was joined by two others after mid-turn and gave way. CONSIDER was never a factor while in the three path.

Footnotes
ROCKIN JUSTICE raced behind a wall of rivals through the far turn, continued behind four rivals while in the three or four path from the eighth to inside the
sixteenth pole, split rivals in the last fifty yards and got up. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD was steadied from between rivals soon after the start, raced reserved
while in the the three path into the far turn, bid four wide in late turn and into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner
safe. SILENT SONATA settled off the pace while off the inside into the far turn, bid three wide through the turn and into the lane, was in the two path when
dueling for the lead outside the eighth pole then was outfinished by the top two. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL saved ground into the lane, was blocked from the
three-sixteenths pole to very late, got free and passed a couple late while under minimal urging. CARMEL BAY pressed the pace two wide through the turn
and into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then weakened. FED MONEY set the pace along the inside through the turn while under
pressure from many in late turn, continued a contender with an eighth to go then gave way. DYNAMIC REACH was done after a half, dropped back to trail
then was eased to the wire and eventually vanned off.

Footnotes
BRODY MO chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid from the three path and two wide through the turn, continued to duel with the previous
leader into the lane, was on near even terms inside the eighth pole then inched up late. SINGLE HER set the pace from the two path while under pressure,
cleared approaching the far turn, was joined by the winner soon after entering the turn, dueled with that one to inside the sixteenth pole then yielded.
CLASSY DREAM dueled for the lead down the backstretch, settled off the pace to chase the dueling leaders through the turn and into the lane, re-bid while
shifting out at the top of the lane, had aim on the top two while in the three path but did not have the needed response. PAT'S PALACE raced in the three
path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a threat. AMERICANA ANNA was along the inside and never factored.
SPOTTY SHOWERS was in the two path through the turns when never far back then was empty into the lane. LITTLE GRAY FLOWER was off the rail
through the turns and was done on the far turn.

closed but came up short. GOLD BUCKLE stalked the pace in the four path and offered a mild late bid. GRAN ROJO pressed the pace between foes to the

Footnotes
S S TROOPER saved ground through the turn and into the lane, gained momentum after straightening, came off the rail to split rivals inside the sixteenth
pole then finished with good energy to run the leader down. TRULY MISCHIEF raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
path and finished with serious energy to be closing in. ON K P pressed the pace three wide into the turn, cleared into the lane, remained clear with an eighth
to go, continued clear inside the sixteenth pole and was caught. CARAMELITO raced along the rail through the turn and into the lane, followed the winner
and his path through the stretch run and was gaining to the wire. HOLIDAY HOUSE raced near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the
three path, moved into the four path inside the eighth pole, had aim on the top ones then faltered and was checked very late but made no difference in
placing. THEDEVILSALGORITHM was in the two path through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and offered a mild gain.
DEUTERONOMYSTRONG in the three path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. MATERS N TATERS led along the inside into the turn,
chased the pace into the lane and faded. RETALIATED was in the four to five path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired.
CLASSIC MAX was close up early while between rivals into the turn then steadily faded. GOODASIWONSWAS trailed throughuot.
