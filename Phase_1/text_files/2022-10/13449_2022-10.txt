QUALITY COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch,
repelled a bid by NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE through the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. WIDE AWAKE stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, raced just behind the pacesetter while awaiting room at the rail approaching the final turn, rallied from along the
inside through the turn, and finished well from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE away well and tracked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, loomed a danger while chasing the leader two wide through the final turn, was unable to
match strides with that rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. TOBESUNNY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back
of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a
serious late impact. ROSE OF TEXAS broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to maintain her position
entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

ZETAMARIE away alertly and stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position into the
backstretch, ranged up three wide to collar the pacesetters entering the final turn and quickly took control, opened a clear advantage through the turn, and
was never threatened late while being kept to task. CERTIFIABLE settled at the back of the pack while racing four wide into the stretch the first time,
continued with a wide trip down the backside while gaining on the leaders in the run to the final turn, rallied four wide into the turn, and closed willingly three
wide in the drive while laying in slightly to get up for the place late. BAKZONE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of RACINO entering the
stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, was quickly overhauled entering the final turn, and
battled two wide in the drive, and just failed to hold the place. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. RACINO broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backside, was quickly
overtaken soon after entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable

racing into tight quarters at the rail approaching the final turn, took hold and shifted off the rail entering the turn while still steadying off the heels of SKY

the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and held ADDENDUM safely at bay late to prove best. ADDENDUM stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive
to prove second best. INDYETTA broke sharply and vied for the lead through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep tabs on her
pace rival entering the final turn, but battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. STOLO SPIRIT unhurried early while racing well
behind the field into the backstretch, launched her rally from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished full of run late while racing three wide in
the stretch drive. FILLY FATALE away alertly and steadied from between rivals as she appeared to drift out entering the first turn, settled off the early pace
in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing four wide in the drive. ISLAND LIVING
was pinched soon after the start, and settled well off the dueling leaders entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. A stewards inquiry into the run into the first turn with regards to FILLY FATALE was conducted
following the running of this race. After review there was no action taken.

AIR FORCE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ABOVE AVERAGE entering the first turn, continued to battle from the outside of that
rival in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and prevailed over that stubborn foe following a stretch long battle. ABOVE AVERAGE broke
sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to just miss. HIGHER IMAGE settled off the contested early pace while racing three wide into
the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering he final turn, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive to garner a share. MATSQUI away well and
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground while chasing the leaders through the final turn, and
finished evenly from along the rail in the drive in a game effort. FREESTYLE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering he
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn from between rivals, and finished three wide in the drive. B C CHU CHU tracked the dueling leaders one
out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain her bid in the lane. EBONY EYES
was slow into stride and trailed the field into the first turn, was always well behind the pack, and failed to make an impact.

LEGACY SQUARE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, chased the ROAD CLOSURE from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch, tipped two wide and quickly took control midway through the turn and opened a clear advantage, and continued to widen that margin
late while well in hand. BAK TO LIBERTY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the
final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. TIME TICKER away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle
off the early pace while saving ground through the first turn, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late
while finishing three wide in the drive to get up for a share. LOGICAL AL settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two
out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive. ROAD CLOSURE dueled for the lead from the outside of LEGACY

unable to seriously threaten. REMEMBERTHEALAMO broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
continued two wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. CROWN COUNCIL settled well off the early pace while racing four wide into the

BAKLANE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the inside entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of FOOT SOLDIER while
racing out from the rail, maintained his advantage into the final turn, and drew clear from his pace rival late to prove best. FOOT SOLDIER away alertly and
pressed the pace three wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to chase BAKLANE two wide into the final turn, was no match for that rival leaving
the turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to hold the place. MACHINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid from along the
rail entering the final turn, and closed belatedly five wide in the drive to get up for a share. JACOBS CALL stalked the contested early pace into the backside
while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn while struggling to hold his position, and finished evenly from along the rail in the
drive. MAKEITORBREAKIT away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
but faded over the final furlong.
