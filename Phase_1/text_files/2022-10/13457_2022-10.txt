Footnotes
STAR OF MINE led the way around the first turn then widened to a commanding lead up the backstretch, saved ground entering the lane and kept to task.
RULING THE ROOST tracked the pace through early stages, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, sustained response into the lane and finished
second best. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was well reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane and finished with response. ONE LAST CHANT
stalked the clear pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled up three wide around the far turn then weakened in the lane. DIXIE THREE G settled along the
inside in early stages, swung four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TACTICAL REBEL raced off the pace and had no response when called upon.
NATIVE HELLRAISER stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, chased in range around the far turn then faded in the lane. BIZZY RUN chased the clear
leader in early stages and came up empty after the half.

WAR RON tracked the early pace then launched a three wide around the turn, bumped with CHINLEE at the head of the lane, gained a slim lead then
edged away under steady urging. CHINLEE settled through the early going then launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, bumped with WAR RON at
the head of the lane, continued in striking distance into the final furlong then failed to be a match late. BIG PINES SANDY raced off the early pace, hustled
along four wide into the lane and finished with good response. MY BOBBY MCGEE was reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane and
improved. TWIRLING CHIEF settled through early stages, hustled up two wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. SIR ELI raced off the early
pace, saved ground into the lane and failed to threaten. AMERICAN POSSE set the early pace and showed the way around the turn, got collared at the
head of the lane and gave way. RIDING THE TRAIN raced near midpack, chased three wide around the turn and had no late response. ALL OVER OLIVER
was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, sustained bid around the turn then faded in the lane.

TYLER'S TRIBE broke on top and held a slim lead over CR INSTAGATOR while racing under slight restraint, briefly raced with rival then let out a notch and
widened to a clear advantage, opened up on the field while still racing in hand around the turn, came two wide into the lane and continued well clear while
never asked. BIG LUKE was unhurried and raced in the back, edged closer then swung four wide into the lane, dug in under firm handling and captured
place. PALACE GUARD tracked the leader through early stages, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and got edged
late for place. ACCELERITAS saved ground through early stages, angled out moving through the turn, coaxed three wide into the lane and lacked a needed
rally. C R INSTA GATOR raced up close in opening stages, continued to chase the leader along the inside around the turn then tired in the drive. I LOVE
ROCKNSTROLL raced three to four wide off the pace and failed to move into contention.

AIN'T LIFE GRAND was away in good order and raced two wide into the first turn, prompted the pace up the backstretch, cleared the lead in hand midway
around the far turn, was ridden along three wide into the lane, responded willingly, drew off through the lane and finished in hand. FINISH UP raced near
midpack up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, angled inside at the head of the lane and dug in to capture place. LATE FOR
LUNCH stalked the pace through early stages, given cue three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and got edged for place. SHIPS ON
FIRE raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. SPALDING STROLL settled through early stages, saved
ground entering the lane and had no late response. FREDDY J set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared midway around the far turn and
retreated. FLEET OF HOOF raced near midpack, was ridden along four wide around the far turn and came up empty entering the lane. MIDNIGHT RULES
stumbled at the start, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
MISS PEACH settled through early stages and raced off the pace, began to pick up the tempo along the outside late on the far turn, given cue at the head
of the lane, reached the leader in the final furlong, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. KAYLA vied around the first turn then showed the
way up the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, came under pressure from both sides at the furlong marker, held a slim lead then fought back
gamely when confronted by MISS PEACH but could not contain the winner late. FLAT OUT STORMIN tracked the pace through early stages, saved ground
around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, roused forward into striking distance a furlong out then yielded late and finished on equal terms for
show. INTERSTELLA rated off the early pace, launched a two wide bid between rivals near the quarter pole, continued in close range into the stretch run
and finished on equal terms for a share. JUST LIKE TRISTA fanned six wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, hustled along four wide
around the far turn, briefly gained closer contention then retreated in the lane. EBONY PEARL was forwardly placed up the backstretch, sustained a bid
around the far turn then faded through the lane. I THINK I KNOW YOU raced four wide around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch then retreated
around the far turn.

BASIC CHANCE raced off the top trio in early stages, chased three wide around the turn, given cue at the head of the lane, responded gamely and got up in
time. MOLLIES ROCKET dueled for the lead up the backstretch, shook free at the quarter pole, continued clear a furlong out then got reeled in late.
SCRUTINIZER tracked the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and captured a share. OUR LAST CHANCE raced in
contention just off the top pair, chased two to three wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. JAYSKER raced near midpack, hustled along four wide
into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SECRET BLARNEY raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the turn and never threatened.
YEARS FLY BY had head turned at the start and failed to come out with the field, declared a non-starter. WOKE UP IN LOVE was off slow at the start,
raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. COWBOY CASANOVA dueled up the backstretch and around the turn then tired in the drive. JUSTA
STREAK failed to move into contention. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, AFTER REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT YEARS FLY WAS NOT GIVEN A FAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER

GREEDY CREEDY was forwardly placed up the backstretch, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead near the quarter pole, battled on with
MINECRAFT MANIAC into the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. MINECRAFT MANIAC set a pressured pace through early stages,
dueled around the far turn, battled on with GREEDY CREEDY into the lane and yielded late. ALLEN'S ROCKET tracked the pace through early stages,
launched a four wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and prevailed for a share. YOU TALKIN TO ME settled off the early pace, was
ridden three to four wide around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and edged closer in deep stretch. SIR WALLY WALLY raced in range up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, cut the corner and roused forward in upper stretch then ran on evenly late. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND settled
through early stages and saved ground, tipped two wide for the drive and needed more for late impact. TIME GOES ON pressed the early pace, dueled
around the far turn and weakened in the lane. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY failed to move into contention. SMART N INTUITIVE settled off the early pace,
coaxed two to three wide around the far turn and never threatened.
