Footnotes
KEY PLAYER unhurried in the two path then moved to the inside, saved ground around the far turn, tipped around a rival then angled back inside, rallied
along the fence and got up in time. ONE MORE BID tracked two then three wide early, bid three deep at the quarter pole, took a short lead midstretch and
got nailed in the final moments. DANCING RINCA sat off the pace three wide, was on the move through the far turn, tipped out in the stretch, rallied four
deep in the final sixteenth and got outkicked. ONE TIME MARK stalked the lone leader outside a rival, bid between foes at the quarter pole, took over
leaving the turn, clung to a short lead entering the final furlong, was soon overtaken in midstretch and stayed on well between rivals. QUINTECENTS
stalked along the inside, coaxed on the far turn but had to pause past the five-sixteenths pole behind the leader, pushed on again leaving the turn, lacked
room in the lane and had to alter out twice to gain a clear path and finished willingly to the wire. LORD SHELDON got crowded between rivals soon after the
start, was reserved early on the inside, had to steady a bit behind a rival entering the far turn, tipped out under urging on the far turn, drifted in some in
upper stretch and failed to threaten. DEVIL MOON took control early and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch, asked on the far turn when
pressured approaching the quarter pole, gave up the lead leaving the bend and weakened in the final furlong. CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) traveled three
wide the back early, remained off the rail into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LITTLE RACHEL was off a few lengths slow then lagged behind early, took the turn five then four wide, rallied from the middle portion of the track, reached
the front with a sixteenth to go and kicked clear to win going away. BOWL OF CHERRIES bumped with SATURDAY HEIST at the start, attended the pace
three deep to the turn, suffered a mild shuffle near the three-eighths pole, chased three wide into the lane, tipped outside the top trio, gained command
command midstretch but was not match for the winner in the final sixteenth. ANNIE GRAHAM raced up close four deep then vied three deep on the turn,
took over past the quarter pole, was overtaken midstretch and flattened to third. SATURDAY HEIST bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace from
between rivals, dueled leaving the backstretch and took over with three furlong remaining, vied between rivals around the turn, lost command into the
stretch and weakened down the lane. TIZ A MASTER settled off the pace, took the turn four then three wide, drifted to the rail in the lane and failed to
menace. EQUILOVE (IRE) set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled entering the turn, lost command at the three-eighths pole but fought back
through the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS stumbled leaving the gate then went up to duel outside a rival down the hill, cleared inner foe then moved inside, showed the
way up the backstretch, drew away on the final bend, led clear into deep stretch and gamely prevailed. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) stalked off the rail down
the hill then moved inside, was closest in pursuit while asked right handed into the stretch, rallied between foes in the closing moments but was too late.
GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) settled along the inside then had to steady behind a rival first time in the stretch, tipped two wide leaving the final turn, launched a
late bid and finished gamely outside the top pair while getting edged for second. CASH EQUITY (FR) chased off the rail down the hill then started to pull first
time in the stretch, settled into a tracking spot in the two path, tipped four wide entering the lane and lacked the needed response. TROPICAL TERROR
unhurried in the beginning, drifted out crossing the dirt, steered to the inside trailing the field, moved off the rail on the backstretch, drifted out a bit on the
final turn and failed to menace. BREAKPOINT (CHI) coaxed to the front and dueled from inside down the hill, steadied inside the winner first time in the
stretch, moved out and stalked in the two path, chased three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
FUN TO DREAM stalked in the two path, went between runners on the backstretch and into the far turn, tipped out and challenged the top pair three wide
into the stretch, quickly took command and kicked clear, then drew off in the final furlong. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH trailed two wide early on, moved outside
rivals on the backstretch, split foes with a quarter mile left to run, angled out in the lane and rallied to get up for second. ANGEL NADESHIKO stumbled a bit
but recovered quickly to take the early lead and angled in, pressured from outside in the middle stages, maintained a short lead through the far turn, was no
match for FUN TO DREAM in upper stretch, churned on through the final furlong and got edged for second. ANACAPA forwardly placed in the two path,
went up to apply pressure between rivals on the backstretch, headed the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, vied between foes into the stretch, could not
keep up outside the eighth pole and flattened to fourth. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER stalked the pace on the inside, moved out in the lane and weakened.
KRISTI'S TIGER was along the four path while in range early, moved up outside the top pair on the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
BEYOND BRILLIANT took control early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final furlong, urged left handed in the final
sixteenth and held safely. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) got crowded along the rail briefly then became a bit rank into the first turn, settled on the inside off the
pace, gained through the far turn while tipped out, took aim at the BEYOND BRILLIANT in the stretch but could not find the needed late kick. PRINCE
ABAMA (IRE) stalked three deep early, continued three wide while outside a rival entering the far turn, moved into the two path then spun three wide into
the stretch, failed to summon a rally in the furlong grounds and stayed on to secure the show. KANDEREL tracked two wide outside a rival at the back, went
two wide into the far turn, tipped out and entered the lane four wide and finished evenly in the late stages. IRIDEO (ARG) pulled bit behind the leader on the
first turn, stalked inside a pair of rivals, lost ground on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and failed to rally. TARANTINO stalked the leader between rivals,
angled to the rail on the far turn and faded in the drive.

past the half-mile pole, tipped out and bid between into the stretch, took over and cleared in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire. LANE WAY

game second. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) dropped back early, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out and bumped rival crossing the dirt, summoned a
mild rally and earned the show honors. COULTHARD (IRE) tossed his head to come away a bit slow, raced off the pace, entered the turn four wide, got
bumped and forced out crossing the dirt, kept on through the final furlong and gained a minor award. AIR FORCE RED stalked the top trio to the turn, went
four wide around the bend, bid five deep entering the stretch, drifted in through the lane and faltered. DUBAI KEY (ARG) bumped with outer rival at the start,

Footnotes
DEFUNDED sped clear and was guided over to the inside, gained company on the backstretch then moved clear into the far turn, pressured again by
SLOW DOWN ANDY at the quarter pole, responded to when asked and drew clear with a furlong remaining and held well to the wire. COUNTRY
GRAMMER lost his path briefly early then moved into range quickly three deep into the first turn, chased three wide into the stretch and rallied for the place.
SLOW DOWN ANDY stumbled badly leaving the gate, became rank while forward early off the rail, applied pressure outside the leader on the backstretch,
lost touch into the far turn, re-engaged DEFUNDED with a quarter mile left to run, could not keep up entering the furlong grounds and got outkicked for
second. EXPRESS TRAIN stalked two wide early, was asked along the rail on the far turn and failed to find the needed response. TRIPOLI stalked on the
inside early, moved off the rail on the backstretch, entered the lane two wide and lacked a rally. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) got bumped from outside then took
back between rivals early, moved out three wide for the clubhouse turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. HIGH CONNECTION broke a step
slow, bumped between rivals early, traveled two wide near the back, raced outside a rival on the far turn or three wide, moved out in the lane and made no
impact. AZUL COAST was a bit rank along the inside into the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
KANTHARA settled off the pace, traveled four deep on the turn, tipped five wide into the lane, kicked clear midstretch and was kept to task to the line.
RAGTIME ROSE was off slow and bumped from outside at the start, went three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied and gained the
place. CANDY CARAMEL angled in and stalked from inside into the turn, tipped to the two path around the bend, bid between foes at the top of the stretch
but got outkicked by the top pair. PLEASANT WAVE raced up close outside the top pair, came four wide into the lane, bid four deep in the stretch but lacked
the needed late punch. BROADWAY GIRLS dueled for command from outside the pressed up the backstretch, challenged again and took over with a
quarter mile left to run, lost command at the eight pole and flattened in the final sixteenth. GOOD AS GONE tracked three deep around the bend and never
responded to urging. THE DANCE BETWEEN broke in and bumped rival, traveled in mid-pack between runners, went two wide through the turn and could
not rally. CAHUILLA bumped at the start, sat off the pace early on, raced along the rail, two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and failed to
menace. MIZZTIFY DOLL chased inside then moved out a bit when a rival came over, steered back to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground then
tipped out in the drive and made no impact. CHEEKIEST was off slow and bumped inner rival to begin, trailed near the inside into the turn, angled out and
came four wide into the lane, got floated out at the eighth pole and was not a factor. MI MIMITA dueled for command from inside, inched ahead to take full
control, headed again by rival on the turn, lost command at the quarter pole and gave way.
