Footnotes
HOLYJAZZ broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, extended the lead into mid-stretch, pulled away in the final
sixteenth under firm urging and was geared down in the final strides. MANY AMBITIONS hopped at the start and was off slowly, was hustled to chase the
solid fractions to the turn, mounted a three wide rally into the drive, was no match late for the winner but finished well to secure place. REALLY EASY
showed early speed and pressed the pace to the turn, lost ground to the winner nearing the top of the lane, gave way in the late stages and was well clear
for show in the end. HABANERO KID was away a step slowly, crowded BRETT REX while hard to place in the early stages, lost ground three wide on the
turn and tired in the stretch run. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was away slowly, chased three wide on the turn and was not a factor. BRETT REX was crowded at
the start and was away a step slowly, chased the solid pace from the inside, was outrun in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under
his own power.

Footnotes
JAYCEE was away in good order, took back to track the quick early pace, closed on the pacesetter in mid-stretch, overtook LADY BRETT inside of the
furlong marker and drew clear in the final sixteenth. NAN ELIZABETH rated off of the quick early pace while saving ground, advanced in upper stretch and
closed well late to secure the place. MAGICAL LADY chased the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, continued to advance to mid-stretch and
lacked a late rally, while clear for third in the end. LADY BRETT broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, was all out
in mid-stretch to hold off the winner and weakened in the final sixteenth. ZAKKIYYAH chased the quick early pace, came three then four wide nearing the
top of the lane and tired in the late stages. MISTICAL SURPRISE broke slowly, spotted the field in the opening stages and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AWKWARD MORNING took back off of the early pace, slipped through along the inside on the first turn and contested the pace through the backstretch run,
took command on the second turn, drew clear into mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages while pulling away. CARSON'S LEGACY was crowded a
bit by KING ROB leaving the start and was away a step slowly, settled three wide off of the early fractions, was roused nearing the quarter marker, was no
match for the winner in the stretch run but stayed on well late to be second best. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET showed early speed and contested the early pace,
took a narrow edge along the backstretch run, lost ground to the winner nearing the top of the lane, weakened in the final stages and just held for show in
the final strides. KING ROB was off a bit slowly, saved ground while unhurried, improved position nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch
and did not produce a late rally. COUSIN MARK was unhurried in the early stages, came four wide into the backstretch run, made a middle move to dispute
the pace nearing the half-mile marker, lost position four wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the drive and lacked a late response. WHISPER AND
WINK was forwardly placed in the early going, lost position nearing the half-mile marker, came two wide to the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. VIVA
LEON JODIDO raced four wide into the first turn, stalked the reasonable fractions through the backstretch run, dropped back three wide on the far turn and
came up empty in the drive.

MOOSIE ONNA was allowed to settle, saved ground through the backstretch run while unhurried, mounted a five wide rally nearing the top of the lane,
closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker and was up in the final strides to prevail. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE was hustled to contest the early pace, was
keen on the first turn, settled into the backstretch run and disputed the solid fractions to the half-mile marker, held FOURTH STREET at bay along the
second turn and into upper stretch, was all out in deep stretch and was overtaken in the final strides for the win. FOURTH STREET came three wide into the
first turn, tracked the solid pace through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker to vie for the lead, could not get by a stubborn
PRINCESA DEL TIGRE in the drive, hung inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the final stages, while holding for third in the end.
NOSHEWONT was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch
and closed willingly in the final sixteenth to challenge for show. IRISH SONG LEADER was away slowly, recovered to sit off of the early pace while racing in
the second flight, lost position nearing the quarter marker, was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest. A ROUSING
BABE rated off of the solid early fractions, advanced three wide on the far turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and flattened out late. CAHUILLA was
sent to contest the early fractions, disputed the pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the stretch drive.

JOHNNY PODRES was away in good order, took back to track the fast fractions through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, closed determinedly in deep
stretch to overtake the runner-up and edged away late. TO SPEIGHT HER broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set fast fractions through the turn, drew
clear nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and held safely for second. STAR RACER chased from the second flight,
came in tight on the turn, found room nearing the top of the lane, finished well in deep stretch and was clear for third in the final stages. HONEYMOONZ
OVER was forwardly placed early on, pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BLAZING
JAMIE chased the fast pace outside of rivals and did not offer a late rally. LOVE CANDY broke slowly, lacked early speed, swung widest into the drive and
was not a late threat.

Footnotes
BLACK ZABAT disputed the early fractions, set a pressured pace through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and
kept to task in the late stages to prevail in a good debut. DANIELLE'S SECRET forwardly placed early on, lost ground three wide on the turn, chased to
mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages, could not reel in the winner in the end but was second best. JERSEY BIRD broke alertly and contested the early
pace, pressed the fast pace through the turn, lost ground to the winner in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and just saved third in the final strides.
FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was shuffled back leaving the start, chased the early speed from the rear to the turn, lacked room while two wide approaching the
quarter marker, swung five wide into upper stretch, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for third in the final strides. AFTER MY OWN HEART was
allowed to settle, came three wide on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch and closed willingly in the final sixteenth. MO TOWN GAL lost her path at the
start and spotted the field out of the gate, came four wide on the turn, improved position nearing the furlong grounds and found her best stride in the late
stages. FRANKLY ALL GOOD chased from midpack early on, saved ground to the top of the lane, was outkicked in upper stretch and tired in the late going.
AUTISM EXCELLENCE broke in at the start and crowded MO TOWN GAL leaving the break, chased two wide through the turn, lost position in upper
stretch and was not a factor. FREED BY MAGIC showed early speed and tracked the quick pace outside of rivals, lost ground four to five wide on the turn,
swung six wide into upper stretch and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
DESCARTES was unhurried in the early going, was a bit rank on the backstretch run and pulled on the rider nearing the half-mile marker, was steered
outside of rivals into the second turn, circled five wide into upper stretch, overtook NOLDE nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged away late. NOLDE broke
alertly and was sent to dictate terms in the early stages, was well rated through the backstretch run while carving out moderate fractions, was set down for
the drive, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and held safely for second. RESPECT THE HUSTLE rated off of the early pace, saved all of the
ground to the second turn, was outkicked in the stretch run and held well late to secure third. EAST RAND tracked the moderate pace from the second
flight, came two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked the needed late response. J T'S WATCH was allowed to settle, saved
ground to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. VIA EGNATIA showed speed and prompted the moderate early
fractions, attended to the pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SKY DINSKI stalked the pace three
deep on the first turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace leaving the far turn and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DANCE LADY broke well, raced into the first turn a little wide, was kept task through the backstretch run with FANTASTIC SECRET a target, bid for the lead
in earnest passing the quarter-pole, inhaled the pacesetter and drew off in the stretch under confident handling. SASSY EINSTEIN was devoid of early
speed early, was handled aggressively down the backstretch run, responded to a couple of taps of the crop and steadily gained on the field to nab the place
spot. FANTASTIC SECRET broke well, established the early lead going into the turn, opened up a clear advantage while setting moderate fractions, kept
the lead to the top of the stretch, did not offer a response when challenged by DANCE LADY and finished evenly to the wire. RUNNING LUCK broke out a
bit at the start, straightened and was sent to challenge for the lead but was floated wide into the first turn by DANCE LADY, stayed wide down the
backstretch run and through the far turn, was in striking position near the quarter pole but flattened out. FOGGY BOTTOM was not asked for any early
speed, raced near the back of the field through the early going, attempted to launch a bid passing the three-furlong pole and made up some ground but
could not muster the needed response to make an impact. KITTYBE QUICK settled into a tracking position along the rail, was encouraged to go after the
leaders at the half-mile marker but lacked a response and was not involved from that point.
