DON WITH THE WIND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to control the pace through the
second turn and in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened his advantage late while under confident
handling. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, began to advance two out from the rail midway down the backstretch, rallied
smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. SILK STILETTOS stalked the leader into the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground at the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch,
launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the lane while garnering a share. KEEPINGTHEDREAM broke sharply
and tracked the pacesetter through the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
struggled to keep up entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. TUXEDO away well and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while
racing two out from the rail, continued three wide from a stalking trip in the run down the backside, but began to weaken approaching the final turn, and had
nothing to offer late.

SOLANDER away well and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering he lane the first time,
maintained his position in the run down the backside, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, took a narrow advantage straightening for home,
and was all out to prevail over a very stubborn SIDERO in the closing strides. SIDERO broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of HARBOUR STORM in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was
collared by SOLANDER leaving the turn, and battled determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. BEST ONE YET rushed up from between
rivals to battle for the early lead entering the first turn, before taking up while in tight quarters to drop into a stalking trip while racing one out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and was forced to await room midway through the turn, and
finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. JACK DON'T DRINK trailed the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail,
commenced his bid four wide entering he final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. HARBOUR STORM dueled for the lead from the outside of SIDERO
through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her
pace rival midway through the turn, and weakened in the late going.

FLORIDA GATOR settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn,
assumed control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear as much the best. BETTER TONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch
the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and split
rivals while finishing three wide in the drive to get up for the place. ALL LIQUORD UP broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DON W in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, disposed of his pace rival midway through the
turn but was quickly tackled and overtaken by FLORIDA GATOR entering the lane, and finished from along the inside in the drive to hold on for a share.
HANKY PRANKY broke outwards at the start, and settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, and closed evenly from along the inside in the drive before tipping one out from the rail late. SHARPZAN settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while
unable to threaten. SLOOP JOHN B away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied four
wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DON W away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ALL
LIQUORD UP entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and into the final turn, struggled
to keep pace with that rival midway through the turn, and weakened in the late going.

BOLD ARCH away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace two wide in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, and finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to fend off a persistent CASCADE BILLY to prove best. CASCADE BILLY away
well and stalked the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, chased the pacesetter two out from the rail through the final turn, and loomed a
danger leaving the turn, but was unable to catch a stubborn BOLD ARCH late while proving clearly second best. BE QUICK broke sharply and tracked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, was unable to match strides
with the top pair through the turn, and finished from just off the rail in the drive to garner a share. SYNERGY unhurried early while trailing the field into the
first turn, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in
the drive while improving his position over the final furlong. SLEW'S BAK settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering he backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. SIR BREGOVIC tracked
the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

BOITANO broke sharply and tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
set sail after the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, assumed control leaving the turn, and held PRINCE CAIRO safely at bay late to prove best.
PRINCE CAIRO settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed steadily from along the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. Y VEE R rushed to the lead
one out from the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time and into the run down the backstretch,
raced two wide into the final turn and was overtaken by BOITANO who attacked at the rail, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a
share. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the

drive while unable to make a late impact. VIVA LA VINO tracked the leader one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, was unable to hold her

CHAMPIOSA pressed the pace from the outside of SHE'S ON FIRE entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide entering the final turn,
put away his pace rival midway through the turn but was tackled by DRILL BABY DRILL, was overtaken entering rhe lane, but battled determinedly from
along the rail to re-take the lead in the final stride to prevail. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing
two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, but was unable to put away a stubborn
CHAMPIOSA, who fought on gamely from along the rail in deep stretch to re-take the lead in the final stride. CAROLINA GENT tracked the battling leaders
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share.
AUNTIE J was fractious prior to the start, settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid
four wide entering the final turn, and improved her position over the final furlong without seriously threatening. SHE'S ON FIRE broke sharply and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of CHAMPIOSA in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival midway through the turn, and was outfinished late. EASTERS MEMORY stalked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon while
continuing with a wide trip throughout. PERFECT PENNY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, saved
ground entering the final turn, but failed to menace. JERSEYS IMAGE unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn while racing three out from the
rail, was always well back, and failed to make an impact. LOOK AT MY SOCKS away alertly, but quickly dropped well off the pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the first turn, trailed the field in the run to the final turn, and was never a factor.
