Footnotes
TOTALLY IN CHARGE sat just off the leader three wide through the turn, engaged for the lead three sixteenths to the finish outside in the three path, took
control under left handed urging a sixteenth to the wire and was edging away at the finish line. DREAMS AND SCHEMES settled in mid pack just off the rail
at the half, shifted out four wide for the drive at the top of the stretch, split runners at the furlong marker and got up at the wire for the place award. JAB
travelled four deep entering the turn, started to rally three eighths from the finish around foes three wide, continued to gain steadily in mid stretch in the five
path and stalled a touch late losing second money on the nod at the wire. SPANISH BEAUTY was away slowly at the start, became a little headstrong
behind horses in early backstretch, rated kindly inside through the turn, angled out six deep three sixteenths from the line and closed in well for a minor
share. MUSKOKA SUMMER showed speed to lead down the backside, continued to set the pace turning for home, put away a brief challenger in upper
stretch was collared by the winner in the final sixteenth and tired nearing the finish line. SWEET BOMBOLINI hounded the early leader from the start,
commenced her bid at the quarter pole between runners, gave way at the eighth pole and retreated in deep stretch. TALE OF PERFECTION settled near
the rear between rivals in the beginning, could not keep up with the field throughout the turn and was not a factor in the late stages. FIRST FROST broke
out at the break, rated well under a snug hold behind the leaders into the turn, was roused three furlongs from home, offered little response and backed
away in mid stretch.

Footnotes
AWESOME TREAT moved forward inside to take the lead shortly after the break, set the pace racing just off the rail, drew off when asked. SMILES FOR
DAVID tracked from inside, switched outside the eventual winner about the five-sixteenths, chased that one but was no match while clearly second best.
BLUEBERRY FIELDS broke a step slowly, raced toward the back, went three wide on the turn, ran along for show honors. TUDOR PEAK was
forwardly-positioned outside early, dropped back to outside the trailing group heading into the turn, went four then six wide on that bend, ran on evenly in the
stretch. LIVIN ON LUV raced mid-pack between rivals to the turn, went about four wide on that bend, failed to rally for the stretch run. CAN'T STOP ME
NOW broke inwardly, was encouraged along having switched off the inside, went near the inside racing toward the back through the turn, was in a bit tight in
upper stretch, failed to threaten. LADY IN RED was getting out while in the lead early, moved in to briefly press the new leader soon after, steadily retreated
while drifting in and out a bit in upper stretch. FOREST VIXEN was in a hair tight early when LADY IN RED was moving about the track, pursued the leading
pair four to five wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTION GAL tracked just outside the frontrunner racing through the turn, assumed control at the top off the stretch, drew off in when asked at the
furlong marker to win comfortably in the end. BASALT STREET broke sharp to lead after the start, continued to set the pace on the rail around the turn, was
collared outside by the winner two furlongs to the finish and had enough left late to hold safe for the place award at the line. CURLIN CANDY tracked in the
second flight outside foes on the turn, was in contention four wide turning for home and finished up evenly while on the wrong lead through the stretch. DE
JORIA settled near the rear running through the turn, angled out four wide for the drive outside foes and showed some late interest to get up for a minor
share in the final sixteenth. SHANGHAI SHAMROCK was allowed to settle at the rear in the early stages of the race, was urged for more run in upper
stretch and passed tired runners in the drive to the wire. SHE MAKES A POINT stalked mid pack on the rail with a half remaining, was ridden for more at the
top of the lane, could not get a response and made no impact through the stretch. LADYWEARSTHERING was restrained early on the rail behind the
pacesetter into the turn, had a good inside position watching the engaging leaders three eighths from the finish, was asked to go after the dueling
frontrunners turning for home, offered no effort and became leg weary with an eighth to the wire.

Footnotes
MISS BRENTWOOD had the early lead briefly then pressed the new leader up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn taking over again by the
three-sixteenths, was clear in mid-stretch, just lasted under steady urging. SPOOKY SPICE stalked the pace from outside four wide into the turn, kept on
steadily in the stretch despite drifting out under left-handed encouragement and just missed. MO TOURING was in a bit tight in behind runners early, went
three to four wide on the turn racing off the pace, swung seven wide into the stretch, gained steadily and slowly but too late. ARTFUL BALLERINA was in
tight behind runners early, shifted in, saved ground advancing inside foes on the turn, came out turning for home and moved out further in upper stretch,
steadied on heels inside the final sixteenth as a rival drifted in front. SILVER BULLET LADY was in tight early as a rival came out forcing her out, dropped
back three wide, kept on to regain more prominent position leaving the turn but needed more for the drive. REMEMBERING RHODA steadied when in tight
about the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, was never a threat. GREEN GABLES moved forward to set the pace inside, gave way in upper
stretch. OUR SOUPER LOVE raced outside about four to five deep before swinging eight wide into the stretch, failed to rally. INDIAN MUSIC moved out
heading up the backstretch chasing two to three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
IMAGERY was unhurried early to trail outside, rallied five wide at the top of the stretch, took control at the furlong marker and drew off nearing the wire.
HELL N WILD settled in the second flight racing two wide around the turn, bid for the lead four wide between rivals three sixteenths from home, continued to
fight on stubbornly at the furlong marker, gave way to the winner in deep stretch but held safe for the place to be second best in the end. MISS SPEEDY
tracked just off the early pacesetter at the half, assumed command three wide turning for home, dueled inside horses with an eighth to go and stalled late to
settle for the show money. CALLE OCHO tracked on the rail behind the leader in hand throughout the turn, waited for a clear path in upper stretch, had
room at the furlong marker inside but needed more late and settled on the fringes. SUMMERTIME MAGIC settled on the fence near the back in this
compact field early, trailed the pack in upper stretch and could not get involved for a share running through the stretch to the finish line. ISHIYAYA broke
sharp to control the pace in the early stages, was collared outside at the top of the lane, stopped at the eighth pole, eased while crossing the finish and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
RENEGADE REBEL set the pace racing inside foes just off the rail, responded when asked and drew off under steady urging before being eased up late.
ESME shifted in settling toward the rear saving ground through the first turn, advanced inside on the far turn, moved out four wide in upper stretch, was no
match but the winner but clearly second best. ALEXANDROVA settled off the pace two to three wide, came out five wide in upper stretch, ran on under
strong urging to get up for show honors over. JULIE'S MIST , who settled at the back while shifting in, saved ground near the inside through both turns and
advancing some on the far turn, rallied inside foes in the stretch but was outkicked for third. TITO'S CALLING was in a bit tight at the break but recovered
and angled in while moving forward to track inside just off the leaders, moved out two wide coming near the quarter pole and within striking distance of the
eventual winner but lacked any late kick and tired in the stretch. OUR LIBERTY BELLE pressed the eventual winner two to three wide, weakened. ANITA
MARGARITA broke outwardly just a bit, was caught outside two to three wide early, moved out five wide turning into upper stretch, was unable to threaten.
RAVELLO BEAUTY raced toward the back outside three to four wide and was never near enough to threaten. STOLEN moved out and forward three wide
early up the backstretch to pursue the leader, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
MISS MARIE angled off the rail midway on the turn, rallied outside eight wide at the quarter pole, found her best stride late to take the lead in deep stretch
and was edging away nearing the finish. FISH MOONEY was shuffled back on the rail through the turn, weaved her way through foes at the three sixteenths
pole and closed belatedly inside to get the place award. KITTEN'S ROMANCE began to pick up rivals racing between horses three furlongs to the wire, was
in contention six wide in upper stretch, had a brief lead with an eighth to go and stalled mildly to settle for a clear third. SPEIGHTSTOWN SHIRL raced three
to four wide tracking the leaders through the turn, loomed eight wide when they straightened out for the drive and levelled out in mid stretch. DEVIL'S BIT
advanced on the rail throughout the turn, was in the mix inside at the quarter marker and could only offer an even finish to wire. ENGLISH BISCUIT settled
near the back of the field in the beginning parts of the race, was ridden between rivals midway on the turn and could not get involved running to the wire.
ANN OF CLEVES was void of early speed to trail down the backside, roused while three wide at the top of the lane, dipped to the inside three sixteenths
from the wire and passed tired runners to the finish line. SWOOP TO FINISH pressured the leader outside on the turn, assumed the lead three furlongs to
the finish, was collared nearing the eighth pole and faded in deep stretch. SILVER MAGNATIZED tracked in the second flight behind the contesting leaders
at the half, offered a mild bid in the four path turning for home and tired mid stretch. RETAIL THERAPIST stalked between rivals near the back in the
beginning, angled out widest in the nine path for the drive, was in range of the leaders with three sixteenths remaining and stalled outside at the furlong
marker. ERASMO'S GIRL broke sharp the be in the mix early, was taken back off the contesting front trio five eighths from home, urged to keep up three
wide midpoint on the turn and weakened in upper stretch. ASTONISH showed speed to be in front on the rail in the beginning, gave way on the fence at the
half and backed away through the field through the turn.

SELFMADE settled inside on then just off the rail through the first turn, shifted five wide turning for home, took aim and struck the lead about the sixteenth
pole and held sway. COURTLY MANNER shifted in, saved ground on the first turn tracking the leaders, came out at the top of the stretch, passed a tiring
rival then rallied inside foes but was only second best. SOLAR was caught four wide on the first turn, moved forward to press the pace into the far turn, took
over about the five-sixteenths, was overtaken about a sixteenth out but kept on willingly. SEGUIMI moved clear and shifted in to the two path heading to the
first turn, faced some pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken on the far turn and had no extra. COLEYVILLE broke outwardly and slowly, raced four
wide and off the pace through the first turn, advanced some midway up the backstretch outside, came in mid-stretch seven or eight deep and ran on evenly.
SUIGU STAR settled at the back racing off the inside, switched out up the backstretch, advanced four wide to begin with emerging eight deep at the top of
the stretch, kicked on mildly. JUNGLE FIGHTER was a bit fractious in the gate, pressed briefly and chased three wide, retreated. BURNING MAN moved
out from two to four wide pursuing through the first turn, moved up a bit three to four wide up the backstretch, was in a bit tight past the quarter pole, failed to
rally thereafter.

Footnotes
HELLO FRIENDS rallied up the fence at the quarter pole, shifted outside four wide off the dueling leaders at the furlong marker and was full of run in the
final sixteenth to draw clear at the wire. DESTINIQUE was in a good position tracking the engaging leaders outside in the second flight, loomed three wide
turning for home, battled between horses in mid stretch and was outkicked late by the winner. DIAMOND CRUSH trailed the field down the backstretch,
rallied two furlongs out finding a seam in the two path, switched outside at the furlong marker to be four wide and closed in to capture third in a photo.
TAKOTA tracked the contesting frontrunners while inside on the turn, bid for the top spot between rivals at the top of the lane, held the lead briefly at the
eighth pole and gave way to the closing challengers in deep stretch. FOREST B hopped at the start, recovered to contest for the for the lead at the half, put
away his speed rival midway on the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole and stalled inside the final sixteenth. SUPER LUNAR stalked three wide
between runners in the third flight into the turn, was nudged along to keep up with the pace with five sixteenths to go and finished up with some intent to
pass runners down the lane. HASN'T HIT ME YET settled in the middle of the pack inside through the turn, was in range behind the leaders in the three
path at the top of the lane and weakened in the final stages. RED EQUINOX travelled near the rear down the backstretch, angled out when roused eight
wide at the top of the stretch and could not get involved in the late stages of the race. HIT AND RUN stalked four deep mid pack at the half, was asked for
more run four wide on the turn and had little to give in the seven path for the drive to the finish. SPEEDY LYNN pressed the pace down the backside,
retreated with five sixteenths left to run and tired between runners in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHARP AZA RAINBOW broke outwardly, shifted in near the rail and inside foes to save ground settling just off the leaders, moved out for the far turn going
three then four wide on that bend, came into upper stretch five to six wide with aim on the leader, surged past late. SENSATIONAL SARAH was forced out
at the start brushing a rival, stalked from just off the inside in about the three path, moved to challenge leaving the far turn, struck the lead by the
three-sixteenths, was clear by mid-stretch but outfinished late. ALL MY TOMORROWS , unhurried trailing early, swung eight wide into the stretch and rallied
strongly for show honors. BEDAZZLE ME settled three to four wide off the pace, continued to need more racing three to four deep on the far turn, came out
seven wide or so in upper- to mid-stretch and ran on with good late effort but was outfinished for show and in just a tad tight strides from the wire. DANISH
DYNAMITE settled off the pace, moved rapidly inside foes on the far turn, came out at the top of the stretch but could only run on evenly thereafter.
GETTING AHEAD moved clear dictating terms from off the rail, widened late on the first turn and up the backstretch, began to back up on the far turn,
drifted out a bit near the quarter pole, had no extra for the lane. ASHLEE'S RING stalked the pacesetter from off the fence, made a mild and brief inside bid
past the quarter pole but had nothing thereafter. SECRET SUNSHINE was caught four to five wide on the first turn, advanced some early up the
backstretch, continued wide on the far turn and had no rally. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH was lightly brushed at the start, raced between rivals toward the
back early, shifted in on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. CRIMSON NIGHTS raced mid-pack three wide into the run up the backstretch,
came up empty.
