Footnotes
BIG SAVE had an awkward start, chased in the five path, ranged up to bid three wide around the turn, shifted bout out to the five path into the stretch, and
drew clear. CAJUN OCCASION stalked in the three path, was coaxed from inside into the turn, shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for
place. MAUNA KEA BOUND was well back in the two path, was driven from the four path into the lane, and improved late for show. FORTHELOVEOFART
dueled for the lead in the two path, was cued from the three path into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. ADIOS PAPA CHICO dueled from the three
path but gave way entering the lane. GERARD stalked in the four path, was ridden from inside into the stretch, but was empty. WINOOSKI broke slowly and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SILENT CHAOS settled off the pace while racing four wide, moved up four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drove
clear. GOLDEN INDY stalked the pace from the rail while hard held, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and shied out late. MAYOR REMO set
a clear pace in the two path and yielded in midstretch. ASTROTURF stalked the pace three wide between foes and was one-paced through the lane.
THORN raced off the early pace in the two path, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. BIRDMAN RICHIE chased the pace four and five
wide and faded in the lane. FISHING FOR FUN trailed inside.

Footnotes
POETIC CODE brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, bid from the five path while under a drive into the stretch, and drew clear.
FREDDY'S MUSIC prompted the pace in the three path, was cued into the lane, and ran on to hold place. VOICE OF NOW was unhurried from the two
path, was roused while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. NOT A DANCE set the pace in the two path, was hustled from
inside around the far turn and into stretch, but faded. FOLLOW Q T R stalked from the four path but was empty going into the stretch. SIDNEY'S BID
brushed with an outer foe, trailed into the stretch and was never a factor. MUD BUG tracked in the five path but was never a menace.

Footnotes
HOAX prompted the pace in the three path, took over near the sixteenth pole and dug in gamely between foes to prevail. OH DARLIN came in early and
bumped ASHFORD GIRL, tracked the pace in the four path, rallied outside and just missed. ANGIE FROM KULM set the pace in two path, led to the
sixteenth pole gave way grudgingly. HEAVENS EXPRESS lacked early speed, went four wide around the turn and rallied belatedly. SEEKING STARDOM
broke outwardly and bumped PATIENCE WORTH at the start, chased the pace five wide and lacked a rally. BLAH BLAH WORLD chased the pace inside
and faded in the lane. KINDNESS IS FREE was in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. ASHFORD GIRL exchanged several bumps in the
early stages, raced two wide and never threatened. DULCE AMBICION was bumped repeatedly in the early stages, checked about a furlong in, had the
rider lose the irons nearing the far turn and was never involved. PATIENCE WORTH was bumped at the start, raced off the pace five wide, bolted when a
rein broke near the quarter pole and was eased from there. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENTS ENTERING THE TURN
AND EXITING THE TURN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
VANDALIA tracked in the three path, took over the lead under rousing heading into the stretch, and drew clear. PERFECT KIMBERLY S stalked from inside,
was cued while shifting out to the four path around the far turn, and ran on for place. KENTUCKY PRIDE raced in midpack from the three path, was driven
from the four path into the lane, and kept on for show. STARSHIP NUGGET had her head turned which caused a slow start, trailed from the two path,
swung out to the five path while nudging an outer foe at the top of the lane, and gained late. NO NANNETTE NO prompted the pace from the five path, led
from the two path into the far turn, but yielded at the top of the lane. TRULY was unhurried from inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but
flattened. BIONDA SUPRISE rated from the three path but was never a factor. PLAY THAT TONE led from the two path early but gave way around the far
turn. VIOLENT ZAP was wellback in the five path and never a menace. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE START OF STARSHIP NUGGET,
AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE HAD A FAIR START SO NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

Footnotes
ASTONISHING ANABEL set the pace along the rail, kicked clear around the turn, drifted out under left-handed urging in the stretch and just lasted. MISS
UCRANIA lacked early speed inside, tipped two wide near the three-eighths pole, steadily gained on the winner and just missed. KAREN'S HONOR
bobbled at the break, raced four wide and bested the rest. SLENDER SLIPPER pressed the winner three wide and was through after a half. SHE'S RED
HOT played no factor while racing four wide. LADY BOURBON was off slow and outrun in the two path. CAIRO WINNER had only brief speed between
foes.

HEALS THE SOUL pressed in the five path, was cued while taking over from the three path into the lane, and drew clear. BARONE CESCO rated in the
four path, was driven while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on for place. PHAROAH CAT tracked in the six path, was ridden from the
four path into the stretch, and evened out late but held show. PARTNER'S HOPE chased in the two path, was driven from the three path into the stretch,
and kept on late. SMALL REASON trailed from inside, was cued from the two path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. PERFECT PICTURE was
hustled out to prompt the pace from inside but flattened in the stretch. GEOSCIENCE stalked from the two path but backed out around the turn. PUTMAN
led from the three path but gave way into the stretch. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) was wellback in the two path but never menaced.

Footnotes
GRAN SLASH set a pressured pace along the rail, lost the lead midway around the turn, battled back inside in upper stretch, regained command in
midstretch and edged ahead late. ROLLING ON pressed the winner two wide, took the lead midway around the turn, appeared to put that foe away nearing
the quarter pole, dueled outside to deep stretch and was second best late. BOUNCER broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace three wide, was no match for
the top two but stayed on to be well clear of the rest. D COLDEST failed to menace while racing four wide. EYES ON THE KING was outrun inside. MR
MURGO chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HONOR D LADY tracked in the four path, bid from the five path around the far turn, opened up from the four path into the stretch, and was much the best.
EVIE DOES IT stalked in the two path, was driven from the five path into the lane, and stayed on for place. STUCK IN MALIBU raced in midfield from the
five path, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, but finished evenly to show. FATIMA SUNSHINE rated in the three path, tipped out to the path into
the lane, and was one paced but passed tired foes late. UNIFIED GURL raced from wellback in the four path, was hustled from the five path into the stretch,
but weakened. ACTION ROSE was loose on the lead in the three path but gave way around the far turn. LIPARI trailed from inside early and was never a
threat. CECILIA'S WINGS chased from inside but was never a menace.
