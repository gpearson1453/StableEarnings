Footnotes
SENSON chased the early pace, was three deep leaving the turn, drifted out a bit when challenging for the lead in mid stretch, dueled outside ROCK ROSE
and determinedly prevailed. ROCK ROSE bumped with LA FAMILIA after bobbling at the break, sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner
rail, drifted out in mid stretch, dueled inside the winner and just missed in a game effort. DREAMING OF AUDREY saved ground around the turn, swung to
the four path turning for home and finished evenly. SALAMINA , outrun, swung to the five path in upper stretch. LA FAMILIA bumped with ROCK ROSE
leaving the starting gate, prompted that one to the stretch, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
LUCIDITY relaxed nicely four wide, commenced a run when put to asking near the three eighths, steadily advanced into the lane, sustained under left
handed pressure, took over heading to the sixteenth marker, drew away and was taken in hand very late. CARMEL SUNRISE steadied when in tight leaving
the gate, found herself well back and under a ride leaving the far turn, came four wide for the drive, leveled off to her best stride in mid stretch and finished
well to just nab the place. CAMI RACHELLE , three wide and outside a rival pursuing the pace, closed in steadily past mid stretch and churned on between
foes. GRASS CUTTER saved ground with early chase, dropped back around the turn then found more while remaining close to the rail in the drive.
WAVERLEY drifted in a the break and tightened things for CARMEL SUNRISE, raced off the pace while saving some ground, eased out in the drive and
had some late interest. THEOLA FUGGINS sprinted out to a clear lead, opened up while two wide, saw her lead dwindle while under a ride in mid stretch,
ceded to the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened. OBER DARE chased off the inside and faded. ANATH broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
BO'S BOURBON was sent clear after a furlong, dropped in and was taken to rate, moved away with little effort around the turn, widened while briefly asked
near mid stretch then coasted home through the final yards. TROPHY ROOM tracked the pace while inside rivals, eased out making some advance into the
lane, straightened and held well to be clear of the rest. BONDED , in close soon after the break, was under a ride while well back past the three eighths,
swung widest and about six wide into the lane and closed willingly. DUKE OF DOOLY had speed under urging, gave hard chase two wide around the turn
and gave way grudgingly. ELUSIVE IMAGE broke on top despite a brush of the gate, dropped back off the pace and raced in the clear into the turn, made a
decent run inside rivals around the turn, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. BARB'S PRIDE was caught between runners through the
opening half mile, shifted out some in upper stretch and gave way. DANNY'S WINKSTER , four wide outside rivals, was under pressure mid turn and
weakened. DOUBLE BID , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
CONGRUENT , along the inner rail around the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path at the head of the lane, gained the lead in upper stretch,
was challenged on his outside by OTAGO in upper stretch, finished eagerly, drew out under urging and galloped out strong. OTAGO , well placed in the
three path between horses around the turn, floated to the four path at the top of the stretch, bid for the lead outside the winner and finished gamely.
FREEDOM ROAD , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the turn, was fanned to the six path turning for home and lacked the
necessary late effort. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL stumbled when clipping the heels of QUINCY CAFE soon after the break, stumbled when clipping the heels of
that one approaching the stretch then finished gamely between rivals. WE DONT NEED ROADS bore out leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses
entering the turn, swung to the seven path at the head of the lane and failed to menace. QUINCY CAFE drifted out leaving the starting gate, raced slightly
off the inner rail on the turn, angled out in front of FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL approaching the stretch, was nine wide in upper stretch and failed to be a factor.
FREE SOUL prompted the pace, was three wide turning for home and faltered. ROAN BURGUNDY raced in mid pack for the opening five furlongs, moved
to the five path entering the stretch and faltered. SPLENDOR BEAUTY showed speed near the inner rail and faltered.

FACTOR IT IN rated kindly towards the inside, eased out and advanced between runners into the lane, closed nicely under asking, forged to command
approaching the sixteenth marker and eagerly kicked away. YODEL E. A. WHO broke a bit slow, edged up between rivals leaving the five eighths and
gained a forward position, was under asking leaving the three eighths, angled out and circled four wide into the lane, ranged up leaving the furlong grounds,
failed to match strides with the winner to his inside but kept on willingly to earn the place. BACKNTHEWOODS sped clear early, set the pace towards the
inside, failed to contain the winner past the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. FAMISHED edged up inside and tracked the pace, was coaxed along mid
turn, altered out from a tight spot leaving the eighth pole and kept on with good energy between rivals. AIR TOKEN lagged back, saved ground making
some progress past the five sixteenths, continued with some gain near mid stretch, eased out, brushed with a rival and churned on. TORCH OF TRUTH , off
the pace and about three wide mid turn, swung wider past the three sixteenths and had some late interest. CROUCHELLI , off the pace, was under pressure
mid turn, angled out in the drive and had a mild kick. TREASURE TRADITION , two to three wide outside a rival and stalking the pace, was under asking
into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch, brushed with AIR TOKEN and faded. EXCELLORATOR lost ground much of the way and came up empty.

Footnotes
BORN DAPPER saved ground on the turn stalking the pace under confident handling, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch, wrested the lead
outside ANOTHERDAYGONEBY in upper stretch, was under energetic urging in the lane and drew away. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY set the pace along the
inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch then dug in gamely to clearly hold the place. LADY AZTECA , four wide leaving the turn, drifted in in mid stretch and
had a mild rally inside horses. BEE MOUNTAIN saved ground on the turn in a striking position, swung to the four path straightening out for the drive and
flattened out. THE CLASSY ONE hopped at the break, circled horses on the turn, was five deep entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. WHAT AN
HONOR , outside horses down the backstretch, chased the pace and gave way mid way on the turn. CHA CHA TAP hugged the inner rail around the turn
and weakened. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM chased the pace two wide for a half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
BATTLE BLING latched onto COACH from her outside around the first turn, poked a head in front with six furlongs to go, briefly went clear under rating near
the half mile marker, was soon joined from her outside by JILTED BRIDE, held that one off while under a hearty ride past the five sixteenths, kicked back
clear in upper stretch, wandered outward with a furlong remaining, soon corrected, kept on while being flashed the whip and held firm. COACH , brushed at
the break, took over a few strides later, dropped and was taken firmly in hand, allowed the winner to go clear, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths, swung out four to five wide for the drive and came back on with good energy through the final furlong. JILTED BRIDE , three wide tracking the
pace, went after the winner near the three furlong pole, pressed that one into the lane, stayed willingly past the furlong grounds then faded. BREVIARY ,
taken off the rail past the three quarter pole, was ridden along three to four wide around the final turn and failed to respond. CLICK TO CONFIRM came out
a bit at the break and brushed with COACH, saved ground while in range early on, dropped back under pressure around the final turn, swung wide for the
drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R lacked speed, followed BEACON HILL in the two path around the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses
and was up near the finish. BEACON HILL , patiently handled down the backstretch, advanced in the two path mid way on the far turn, eased out three wide
approaching the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. VANCE SCHOLARS disputed the early pace outside WHAT SAY THEE,
opened a clear lead leaving the backstretch, lost the advantage in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously. CARROTHERS , three wide both turns, chased the
pace to the stretch and gave way. BURNING BRIGHT , inside horses stalking the pace to the far turn, swung out entering the stretch, gave way and was
eased. WHAT SAY THEE hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, was done on the far turn, faltered in upper stretch and was eased. BIZZEE CHANNEL
came out at the break, failed to be a factor, drifted wide entering the stretch and was eased. SAMUI SUNSET saved ground the first turn, circled the far turn
three wide, faltered and was eased.
