Footnotes
SPEEDY MOBILE was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was well handled on the front end, led throughout and widened late under mild urging. BEAT
THE DEALER chased the winner throughout on the inside, was no match late but was second best. SAMMY DA BULL was allowed to settle early, had a
mild bid late while no threat. DEER CREEK ROAD was unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and was no menace. MA MOO POWER pressed the pace
for three quarters, then tired. TRUST AND OBEY had good position for six furlongs, then lacked a late response. FU ROO raced mid pack early and was
outrun. PRECIOUS JULES trailed.

set pace, remained clear in mid stretch and was caught in the last jumps. SEEYOUINMOTOWN was never far back, rallied in the stretch four wide and
closed fast to be quickly gaining. EMERSON JONES raced close up on the inside and finished willingly. NEECHI was unhurried early, saved ground and
improved late. MANDOLIN BREEZE raced close up throughout and went evenly late. MISS BUMBUM raced mid pack and went evenly. CHANEL SPIRIT
was no factor. CRYSTAL M was outrun. SHAKA'S LYRIC trailed.
