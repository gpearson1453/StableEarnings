Footnotes
CHAY UP AND AWAY stalked pace along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, launched bid along the inside when leaders drifted out, and
responded well to win almost clear. BLUE BUTTERFLY away well and sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn and into the stretch, kept to
task and led until the final hundred yards when collared late by rallying inside foe. NICE AND TRUE away well showed speed and attempted to control the
pace, outquickened and had to settle for a pressing/chasing inside position, continued along the inside on the turn, rider attempted to ease out entering the
stretch but ended up lugging out into the five path, kept on in the lane to save show. TRUTH PREVAILS off bit slow, trailed field under urging on the
backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and launched a mild bid in the lane to miss third. CHARMING ALEXIS away cleanly, stalked pace two
wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and failed to respond when asked in the lane.
