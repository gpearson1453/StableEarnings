RUNAWAY STAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. MARK
THE MOOSE tracked the back back, moved to position inside and rated through the turn, bid outside the leader, drifting out slightly into the stretch, then
was no match for that one, while clearly best of the rest. LEONARD'S LEGACY well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, was
carried four wide into the stretch, then could not gain and held the show. SONGWRITER mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn and had
no stretch rally. MY FREEDOM passed a tiring rival while widest in the stretch. UNCAPTURED LYON was no factor, inside.

Footnotes
COMMODORE BARRY rated tracking the leader, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked, waited, angled
in and got through inside the leader at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. SHOOT YOUR CUFFS unhurried, looped up three wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and closed well for the place. AEGONTHECONQUEROR sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then drifted out slightly, exchanged bumps with a rival, weakened and held the show.
BRADITUDE well placed and between, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in gaining, exchanged bumps with a
rival, steadied and could not gain. BISHI never far back, faded through the turn. PURE SPRING was a brief factor. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE
TRAINER OF BRADITUDE AGAINST THE RIDER OF AEGONTHECONQUEROR WAS NOT ALLOWED

GENEVIEVE'S Z VA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
KLAYTON'S KANDY tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was
no match for that one, while clearly best of the rest. ANTIGONE hesitated and hopped at the start, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. HONEY BOURBON allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch and improved her position. LIGHTNING ROUND mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch,
angled out, then drifted in and faded. BLARNEY GIRL well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, then faded into the

the final furlong. MAKES MO CENTS tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, angled two and three wide into the stretch
and closed well for the place. WHISTLE ME HOME allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady
gain, then weakened late and held the show. FIGHTIN PHIL well placed, gained position into the second turn, held that position on the two path, bid three
wide outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. RED CAT (CHI) rated back in the early going, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, drifted out six wide into the stretch and could not gain the final furlong. STORM ALFEET mid pack, moved up into the second turn, then
drifted in from the five path and faded. CAKE AND EAT IT TO hopped, hitting the gate at the start, was no factor.

Footnotes
SIRJUS DREAM stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the
stretch, made a steady gain, drew off and was kept to the task. SHE'S REDNECKER rated on heels in the early going, gained position on the two path
through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. DETERMINED CHARM mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the
turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, drifted in and got up for the show. RACING QUEEN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. FINE FABRIC hard to load, broke slowly, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
into the stretch and improved her position. MIDNIGHT FAME set the pace inside and faded the final furlong. IN BEAUTIFULDREAMS was no factor.
GYPSY TAILWIND was never involved.
