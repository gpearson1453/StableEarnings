placed throughout and lacked a late kick. IN FOR A PENNY raced near the middle of the field and was never a factor. TALE OF TENSAS dueled on the
front end, took the advantage around the turn and faded down the home stretch. T R'S FIRST void of early speed and was never a threat. SWEET

late. KAJUN KARMA vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, came around the final turn between rivals, dueled down the lane, was outfinished
for the win, but proved best of others. RACY BILLE raced in the middle of the field, made a late wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for
third. DOCTORED DEAL hopped at the start, racing in the rear, moved up quickly, finished evenly, lacking a late kick. PINK HIGGINS dueled for the early
lead and weakened. REGAL KINGDOM lacked early speed, had an outside trip and was never a factor. I SEE CLEARLY NOW void of early speed and

LOVETHATCAUSE pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, dueled on the inside with THAT'S D CAT, was all out and prevailed for the win.
THAT'S D 'CAT went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. COOL CATOMINE
raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, made a late bid, racing four wide and finished willingly. WILSON TO LOCKETT pressed
the pace, raced three wide around the final turn and lacked a late kick. GUILTY AGAIN lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn, moved up and
finished evenly. DEALIN' STELEN broke a step slow, racing in the rear and was never a threat. SOUTHPINE GIFT void of early speed and showed little.

JUSTIN SPEIGHT shot to the front, drove clear, was never challenged and was ridden out. BRYKEN N MITCHELL pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. TAPIT TO THE LINE lacked early speed, made a steady gain and was a clear third.
AHIMAAZ pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and lacked a late kick. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY raced within striking distance, made a bid
and weakened. MAJESTIC MANDATE raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. XANTHUS WRATH void of early speed and was never close.
MORO FLYBOY raced evenly near the back and showed little. BERNIE SPECIAL was an early factor and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF 32 XANTHUS

LUTIE MO pressed the pace, raced close throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and won under steady urging. MEAN AMERICAN showed early
speed, was forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. FASTED went to the front, drove clear, saved ground
and hung late. TRINITY HOPE void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. START WELL lacked early speed and was never a threat. JUST A
WIN raced within striking distance, had an outside trip and faded. CASHEW always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
JANET IS READY pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the second turn, took command, drove clear, won under urging, while holding off a
late running TENSAS CANDY. TENSAS CANDY void of early speed, had an outside trip, made a steady gain, rallied down the final stretch and was getting
to the winner. FREE DROP MADDY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. GUITAR WOMAN raced in the
middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CAJUN NINJA hopped at the start, racing in the back, came around the second turn on the outside and was
never a factor. DORGENOIS void of early speed and was never a threat. CAJUN GUMBOW went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded.
SERENADINGTHEMOON raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
KING OF THE COURT pressed the pace, raced close throughout, came around the turn on the outside, rallied down the lane and was going away at the
end. WHENTHEDOVESCRY dueled for the early advantage, challenged throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. WONDER
RUN vied for the early lead, saved ground and faded down the home stretch. LUNAR LIGHT lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor.
ADIOS YANKEE raced near the middle of the field, finished wide and was never a factor. MR. PAYCHECK dueled on the front end, saved ground and
faded. MIDNIGHT BAYOU raced near the middle of the pack, faded and was no threat late. MAKATI PHIL always raced near the back and showed little.
