Footnotes
SEXY DEXY set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin after going three furlongs and drew off through the lane as a handy
winner. FLAT FAST settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best.
SAMURAI JACK raced four-wide through the first turn, settled just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the
drive. RUN FOR MATTY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed to threaten.
GOSPEL BUZZ pressed the pace from the inside for three-quarters and weakened. PAPA JUSTICE lagged throughout.

Footnotes
BERNICE WHO was squeezed back at the start, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and was up in the final jump. LA DIAMANT
stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with INDIAN EXCELLENCE nearing the three-eighths pole, vied with that rival
and just failed to last. BLUE LUNA WHO raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled in with a
furlong to run and finished with good energy. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide with LA DIAMANT to offer
a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late. LEMON ICE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through
the second turn and failed to rally. GOSPEL GINA disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. CLOSING TIME
CUTIE dueled for the lead from the inside with GOSPEL GINA , weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way to the winner through the final furlong. ONOMATOPOEIA was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. VODKA TWIST raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished
evenly. WISKEY CROWN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. BAYERN TO BE WILD showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FABOZZI raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GLENDORA MINECAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-eighths marker, vied with KENTUCKY
PEERLESS through mid-stretch and held STRYDER safe late. STRYDER disputed the pace with KENTUCKY PEERLESS while racing three-wide, dropped
off the leaders and angled out into the lane and finished with good late energy. KENTUCKY PEERLESS dueled for the lead with STRYDER from off the rail,
responded when challenged by the winner nearing the five-eighths pole, vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly in the drive. SAYIN GRACE settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. HEREDITARY showed no early speed, raced seven-wide
through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. STOCK DEAL raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. IZA DADDY was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. GOT MOJO was
forwardly placed from the inside, weakened and was eased late.
