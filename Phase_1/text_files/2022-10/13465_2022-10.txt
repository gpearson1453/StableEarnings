Footnotes
EASY BIG BOY set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of mildly pressing foes around the turn, shook clear of them in upper stretch, but
tired late, yet lasted to the wire. WILDERZAR broke slowly, moved forward to track in the three path while behind the pace setters around the turn, tipped
outside of the top pair entering the lane, grinded away to vie for place in pursuit of the tiring leader in the final sixteenth, and narrowly prevailed for that
position while running out of ground to reel in the leader. HE'S A GOOD DANCER stalked along the inside before tipping outside of the pace setter into the
turn, pressed that foe along with another outer rival turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased through midstretch as
an outer WILDERZAR ranged up, closed in on the tiring leader in the late stages along with that rival, but was nailed at the wire for place. BIG BEEMSTER
stalked two wide, pressed three wide around the turn, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane and gave way. TSURIS broke slowly, saved ground at
the rear, and moved up. VASY SAYS NYET tracked three wide, but yielded while getting floated to the five path at the five sixteenths pole. GIANT
AWAKENING broke a bit outwardly while off a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, and made little impact.

Footnotes
HONEY RUN broke a step slowly while being bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked the clear leader from the inside, moved forward to be that foe's
main pursuer into the turn, loomed a danger while tipping outside of her at the three furlong pole, bid in hand at the five sixteenths marker, then assumed
command nearing the lane, and drew off under driving pressure. CANT BE TOUCHED broke in and bumped a rival before tossing his head in resentment of
rider correction, pulled to a clear margin early on, met HONEY RUN's bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that foe entering the
lane, gave way, but just lasted for place late. LEGERITY stumbled just after the start, raced at the rear four wide while taking the turn in the five path, then
stayed on through the lane, but missed reaching a tiring foe for place. DISTORTED SECRETS broke out, stalked three wide, then from the four path and
between horses around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch. CANARY chased two wide and between horses entering the turn, and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CORTESE stalked outside of the pace setter, ranged up to bid entering the lane, brushed that rival in upper stretch while wrestling an advantage, drove
clear at the furlong grounds, dug in to resist BABY BILLY's late challenge, and just lasted to the wire. BABY BILLY bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked
three wide, rallied with a clear CORTESE to catch in the final furlong, closed in to steadily bid nearing the wire, but just ran out of ground. TUMBARUMBA
took a bump from an outer rival at the start, then checked slightly when put to tight quarters at the six furlong pole, tugged forward soon after to an inside
stalking position, but came under urging turning for home, and lacked a bid before surpassing a tiring rival. CHILDERS hopped and broke over a length
slow, quickly rushed forward to scoot clear early on, met CORTESE's bid nearing the lane, got brushed and leaned on while headed in upper stretch, then
subtly shifted out and returned a brush at the furlong pole before weakening. ATKINS trailed in the three to four path, and made little impact.

PLEMMONSTON tracked three wide, chased the leading pair through upper stretch, began to progress in midstretch as the top pair tired, rallied to bid in the
final sixteenth, and drove clear. DROP ANCHOR bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, met CORN POP's bid turning for home,
got headed by that foe entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, reclaimed an advantage in the final sixteenth from his outer faltering counterpart, but
was outkicked soon after. CORN POP took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide, bid turning for home before gaining an advantage
entering the lane, led into the final furlong as his inner counterpart fought on and an outer PLEMMONSTON closed in, then faltered between those foes in
the final sixteenth. BRONZE BEAST tracked in midpack along the inside, was rated back under a snug hold inside of foes nearing the turn, shifted off of the
rail approaching the five sixteenths before fanning to the five path entering the lane, then chased the leaders thereafter while one-paced. MOUNTAIN
GHOST tracked two wide and between horses before clearing an inner rival nearing the turn, chased along the inside around the bend, but weakened.
COMMANDER COMPTON lacked early speed despite heavy rider encouragement, raced far back in the five to four path, and failed to respond.
CONSIDER broke a step slow and was ourun.

Footnotes
MONEY RUN brushed the inner part of the gate before breaking in and towards open space, stalked along the inside, loomed a danger from the pocket
while a path off of the rail around the turn, smoothly split foes three wide entering the lane via a narrow seam to bid for the lead in upper stretch, then kicked
clear approaching the furlong grounds. BOXSTER tracked two wide, took the turn in the three path, tipped outside of the leading trio at the five sixteenths
pole before being floated five wide entering the lane, but was simultaneously outkicked by an inner rallying rival, then chased that foe through the final
furlong to claim place entering the final sixteenth. DISTORTED PRO laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted to the six path at the furlong grounds, stayed
on while flopping back to his left lead a sixteenth from home, claimed show soon after, and was gaining on place late. OLAZABAL rushed to set the pace
inside of a pair of vying rivals, but was headed by a separate bidder in upper stretch, and through the final furlong. FUNNY UNCLE prompted the pace three
wide, then drifted four wide entering the lane, and weakened between rivals soon after. SALTA vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but was
outkicked approaching the final furlong, and weakened. BRILLIANT COLORS raced off of the pace in the two path, and never got involved. LOUISIANIMAL
broke a step slow and was outrun.

Footnotes
ALL WEST settled off of the pace in the two path, moved forward between horses entering the backstretch, chased from behind a newly leading FAMILY
MAN turning for home, split foes to take aim inside of the aforementioned rival in upper stretch, produced a bid at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage
soon after, and drove clear. FAMILY MAN stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, led turning for home, inched clear in upper stretch as an inner ALL
WEST took up the chase, met that foe's rail bid at the furlong grounds, but failed to resist him leaving that station, and was second best. BEAR OAK laid off
of the pace four wide around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, then stayed on to split rivals at the furlong grounds and gained show.
LEADER OF MEN tracked three wide, improved to a stalking position down the backstretch, but came under urging in the four path appraoching the three
furlong pole to keep pace with the top pair, and failed to do so nearing the lane. JUSTIN'S QUEST stalked along the inside, but tired around the far turn.
EAGLE PASS trailed in the two path and never got involved. HOME RUN TRICK set the pace, showed the way from a vying FAMILY MAN around the far
turn, but was headed turning for home, and weakened.

EAST SHORE stalked behind the leading pair and from the two path, tipped outside of those foes turning for home, produced a bid in upper stretch, gained
an advantage at the furlong grounds, and held sway from her inner game counterpart. ALPHA BELLA vied for the lead inside of LOVIN' ON THE RUN,
sparred with that foe around the far turn, shook free of that rival in upper stretch while meeting EAST SHORE's challenge, got headed by that foe at the
furlong grounds, fought on through the late stages, but failed to regain even terms. LOVIN' ON THE RUN broke a step slowly while last away, quickly
rushed between horses soon after to be prominent in the four path entering the first turn, tucked down to the two path while vying outside of ALPHA BELLA
around that bend, sparred with that foe around the far turn, but yielded to that rival and an outer challenger at the three sixteenths pole. METAPHYSICAL
tracked along the inside, shifted four wide and outside of foes at the five furlong pole, chased while getting floated to the six path turning for home, and
stayed on mildly. MIDVALE stalked while tucking from the five path to the three path around the first turn, then yielded between horses entering the lane.
BELLA MAKER settled far back three wide, and failed to menace. LACIE BE GOOD trailed along the inside, then took the far turn in the four path, and
never got involved. DESTINE TO RACE laid off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. FLIRTING GIRL saved ground off of the pace, and tired. LADY
SQUARED rated towards the rear two wide, and was outrun around the far turn.

KOUFAX stalked two wide, bid entering the turn, forged an advantage with three furlongs to go, then drew off entering the lane, and inched further away
thereafter. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS trailed in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane, then rallied willingly outside of foes to gain place in the
closing stages. LEBLON laid off of the pace in the four path, stayed on to reach place leaving the furlong pole, but was bested by an outer foe for that
position inside the final sixteenth. MONEY MIKE tracked three wide, came under a strong drive approaching the three furlong pole to chase the leading pair
turning for home, gained place entering the lane before failing to keep pace with the leader, then weakened inside of a pair of place-bidding rivals in the final
furlong. EXPLOSIVE laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed turning for home, then passed tiring rivals. MAHOMEY tracked along the inside, but tired.
BREAKING NEWS set the pace, vied inside of a bidding KOUFAX into the turn, got headed at the three furlong pole, then weakened entering the lane, and
was found to have bled.

Footnotes
BERATE stalked outside of the top pair, bid entering the lane sparking a duel with PARK ON THE NILE, forged an advantage from that foe inside the final
furlong, and edged ahead through the final sixteenth. PARK ON THE NILE set the pace, met BERATE's bid entering the lane, dueled gamely with that foe
through midstretch, but was headed inside the final furlong, and bested a sixteenth from home. HIGH FASHION tracked in midpack two wide, then gained
between horses in upper stretch to reach show at the furlong grounds. LOVELY PRINCESS laid off of the pace in the two path, improved in the three path
around the far turn before entering the lane in the four path, but failed to progress on the leaders before losing show to an inner rival at the furlong grounds.
ROC'S PRINCESS tracked in midpack along the inside, retreated to trail the field turning for home, then tipped to the five path in upper stretch, and finished
up mildly. MALIBU MARLEE broke slowly, trailed in the three path, took the far turn in the five to seven path, and failed to factor. SHE'S KEEN pressed two
wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. OUTLINING stalked along the inside, but chased under urging around the far turn before fading.

SKELLY sparred with an inner rival around the turn, assumed command entering the lane, and widened while under moderate hand urging. VICTORY
MARCH laid off of the pace in the two path, gained three wide and between horses leaving the three furlong pole, gained place at the three sixteenths
marker, and fended off an outer foe for that positoin. SHIPMAN was crowded between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to five path into the
turn, tucked back to the three path before gaining between horses turning for home, tipped outside of VICTORY MARCH entering the lane, then pursued
that foe in hopes of bidding for place, but was kept at bay. MONTAUK POINT stalked along the inside, but was shuffled behind a tiring foe turning for home,
altered course out entering the lane, and chased. MAMZOOJ saved ground far back and improved in upper stretch. TOUCH CODE was pinched back
between horses early on, took the turn in the three to four path while far back, and failed to factor. CHIRON stalked two wide and between horses, emerged
as the embattled leading pair's main pursuer into the turn, chased them turning forhome, but weakened nearing the lane. ENGRAVE sparred for the lead
inside of the eventual winner while just off of the inside, proved no match for him entering the lane, and stopped. ALLO ENRY tracked four wide, but
weakened in the six path entering the lane. FOWLER CASTLE was outrun.
