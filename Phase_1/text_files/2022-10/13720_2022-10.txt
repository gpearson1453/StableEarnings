PRETTY DEVIL broke in at the start, rushed up and sprinted clear quickly, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. MY GIRL MELLY mid pack
and inside, saved ground moving up through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed for the place. CARINA'S WAY
well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. DUPLICATED unhurried, moved up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and got up for a share. GIO'S MY DAD well placed and outside, angled
in and tracked the leader through the turn, then drifted in and faded in the lane. DANCE FOR BOURBON never far back, gained position four wide into the
turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
TALES OF MAKENNA allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. SCOOP THERE IT IS tracked the pace back, moved up and took command on the two path through the turn, drew off in the lane, then was
no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. TAMI'S ORCHID allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled four wide into the
stretch and closed well for the show. GRAND VENUS mid pack, looped to position four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up
for a share. TRACKER JACKER well placed, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
MACRELLETTA sprinted to a long lead pulling soon after the start, then faded into the stretch. KIKI'S LULU ROSE was a brief factor and faded.

BAY DEFENSE mid pack and inside, moved up and was boxed through the second turn, waited, angled three wide and split foes in the stretch, then made a
steady gain and edged ahead late. MID ATLANTIC allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. BRAMBLE BEACH well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened, then was vanned off after the race. WHONEW'S TREASURE set the pace on the inside, shook clear into
the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. MAGIC WIZARD mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came
widest into the stretch and improved position. CRITICIZE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch
and had no rally. TIDDLY WINK stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader
into the stretch and faded. CROWN'S DEFENDER was a brief factor, inside. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, BAY

SUNSHINE CHARLIE well placed and off the rail, gained position on the two path through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up in the final strides. BLUE SKY'S ABOVE well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide
outside the leader into the stretch, edged ahead, then shook clear late and was outfinished. LEAVEITALONELARRY unhurried, looped up three and four
wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed for the show. WATCH THE DIP mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and ran evenly. DONALD fractious in the gate, sprinted clear soon after the start, then faded the final furlong.
CANDY MY BOY passed a tiring rival. WHISKEY DASH steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
PUNX allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in the
final strides. SKYDIVING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. FEAR
THE DEER mid pack, gained position on the two path through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, edged ahead, shook clear, then weakened
late and held the show. BIG FRANK well placed and outside, looped three and four wide to a striking position through the second turn, lost ground five wide
into the stretch, then had a mild gain for a share. EASTON ROCKS allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into
the stretch and passed tiring rivals. GENERALONAMISSION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second
turn, then faded the final furlong. GIOVANE'S PROMISE was a brief factor. OLE G MAN stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path
through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded. BREWING STORM mid pack, moved up inside through the second turn, angled
out into the stretch and had no rally.
