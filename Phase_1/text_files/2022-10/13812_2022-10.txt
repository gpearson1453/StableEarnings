Footnotes
SHOTGUN JOE set the pace from the two path on a clear lead into the backstretch, was under pressure into the far turn, dueled with two others into the
lane, lost the lead to the runner-up with an eighth to go then game came back. ROUNDER chased the two rival duel into the far turn, unleashed a strong bid
in late turn, came into the lane from the four path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while dueling to the wire.
JACKS FIRE BALLS pressed two wide done the backstretch and through the turn then weakened in the drive. DIALED A DAME tracked the pacesetters
while near the inside into the far turn, continued to be a contender until late turn then faded through the lane. MOUNTAIN GHOST was always last while in
the two path.

Footnotes
GO EARLY STAY LATE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid nearing the quarter pole while three wide, gained the lead into the lane,
cleared near the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on. EPIC THE LEGEND tracked the pace along the inside into the far turn, bid after mid-turn, gained a
short lead before the quarter pole, quickly lost the lead into the lane then chased the winner home. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE was in the two to the three path
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up while not a threat. RUNAWAY IMAGE was in the four to the three path through the first
turn, moved closer to the inside on the far turn, bid into the lane and tired. GENTLEMAN LOGAN raced on a clear lead down the backstretch while in the
two path , gave way after mid-turn then drifted out through the stretch run. SHAD was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. BINNINGTON
BLUES was off slowly and veered to the rail spotting the field several lengths then raced far back.

Footnotes
POPSTER vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside, lost the lead approaching the quarter pole, dueled to retake the top spot with an eighth to
go, dispatched of challenger outside the sixteenth pole, was joined by another soon after and lasted in a very game effort. NOMADIC FIGHTER was
unhurried while off the inside, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane, rallied through stretch and was closing in the end in a strong effort.
CREATIVE MIRACLE stalked the dueling pacesetters through mid-turn, bid approaching the five-sixteenth pole, gained the lead into the lane then could not
keep up. BROKEN JUSTICE raced near the rail through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up. SEE SPOT RUN dueled for the
early lead then steadily faded and drifted out through the lane. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA dueled early while between rivals into the backstretch, gained the
lead then steadily faded. MASTER LEA was five wide through the first turn and was done after a half and eventually was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
WET PAINT trailed early while near the inside, began gaining momentum nearing the half-mile pole, moved through the four to the three path on the far
turn, continued on to engage the leader outside the eighth pole, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then edged clear. WINDY BAY vied for the lead two
wide through the far turn, lost the lead after mid-turn, regained the top spot into the lane, was joined by winner outside the eighth pole, could not keep up
with that one and settled for second best. ELECTRIC SENSE vied along the inside through the turn into the far turn, gained the lead approaching the
quarter pole then weakened after turning into the lane. NAVY FLEET raced off the rail into the far turn, was asked for more near the three-eighths pole, was
hard ridden into the lane and could not gain while weakening through the final eighth. FLAT OUT FREDA was never a factor while near the rail. WICKED
FROST was in the three path through the far turn while not far back then was empty turning into the lane. VIVI BRASS chased the pace while along the
inside then steadily faded.

Footnotes
ASHWINS ORB was unhurried while in the three path down the backstretch, began gaining momentum after mid-turn, came three wide into the lane with
energy, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then drew away. TOLKIEN was unhurried early while in the three path, quickly moved up through mid-turn,
swung into the lane from the three path and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. OFFUTT COLE pressed the stalked the
pacesetter into the far turn, gained the lead in late turn, continued with a short lead into the lane while dropping to the rail, was no match for the winner but
held on to the minor share. SCOTCH NO ROCKS was in tight and shut off at the start, raced in the three path through the turn when near the back, moved
up through the far turn while in the three or four path and never was a threat. LONGER VIEW was shut off at the start when squeezed from both sides,
raced behind mid-pack down the backstretch, continued in the three path through the far turn and never was a serious factor. AZAMANA EMPIRE chased
the pace from the three path into the far turn then tired. MIGHTY RIOT was in the two path through the turns and was always well back. FIRST FORCE
raced in the four path through both turns and was empty after turning into the lane. FLAGSTONE set the pace while in the two path through the far turn then
was empty turning into the lane. GALLANT DUDE chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then was done in mid-turn while along the rail and was
eased to the wire through the latter stages and walked off.
