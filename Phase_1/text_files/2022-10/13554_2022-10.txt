Footnotes
REAL ACTION pressed the early pace, dueled around the final turn, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. FISHIN WITH PETE
went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, dueled around the final turn, couldn't match strides with the winner down the lane, but was best of others.
MOR BIG LEE raced within contention, was close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. ST PIERRE lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but
was no factor. LIFEASWEKNOWIT raced near the middle of the field in the beginning, eased back, improved position late, but was no factor. CARLOS'
BLAST pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. LITTLE STAR TARGET void of early speed and was never close. CLEMENT'S NOTE broke
slow, trailed throughout, was distanced and walked off.

outside trip, moved up around the second turn, rallied down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MAX PANDOWDY raced
near the back in the early part, moved up, wide around the final turn, made a late gain and was a clear third. BOURBON ST TAPPIN had a tight start, racing
in the back, made a steady gain, rallied on the inside down the stretch, but was no factor. OAK HILL SOLUTION showed early speed and weakened late.
NOW YOU RULES raced within striking distance and faded. MACHO MARK lacked early speed and was never a threat. HELIOCHROME went to the front,
drove clear, saved ground and retreated. CARRIES MAN void of early speed and was outrun. CYBER GUN raced within contention, came around the first

BASSETT lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. FLASHBURN vied for the early lead and faded down the home stretch. PA MA'S AMOS
lacked early speed and was never a factor. RITHMICALLEA raced near the back and showed little. BOATING PARTY raced within striking distance and

PRANK went to the front, dueled throughout and was outfinished by the top two. BRAVE MAGIC pressed the pace, saved ground and lacked a late kick.
GALLANT BUCK lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a mild bid and faded. TIZ THE BIG ONE showed brief speed and dropped to the
rear.

finished well. MILITARY BEARING pressed the pace, challenged on the front throughout, but proved no match for the winner late. FORTY THREE showed
early speed, dueled throughout and hung while racing inside. MACHO ROCCO vied for the early lead, steadied down the backside, racing rank, finished
evenly, lacking a late kick. RUMOHR REIGNS raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. BLUE CHEESE lacked early speed, came around
the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, racing wide, but was no factor. WISE GUY raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
WON DAY dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drifted out, while dueling with MALFORMED down the stretch and prevailed for the win.
MALFORMED challenged on the front end, dueled throughout, was bumped down the home stretch by rival and missed the win. LONESHILOHSPECIAL
raced in the middle of the field, made a late wide bid and finished willingly. HALF PAGE was unruly in the gates, raced in the middle of the pack, made a
mild bid, but was no factor. MADAME JANE bobbled at the start, raced within contention and weakened. GOODNIGHT GRACIE lacked early speed and
was never a threat. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY unruly in the gates, void of early speed and was never close. SATISFY U void of early speed and was outrun.
NOT SO SWEET flashed brief speed and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF #12 MALFORMED LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #10 WON DAY
FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #10 FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER
SECOND.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY unhurried in the beginning, had an outside trip, made a big move around the final turn, took command, was going away at the
end and won handily. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE vied for the lead, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. RELENTLESS
DANCER raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. BLACK SWORD raced near the middle of the pack,
made a late gain and was outfinished for third. VODKA GIMLET lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SCHNELL dueled on the front
end in the early going and faded. LANGS DAY void of early speed, trailing the field in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, gained
ground, but was no threat. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE pressed the early pace and retreated. HIGHLAND CREEK raced near the back, moved up, within striking
distance and dropped back.
