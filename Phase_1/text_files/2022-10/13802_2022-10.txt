HIZAAM dueled for the early lead outside of KITTEN'S SOLUTION, then made a bid and was confronted by ROCKET BLAST by the quarter pole and
dueled to the inside of that rival, then drifted out the final sixteenth while edging away under a drive. ROCKET BLAST was off a step slow, made a four wide
bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, then had a long drive and had to take up and alter course leaving the sixteenth pole and was clearly
second best. KITTEN'S SOLUTION dueled for the lead on the inside, then fell back on the turn, angled off the inside in the lane and faded. The rider on
number two claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference in late stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replay they allowed the objection and
placed the winner second for drifting out causing ROCKET HEAT to alter course.

TIZ HANDSOME was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then turned back a bid leaving the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch to prove much the
best, driving. SCARY LARRY stalked the winner and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, but could not sustain that bid, while staying on to be
second best. MANUKA BOBBY chased the early pace and saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed bid, bested rest. AMERICAN ROCKY was
settled three to four wide and was not a threat. IRON CLASH was unprepared for the start, not a factor.

MOTI had to be motivated early to get into contention on the inside, shifted off the inside at the three eighths marker to make a four wide bid on the turn, hit
the front nearing the furlong marker and was given one right handed pop, then was given two left handed pops with the riding crop to draw away smartly to
prove best. RISQUE REBEL set the pace towards the inside, was well handled and headed by the quarter pole, dug in but could not go with the winner late,
clearly second best. VITESSE was rated along three wide, came four wide into the lane and had no rally, bested rest. BAVARIA was four wide into the first
turn, stalked the pace three wide and went up to press the pace by the half mile marker and then tired on the turn.
