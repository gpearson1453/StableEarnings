was second best in the end. VARNISHED dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive and gamely dug in but weakened in late stretch.

stalking the pace while inside but was in hand while racing off heels, was blocked going into the far turn, angled out to be four wide in upper stretch and was
no threat. VIOLIN MAKER dueled for the lead while two wide, was hard used then gave way in the stretch. CONCRETE FINISHER was unhurried early
while inside, saved ground then angled out five wide and was no menace. LETHAL MOVE was unhurried early then raced three wide on the far turn,
