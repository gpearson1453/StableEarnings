Footnotes
FOGGY KITTEN was urged setting the pace between rivals on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the turn, widened the advantage nearing
upper stretch, forged clear through the stretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement. TIME BREAK, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off
the pacesetter into the turn, continued with a steady bid between rivals into the stretch while failing to gain terms with the winner but finished with interest to
hold a rival for the place honors. HOPPESTRY was rated off the second flight while tipping a bit off the inside in the opening stages, shifted out four wide
racing into the turn steadily advancing to contention between foes into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. FIVE ROSES LUNA angled to the
inside early tracking the leaders inside rivals in second flight, tipped off the rail racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position inside foes.
SUMMER LOVIN, held up avoiding close quarters at the break, was prompted to advance racing five wide into the turn, continued in that path to upper
stretch but lacked the needed late bid. MIKE'S LADY raced three wide between foes in the second flight in the opening quarter but, faded early. SINGING
ALLI, caught four wide in second flight racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing upper stretch. IRISH HALO tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight, angled to the inside racing into the turn and quickly came up empty. ASHLEY ELIZABETH, urged inside the eventual winner prompting that rival on
the backstretch, switched out entering the turn while continuing in pursuit of that foe but gave way abruptly into the stretch.

Footnotes
MAGIC MONDAY angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter along the rail through the
turn, tipped out racing through upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. LAWMAKER tracked
the leaders three deep early, then outside a rival nearing the bend, angled to the rail racing through the turn while being prompted to advance, shifted out
three wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to prove best of the others. J J'S SOLUTION was settled outside foes in the opening stages,
swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to make some mild progress late while prevailing for a share. INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke
readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the bend, shook clear midway through the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid midstretch but
weakened in the drive. SENOR MIKE, restless loading in the gate, angled inwards tracking off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and
continued evenly while gaining some position late. TAHKODHA KNIGHT angled to the inside in early stages tracking the leaders from out of striking
distance and faded early. BALADINE, urged three wide prompting the pace in the opening three sixteenths, bore out racing into the turn and soon gave way.
MICHAEL GEORGE was off slowly and never gained contention. ANUNKA proved no factor. ROCKET MAN ATTACK, urged between foes pressing the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, emptied out nearing upper stretch.

REDNECKERTHANYOU broke well to the lead, took pressure from W W KAN DO from the five eighths, dueled inside of that foe while racing in the three
path on the turn, opened up in upper stretch, and held driving. STORMIN HONGKONG settled at the rear, continued patiently into the turn, began to
improve in the five path near the three eighths, swung near the middle of the track in upper stretch, responded under a drive, finished full of run in the final
furlong and was gaining with every stride. W W KAN DO was urged in the opening furlong to prompt outside of REDNECKERTHANYOU, dueled outside
that foe while racing in the four path on the turn, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, continued to chase while drifting out and held the show late.
BIG PINES SANDY broke outward, settled near the rear outside of BEL BIMBO, was urged in the four path on the turn, swung out six wide into upper
stretch, chased on willingly but missed the show. BEL BIMBO settled near the rear inside, continued near the rear in the three path on the turn, was driven
into the lane and finished mildly past tiring horses. HATCHET CREEK tracked inside down the back straight, gradually lost ground along the rail around the
turn, was driven in upper stretch but continued to flatten out. RIPE ATTACK tracked the pace two wide early, continued to track in range in the two path on
the turn, took closer order inside when driven into the lane, but weakened from near the three sixteenths. PO BOY chased three deep down the backstretch,
continued midfield in the five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
IRISH MAJOR settled well off the field in the opening half, continued last into the far turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch, rallied smartly to striking
distance leaving midstretch, shifted inwards under right handed pressure but just edged CARTE BLANCHE in time. The latter, forwardly placed three deep
attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path racing into the far turn, went clear into upper stretch, drifted out late despite right
handed pressure crossing into the path of TALLESTOFTHETALL and just failed to contain the winner. TALLESTOFTHETALL, caught four wide racing into
the first turn while racing as part of the second flight to the backstretch, continued in that path into the far turn, gradually drew into striking position between
foes leaving midstretch, then was caught in close quarters nearing the wire while failing to match the top pair. CAMPAIGN SPY tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no late bid. YAK tracked off
the first flight inside rivals to the backstretch, was bumped, then exchanged repeated contact with EMOJI GUY racing into the far turn, then continued evenly
between foes into the lane. LASTFORTINOFAMILY settled outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, raced five wide into the stretch but
had no rally. EMOJI GUY, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, was urged to advance nearest the rail after a half, bumped YAK, then continued to
exchange repeated contact with that foe racing into the far turn, then faded into the lane. ANTRIM'S GIANT angled to the inside dropping off the second
flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing upper stretch but offered no closing bid. SHOBIZ STAR, urged between foes prompting the
pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. PRINCE OF MAYHEM, urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into
the first turn, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF TALLESTOFTHETALL LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF IRISH MAJOR AND CARTE BLANCHE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE WIRE, BUT THAT
CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SIGN OF PEACE broke readily, took up a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival to the far turn, readily advanced to wrest the
advantage racing into upper stretch, then gamely held the challenge of KATHAAN to the end under firm encouragement. The latter was rated inside rivals
behind the second flight to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, angled to the rail racing past
midstretch to challenge inside the leader and continued willingly to the end while just failing to edge that rival. SURE SHOT ANNIE tracked just off the
pacesetter inside the eventual winner to the far turn and weakened in the drive. PERFECTLY PROUD settled last early, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. LOFTYSHIPSLOWSAILS tracked the leaders between foes behind the second flight, angled
inside rivals racing into the stretch and finished evenly. PRADA'S MIRACLE tracked the leaders three wide off the second flight to the far turn and faded into
the stretch. AVARIE was hustled to the lead while angling inwards, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn and gave out abruptly racing into upper
stretch. BEE A WINNER settled outside foes early, raced wide into the far turn and faded early. MISS KITTY PIE proved no factor. ARCTIC TEARS tracked
off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, retreated after a half, then was vanned off the course following the race when failing to return to be
unsaddled.

Footnotes
PALAGO chased toward the rear of the main group early, was pushed along in the three to four path on the turn, shifted inward in upper stretch, responded
well under a drive, sustained her rally to the finish and got up in the final strides inside of DELIGHTFUL BREEZE. The latter set a pressured pace early
inside of TIZ HOPPIN, dueled inside of that foe around the turn, kicked to a more defined lead in upper stretch, drifted out midstretch as TIZ HOPPIN kept
on to her outside, and was nailed in the final strides by PALAGO to her inside. TIZ HOPPIN broke a bit awkwardly, pressed the pace outside of
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE early, dueled two wide on the turn while brushing with DELIGHTFUL BREEZE, was outkicked by that foe into upper stretch but kept
on willingly to try and reel him back in, was carried out by that foe midstretch, altered in late behind that foe and kept on willingly for show. LONG TALL
WOMAN settled at the rear, raced in the three to four path on the turn, took closer order approaching the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch
under a drive, and made good belated outside gain. FOOT RUB LOVE chased inside early, advanced approaching the quarter pole to track the pace inside
of ORDAINED KISS, saved ground on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane and chased on mildly between horses. ORDAINED KISS
chased three deep early, tracked well off the leading pair in the three path on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into upper stretch and flattened
gradually. JOLIE RULER chased between horses early, continued midfield in the two to three path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and chased on
mildly under a drive. DR. ANN chased inside while a bit keen down the back straight, saved ground while chasing around the bend, was driven inside in
upper stretch and weakened. KHOZYS CROWN chased between horses early, dropped back to the rear of the main group approaching the half mile
marker, raced in the five path toward the rear around the turn, was forced out slightly in upper stretch by LONG TALL WOMAN, and came up empty. THE
RIDER OF TIZ HOPPIN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DELIGHTFUL BREEZE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH.

Footnotes
LOCAMOTOR broke sharply, attended the pace four wide down the back straight and into the turn, vied three wide from past the furlong mark, held a
narrow lead in upper stretch, drifted out but nonetheless kicked clear with one strike of the crop and otherwise hand ridden. MEGAN'S HONOR was sent for
pace between horses, battled for the lead three wide, raced two wide between horses from the three eighths, vied inside of LOCAMOTOR into upper
stretch, and chased on in the final furlong while proving a clear second best. MKAR THE FAST was reluctant to load, chased midfield, was pushed along in
the five path on the turn, went to a drive six wide in upper stretch, and kept on willingly outside foes to secure the show. MAC PANDOWDY settled near the
rear early, continued near the rear in the four path on the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch and improved mildly between horses.
IWILLPERSEVERE tracked the leading line early, chased well behind them into the turn, pursued in the four path around the bend, was driven five wide into
the lane, and lacked the needed kick. LOOK AWAY was a bit anxious in the gate, settled at the rear, was outpaced into the turn, hugged the rail around the
bend, regained touch with the rest of the field inside into the lane and passed tiring horses. WILDWOOD SECRET broke sharply, vied between horses in the
leading flight, gained the inside after D'FEVER stopped near the three eighths, proved no match for MEGAN'S HONOR and LOCAMOTOR into the lane
despite being driven in upper stretch, and weakened. D'FEVER was sent for speed inside, vied on the pace, and stopped approaching the three eighths.

VALLEY VISTA prompted the leader inside early, vied into the turn and edged to a narrow lead near the three eighths, was driven inside into the lane to
keep that lead, drifted out and bumped TAPIT SAM near the furlong mark, and edged clear late. TAPIT SAM took a narrow lead between horses early, vied
outside of VALLEY VISTA into the turn, pressed outside that foe from near the three eighths, continued to goad outside of him into the lane, was bumped by
VALLEY VISTA near the furlong mark, continued to chase on and proved second best. FRISCO LINE chased between horses, rallied between horses in
upper stretch and kept on evenly in the final furlong to prove best of the rest. TEA AFTER BALLET tracked the leading line early but soon settled back to
chase outside foes, raced three wide between horses on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane and finished willingly. SHANGHAI SILVER chased inside
down the back straight, hugged the rail around the turn and into the lane, offered a mild rally in upper stretch but flattened out late. MYNAMEIS PRINCE
chased three deep early, tracked four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and was outfinished. STUN GUN broke outward, settled at the rear well
behind the rest of the field, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, angled in, regained touch with the field and drove
past tiring horses. MINISTRY OF ART attended the pace three wide early, settled back to midpack approaching the nine sixteenths, chased at the rear of
the main group in the two to three path on the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch, and flattened. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE attended the pace four wide
early, settled back to track the leading pair approaching the half, tracked in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened between
horses. DARE GOES DA DEVIL settled near the rear, drifted out into MUNCH on the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn just inside of that same
foe, swung seven wide into upper stretch and lacked a bid. MUNCH settled near the rear outside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL, was bumped by that foe
mid-backstretch, raced in the six path on the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch and had no rally. THE JOCKEY OF VALLEY VISTA CLAIMED FOUL
