and dueled through the final furlong in game fashion to prevail by a nostril at the end. AL'S PRINCE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to duel through the final furlong gamely with the aforementioned foe to his inside, but was ultimately

stretch, offered up a mild kick. SPECTATORLESS showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front
and took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. WILL E SUTTON three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch and offered up no response. UMBRIA chased along the
