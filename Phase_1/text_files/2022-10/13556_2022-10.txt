Footnotes
BENSON was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted to the second turn, was confronted by the runner-up in mid-stretch, repelled that
bid, found more in the late stages and edged away in the end. CLOCHARD STREET was unhurried early on, advanced along the backstretch run, kept
pressure on BENSON to the top of the lane, confronted the winner in mid-stretch, the rider lost his crop inside of the furlong grounds, reluctantly gave way in
deep stretch and was best of the rest. DESERT SMOKE tracked the decent early fractions, came four wide into the backstretch run, was not able to match
strides with the top two in the drive and lacked a final response but was well clear for third in the end. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was forwardly placed early on,
came three wide into the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the half-mile marker, lost contact on the far turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FOREIGN PROTOCOL broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set quick fractions while prompted to the quarter marker, drew clear into
mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up but kept to task in the final stages. STRIKE IT LUCKY bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly,
chased the early speed from the rail, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, angled out in upper stretch, made a good final push in deep stretch but could
not reel in the winner and held safely in the end for the place. BEAR CHUM (AUS) chased from the rear early on, gained ground three wide on the turn,
pursued the winner to mid-stretch and was outfinished in the late stages, while well clear for show. MOSQUITO FLEET showed good early speed and
pressed the quick pace to the turn, chased the winner to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ALWAYS LITT was sent to the early lead and dictated terms to the turn, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper
stretch, was kept to task in the final furlong and proved best in the end. HAVAKASH READY rated just off of the early pace, came three wide to the quarter
marker, finished well in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner late but stayed on to secure place. LOOKIN TO EXCEL showed early speed and
pressed the quick fractions to the turn, kept pressure on ALWAYS LITT to the top of the lane, chased the winner to mid-stretch and was outfinished late,
while well clear in the end for third. PAPA TIGER chased the quick pace outside of rivals to the turn, lost ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker
and did not produce a late rally. VINNIEBOB was shuffled back at the start and spotted the field early on, chased from the rear through the turn and was not
a factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HULA KING showed speed and contested the early fractions, headed CLASS PROOF nearing the quarter marker, could not go on with that foe into upper
stretch, came again inside of the furlong grounds and closed determinedly in deep stretch to prevail. CLASS PROOF was sent to contest the early pace, set
disputed fractions through the turn while pressed by HULA KING, was able to shake free in upper stretch, was confronted again by the winner inside of the
furlong marker, met that foe's bid to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the end, while holding safely for place. LIVE A GOOD LIFE chased the early
pace, gained ground four then three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not make headway on the top pair late but did gain ground in the final sixteenth
and was clear for show in the end. MARKSMAN ON TARGET lacked early speed, improved position two wide on the turn, was not able to reel in the top
three in deep stretch but found his best stride in the late stages. ABADON showed early speed and vied for the early lead, took back to track the pace
through the turn, chased the leaders into the stretch and lacked a late rally. SNICKER'N DAN chased the early pace, lost ground two wide nearing the top of
the lane and gave way in the stretch run. BENNYANDTHECHICKS stumbled sharply at the start and spotted the field early on, chased from the rear through
the turn, the rider lost his crop at the top of the lane and did not have an impact late.

Footnotes
U S READY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while pressed on the turn, shook free into upper stretch, felt pressure from the
runner-up in deep stretch and held well at the end to prevail. YOUONLYLIVETWICE tracked the early pace, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker,
chased U S READY to mid-stretch, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages but was best of the rest in the end.
WETHERLY was never far back in the early going while unhurried, mounted a five wide bid on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the
final sixteenth but was well clear in the end for show. LONSDALEITE chased the pace three wide to the quarter marker and gave way in the drive.
CLUBHOUSE WAVE showed early speed and raced close to the solid early pace, came in tight entering the turn and was bothered and shuffled back
midway through the bend, trailed into the stretch and lacked a late rally. INEXPENSIVE STAR stumbled leaving the break and was off a step slowly, was
forwardly placed to the turn, crowded CLUBHOUSE WAVE along the turn and lost ground nearing the top of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the
final stages.

TRAFFIC STOPPER was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set quick and contested fractions through the turn, shook free in upper stretch,
was pressured in deep stretch by the runner-up but held that foe at bay in the end to prevail. HEY WILMAAA showed early speed and pressed the quick
pace through the turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch, came back in deep stretch, challenged TRAFFIC STOPPER in the late
stages but could not get by that determined winner and was second best at the end. ST. ANNIE'S INDY chased the quick early speed from a ground saving
position, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in deep stretch but was outkicked in the end, while holding safely for third. MERGIE TROID stalked the early
fractions, lost ground three wide on the turn, made a mild late rally in the drive but was not able to impact the leaders late. CHAY UP AND AWAY hopped at
the start and was away a bit slowly, chased from the rear through the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, was not able to threaten in the final stages but
found her best stride late. TAKES A VILLAGE chased the solid early pace, came three then four wide along the turn, lost ground five wide in upper stretch
and lacked a late rally.

LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS bobbled slightly at the start but won the break and established the early lead, set fast fractions while pressed by DRAW THE
FOUL, shook free of that rival in upper stretch, was confronted again by the runner-up in deep stretch, was tiring while on the left lead in the final strides but
dug in late to prevail. DRAW THE FOUL engaged with the winner soon after the break and pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth, challenged the winner in deep stretch but could not get by in the end and was second best. GONE SOMEWHERE was
unhurried in the early going, came three wide to the quarter marker, was not able to impact the top two late but was gaining in the end and rallied for show in
the final strides. KNOCKOUT BERT stalked the quick early fractions, maintained position while along the rail through the turn, was steered four wide into the
lane, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late response.

PSYCHO DAR showed good early speed and disputed the pace to the turn, took command nearing the quarter marker, drew clear to mid-stretch and pulled
away in the final stages. TOP HARBOR pressed the fast early fractions, chased PSYCHO DAR to the quarter marker while three wide, lost ground to the
winner in mid-stretch and was no match for that one late but stayed on well in the end to be second best. ULTIMATE BANGO settled off of the quick early
pace, came four wide to the quarter marker, was not able to make headway on the top pair in deep stretch but was clear for third in the end. CLEM LABINE
chased the pace, came two wide along the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, was not able to factor in the outcome in the final stages but did offer a
mild late bid. FASHIONABLY FAST was away in good order and was prominent in the early going, dueled for the lead to the turn, came in tight while racing
between rivals on the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the drive. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD rated off of the early pace, lost
ground three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the drive and was not able to threaten in the late going.

Footnotes
TIPPY TOP broke from the gate in good order, stalked on the outside of a speed duel to the turn, was asked for more passing the five-sixteenths pole,
entered the stretch five wide and wore down a pair of rivals to nab the win in the final strides. JAYCEE broke best and contested the early pace on the flank
of MY SPY with another pair in pursuit, continued the duel through the turn and into the stretch, finally got a head in front of that rival in the final furlong only
to be out finished by TIPPY TOP in the final yards and was second best in the end. MY SPY broke well and contested the early pace just ahead of JAYCEE,
doggedly held a narrow lead until just past the eighth pole, gave way grudgingly in deep stretch and was well clear for third in the end. ENGEE OMBEE
devoid of early speed, was ridden from the half-mile marker, continued one-paced to the finish well behind the field and offered a mild late rally. CLEAR WIN
was bumped at the start then was encouraged to contest the early pace, was in striking position through the turn but failed to respond when asked for more
passing the quarter pole and tired. ROYAL DANIELLE was outrun at the start, moved to the rail to save ground, remained there through the turn and was
never a factor.
