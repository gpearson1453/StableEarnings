Footnotes
CHASE LIL ME settled back in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod three wide midway
on the far turn, dug in to draw clear inside the sixteenth pole and held on well. FELICIAS CASTLE stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and finished evenly to take second later yards. MIO GRACELAND stalked two deep through the front
stretch then moved to even terms and alternated the lead with Lasher from the nine sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep into the far
turn, was caught midway through the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. SUGAR LIPS settled inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail into the far turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch then flattened later yards. LASHER rated the pace with a
slim early lead, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and alternated the lead with Mio Graceland from that point, gave up front running position at the rail
midway on the far turn and weakened into the lane. DUKE OF CORK ducked in stumbling and lost his rider leaving the gate. The Stewards reviewed the
start of this race before posting the official.

quarter but was caught past the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. UPSY DAISY DO saved early ground, bid approaching the three eighths pole,
ran in the four path of the far turn and passed a rival in the lane. RHYTHM TREE came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with Buff N then closed to

MIDNIGHT BRASS settled well off the pace saving early ground, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and steadily gained four wide on the
far turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole to take over mid-stretch and drew away later yards. BAYS CASTLE was bumped at the break then saved ground well
off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the lane, left the turn in the four path and
closed steadily to take second the final strides. SAYYESTOTHELADY raced with the pace inside and battled Windsor's Play through the backstretch,
contested the edge nearest the rail into the far turn and put that one away midway through the turn, kept the advantage through the upper stretch but was
over come mid-stretch then ceded second in the final strides. TIMETOGETUP broke in and made contact with Windsor's Play then saved ground, bid
leaving the half mile pole, closed to even terms three wide midway on the far turn but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. ELIANAGRACE raced well off the
pace about the three path on the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and bid only mildly from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the
far turn and weakened in the lane. WINDSOR'S PLAY was bumped inward and into Bays Castle leaving the gate and raced with the pace two deep, battled
Sayyestothelady through the backstretch and raced close two deep while between horses into the far turn, but dropped back midway through the turn and
weakened in the lane.

WILLOW MOON took over leaving the chute and rated a slim lead inside, rounded the turn at the rail and was kept alert in the stretch. MY LOVELY GIRL
chased inside, raced close in the three path of the turn, drifted a bit into the lane then dueled through the stretch for second. COACH RUBE chased outside
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path then outfinished in the stretch duel for place. SECRET CASTLE chased the early pace outside,
raced two deep on the turn and finished well. FANCY HER UP pressured the pace off the rail, but dropped back midway on the turn and weakened in the
stretch. SWEETONTHEGENTS engaged in close early chase, ran at the rail on the turn and flattened later yards. ASUE mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
MR HOOVER settled in the three path, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and contested even terms in the three path of the far turn, dug in leaving the
turn, took the lead later yards and raced clear approaching the wire. AUTS REVOLUTION rated with the early pace two deep then took over and showed
the way from the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, contested even terms at the rail midway on the far turn but was
caught in later yards and relented nearing the wire. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled back inside early, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and dug in leaving the turn to take third later yards. WALK THE BANK saved early ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced
in the four path of the far turn, left the turn widest and ran evenly in the lane. NIGHT BOSS stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail through the far turn then weakened into the lane. ELVIRUS raced with the pace inside, gave chase from the
nine sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. CAPE LOOKOUT hopped at the break, rounded the opening turn in the five path and never
factored.

SHOSHONI MOON rounded the first turn in the four path, rallied to the lead at the five sixteenths pole, drew off at the rail on the far turn and was steadily
handled in the lane. JAMESTOWN ROAD saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced off the rail through the far turn, then dug
in for second mid-stretch. FEEL THE LOVE became anxious in the gate and came away awkwardly, dropped well back to save ground, started a bid leaving
the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and improved enough in the lane to take third the final yards. BAHAMA PEARL stalked two deep
and took a slim lead into the backstretch, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the five sixteenths, dropped back through the
far turn and weakened in the lane. SOMEDAY IS TODAY became a bit edgy in the gate and settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced close through the backstretch then weakened in the five path of the far turn. HEIDI T set the early pace inside, was met into the
backstretch and gave chase from that point, but faded past the five sixteenths pole. MAE SAI PRINCESS became fractious in the gate, ran in the three path
the first turn and bid only mildly nearing the three eighths pole, then flattened in the three path of the far turn. LADY KAZA rated close inside on the first turn,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Jamestown Road for
alleged interference at the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Lady Kaza, though found no foul.

Footnotes
SAX settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn then dug in to pull away later
yards. SKYFLY had her heels clipped by Christine's Cosmo shortly after the break, closed to the front while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn, remained a close factor through the upper stretch but
flattened later yards. WATERLOO ROSE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled out midway on the turn and entered the
stretch six wide, then finished well to take third the final strides. DON'T TELL GRANDMA stalked from the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, angled five wide into the stretch and was outfinished in the duel for third. CHRISTINE'S COSMO
ducked outward and clipped the heels of Skyfly shortly after the start, rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but angled four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. MARKET OF STOCKS rated close off the rail, challenged
nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back two deep midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL showed little response
through the backstretch. FASHION ICON rounded the opening turn in the five path, left the turn outside and was not a factor.
