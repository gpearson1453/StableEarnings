Footnotes
SHE'S A BIT SASSY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the fractions three wide through the backstretch run, rallied leaving the quarter marker,
took a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth-marker and held her stablemate at bay in the final strides to prevail. ON VACATION rated off of the moderate pace,
saved ground to the far turn, advanced along the rail in upper stretch, battled against her stablemate in deep stretch and was bested in the final strides.
PEACEHAVEN hopped at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle in the early going, was steered outside of rivals on the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch and held safely for third in the end. FLAPS UP was sent to the early lead, set the moderate pace while prompted
through the backstretch run, extended the lead nearing the quarter pole, took a narrow lead to mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final
furlong and weakened. BIG ROSIE showed early speed and prompted the moderate fractions, kept attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker,
came in tight nearing the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. BOLD DAUGHTER stalked the early pace from the inside, lost position on the second
turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MISS EVER READY was unhurried in the early stages, mounted a four wide rally nearing the top of the lane, loomed in upper stretch, closed fast inside of
the furlong grounds and overtook MISS FLAWLESS inside of the sixteenth-marker to prevail. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) was allowed to settle early on, saved
ground to the half-mile marker, was steered three wide nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the
sixteenth-marker, could not hold off her stablemate in deep stretch and was second best in the end. MYBLUEBELL (FR) threw her head at the start and was
away a step slowly, contested the early pace then ceded the lead into the backstretch run, prompted the pace to the far turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving
the three-eighths marker, took command into the drive, could not hold off the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-marker and was well clear of the rest for third.
DEL MAR FLASH was away in good order, disputed the early pace then took back to stalk the quick fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground four
wide on the far turn and tired in the drive. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was hustled to contest the early pace, set fast fractions through the backstretch run,
was collared on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BIG CHICK bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear in the early going, improved position while along the rail on the turn, angled out in
upper stretch, gained ground inside of the furlong marker and produced a good late kick in deep stretch to prevail. GARDEES WORLD tracked the
moderate early pace from the second flight, swung four wide into upper stretch, lost position nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied while drifting out in deep
stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the late stages and stayed on well in the final strides to secure second. AUSTRIAN NAVY broke alertly and was
hustled to the early lead, set the pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was all out inside of the furlong marker, could not hold
off BIG CHICK in deep stretch and was just edged out for place in the final strides. AFTER SUNDOWN was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear to the turn,
improved position nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch and produced a mild late bid. JUMPING JILL FLASH showed early speed and
pressed the pace to the quarter marker, chased AUSTRIAN NAVY to mid-stretch and weakened late. COCOA CENTS chased the pace three then four wide
on the turn and did not offer a late rally. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL chased the early pace, came four wide into the turn, could not keep pace nearing the quarter
marker and was outrun in the stretch.

Footnotes
JACKS OUTLAW broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the lead
nearing the top of the lane, drew clear in mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from KODIACTION and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. KODIACTION
bobbled a bit at the start, was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position on the backstretch run, raced four wide nearing the quarter marker,
closed well inside of the furlong marker, put mild pressure on the winner late, could not reel that rival in in the final stages and was second best. FULL OF
LUCK (CHI) was asked to show early speed, stalked the moderate pace from the inside through the backstretch run, tipped out two wide nearing the top of
the lane, could not match strides with the top pair inside of the furlong grounds and was well clear of the rest for third. HAPI HAPI lacked early speed, saved
ground through the far turn, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals in the late stages. BRONZE WARRIOR showed early
speed, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and
tired. HUNGRY HENRY stalked the early pace from the inside, lost position along the backstretch run, was asked for a response nearing the top of the
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ZACCHEUS broke alertly and showed speed to dictate terms early on, set solid fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive,
felt late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. SGT POWELL was allowed to settle in the early stages, came two wide to
the quarter marker, tipped out in upper stretch, improved position inside of the furlong marker, closed fast in deep stretch, pressured the winner in the final
stages but could not reel that one in and held for second. SAXON SAGA broke in at the start, chased the quick early pace from the inside, was outkicked in
the stretch run and was up for show in the final strides. ZHIVAGO was away in good order, pressed the solid early fractions through the turn, chased the
winner to mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. EFFECTIVE GIG was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, came two
wide to the quarter marker, was not able to factor in the late stages but did offer a late rally. BIG DON'S SMILING was squeezed at the start and was off a
bit slowly, chased the quick early pace, ran in pursuit while three wide on the turn, lost position in mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. ACTINIUM lacked early
speed, lost position nearing the top of the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the modest pace through the backstretch run, came three wide on the far turn,
mounted a five wide rally in upper stretch, made a grinding advance through the drive, overtook the runner-up in deep stretch and proved best in the late
stages. LA REINE'S LEGACY was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions through the far turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, could not hold off the
winner in deep stretch and was second best in the end. STRIKE AT DAWN tracked the early fractions, raced outside of rivals on the second turn, swung six
wide into upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on late to secure third. LA VIKINA was away a step slowly, was hustled to be close up while
three wide into the first turn, stalked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, chased the pacesetter to
mid-stretch, gave way in deep stretch and was edged for show in the final stages. SCHERZO (GB) was allowed to settle, raced off of the rail into the second
turn, gained ground in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. ISOLA MIA was bumped at the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the
early pace from the inside, raced in the second flight to the second turn, came in tight leaving the three furlong marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
weakened in deep stretch. SHEZAGHOST traded bumps with ISOLA MIA leaving the break, settled off of the early pace while saving ground and was not a
threat in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MR BOTANICALS was bothered at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to track the pace from the inside through the backstretch run, came in tight
along the far turn, tipped out leaving the quarter marker, confronted QUE SERA SIR RALPH in upper stretch, overtook that rival and held in a drive inside of
the sixteenth-marker. QUE SERA SIR RALPH broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace while carving out moderate fractions
through the half-mile marker, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch, could not hold off MR BOTANICALS nearing the furlong grounds, stayed on
well in the late stages and held for place in the end. ROISTER was forwardly placed in the early going, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the second turn, lost ground four wide in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the eighth pole and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for
show in the final strides. TAM'S TIME was allowed to settle, was never far back while unhurried to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, made
a mild late bid and challenged for show in the final strides. LOVE OF THE SPORT was away in good order, prompted the moderate pace to the second turn
and gave way in the stretch. THUNDER OF ZION rated off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, raced outside of rivals to the second
turn, came five wide to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
ALTHEA GIBSON broke alertly, took back to track the quick early pace, raced two wide in pursuit of the dueling pacesetters nearing the top of the lane,
gained ground three wide in upper stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, overtook LOTSA PEPPER in the late stages and edged away in
the final strides. HOT RAGEOUS was crowded at the break and was away a step slowly, chased from the inside through the turn, made a quick move in
upper stretch, continued that advance in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was up for second in the final strides. LOTSA
PEPPER was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, showed good speed while setting fast fractions, was pressed through the turn, shook clear
in upper stretch, could not hold off the quickly oncoming winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and was just edged for second in the final strides. LALIC (FR)
chased the early pace from the second flight, raced outside of rivals on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and closed willingly in the final sixteenth.
TIGER QUEEN was shuffled back at the start, chased from the rear through the turn, came two wide to the top of the lane, improved position in the final
stages but did not offer the needed late response. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU was outrun in the early going, trailed through the turn, angled out inside of the
furlong marker, showed good late interest but was unable to threaten the leaders in the final stages. DANCING CRANE was forwardly placed in the early
going, lost position on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. BOSSY MAMA showed good early speed, pressed the fast pace
to the quarter marker, lost ground leaving the turn, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages. LA AGUILILLA chased the pace from
the second flight, came four wide into upper stretch, lost position nearing the furlong grounds and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
O B'S was content to race mid-pack while early, made a bold, sweeping move while still wide around the turn, swung out even wider at the top of the
stretch, collared RUNNING ON FIRE passing the eighth pole and drew off under a brisk hand ride. RUNNING ON FIRE off a step slow, was hustled gain the
rail position and the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch where he was met by a host of challengers to his outside and was able to out-finish all but the
winner in a game effort. CHILLY WILLY last early, started a sustain bid from the half-mile pole, swung six-wide into the stretch and finished well, gaining
third by the narrowest of margins. SPECIAL MOMENT was away a bit slowly, angled over to the inside into the turn, was asked to pick up the pace through
the turn, swung six-wide into the stretch, briefly encountered some traffic and was gaining ground in the end and was just nipped for third. IMPACT ZONE
away in good order, gradually made his way to the rail down the backstretch, was making some forward progress approaching the top of the stretch but was
stuck behind a wall of horses, did not have the needed response when asked. CODIS BREAKER broke best, gained the lead briefly, then allowed
RUNNING ON FIRE to take over while the rider adjusted his left stirrup, still in close pursuit launched a bid in tandem with MURLOC BAY from the
five-sixteenths pole, advanced to the flank of the leader at the head of the stretch but tired in the final furlong. MURLOC BAY broke well and was up close
early while under some restraint, was let loose passing the five-sixteenths pole, moved with and to the outside of CODIS BREAKER to challenge the leader
got within striking distance but couldn't sustain the bid and was outfinished in the final stages. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE was a little slow into stride, angled
over to the rail after the break, fell well behind the field through the first quarter mile, was roused by her rider passing the half-mile marker, made some
gradual progress to gain some ground but was never a threat.
