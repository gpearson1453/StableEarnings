Footnotes
TAPITURE WAY settled patiently near the rear down the backside, waited behind the chasing pack entering the turn, weaved her way through horses
nearing the quarter pole to bid three wide at the top of the stretch, took command at the furlong marker to draw away convincingly at the wire. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER trailed the field from the onset, rallied inside turning for home, shifted out off tiring runners to be in the three path for clear run at the eighth pole
and finished up well besting the rest. SWEET EDITION travelled four wide outside foes on the turn tracking the early pacesetter, was in range in upper
stretch four wide for the drive and showed late energy to close in for the show award the final sixteenth. SNEAKY REBEL tracked in the second flight
between rivals three furlongs to the finish, was asked for more midpoint on the turn, poked her nose in front in upper stretch and faded between challengers
in deep stretch settling for a minor share. LETS RUN TWO showed good speed leaving the chute to lead down the backstretch, continued to dictate the
pace on the turn, was collared outside three sixteenths from the line, offered little resistance and retreated in deep stretch. VERI UNIFIED was eager
tracking behind the frontrunner at the half, waited on the rail for running room on the turn, shifted just outside at the quarter marker for her stretch run but
offered little response down the lane. CLIFF'S HEAD travelled three wide in the tracking flight through the turn, was steadied while under urging amongst
runners nearing the quarter pole and was not a factor afterwards. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #5 CLIFFS HEAD AGINST #1 TAPITURE WAY NEARING

Footnotes
ALPHA MIA showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside of Bayou Belle, challenged through the far turn, dug in deep stretch and prevailed
under all out pressure. BILLYJANE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide through the far turn and just missed in a game effort.
DANGER rated off the early pace, raced two deep between rivals near the five sixteenths pole, shifted out five wide near the quarter pole and rallied gamely
to the wire. BAYOU BELLE pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. STARLIGHT RIDGE settled off the early
going, angled widest through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. CARELESS HEIRESS settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside
and lacked a rally. BOBBI'S LEGACY was unhurried early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. GIZMO'S B F F was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on and faded while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
FOXY DIVA inched closer to the frontrunners entering the backstretch, then was taken back at the half to track the engaging leaders, was roused three wide
at the quarter pole and wore down the stubborn pacesetter in deep stretch for the victory. GENEVA broke sharp to lead the field into the first turn, was
pressed outside for the top spot down the backstretch, put away her early pace rival in upper stretch, braced for challengers the final sixteenth and just lost
out at the wire in a gutsy front running effort. TARA LUNA travelled four wide in the early stages, rallied around rivals four wide midway on the far turn,
shifted out in the five path for the stretch drive and was gaining steadily on the leaders in the end. HIGH TREASON was reserved on the rail in the
beginning, trailed inside at the half, crept closer on the fence three furlongs from the finish, angled out in the four path between horses and showed late
interest the final sixteenth getting up for a small share. MARDENE rated kindly just behind the contesting leaders at the half mile marker, waited while well in
hand inside on the far turn, could not really find clear running room through the stretch and only offered an even finish. REES broke inwards to start,
pressed for the lead outside down the backstretch, continued to force the issue on the far turn, weakened between runners at the furlong marker and tired
nearing the finish line. SHEZ A SEALY travelled three wide into the first turn, settled near the back through the backside, trailed the pack into the far turn
and was never interested through the lane. INTRO was brushed at the start, tracked between runners just behind the pacesetters at the half, was ridden for
more three eighths to go, lost positions racing through the far turn and was not involved through the stretch.

Footnotes
STOLEN MONEY showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear late under steady pressure. SPRING
MOUNTAIN settled to race mid pack early on, moved up five wide past the three sixteenths pole and rallied for the place position late. PINK GELATO
settled off the early going, moved up four wide into the upper stretch to challenge for the early lead and finished willingly to the wire. FREE SHIPPING was
unhurried early on, raced along the inside near the three eighths pole, angled five wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. GRAND GIZMO
rated along the inside, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. TUFF RAGS was slow early, raced along
the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. HARDWARE GAP was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into
the upper stretch and lacked a rally. STRONGER TOGETHER raced mid pack early, was five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
AGILE DANCER dropped back early, ridden near the half mile pole, raced from the outside of rivals while racing five wide near the quarter pole and lacked
a bid. BROADWAY SKY stalked the pace while racing between horses, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and weakened. CROONER tracked the
pace from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO was part of the tracking trio in the beginning stages, took closer order to the loose leader inside at the half, was urged to go on
with a quarter remaining, caught up to the lone speed frontrunner outside with a sixteenth left and determinedly was inching away at the wire. DIOSA
CATRINA was away alertly to dictate the pace in the early stages, continued to be loose on the lead through the far turn, was headed by the winner in deep
stretch and battled on stubbornly late only to give way grudgingly just before the finish line. AGENDA settled near the rear early on, was roused on the fence
entering the far turn, advanced nicely inside at the quarter marker, shifted out three wide for the drive between runners and finished up to be a non
threatening third. SILENT DIVA could see them all through the first turn and backstretch, began to pick up rivals three eighths out, circled foes four wide two
furlongs from the line and finished evenly through the lane to settle on the fringes. MY GIRL GABBY rallied at the half following the rail path of the eventual
winner, made a good move midpoint on the far turn up the fence to take third place into the stretch and stalled losing positions the final sixteenth. PANIC
SWITCH stalked mid pack between challengers at the half, was shuffled on the far turn to trail and could only rally to pass tiring rivals down the stretch.
READY TO ORBIT was allowed to sit near the back in the beginning, offered no movement racing down the backstretch and could not make a presence for
the stretch drive. QUEEN'S IMAGE was five wide going into the first turn, was part of the second flight chasing the lone speed down the backside, was
ridden for more at the quarter pole and had nothing to give for the stretch drive. ONLY AT MIDNITE was situated in the middle of the pack all alone racing at
the half, offered a mild move entering the second turn and retreated with five sixteenths left to run. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR chased the leader through the
backstretch, was roused to keep up with the leaders on the far turn between rivals, gave way two furlongs to the wire and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROSEBUD'S HOPE stalked the pace along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, shifted five wide near the quarter pole and finished well to be clear
under strong handling. MILLIE GIRL settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished
second best. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE settled to race mid pack early, saved ground around the far turn into the stretch and moved up to improve position.
BIG BAND LUZZIANN was quick to begin to set the early pace and gave way. GLORIANNIA was rated to race in hand early while racing just off the inside
and faded in the stretch drive. SWEET SERENADE was unhurried early, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and lacked a rally. CRYSTAL GLACIER
dropped to the back of the pack early, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. READY LADY raced three wide near
the five sixteenths pole and had no rally while racing from the outside in the drive. The fourth internal fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
VANTARSI took command soon after the break, opened up on the field through the turn, was unchallenged turning for home and won comfortably in the
end. MAGIC RIDE trailed early while reserved on the rail, was roused at the three furlong marker, began to pass runners inside through the turn and slipped
up the fence at the furlong marker besting the rest at the finish. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL raced in the middle of the pack down the backside, was urged
running two wide at the top of the stretch and closed determinedly between horses to get up for the show award nearing the finish. REGAL REALM steadied
at the gap leaving the chute in the beginning, recovered to sit in a good tracking position into the turn, rallied with two furlongs left to offer a mild bid at the
top of the stretch and tired very late holding onto a small award at the line. TWISTER ALERT was off a bit slow on the break, travelled in midfield inside with
three eighths left to run, shifted out four wide at the quarter pole and finished up with intent on the wrong lead through the stretch to be involved for the
minors in the end. SPIDER BELLE broke in at the start, stalked close to the back of the field between foes down the backstretch, angled inside to the fence
for the stretch run and finished with interest weaving passed rivals running to the wire. QUINTE ROAD trailed the pack through turn and could only find
enough to pass stopping competitors down the lane. MARAIS was allowed to settle near the back in the early running, was ridden on the turn, could not
reach contention in upper stretch and was a non factor to the line. BAKSHEESH tracked just outside in a good spot running at the half, was asked for more
run three eighths to the finish, had nothing to offer on the turn and backed away through the stretch. I HAVE AN IDEA chased the winner in the early stages,
began to weaken in the two path at the top of the stretch and stopped the final sixteenth.

KATE'S KINGDOM was unhurried early on to race near the back of the pack early, made an advance through the far turn, raced along the rail past the
quarter pole, angled five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. OUR FLASH DRIVE stalked the early pace
while racing near the inside, checked approaching the half mile pole, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole, led inside the sixteenth pole but
couldn't hold off the winner in a game effort. BROADWAY LADY raced mid pack early, checked nearing the half mile pole, raced five to six wide into the
upper stretch and gained ground to improve position. DREAMING OF DREW pressed the early leader from the outside of rival and weakened in the drive.

early on, raced three to two wide in the lane and lacked a rally. SILENT CAUSEWAY stalked the pace while racing three deep and faded in the drive.
ALYDIVA settled off the early going, raced five wide near the quarter pole while racing outside of rivals and lacked a bid. PEACE SEEKER was forced to
check in the early going, raced with the second flight, saved ground to the quarter pole and never threatened. SUPER CHIANTI was forced to take up in the

Footnotes
EVER SO D'WILD was in a good position behind the engaging trio down the backside, had to wait momentarily inside three furlongs to the finish, angled out
four wide for the stretch run and found her best stride late to get up for the victory just before the wire. SPARKLE SAMMY waited behind the contesting co
leaders three furlongs to the finish, bid for the lead between runners in mid stretch, got her nose in front in the shadow of the wire and was caught by the
closing winner right at the line. TAKE IT EASY was steadied briefly at the nine sixteenths pole, rallied around foes midway on the turn, loomed four wide at
the top of the stretch and needed a little more late in a close photo for the top placings. SILENT GUROO dueled for the lead outside in the early stages, put
away her speed rival at the top of the lane, dug in with an eighth to go with runners on either side and was outkicked in deep stretch. SASSY MARTINI
angled inwards saving ground on the turn while racing mid pack, was roused inside for the drive to the wire and could only finish up evenly to be a non
threat in the end. MY FINAL TRICK dueled for the lead on the rail into the turn, continued to battle inside at the top of the stretch, fought on stubbornly until
the sixteenth marker and tired nearing the wire. MRS. DEL stalked near the back in the beginning stages, was four wide for the drive, took closer order to
the field down the lane but could not gain any position at the finish. FEDALIA settled behind most runners into the turn, angled five wide for a stretch run and
could not make an impact running the the finish line. MISS BOBBIT could not keep up with the pack down the backside, trailed on the turn and could not get
into contention running to the wire.

Footnotes
CALL ME BROOKE broke in, bumped at the start, rated in the early stages, moved up three wide into the upper stretch, had a narrow advantage near the
quarter pole and prevailed late under strong handling. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was squeezed back at the break, raced off the early going, experienced traffic
near the five sixteenths pole, split rivals nearing the sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire while racing four wide. SHE'S SO COLD broke to the
outside, raced with the second flight early, moved up from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and closed in well late. T'PRING stalked the
pace from the outside, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. ORIGINAL ME stalked the pace along the inside, continued an
inside bid near the quarter pole, experienced traffic near the eighth pole and raced evenly with no final winning bid. GYPSY MAGIC settled off the early
going, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position late. SO BREANNA showed good early foot from the outside to set the
early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LILLZ HOPE was slow early, raced four wide around the far turn, fanned eight wide into the upper
stretch and had not enough. STOLE THE RING was coaxed along early and faded. SHES LOADED was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide near the
three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. SKIPOVER was unhurried early on, raced six deep near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. P. S. RISING STAR
raced with the second flight early on and failed to respond. BEST BANK SHOT dropped back early and showed little. MEETING AT MARTHAS raced far
back while being eased up on late.
