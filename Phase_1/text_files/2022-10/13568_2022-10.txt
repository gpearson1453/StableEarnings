Footnotes
MALAKAI MOXIE away well and led along the inside, pressed by rival on the backstretch through half the turn, shook free entering the stretch and
responded to rider in the lane to edge away. ELUSIVE VIRTUE broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked contested pace in between rivals on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and launched rally along the inside to be second best. HIGHLY DISTORTED stalked pace three wide on the
backstretch, traveled nicely on the turn advancing four wide, entered stretch in range and failed to kick on with top two while holding show. SURPLUS
bumped by inside rival at the start, asked for speed early, settled for a chasing three wide trip, continued three wide, in range in the lane and gave way
under urging the final sixteenth. COJO stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to respond when
asked the question in the lane. CHIEF EAGLE EYE broke a step slow, rushed up to press pace two wide on the backstretch, continued pressing the issue
entering the turn, began to weaken midway through the turn and prove no threat in the lane.
