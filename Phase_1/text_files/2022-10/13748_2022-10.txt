RAIN LILLY dueled for the early lead outside of HIGH CLASS DIVA, disposed of that rival on the turn and drew out by the quarter pole, then put this field to
bed leaving the turn and was ridden out while drawing off impressively. DUST BUNNY stalked the early pace and came four wide into the drive and proved
to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HIGH CLASS DIVA stumbled at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened, bested
rest. MIMI'S GOLD was sandwiched at the start, failed to menace. SOULSTONE chased the pace three to four wide and was empty.
