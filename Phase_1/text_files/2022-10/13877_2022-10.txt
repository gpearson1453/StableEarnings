Footnotes
KATHAAN settled back at the rear, raced at the inside of the rear flight around the first turn, continued patiently down the bakc straight, swung out into the
far turn, circled three to four wide around that bend, swept four wide into the lane, drove to the lead past the three sixteenths and cleared while drifting out.
MISS KITTY PIE tracked the leading pair early, tracked the leading trio down the back straight, was pushed along at the inside of the tracking flight around
the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and bumped PERFECTLY PROUD, chased on willingly and proved second best.
PERFECTLY PROUD chased midpack, raced two wide down the backstretch and between horses on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, was
bumped by MISS KITTY PIE in upper stretch when that foe came out, and chased on mildly for the show. PRADA'S MIRACLE was herded in early as a
result of SURE SHOT ANNIE breaking inward, raced between horses in the rear flight on the first turn, continued near the rear down the back straight and in
the three path on the far turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch and chased on mildly. TANGO CITY was squeezed back in the opening strides
and steadied, settled near the rear outside of PRADA'S MIRACLE early, raced three wide in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn, pulled keenly three
wide into the backstretch and attended outside the leading pair, settled back to track the leading pair near the five eighths, raced three wide in the tracking
flight around the far turn, bid again three wide approaching the quarter, but proved no match for KATHAAN near the three sixteenths and flattened out.
SURE SHOT ANNIE broke inward, prompted outside of SUMMER SWINGER early, advanced to press the pace between into the backstretch, continued to
vie outside SUMMER SWINGER around the far turn and into the lane, was no match from near the three sixteenths and weakened. SUMMER SWINGER
was reluctant to load, was prompted by SURE SHOT ANNIE early, vied inside of that foe down the back straight, around the far turn, and into the lane, was
no match past the three sixteenths and emptied out inside.

REDNECKERTHANYOU swerved in sharply leaving the gate crossing over the path of KING TITO bumping that rival, was righted, then urged three deep
through the backstretch to gain terms with the pacesetter entering the bend, pressed the issue outside that rival through the bend, kicked clear in upper
stretch, drifted out late under pressure but held sway on a safe margin. THE BOSS FACTOR broke outwards bumping MY BOBBY MCGEE, was righted to
track off the second flight racing to the turn, steadily gained position four wide racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. KREWE CHIEF,
bumped at the start, settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch gathering momentum and made
belated progress to gain a share. SAHM TEQUILA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the bend, then continued evenly into the
stretch. PACHI, caught six deep in the opening stages, was urged to gain a contending position four wide in second flight racing into the turn, but faded into
the lane. MY BOBBY MCGEE, bumped, then pinched back at the start, settled last to the turn and passed some tiring rivals late. WINGING WAYS broke
outwards bumping KING TITO, was righted, then urged between foes setting the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled inside a rival
racing into the turn and gave way midstretch. KING TITO, bumped, then cut off at the start, angled to the inside tracking behind the second flight and faded
into the stretch. TURN THE SWITCH was urged along the inside prompting the pace in the opening quarter but gave way early.

Footnotes
KENNESAW broke inward, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and offered a bid,
led approaching the furlong mark, vied outside of TAPE TO TAPE and proved best. TAPE TO TAPE disputed the pace two wide, race into the lane two wide
between horses, was engaged by KENNESAW in upper stretch, was headed by that foe midstretch, fought on past the sixteenth inside of the new leader
but did not have enough in the final strides. LAKE MILLS tracked the leading trio, chased well off the leading trio while saving ground around the turn, swung
four wide into the lane and was driven, and chased on for the show. TOM'S LAST GENERAL chased between horses early, continued three wide on the
turn, swung seven wide under a drive into upper stretch, and offered a belated rally. TALKTOEACHOTHER disputed the pace inside of TAPE TO TAPE
down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was no match from the three sixteenths and flattened inside. CYCLONE ATTACK was held up at the
rear early, raced in the four path on the turn, floated into the lane eight wide and chased on mildly. READTHETRANSCRIPT chased inside early, raced
along the rail toward the rear on the turn, was driven in the two path into the lane and offered a mild bid, and flattened out. FLEET OF HOOF chased four
wide early, was pushed along for a brief bid into the turn, raced three wide between around the bend, began to flatten out from the three eighths and
continued to flatten in the lane. MAGIC MONDAY was very keen early, veered out on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and was empty.

Footnotes
WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW, bumped, then taken up at the start, was switched outside rivals in the opening stages while being prompted to gain contention
nearing the bend, made a steady advance three deep on the turn to gain terms with the leaders in upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage nearing
the wire under firm right handed encouragement. LUCKY SHOT, restless in the gate, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into
the turn, then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end while just failing to contain that rival. TEE BURNS, prominent three deep in the opening stages,
angled inwards nearing the turn to press the issue outside a rival through the bend, dueled between foes into upper stretch and weakened late.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY broke sharply to race on terms with the first flight between foes, was eased off the pace after the opening furlong while switching
out nearing the turn to track the leaders three wide, swung out to the five path entering upper stretch while being prompted to advance but finished evenly
late. MON AMI FUZZIE broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was settled while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and improved
position inside foes late. COCO BRAVADO tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch but faded in late stages.
ALPINE GHOST tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. O DOGG trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
RAP STAR, bumped at the start, was urged to gain a narrow advantage between foes in the opening stages dictating the pace, shifted to the inside entering
the turn dueling for command inside a rival, edged forward of that foe along the inside entering the lane and held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. GARBO SPEAKS, forwardly placed while angling to the inside in the opening stages to track just off the pacesetter into the turn, tipped out
three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a willing effort to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. JITTERS prompted the pace
three deep between foes through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner, then between foes into upper stretch, couldn't match the
winner late and just missed for second. CAIRO SUMMER tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and
finished evenly in late stages. MINI DRESS bobbled at the start, was righted to make some progress four wide to gain terms with the second flight racing
into the turn, but flattened out in the drive. VOODOO FIRE broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was settled between foes in the last flight early,
swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but made no impact. IRISH HALO settled inside foes in the last flight in the opening stages, was prompted to
advance while tipping out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. ZENCHUA SKY, reserved between foes in the last flight on the backstretch, failed
to menace thereafter. SENORITA AURORA broke slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN broke sharply, made brief pursuit of the
leaders four wide on the backstretch, then shifted inwards and gave way abruptly racing into the turn.

Footnotes
WESTA WAVERLY broke sharply, was urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm right
handed encouragement. TWO COOKIE RULE tracked the leaders outside rivals four deep in second flight early, dropped back from that position into the
turn, then shifted out four wide in the stretch producing his best stride late to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. ART HEIST, slow to gather
stride, angled inwards racing behind the second flight into the turn, gained position between foes racing through the stretch and was just outkicked for
second. TODDLES tracked the leaders inside foes racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but came up empty late. FINAL CALL settled
last along the inside racing to the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and improved his position with a belated rally. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE settled
between foes in the last flight in the opening furlong, then angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. PO BOY
tracked off the first flight three wide between foes, then outside a rival into the bend, was fanned five wide into the stretch and steadily faded. JUST RIGHT
MIKE, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half. NEW DICE, brushed rivals at the start, then
was reserved while shifting nearer the inside and dropped out early.

settled between foes in the opening stages, then angled nearer the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to race four deep between foes in upper stretch
and continued with interest to gain position to the end. OUTRUN THE POSSE settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned five wide racing into the
stretch but continued with an effort to improve position. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out three
