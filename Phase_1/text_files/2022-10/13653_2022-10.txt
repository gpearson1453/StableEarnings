Footnotes
SON OF LIBERTY set the pace on the inside, showed the way racing with a clear lead, responded when roused turning for home, drew off and widened
under urging. SILK WAR tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and earned the place spot.
EQUALJUSTICEFORALL bobbled at the break and was bumped, raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail.
CHANGING THE KARMA trailed the field, advanced outside rivals on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. CHENTI raced off
the pace between rivals, chased between horses on the far turn and lacked a rally. ANVIL stalked the pacesetter, chased that rival on the far turn, came
three wide into the lane and weakened. AMERICAN DAY was bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the far turn and
weakened. BUSHWICK BRUISER was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, moved up four wide on the backside, continued four wide on the far turn
and tired. RACE WAS HAND TIMED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
