SPECTACULAR KID alternated for the lead along the inside and proved empty late. INDIRECTLY dropped back early then narrowed the gap while no
threat. NINE TOE JOHNNY prompted the pace four wide to the five sixteenths and faded. NICE OF ME trailed early then passed rivals wide without
menacing. EXPENSIVE dropped back after the start inside and gave way. E T'S SUPER STAR chased very wide and was never in contention. CURRENT

SPLITZVILLE broke slowest, advanced inside, angled out rallying in the lane and edged clear through the final furlong. LARGE far behind early, split rivals
rallying and closed well too late. WIZARD SERRAT lacked speed, moved along the inside and finished willingly. BIRD RULER stalked the pacesetters three
wide, bid on the turn then flattened out. JADE'S DREAM chased very wide then offered a mild rally while no threat. VERO SUN lagged far behind then
passed rivals too late. J WASS vied along the inside, weakened in the stretch and appeared difficult to handle late. MR. TUTTLE raced off the leaders then
moved very wide in the stretch. GIVE ME TWO STEPS was urged outside down the backstretch and gave way. D BLACK MAMBA chased far behind
throughout. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN earned a narrow advantage outside for half a mile then stopped.

stretch. VEESON chased inside then showed some late energy outside. BLUE ROYAL steadied along into the far turn, was taken up sharply at the three
eighths pole then moved wide. DESTIN'S MISSION battled the winner along the inside to the stretch and faltered. PRAETORIAN GUARD was taken up
soon after the start, chased wide and was no factor. KIDMAN KERRY raced extremely wide down the backstrerch and stopped. BOY IS IT HOT broke
slowly and raced far behind throughout. MUDDY DROP KID broke slowly and was never in contention. A claim of foul by the rider of BLUE ROYAL against

PREDOMINATE settled well back, advanced wide, collared the pacesetter late and was just up nearing the wire. SENSIBLE JIM vied outside, took over on
the final turn, was challenged again from his outside and continued well in a game try. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX settled behind the dueling leaders, loomed a
stretch threat but was outfinished. STAFF SERGEANT stumbled badly at the break, raced wide and weakened late. SOCIAL JOE dropped back early then
passed rivals without threatening. STELLA'S TOUR moved closer very wide on the final turn then gave way. BUSTIN UP alternated for advantage inside
then stopped on the final turn. FACTUM LOVE STYLE dropped far behind and was always outrun. OLD BEAU saved ground within striking range then
stopped.

MY BROTHER NEIL settled inside the pacesetters, angled out rallying into the stretch, wore down the pacesetter then bid clear. LORD JAXSTON controlled
the pace then shortened stride in the final furlong. PORSUPUESTO moved closer three wide before half a mile then flattened out lane. CAIRO BOOGIE
trailed initial half a mile then passed fading rivals. FROZEN FUNDS urged close up between rivals down the backstretch then gave way. STILL THE ONE
forced the pace briefly outside then gave way readily. CHAIN REACTION raced very wide off the pacesetters and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DIDINGER set the pace near the inside, vied through the final turn, shook loose when ready into the stretch and pulled away handily while being geared
down late. RYAN'S FLEET fanned five wide on the first turn, dueled with the winner through the final turn but proved no match in the stretch. ONE BITE
raced close up three wide and continued well while no threat. COWBOY JIM saved ground prompting the leader briefly then faltered. THE BEARRISH ONE
chased three wide then angled inside and lacked a solid rally. FIERCE AND STRONG chased very wide down the backstretch and weakened. HOT LOVE
prompted the leaders for half a mile and faded. CHECKITUP lacked speed, was put to urging before half a mile and was no factor. SKYHOOK was in tight
entering the backstretch and always far back. MODERN ERA lost contact with his field early then caught fading rivals. SON OF A BUCK dropped back early
and was far behind throughout. BATTUTA D'ORO firmly rated off the pacesetters and stopped abruptly.

BEREN controlled the fractions inside, repelled challenges then edged away under steady encouragement. PRINCE OF RAIN trailed for half a mile inside,
angled out on the turn and closed well for the place. SMOOTH B prompted the winner to the stretch, tired but continued willingly. FINAL SHOT saved
ground close up for half a mile and weakened. WAIT FOR IT raced very wide throughout and lacked a response. EAGLES CRY broke very slowly, rushed to
contention inside then faded. BOURBON MUSIC was urged just off the pace three wide and stopped.
