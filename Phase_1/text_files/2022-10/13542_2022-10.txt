Footnotes
DAVID'S GEM laid off of the pace in the three path, gained between horses in midstretch before tipping outside of the leading quartet a sixteenth from
home, and surged to reel in those tiring rivals nearing the wire. SOUNION bumped with outer rivals soon after the start, chased two wide and between
horses into the turn, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the lane, failed to truly progress in midstretch, but inched closer in the final furlong as the
leaders tired, bid entering the final sixteenth as an outer DAVID'S GEM took aim, and was outkicked by that foe in the closing stages. HOOPLA bumped
with inner foes in the opening stages, set the pace inside of a pair of hounding rivals into the turn, briefly failed to keep pace with them entering the lane,
fought on to attempt a rebid in midstretch, vied into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late. GLORY SONG vied for the lead two wide and between
horses, sustained the duel through midstretch, but faltered late. ALFIE SOLOMONS pressed three wide, vied around the turn, dueled through the lane, but
yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. MAKE NOISE got bumped by rivals on either side while put to tight quarters soon after the start, laid off of the
pace in the two path, altered to the six path in upper stretch, and lacked a kick. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER tracked four wide, got floated five wide entering the
lane, but lacked a bid before yielded between horses in midstretch. WITH VERVE laid close up along the inside, chased under urging to sustain that position
around the turn, but faded. DIRECT ORDER backed out from tight quarters after receiving bumps from rivals on either side soon after the start, then trailed,
and surpassed a tiring rival alte. HIGHER AUTHORITY laid in midpack five wide and outside of rivals, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SHE'S ALL CLASS bumped with an outer rival at the start, sparred for the lead two wide, forged advantage into the turn, drew away from her inner
counterpart entering the lane, and maintained a clear margin under driving pressure through the late stages. MAGICAL ACT was slow into stride and lagged
behind the field leaving the chute, tugged between horses down the backstretch after rejoining the field, improved before tucking to the rail turning for home,
swung to the five path for clear sailing entering the lane, grinded away through midstretch, shifted out in the final furlong to maneuver around a drifting
GUNESH, and stayed on late while gaining on the clear leader. GUNESH dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, sustained vying position after
being headed entering the turn, but gave way entering the lane, and weakened while gradually drifting out. THE GANG THAT SANG took a bump from
rivals on both sides at the start, raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, chased the top pair under urging around the turn, shifted outside of
GUNESH entering the lane in hopes of bidding for place, altered course inside of that rival at the furlong grounds while trying to sustain that charge, but
flattened out in the final sixteenth. MISREAD laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide approaching the three furlong pole, then to the six path
entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. SEABROOK raced at the rear three wide, and made little impact. CRYSTAL SNOW chased while close up along the
inside, but weakened entering the turn. SCRIPPS bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
KEY OF LIFE pressed two wide, vied into the turn, gained an advantage turning for home, then kicked away when set down in upper stretch. TWICE AS
SWEET steadied slightly when altering course outside of an inwardly shifting KEY OF LIFE after a sixteenth of a mile, chased from outside of the top pair,
got brushed out a path by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, took aim on a leading aforementioned foe in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with
him nearing midstretch, and remained clear of show. BAYTOWN LOVELY tracked in midpack in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, and
stayed on. RIBBONSINHERHAIR raced in midpack in the two path, then chased between horses without menacing. LOOKING FOR HOPE stalked along
the inside, brushed an outer rival while attempting a bid three wide and between horses turning for home, but faded in upper stretch. CRACKALACKING set
the pace inside of a vying rival into the turn, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and weakened. KARMA GHIA raced far back two wide and between
horses, and made little impact. SANTA FE GOLD bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. MURSAL broke a beat slowly, trailed
three wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MARK OF THE Z stalked two wide, bid outside of the leader at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. JOHNNY UNLEASHED set a clear pace, dug in to
resist MARK OF THE Z's bid in midstretch, but proved no match for that foe a sixteenth from home, and lasted for place. BE HERE took a mild bump from
an inner foe soon after the start, tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, then stayed on, but failed to reach a tiring
rival for place late. THERIDEOFALIFETIME stalked along the inside, but failed to gain while tipping off of the rail in midstretch, and lacked a bid. STRIKE
ME DOWN tracked three wide, got floated to the five path entering the lane, but offered no rally. ROBO MAN broke a beat slow, ,trailed three wide, but
steadied in upper stretch when an outer CASANOVA KITTEN drifted across her path, and failed to factor. JOKER ON JACK bumped an outer rival soon
after the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and made little impact. CASANOVA KITTEN tossed her head while hopping at the start,
raced in midpack four wide and outside of foes around the turn, failed to keep pace turning for home, then drifted inwardly in upper stretch while weakening.
TORONTOTORO saved ground off of the pace, brushed the fence in upper stretch, and was outrun.

Footnotes
OLGA ISABEL set the pace in the three path, bore out to the six path entering the lane to float an outer JAG WARRIOR wider, held sway from that, now
inner, bidding foe through midstretch, flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth, shifted a bit inwardly in the late stages while not making
contact with her inner sparring counterpart, and held. JAG WARRIOR stalked outside of the leader and in the four path, ranged up under a drive turning for
home, got floated to the seven path by that rival entering the, tipped inside of that foe while changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, kept on to produce a
rebid entering the final sixteenth, dueled through the late stages, but failed to reach even terms. CODE FOR SUCCESS laid off of the pace in the four path,
and rallied through midstretch to reach show at the sixteenth pole. FAST AND FLIRTY sat reserved in the two path, awaited racing room turning for home,
fanned to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong. BEGUINE stalked while forwardly placed two wide and between horses, chased
the outer leading pair through upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. STREET JAM bumped an outer rival at the nine sixteenths pole before faltering
between horses soon after, raced far back in the three path, trailed turning for home, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on. MISS MATTIE
B trailed, took the turn in the four path, and moved up. GOLDEN SIGHTS tracked in midpack in the two path, then from between horses entering the lane,
but tired. NOSILVERSPOONSHERE bumped with rivals on either side at the nine sixteenths pole, raced off of the pace in the three path into the turn, but
yielded between horses at the three furlong pole. RING ME DARLING took a minor nudge from an inner foe at the nine sixteenths pole while setting in
midpack three wide, and tired. TOWSER stalked along the inside, then weakened at the three furlong pole. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, AS
WELL AS A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF JAG WARRIOR VS. OLGA ISABEL FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE LANE AND IN DEEP STRETCH;
OLGA ISABEL WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
WELAKA vied two wide and between horses, led from an outer vying DAKOTA RUN while a bit off of the inner railing around the turn, got narrowly headed
by that foe tuning for home, fought back to regain an advantage in upper stretch, and drifted a bit outwardly while gamely clinging to a margin through the
late stages. DAKOTA RUN broke outwardly, vied three wide and between horses, sustained sparring position outside of WELAKA while in the three path
around the turn, gained a narrow advantage turning for home, but was re-headed by his inner counterpart in upper stretch, drifted out subtly while fighting on
in midstretch, but was kept at bay late. MOBSTER vied along the inside of a pair of foes, but failed to keep pace with them into the turn, faltered turning for
home, but regained stride in upper stretch, and stayed on to reclaim show from an outer foe nearing the wire. COLLIER'S TIME was bumped and pinched
back between horses at the start, lagged behind the field in the three path around the turn, shifted to the seven path in midstretch, and offered a belated
charge. GOLDEN BANDIT stumbled and veered in at the start, stalked in the two path, then failed to progress on the leading pair through the lane before
tiring and losing show to an inner foe late. MY UNCLE LEON broke a step slowly before shying from an outer rival at the start, then saved ground far back,
but to no avail. Z Z'S PRINCE chased in midpack three wide, then faded in the four path around the turn. SIR bobbled at the start, raced far back three to
two wide, and made little impact. IRONSIDES prompted the pace four wide, chased the leaders into the turn, then weakened nearing the lane. LIBERTY'S
HAULER raced at the rear two wide and between horses, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MANNY WAH trailed, launched a rally three wide entering the lane, surged between horses while tipping in for clear racing room in midstretch, sustained a
bid while getting herded to the rail approaching the final sixteenth, dueled with an outer LONG RANGE TODDY through the late stages, and prevailed.
LONG RANGE TODDY pressed three wide, chased the top pair under entering entering the turn, shifted inside of a clear and drifting TOP GUNNER at the
furlong grounds, produced a bid along with an inner MANNY WAH in the final sixteenth, sparred with that foe to the wire, but was bested. TOP GUNNER
vied for the lead two wide, drew clear in upper stretch after his inner counterpart faltered, but drifted out at the furlong grounds, met a pair of inner bids a
sixteenth later, and was bested by them in the closing stages. SIBELIUS tracked four wide, then chased evenly through the lane. BAYTOWN BEAR tracked
in midpack two wide, tucked to the rail into the turn, then chased the leaders through midstretch, got outkicked by a pair of outer bidders entering the final
sixteenth, and yielded. NECKER ISLAND raced far back two wide, got outkicked while three wide in midstretch, and moved up. SIR ALFRED JAMES
tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position into the turn, and faded. SPECIAL RESERVE set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn,
but weakened in upper stretch.

DELIGHT set the pace along the inside, forged narrowly clear at the five furlong pole, managed a loose and uncontested advantage while in hand with her
ears pricked down the backstretch, then kicked away when let out in upper stretch, and was ridden out through the final furlong. KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF
hopped while spotting the leaders multiple lengths at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, noticeably picked up stride while shifting out turning for home,
came into the lane five wide, then rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to reach place at the wire. BLING prompted the pace setter from the outside
around the first turn, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch, attempted to re-bid turning for home, but quickly failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch, sparred for place approaching the final furlong, forged that position a sixteenth from home, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging
rival. SABALENKA was allowed to settle at the rear of the field, trailed around both turns, swung six wide entering the lane, and stayed on outside of rivals.
C C CRUISE CONTROL stalked along the inside, vied for place inside of a foe while not keeping pace with the leader in upper stretch, then yielded in the
final sixteenth. DULCIA tracked in midpack two to three wide and between horses, then chased among rivals without producing a bid. HAPPY GAL took
bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path around the turn, and failed to menace among foes.
TOWHEAD stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, then faded between horses through the final furlong. BLIND SPOT brushed with
rivals on both side at the start, jumped a shadow passing the wire for the first time while behind foes, advanced to midpack along the inside into the first
turn, awaited racing room turning for home, but faded through the final furlong. STEPHANIE'S CHARM laid off of the pace in the five to four paths, and
made little impact. RECOGNIZE tracked four wide, but tired in upper stretch. PROMISE OF HOPE tracked two wide and between horses, but faded entering
the lane. PER THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
WONDER WHEEL set the pace along the inside, drew clear around the far turn, held sway on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over inside the final
furlong, tired as a set of outer rivals closed in during the late stages, and lasted. CHOP CHOP broke a step slowly, settled far back along the inside, picked
up stride into the far turn before tipping four wide with three furlongs to go, then sustained his charge outside of foes, took a bump from an inner rival while
reaching place entering the final sixteenth, closed in on the leader late, but missed. RAGING SEA prompted the pace two wide and between horses, rated
back to stalk entering the backstretch, bid for place inside of XIGERA in upper stretch while chasing the clear leader, brushed that foe in midstretch before
coming out and bumping her more vigorously at the sixteenth pole, then got outkicked by another outer rival for placelate. XIGERA stalked three wide,
pressed the leader into the far turn, chased under urging turning for home, battled with an inner RAGING SEA for place in upper stretch, got brushed by that
foe in midstretch, took a solid bump from that rival and steadied between horses at the sixteenth pole, and faltered. SABRA TUFF settled at rear in the two
path, and rallied between horses. MUSTANG LADY laid off of the pace in the two path, then in the four to five path around the far turn, and moved up.
BOSS LADY BAILEY tracked two wide and between horses, then chased frombthe two path around the far turn and lacked a bid. FUN AND FEISTY settled
far back three wide and failed to rally. STELLAR LADY tracked in midpack along the inside, and faded between horses. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA laid at the
rear in the three path and made little impact. KALING tracked five wide, then four to three wide around the far turn, and weakened turning for home.
ESSAOUIRA was reluctant to load, stalked along the inside, then wilted around the far turn. JUST CINDY tracked while tucking six to three wide around the
first turn, then weakened, and was eased through the lane. INFINITE DIAMOND chased four wide and between horses, but weakened after a half mile, and
was eased. FOLLOWING RIDER'S AND TRAINER'S CLAIMS OF FOUL OF RAGING SEA VS XIGERA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG,
AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH; RAGING SEA WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
MIA MARTINA tracked in midpack along the inside, tipped outside of the leading trio entering the lane before floating wider in upper stretch, gained an
advantage approaching the furlong grounds, drew clear, and held sway. LIGHT STARS (FR) settled far back two wide, gained between troubled rivals after
altering to the seven path, sustained his rally by splitting rivals at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay by the outer leader. DANCE WARRIOR saved
ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail to vie for place in the late stages, but was denied. FEDERALIST PAPERS trailed, swung five wide entering the
lane, and stayed on. QUEEN BOURBON laid off of the pace two wide, tracked four wide around the second bend, bid outside of the top pair turning for
home, but drifted tot he five path in upper stretch, and tired between horses. LOVED REIKO tracked two wide, but failed to factor. ROUGHLY A DIAMOND
laid off of the pace three wide, but steadied behind troubled foes at the three furlong pole. THEREARENORULES stalked along the inside, but steadied hard
behind a troubled FAIRCHILD approaching the three furlong pole, and bolted outwardly in the process. LONGPANTS REQUIRED stalked two wide, bid
outside of the top pair approaching the far turn, but bumped an inner rival in the process causing another inner foe to be pinched back, then vied around the
final bend before weakening between horses in upper stretch. SOFT TOUCH prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses into the far turn, but was
bumped approaching the three furlong pole by his outer counterpart, vied with that foe turning for home, but weakened. FAIRCHILD vied along the inside,
but was bumped and pinched back inside of a pair of rivals entering the far turn, steadied hard and bore out soon after, then was eased in the aftermath.
