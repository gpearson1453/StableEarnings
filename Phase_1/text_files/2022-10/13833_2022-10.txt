Footnotes
FAST'N SEXY took command leaving the chute, set all the fractions in the early stages, opened up on her rivals in upper stretch to get a comfortable lead
and was tiring in the final sixteenth but held safe at the wire. CHROME'S ANGEL was off a bit slow to be unhurried down the backside near the rear, began
to rally three wide three furlongs from the line, continued four wide circling foes at the quarter marker and finished well outside of rivals through the lane to
get up in a close photo for place. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN rated in mid pack between foes travelling three wide on the turn, was asked for more run at the
quarter pole, quickened between rivals to close down the stretch and battled for the place award losing the tight photo by a bob at the wire. SPARKLING
SILVER chased the lone pacesetter on the turn, took closer order two furlongs from the finish, could not threaten the winner in mid stretch and faded late at
the sixteenth pole to settle for a small share. SEATTLE TRUST tracked just outside while in range of the the leaders at the half, was roused midpoint on the
turn to go after the frontrunner, put in a mild run until upper stretch and levelled off running to the finish. GO OVERBOARD tracked just behind the leaders
on the fence in the beginning stages of the race, lost ground while under urging inside through the turn and raced evenly to the finish line. RUBY'S REIGN
settled in midfield on the rail running down the backside, was asked for more run midway on the turn, angled to the outside five wide at the furlong marker
and offered little finish to the line. FLAT OUT ANGEL trailed the field from the start, saved ground running through the turn and could not get involved for the
drive. CHIPMUNK rated in mid pack between rivals at the half, was asked with runners on either side entering the turn, could not keep up with the field and
retreated nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LADY MOONSHINE stalked just off the pacesetter from outside going three wide on the turn and four wide at the top of the stretch, struck the lead in
mid-stretch, drifted out several paths while drawing clear but held safe. GAMBLE'S SILVER rated inside in behind the leader, moved through inside in
mid-stretch but was in a bit tight as the leader drifted in, lost just a touch of momentum but kept on to be second best. SYSTEMATIC was bumped at the
break, switched outside rivals up the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, held show honors from TAQUANYAH, who was in a
bit tight on two occasions up the backstretch, was encouraged along about the five-sixteenths, angled six then nine wide in upper stretch, showed late
interest but missed show honors. YA MAR set the pace off the rail and in the clear, drifted out a bit turning into upper stretch then drifted back in about
mid-stretch, weakened. LOADED QUESTION pursued the pace four then three wide through the turn and failed to rally. STERLING SPEED bumped a rival
a the start, was in a bit tight in behind rivals early and angled in, saved ground on the turn, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
MASTER SPY hounded the pacesetter just outside at the half mile marker, bid for the lead in the two path at the quarter pole, battled determinedly outside
to the wire and was inching away in the late stages. COLTONS DREAM took command clearing rivals to be on the fence leading at the half, was headed by
the eventual winner outside two furlongs to the finish, battled stubbornly down the lane on the inside and gave way in deep stretch holding for the place
share. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked the leaders on the rail racing mid pack down the backside, waited behind horses in the early part of the turn, advanced
on the rail entering upper stretch and was gaining steadily on the dueling leaders but could not threaten for the top spot at the finish. BOUND LUCKY was
taken back on the rail to track the contesting leaders three furlongs to the finish, shifted three wide outside midway on the turn, contended three wide at the
top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. STEEL WOOL rated three wide in the middle of the field into the turn, offered a brief run three furlongs
from the wire, was in the mix for a small share turning for home and needed more to be competitive in the late stages of the race. WHISKEY VICTOR
travelled near the back of the field racing down the backstretch, trailed the pack at the quarter pole and could only pass tiring runners in the stretch. ONE
PUNCH CHARLIE settled in mid pack racing between rivals into the turn, was asked for more run at the quarter marker, offered little at the top of the lane
and had no impact running to the wire. TOUCH OF ROUGE was allowed to settle at the back of the field in the beginning, put in a brief run four wide around
rivals on the turn, angled out to the six path for the drive and weakened in upper stretch to be a non factor late.

Footnotes
I'M DASHING brushed a rival lightly at the back, settled toward the rear, had to wait in behind runners at the quarter pole, found room three wide between in
upper stretch, struck the lead and held from rallying rivals. WINGS OF VICTORY switched out gradually through the turn, came into upper stretch about five
or six deep then moved out more for room, rallied too late from between runners and just missed. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL settled off the pace, advanced
with the aforementioned rival outside that one, moved out ten wide into upper stretch, finished solidly but too late. COO BIRD stalked the pace outside going
five then six wide on the turn, came out seven to eight deep in upper stretch and ran on evenly. STREET LEGAL was encouraged along between runners
four to five wide on the turn, came out five to six wide for the stretch run, bumped the inside rival then in turn was bumped lightly by that one and ran on.
FIFTH SEASON set the pace, was off the rail into upper stretch, had no extra. BEYOND MY DREAMS raced at the back, was asked for more past the
five-sixteenths going two to three wide, showed late interest but was too little too late. CORRELATE was outside runners five to seven wide on the turn,
moved eleven deep for the drive, ran on evenly and made no bid. MR. AGRO shifted in and advanced some up the backstretch two to three wide and
between, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, exchanged some bumps in mid- to late-stretch and had no kick. COPINSAY stalked three wide,
floated five wide into the stretch, was bumped into a rival then bumped by that one in mid- to late-stretch and tapped on the brakes slightly. YZERMAN was
not a factor while racing off the inside. SUPER BREW was urged along early to advance while shifting in about two wide, came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
VICTORIOUS WAVE tracked just outside off the early pace down the backside, rated kindly while well in hand into the turn, took command at the quarter
pole, was quickly headed by an outside rival at the top of the lane, battled to the wire, briefly lost the lead in mid stretch and resurged the final sixteenth to
inch away at the wire. HANDCARVED tracked the early leaders inside at the half, waited behind the engaging leaders midpoint on the turn, shifted outside
off contesting rivals at the top of the stretch to bid, dueled for the lead in upper stretch, poked his nose in front at the furlong marker and was outkicked in
deep stretch settling for the place award. KID FORESTER broke inwards at the start, trailed the field at the half, angled outside at the quarter marker to be
six wide entering upper stretch, closed belatedly while widest on the drive and got up for third nearing the wire. REGAL INTENT travelled all alone in mid
pack with three furlongs remaining, was roused just off the rail midway on the turn, got shuffled back to last at the top of the stretch, found another gear
shifting inside with an eighth to run and showed good late energy to finish up for a minor share in the end. BLUE MAX stalked three wide in the back group
down the backstretch, was urged while between runners racing four wide two furlongs from the wire and could only offer an even effort to the finish line. BIG
EXECUTIVE was situated near the back four deep outside at the half, stared to rally four wide into the turn, continued to circle foes outside to be in range
five wide at the top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker to be a non factor in the end. CALL MY BANKER settled on the fence near the back at the
half mile marker, was ridden to keep up inside throughout the turn and had little to give running to the wire. MAD DOG N JOE broke sharp setting the pace
down the backstretch, was collared outside nearing the quarter pole, gave way inside turning for home and stopped the final eighth.

Footnotes
MISTER MESEEKS settled toward the back racing off the inside in the two to three path, began to advance four then five wide on the far turn, struck the
lead past the furlong marker and was soon clear, lugged in at that juncture then drifted out a bit late while just holding off a rallying rival. GLENHOLME
settled mid-pack two to three wide, continued three wide on the far turn taking closer order, switched outside the drifting aforementioned foe in mid- to
late-stretch and was gaining late but just missed. MANETKA was outside off the leaders four wide about mid-division early, made a rapid outside advance
approaching the half, dueled into and on the far turn, took a narrow and brief lead about a furlong out but was outkicked. BOSTON BAY set the early pace
inside, was prompted early up the backstretch by an outside rival then engulfed by two others, switched outside those in upper- to mid-stretch and kept on.
GREEN AMAZON broke a step slowly, angled in, saved ground on the first turn, moved up inside heading to the far turn, saved ground on that bend as well
before tipping out four wide in upper stretch and ran on. DON'T STOP DREAMIN rated off the leading pair three wide through the first turn and up the
backstretch, moved in conjunction with an outside rival nearing the half, dueled inside that one, came up empty. RARE DISCOVERY lacked early speed
racing three to four wide, was never a threat. ONE MORE RING saved ground tracking inside early, went two to three wide on the far turn, failed to rally.
UNXPECTED TIGER raced about mid-pack two wide early, dropped back and was never near enough to threaten. MAGIC GAMBLE prompted the pace two
wide early up the backstretch, retreated.

Footnotes
ZAFEATHER relaxed nicely while well in hand travelling down the backstretch behind the frontrunners, shifted just outside to engage for the lead turning for
home, took control outside foes at the eighth pole and was drawing away in deep stretch. YA BEAUTY (GB) broke inwards to start, was a bit slow into stride
afterwards, saved ground inside through the first turn, continued to advance up the rail down the backside, waited briefly on the far turn, slipped up the fence
to put in a good run at the top of the stretch and closed well besting the rest. PHIL IN ECHO trailed the field at the half, began to pick up runners on the rail
saving all the ground through the far turn, slipped up the fence in upper stretch and rallied inside to get up for the show award a right at the wire.
FORESTERS PRINCESS took command at the start, set all the front end fractions in the beginning stages, was collared by the winner in mid stretch,
offered little resistance and began to get leg weary the final sixteenth and held on for a minor share in the end. TWISTED PATH settled near the back
travelling in the three path in the early stages, offered a mild run five wide midway on the far turn, angled outside to be seven wide for the drive and was one
paced to the finish. JOLENE JOLENE was tracking the leaders under a good hold down the backside, was coaxed between rivals five sixteenths from
home, offered little turn of foot in upper stretch and could not get involved in the late stages of the race. WAR EMPRESS chased the frontrunner in the
beginning, was urged to go after the leader five sixteenths from the finish, offered little response at the top of the stretch and faded the final eighth.
VESPOLINA stalked between runners mid pack into the first turn, put in a mild run at the quarter pole to be six wide turning for home to be in the mix and
retreated at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
CREEMORE tracked from inside, waited briefly leaving the turn, had room inside to take command past the three-sixteenths, quickly drew clear and was
kept to the task. ROYAL CHROME settled off the pace inside, shifted five wide leaving the turn, ran on to get up for second. BAYSVILLE was bumped into a
rival at the start then coaxed forward to set the pace but soon joined by another rival, dueled inside that one, came off the inside a bit leaving the turn, was
no match for the winner and lost place late. WANNA PLAY was bumped at the break, unhurried at the rear, swung outside foes seven wide turning for
home, kicked on mildly. DIXIEWISH pursued the leading pair two to three wide, was four deep in upper stretch and ran on evenly. OUR STORMY SOPHIA
raced inside foes two to three wide on the turn and off the leaders, came out in the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. ROOKIE COURT was
outside foes four to five wide on the turn, shifted out further in the stretch but failed to rally. LAILA'S CHARM bumped a rival at the start, raced between foes
into the turn going three then four wide on that bend and wider for the drive, was never a threat. FREE CARRYCOMB dueled outside for the lead, gave way
and came up empty.
