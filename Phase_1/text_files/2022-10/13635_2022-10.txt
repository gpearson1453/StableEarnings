Footnotes
LIQUIDATOR stalked the pace while three deep around the turn, secured command inside the three sixteenths pole, lugged in despite left hand urging
inside the eighth pole, drew out and her rider dropped her whip near the sixteenth pole. LUV U MARY JANE raced in the two path around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and rallied. ICE CUBE BABY quickly opened up, hugged the inner rail and tired in the stretch drive. ONE LAS OLAS , along the inner
rail most of the trip, was outrun. DONNA'S COURAGE , three wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CLAIRE'S DARLING , away alertly, prompted the pace outside ALWAYS SOMETHING, moved alongside into the turn, dueled past the five sixteenths,
spurted clear into the lane, wandered outward a bit past mid stretch then held firm under a drive. TIZ SUSAN ANN , four wide leaving the far turn, circled six
wide under asking into the lane and closed willingly. FOGGY DREAMS , sluggish early, raced off the rail leaving the three eighths, swung out very wide past
the three sixteenths and offered a mild rally. PROPER ATTIRE , between runners early, edged up some past mid stretch then flattened out. BAHAMA
PEARL chased of the inside, circled five wide into the lane, edged up between rivals past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain. ALWAYS
SOMETHING sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure into the turn then dueled past the five sixteenths, failed to match strides with the
winner entering the lane then faded late. KLAYTON'S KANDY , urged early, dropped well back leaving the far turn, came three to four wide for the drive,
advanced between foes near the sixteenth pole then was out kicked from there. CAROLINA ICE , well placed inside, faded. ODRAMARK , three wide
stalking the duelers mid turn, shifted four wide between rivals into the lane then weakened. TRIKKI NIKKI dropped far back.

Footnotes
CONDESCENDING sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted to the middle of the strip in mid stretch and prevailed under pressure.
ALAS AND ALACK , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, angled four deep at the head of the stretch and rallied. LARAMORE , fractious behind the
starting gate, chased the pace two wide around the turn, moved up near the inner rail to reach a striking position in mid stretch and weakened. LUCIDITY ,
soon after the break, bumped with HEARDITALL causing her rider to briefly lose his right stirrup, then was outrun. HEARDITALL bumped with LUCIDITY
shortly after the start then briefly chased the pace. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

MASTER OF NONE attended the pace towards the rail and to the inside of JOHNNYFRENCHFRI, saw that one briefly get away a bit around the far turn,
battled back under a hustling ride to re engage past the three eighths, secured command a sixteenth later, drifted three wide when clearing into the lane,
kept on under repeated right handed asks and held firm. ENERGY EFFICIENT saved ground under some early rating, took closer order past the five
eighths, came under pressure leaving the far turn, advanced along the rail to loom a serious threat in mid stretch, kept on with good energy but was denied
by the winner. BONDED stalked the pace three deep, was under coaxing pursuing the dueling leader past the five sixteenths, was fanned four wide into the
lane, stayed on to remained a presence past mid stretch then lacked the needed late punch. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI took over early while off the inside, got
out a bit past the three quarter pole, corrected past the five eighths and set a pressured pace off the inside, edged away a bit around the far turn, was taken
back on from the inside by the winner, dueled briefly, gave hard chase from the head of the lane, continued with effort past mid stretch then faded.
GENERAL J R broke a step slow, lost ground four wide, moved up some near the half mile marker, was under a ride chasing four wide into the stretch but
came up empty. DISCREETLY THRIFTY , hustled up soon after the break, stalked between runners, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered. SNIP
THE ROSES , rated back from between foes soon after the break, had no response past the half mile pole and faltered.

UNCLE IRISH cleared early, rated kindly just off the inside, responded when roused nearing the lane, turned back a threat near mid stretch then edged
away late while kept alert. DIXIE DRAWL , five wide outside rivals past the seven eighths, dropped in a bit and stalked outside foes leaving the five furlong
pole, took closer leaving the three eighths, gave hard chase there and held well while clear of the rest. FORTUNE'S FOOL was squeezed back from
between runners heading into the first turn, recovered and was taken wide and settled, edged up leaving the far turn, swung five wide with some momentum
into the lane, sustained to about mid stretch then flattened out. PLOT THE DOTS rated behind foes early, swung six wide for the drive but lacked a serious
run. SAVOY stalked between runners, dropped in towards the rail leaving the far turn, gave willing chase into the lane then gave way through the final
furlong. MAJESTIC FRONTIER broke a step slow, saved ground past the five eighths but failed to rally. MONEY RIDE , inside rivals chasing the pace, failed
to go on under a hustling ride past the half mile marker and weakened. BUSTOFF , three wide between rivals early, raced closest past the five eighths,
ranged up to loom leaving the far turn, pursued to the quarter pole then retreated.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS LAD took control leaving the chute, set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when shaken up for the drive, kept on under right handed
asking past mid stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch and held firm. CALIPARI settled well off the inside, circled five to six wide into the lane, closed
steadily and nabbed the place in the final yards. MOON WARRIOR stalked inside, angled out mid turn, chased four wide into the lane, moved up on his left
lead past mid stretch then flattened out late. GRAND MANNER stalked the pace off the rail, ranged up three wide under pressure into the lane, gave hard
chase past mid stretch, altered in late and came up empty. PLAYING GOLD , brushed at the break, saved ground early and was outrun. CAN'T DREAM
ALONE , brushed at the break, retreated.
