Footnotes
NEVER CHANGE set the pace along the inside, cantered away from a pressing rival with three furlongs remaining, then drew off under mild hand urging
through the lane. LORD CAPTAIN was last away, chased from off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turns, then stayed on while hanging on
his left lead to bid for place at the furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position late. EMPIRE BUILDER stalked two around around the first turn before
pursuing outside of the leading pair down the backstretch, gained place from a faltering foe at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader
entering the lane, then resisted an outer rival's challenge for place through the final furlong, but was bested late. HEY BOSS lagged behind around both
turns, and moved up. WORDS OF WISDOM pressed outside of the eventual winner, but faded at the three furlong pole. COASTAL CHAOS broke on top
before tracking from the inside around the first turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SUPER DESIGN set the pace inside of a prompting foe while remaining multiple paths off of the inner railing, showed the way around the far turn as an
another outer rival applied pressure, inched narrowly clear of those foes nearing the lane before bearing out to the five path entering it, held sway while
drifting back in and across inner foes' paths in midstretch, then lasted late as those challengers closed in. CARMICHAEL broke multiple lengths slow while
bumping the outer part of the gate, raced far back two wide, closed in as the pace slowed to a two wide tracking position between horses with five furlongs
to go, chased the clear leader while vying for place through midstretch, altered course outside of that foe with a sixteenth to go, closed in between horses in
hopes of producing a late bid, but ran out of ground. CAN'T HUSH THIS pressed the leader from the outside while kept in the four path by that foe,
sustained pressure between horses via rider encouragement around the far turn, but began to fail to keep pace with the pace setter nearing the lane, tipped
outside of that drifting foe at the furlong grounds while getting outkicked by an inner rival for place, and kept on. MAXIMUM IMPACT broke a step slowly
while taking a bump from an inner foe at the start, trailed, swung from the three path to the six path entering the lane, and failed to menace while improving.
ENDLESS SUNSET broke out and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, closed in down the backstretch before chasing inside of
foes around the far turn, and tired. CAMP DAVID tracked the runaway leading pair from the three path early on, tipped outside of them and to the five path
entering the backstretch, inched closer to press into the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. THE RIDER OF CARMICHAEL CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SUPER DESIGN FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SPANKHURST saved ground far off of the quick pace, swung six wide and outside of the leading group in midstretch, and surged in the final furlong to drive
past them in the late stages. WILD BEHAVIOR shifted outside of a clearing foe in the early stages to stalk two wide, ranged up between horses to vie
entering the final furlong, forged a narrow advantage at that station, gamely clung to a margin from outer rivals thereafter, but was outkicked by an
oncharging foe in the final sixteenth before holding place. GRAY ATTEMPT tracked three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds,
sparred between horses into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late before beings staved off for place. REED KAN tracked from off of the pace two wide,
shifted out turning for home before coming into the lane five wide, but only offered a mild grind, attempted a bid in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an
outer rival in the final sixteenth, and flattened out. CALIFORNIA STREET tracked along the inside, hugged the fence around the bend before lightly brushing
it turning for home, then chased evenly inside of foes through the lane. MONTAUK DADDY sped clear early on, set the pace around the bend, but saw the
rider accidentally fling his crop at the three sixteenths pole, and folded between horses at the furlong grounds. TRAPPE VALLEY laid off of the pace three
wide, and failed to factor in the six path. BOLD ADVENTURE tossed his head at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
CAN'TBETEMALL pressed the pace setter from the outside while kept in the four path by that rival, vied with him around the far turn, forged an advantage
coming to the furlong grounds, and edged clear. TIME FOR TROUBLE laid off of the pace two wide, chased the top pair turning for home, inched closer
inside of them along with an inner BEAR OAK in upper stretch, bumped and leaned on that foe passing the sixteenth pole, and gained place at the wire.
LEADER OF MEN set the pace while remaining in the three path as an outer foe gave pressure, sparred with that rival around the far turn, got headed
approaching the furlong grounds, gave way, and got caught by an inner foe for place at the wire. BEAR OAK stalked two wide before tucking to the rail
entering the backstretch, moved forward to press inside of the top pair with nine sixteenths to go, backed off to stalk again from the pocket around the far
turn, then chased the leaders through midstretch along with an outer TIME FOR TROUBLE, jostled and steadied when bumped and bothered by that foe at
the sixteenth pole, and gave way while protected through the late stages. DERBY CODE tracked along the inside, retreated to trail at the five furlong pole,
and never got involved. EAGLE PASS trailed, moved out of last while in the four path down the backstretch, but faded around the far turn. THE RIDER OF
BEAR OAK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIME FOR TROUBLE FOR INTERFERECE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
GET ON THE BUS stalked two wide and between horses, tucked behind the clear leader nearing the far turn, tipped back outside of her entering the lane to
take aim, chased while mildly progressing through midstretch, but sustained her charge to bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear. IMPLOSION
tracked two wide, shifted four wide turning for home before being floated five wide entering the lane, then rallied in pursuit of the leading pair in the final
furlong, but was kept at bay by the winner in the closing stages while reaching place. TWO SIXTYONE set a clear pace, maintained a margin from a
chasing GET ON THE BUS through upper stretch, but was collared by her entering the final sixteenth, and folded late. UNDER ONE SKY saved ground in
midpack, shifted off of the fence in upper stretch, and chased evenly behind the leaders through the final furlong. GAL WONDER (GB) checked from tight
quarters between horses passing the seven furlong pole, settled off of the pace two wide, then chased evenly along the rail while lacking the needed kick.
MINT EDITION took a bump from an inner foe at the start, then got rank when wrangled back from between rivals moving through the lane for the first time,
settled off of the pace in the three path, trailed around the far turn, swung to the seven path approaching midstretch, and moved up. LET'S DUET tracked in
midpack three wide, came into the lane in the five path and between horses, but lacked a rally while hanging on her left lead. CHATON ROUGE trailed,
moved out of last four wide around the far turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, and made little impact. SISTER NELL broke out and bumped a foe at the
start, then saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. AALIYAH EZRI stalked along the inside, backed off to track before tipping three wide around the
far turn, but weakened once floated four wide entering the lane. FANTAIL (GB) stalked three wide, tucked two wide nearing the far turn, then weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
RARIFY bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked the leading trio from the three to four path around the turn, swung to the eight path while ranging up
outside of them entering the lane, sustained a bid under confident handling in upper stretch, gained an advantage approaching the final furlong, and drew
off under hand urging while hanging on his left lead. MALIBU TOAST prompted the pace three wide while in the four path into the turn, bid outside of the
leader before gaining an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out while confronted by RARIFY in upper stretch, but proved no match coming to the
furlong grounds, and remained clear of show. STELLAR LILY pressed from the three path while between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those
foes into the turn, chased them around the bend, came into the lane in the five path while getting outkicked by an outer rival, kept on to reclaim show soon
after, and was best of the rest. A. P. LADY broke a step slowly, moved forward to midpack entering the turn, chased from the two path around the bend,
then failed to menace while improving. SWEET CHABLIS trailed along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and moved up. MASTER SOM
set the pace inside of a pair of foes while in the two path early on, got headed by her only remaining pressure at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened
entering the lane. CLASSIC FAREWELL bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. CATCHA LATER MO
lacked speed along the inside, and tired.

Footnotes
IMPLEMENTATION stalked in the three path, assumed command entering the far turn, drew off under driving pressure through midstretch, and was
wrapped up in the final sixteenth. COOL RAGS tracked in midpack along the inside, chased between horses around the far turn before gaining place turning
for home, and was second best. JR'S GIFT lacked speed two wide, was driven along in the four path around the far turn, then stayed on between horses in
upper stretch to claim show at the furlong grounds. HAPPY BOY ROCKET tracked in midpack in the three to four paths, chased the clearing leader while
gaining place around the far turn, but weakened after drifting to the six path entering the lane. CIVICS CLASS tracked along the inside, but was shuffled
back behind the stopping early pace setter, and lacked a re-rally. CENTURION laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed nearing the far turn, then moved
up between horses. DEEP STATE broke slowly while tossing his head, trailed early on, moved out of last down the backstretch, inched closer in the five
path around the far turn, but stalled out and tired through the lane. BLUE NORTHER was sent to the front out of the gates, but ran off around the first turn,
began to tire approaching the far turn, got headed into it, and stopped. UNLEASH THE POWER tracked in the four path around the first turn, and was done
early.

Footnotes
LOVELY PRINCESS settled off of the pace two wide, tracked from the three path while behind the main group around the far turn, shifted six wide in upper
stretch, rallied outside of foes to bid approaching the final sixteenth, and drove clear. PERSONAL BEST tracked from midpack two wide, moved between
horses down the backstretch, tipped to the five path turning for home for clear sailing, but only produced a mild grind, bid for the lead at the furlong grounds
as an outer LOVELY PRINCESS loomed, vied between horses into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by her outer bidding counterpart, and held place.
LOVED REIKO laid off of the pace along the inside, attempted a five wide gain outside of foes before being floated to the eight path entering the lane, and
stayed on willingly. INSATIABLE stalked along the inside, bided time from the pocket around the far turn, easily slipped inside of the leaders to bid entering
the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, but was outkicked a sixteenth from home, and got nailed at the wire for show. ELLE EST FORTE tracked
along the inside, awaited racing room in the two path around the far turn, then chased the leaders through the lane while lacking the needed kick to split
them. THISNAMEISOKAY stalked two wide and from between horses while in the three path, was coaxed to attempt a bid entering the far turn, vied in the
four path entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. PEARL EARRING tracked from the four
path, moved forward to press into the far turn, but weakened while floated to the six path and between horses entering the lane. MS MERRABEL sped clear,
set the pace in the two path, felt pressure from outer foes around the far turn, then caved between horses in upper stretch. MY SWEET STORY broke a
step slowly while being nudged by an inner foe at the start, then never got involved from the two path. WILMORE got outrun. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) was
bleeding from the mouth when moving to post, then trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
SALTA set the pace inside of a pair of mild pressers into the turn, shook free once set down entering the lane, and drew off. BALSA pressed three wide,
took aim on the leader turning for home, but proved no match while second best. MATARO hopped while breaking slowly, laid off of the pace in hand in the
two path, shifted out and split foes five wide in upper stretch to gain show at the furlong grounds, and held. TIME TO CRUISE broke a step slowly, trailed
before swinging seven wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. PREMIUM lacked speed two wide and between horses despite rider's urging, split foes three
wide in upper stretch in hopes of bidding for minor placings, but failed to menace. LIFE AND LIGHT took the turn in the four path while between horses and
off of the pace, and failed to factor. SANTINO'S FANTASY got caught five to six wide while off of the pace, and made little impacct. TALK TO TOKEY
tracked along the inside, and tired through the final furlong. IRONSIDES pressed two wide, but weakened entering the lane. BOLT ABOVE tracked three to
four wide, chased entering the lane, then caved between horses in upper stretch.
