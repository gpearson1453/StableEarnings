Footnotes
SIX O'CLOCK SARAH showed good early foot the set the early pace, raced well off the inside down the backstretch, continued to race off the inside in the
stretch run and held well to be clear under strong handling. MURUMBI tracked the early leader from the inside, angled out through the stretch run to race
from the outside of Six o'Clock Sarah and no closing bid in the winner to finish second best. DARE ME stalked the pace while racing between, angled widest
through the lane and kept on to the wire. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT raced off the early pace, hard ridden turn, raced six wide near the quarter pole and
lacked a rally. FABS broke sharply to the outside, chased the pace from the outside and faded.

DEEP FAITH settled off the early pace, hard ridden near half mile pole, raced for wide into the upper stretch and finished well to prove best under strong
handling. LOOSE ENDS stalked the pace from the outside, took command near the five sixteenths pole but couldn't match strides with the winner in the
stretch drive to finish second best. SHOOT THEMESSENGER raced off the early pace, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to
improve position. ROCKIN THE PALACE pressed the pace from the outside and weakened the final quarter of a mile while racing from the inside. STYLE
was unhurried early on, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. EXACTING showed good early foot to set the early pace, was
overtaken down the backstretch by Rockin the Palace and tired readily.
