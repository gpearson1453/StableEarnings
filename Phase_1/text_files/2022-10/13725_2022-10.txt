Footnotes
LA DANTA raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, got through on the rail down the stretch and pulled away. MORO SMOKE
pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide, proved no match for the winner, but got by FLYING I for second. FLYING I vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, raced close throughout and was caught late for second. GOLD CHAIN brushed at the start, racing near the back, showed late
interest, but was no factor. SLOOPY HANG ON lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, improved position, but was no factor. KEEP ON
DREAMING broke out, bumped, raced within contention and faded. TENPINS TEMPEST raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. GYPSY SOUL
broke out, raced within contention and dropped back. PRIME CHOICE broke slow, hopped start, racing in the rear and was never close. DEE DIN showed
early speed and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
LUCKY BREAK went to the front, dueled throughout and drove clear deep in the home stretch. TOP HAT CAT vied for the early lead, saved ground around
the turn, dueled throughout and couldn't keep up with LUCKY BREAK down the lane. POLICY LIMIT pressed the pace, raced three wide around the turn,
raced close throughout and was a clear third at the wire. MR. CURLIN raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid, but
was no factor. CALLEN FEELS GOOD raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. WIN IN THE CITY lacked early speed, finished wide
and was never a factor. SHADY MONKEY pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and faded. HARD TWIST void of early speed and showed
little. JUST HANGIN RIDGE acted unruly, just as the gates pop open, broke last and was never close.

Footnotes
BILOXI vied for the lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. STREET COMMANDER pressed the
pace, saved ground around the second turn, raced close throughout and was a clear second. TEXAS TURBINE dueled on the front end, saved ground and
lacked a late kick. PITCH AND RUN raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. CLASSY
SHIPMAN challenged for the early lead, raced outside around the second turn and weakened. CHROME RUN lacked early speed, improved position, but
was no factor. MALIBU MONEY broke poorly, racing in the rear and was never close. GOLDEN CONFUSION always raced near the back and showed little.
CLASSIC RUNNER raced in the middle of the field and dropped back.

BLAZING CHARLIE lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, drove clear down the lane and won under steady
urging. GOTTATAKEHIMTO unhurried in the beginning, made a bid on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the stretch, proved no match for the
winner, but got up for second. PROUDTOWN dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn and was outfinished
for second. NUGGET OF GRACE raced within contention, eased back, made a mild bid, but was no factor. PLENTY OF CENTS void of early speed and
passed tired ones. CHAPEL OF DREAMS dueled for the early lead and was finished early. SCREWBALL raced near the back, saved ground around the
second turn and was never a threat. MARVINS GOLD raced within striking distance and retreated.
