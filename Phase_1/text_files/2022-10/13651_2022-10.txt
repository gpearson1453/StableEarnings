Footnotes
LORD MIO prompted the pace outside NOSTALGIC RUN, saw that one get away a bit in upper stretch, found more inside the final furlong, came back
determinedly under strong handling to take over in deep stretch then edged clear at the wire. NOSTALGIC RUN took command to the inside of LORD MIO
around the first turn, kicked clear and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure past the five eighths to the five sixteenths, was roused
clear in upper stretch, widened under a drive past the eighth pole, wandered outward inside the sixteenth pole and failed to last. SOROS , bumped at the
break, was taken to rate into the backstretch while two wide, edged up leaving the far turn, angled three wide when put pressure past the five sixteenths,
gave hard pursuit from there and churned on. VASARIANO , away alertly, saved ground and settled off the pace, took closer order under some coaxing into
the far turn but lacked any solid further response. AWARD NOMINATED broke outward and bumped with a rival, advanced four wide leaving the far turn,
chased into the lane but came up empty through the final furlong. JARDANI , off the pace while about two wide early on, angled out around the final turn,
circled five wide under a ride into the lane but lacked a bid. INSIDE THE BOX drifted out at the break, raced well back through backstretch run, came three
wide for the drive and never got un tracked.

Footnotes
THE CAIRO KID tracked a contested pace while three to four wide, ranged up four wide into the lane then was bumped by YES SIR ROBERT, sustained
under pressure and moved alongside the leader near the sixteenth pole, was bumped as BIGMANCAN drifted, kept on to take command late and prevailed.
BIGMANCAN vied three wide outside a rival, took a short lead into the lane, battled between rivals leaving mid stretch, drifted out under left handed asking
soon past the sixteenth marker and bumped with the winner, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. YES SIR ROBERT , bumped and in tight at the
break, edged up near the five eighths and stalked behind the embattled leaders, bumped with the winner when attempting to angled out for room entering
the lane, failed to find daylight and remained blocked to the sixteenth pole, altered out late and finished with good energy. ROYAL THUNDER had speed
two wide and took the early lead, dueled to the inside of BIGMANCAN, stayed on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BATTLEBUS bobbed inward
at the break and bumped with a rival, flashed speed then rated back off the dueling duo, saved ground into the lane, made a mild comeback past the eighth
pole but failed to seriously follow through. SHOULDA HAD IT , bumped at the start, raced off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole but lacked a bid.

DIALING DIXIE , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, closed late outside LADNEEDSAHANDLER and was up approaching the finish.
LADNEEDSAHANDLER , clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. FREE SQUARE , rated on the
backstretch, was four wide turning for home and flattened out. AMICALOLA FALLS raced along the inner rail and lacked a sufficient late response. SPRING
THE BEAST , steadied when attempting to drift out on the turn, failed to rally. CALLYOURIGHTBACK raced in the five path between horses in upper stretch
and was not a factor. SOUPER EMPEROR , five wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. RULING FRONT , three deep
chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO stumbled soon after the break and walked off after being pulled up.

Footnotes
HACHURE rated close up and to the inside of a rival, eased out three wide near the three eighths, moved up to take aim into the lane, closed in under
strong handling and engaged FEDERAL OFFENSE nearing the furlong grounds, dueled, wrested a short lead with a sixteenth to go and shook clear at the
wire. FEDERAL OFFENSE vied outside INVECTIVE while under early rating, spurted clear around the turn, responded when shaken up soon into the lane,
dug in when confronted by the winner past the three sixteenths, fought gamely inside that one to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. CASH ROCKET ,
off poorly when appearing to stumble in behind, regrouped and edged up while saving ground into the turn, angled out, circled four wide under coaxing into
the lane, had aim then flattened out through the final furlong. PURSUING PACE lacked speed while off the inside, circled five wide into the stretch and failed
to muster up a rally. GOD IS LOVE , sluggish from the gate, raced between rivals early and failed to menace. INVECTIVE disputed the early pace to the
inside of FEDERAL OFFENSE, ceded the lead to that rival after a half mile, failed to keep up leaving the three eighths pole and faltered through the final
quarter mile. CONSULTANT gave early chase outside a rival and stopped.

Footnotes
ORDER OFTHE KETTLE , bumped in the jam up at the start, was three wide around the turn chasing the pace, swept to the lead in upper stretch then
pulled away under brisk urging. SUPER ACCELERATE , in the two path disputing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. SHACKINTHEBOX ,
bumped in the jam up soon after the start, swung to the four path leaving the turn, passed tired foes. IT'S VIPER hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and lacked a serious rally between horses. LOVE TALK , three wide on the turn, floated four wide turning for home and was not a factor.
GREEN BEANS showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. INSPIRED IRISH , soundly bumped and forced out by SILVER PATRON soon after the
break, raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. IMAGINE IT hugged the inner rail around the turn and retreated through the stretch. SILVER
PATRON caused a jam up when bearing out sharply leaving the starting gate which made his rider briefly lose an iron then was checked when pinched back
shortly after the start. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
R B'S THE BOSS broke alertly and was confidently handled while prompting the pace outside GRAND ESCAPE, responded when shoved on and went
clear into the lane, eagerly kicked away when put to firm asking past the three sixteenths, was kept alert to the sixteenth pole then was gathered up proving
much the best through the final sixty yards. GRAND ESCAPE broke outward, was corrected and sped to command towards the rail, set a pressured pace,
dueled with the winner past the five sixteenths, failed to match stride soon into the lane, shifted out a bit and kept on with effort to hold down the place.
COFFEEWITHCHRIS , bumped at the break, was sent up between rivals past the five eighths, gave hard chase three wide leaving the three furlong marker,
saw the leaders get away into the lane but kept trying to the wire. CAVALRY COMMAND , bumped at the start, raced in range early on while saving ground,
dropped back mid turn, came back slightly near mid stretch then flattened out. DREAMS DELIVERED drafted well back after a good start, saved ground
leaving the three eighths, swung well wide soon into the lane but failed to threaten. GOLDBUSTER bobbled then was bumped at the start, regrouped and
edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker, failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and weakened.
