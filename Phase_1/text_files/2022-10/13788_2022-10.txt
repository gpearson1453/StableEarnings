Footnotes
PARADE FIELD Contested the lead along the rail to the line and under strong handling got the job done. BEACH ACCESS Contested the lead along the
two path, battled to the line and just missed. THIS CAT CAN FLY Unhurried five wide on the first turn, four wide on the last, angled out some and finished
with interest. SLEEPY JOE Unhurried along the rail and then failed to threaten inside. FLAT BILL Unhurried, three path into the last turn, four wide out of it
and failed to threaten. BEACHSIDE Well placed along the three path on the turns and weakened. STARSHIP OREO Well placed, two path into the last turn,
four wide out of it and weakened. YOU'VE GOT MALE Three path on the first turn, two path on the last and tired.
