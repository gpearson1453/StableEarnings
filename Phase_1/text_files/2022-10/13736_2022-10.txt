INTENT TO STRIKE contended the early pace under a strong hold, disposed of inside rival moving clear into the lane, and edged clear under light handling.
NEVVARE stalked the pace from the six path, rallied between foes into the lane, and fought on to hold place. SIR BRONX chased from the four path, took
closer order leaving the backstretch, went evenly through the lane from the rail and was edged out settling for show. MAJESTIC CAFE unhurried early,
circled into the far turn, drove four wide into the stretch under urging and weakened in the final yards. FROBISHER BAY raced wide through the
backstretch, fanned three wide in the final turn, and yielded. VISION QUEST pressed the pace, and tired early.

PERDITION set a pressured pace from between foes, edged clear nearing the quarter pole, turned back challenge from ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER under
heavy urging, and held safe. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER bumped leaving, was never far back in the four path, moved menacingly but was unable to get by
PERDITION and kept pressure to the wire. IRISH TRICK stalked inside, raced in traffic leaving the backstretch, urged into the lane, and finished evenly.
MUCHO MAGIC sat in striking distance outside, fanned three wide, dropped back and failed to threaten in drive. RISING REVOLUTION tracked inside then
raced in close quarters into the far turn, and came up empty in the drive. BELLS AND WHISTLES broke inward bumping ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER, was
under a snug hold early, shifted outside to the five path, and faded. SOUL FREEDOM vied inside while three wide, was unable to keep pace with the field
and tired.

Footnotes
JOY IN GRACE sat in striking range while in the four path, set down into the lane, wore down the leader and held on. A LOT OF SPUNK broke alertly,
stalked inside, lacked running room in the final turn, drove between in the final sixteenth and just missed. EXACTLY unhurried early, and passed tiring rival
in the final yards. QUICK DIAL contested the early pace from the three path, showed the way into the final turn, was under attack into the stretch and gave
way. LIGHT FAST FEET failed to menace. WINE TASTER raced in close quarters inside, was pulled up, did not finish and was vanned off. TIMER
MALFUNCTION- Race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

KISS AWAY settled in stride leaving, stalked the pace while three wide into the far turn, moved up alongside RUN ROSSCO RUN into the lane, and edged
clear under light handling. RUN ROSSCO RUN hurried to the front, was overtaken and finished evenly. BOMEGA tucked inside leaving the backstretch,
hustled inside at the quarter pole, but was unable to improve contending position in the drive. ATABOYCOOKIE was gapped early, gained closer order,
drifted in under right handed urging, and showed a mild interest late. DUKE OF DEWINTON lacked serious bid. AUSSIE'S BELLA saved to no avail.

Footnotes
SWIFT SWALLOW angled in leaving the opening turn, advanced quickly in the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, moved clear in the final furlong,
geared down and held under a late drive. NORTHERN GOLD saved inside, angled out to the four path at the head of the lane, closed gradually and missed.
MIDNIGHT TAKE lacked early speed, experience traffic near the three sixteenth pole, lodged bid late stretch to secure show. LULABELLE chased in the far
turn, shifted outside in the final furlong and offered up a mild kick. COUNTESS CAT showed early speed inside, shifted out to the four path into the
backstretch, moved up alongside WHITEROSE SPIRIT near the five sixteenth marker, and yielded. HUMBOLDTSTRONG saved from the rail, lacked
running room at the head of the lane, shifted out to the four path and tired. WHITEROSE SPIRIT emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, showed the
way into the far turn, was challenged by COUNTESS CAT and wilted soon after. MUSICAL RELOAD settled in the five path, chased and tired. PRECIOUS
NOTES tracked the pacesetter, and tired early.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE NEIGH quickly went to the front then saved ground while showing the way, contended the lead inside of AMUSING WAY, dueled into the
final turn, came under heavy urging and held under constant pressure late stretch. HANDSOME HENRY tracked the pacesetters from the five path,
commenced a bid in the final turn, loomed boldly late stretch but was unable to stall the winner. KEEPMEINPOWER bid belatedly and was along in time for
show. AMUSING WAY raced four wide leaving the chute, moved up to contested the early pace, dueled outside, and lacked the rally needed late.
STUBBORN LOVE broke slow, chased inside, and failed to menace in the drive. JEFF FA FA outrun throughout. WIDE EYED WILEY away well and trailed
throughout.
