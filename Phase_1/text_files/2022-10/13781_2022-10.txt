CANDIDATE broke well and immediately sprinted clear, hugged the inner rail throughout, opened up in upper stretch and was hand ridden. PROWLING
TIGER saved ground around both turns, remained along the inner rail through the stretch and closed nicely. HARBOR MOON raced along the inner rail
around both turns, swung outside near the eighth pole and rallied. HERE'S LIAM , reluctant to load into the starting gate, prompted the pace outside the
winner and weakened in the drive. CODE OF KINGS , outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, floated to the five path in upper
stretch and came up empty. JOHN MACARTHUR , no factor, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and in the stretch. PAY THE SQUID stalked the pace
down the backstretch, was well positioned in the two path on the far turn, eased out three wide turning for home and gave way. MICROFIBER , three wide
the first turn, was four deep on the far turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. URBAN BANDIT was outrun. BLOWN SAVE ,
sluggish early, was outrun.

Footnotes
PAISLEY SINGING quickly went clear, set a rated pace just off the inside, came under a firmer ride past the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed
asks inside the furlong pole and dug in nicely to hold off RESPONSE TIME. RESPONSE TIME prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, continued
on gamely through the final furlong and was steadily closing the gap. CANOODLE chased outside a rival, shifted four wide for the drive and rallied.
MATTITUDE stumbled and bumped at the break, recovered and advanced inside to stalk, was under coaxing pursuing into the lane, stayed willingly to
about mid stretch then faded. HYDRA , bumped at the break, dropped well back early while saving ground, angled wide for the drive but lacked a bid.
AMERICAN BASTET drifted in at the break and bumped with MATTITUDE, gave hard chase while saving ground and faltered through the lane.

CONSULTANT , alertly steered to the inner rail entering the first turn, raced inside horses down the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the far turn,
worked between horses entering the stretch, swung outside in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in time. TRASH TALKIN LARRY chased the
pace outside JET SPEED, overtook that one in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. TATE lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch and rallied.
HELLMAN , four wide both turns, floated to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. BALLYHOO PRINCE raced near the inner rail stalking the pace and
weakened in the drive. JET SPEED set the pace along the inner rail and tired the final furlong. HEARTBURN , up close down the backstretch, raced in the
three path turning for home and failed to rally. SEBARAY offered a mild, wide move leaving the far turn then weakened. CODIGO saved ground on the far
turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and weakened. TRANSIT was outrun. THE MAN TO SEE , no factor, was very wide around the far turn.
VOTETHEMALLOUT raced along the inner rail down the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn.

Footnotes
WATCH YOUR TONE took command leaving the chute, secured the inside and set a pressured pace under rating, kicked clear after being set down into the
lane, kept on under solid handling past mid stretch, drifted out a bit late and held firm to turn back APPALACHIANHEIGHTS. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS
rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out mid turn, ranged up four wide into the lane, had dead aim past mid stretch, kept on grinding but denied
through the final yards. LOVE IS STRONG disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on with that one past the quarter pole, stayed on with interest
and was able to regain the show. GOLD TIME VIXEN settled off the early pace, quickly gained while saving ground past the three eighths, chased to mid
stretch and faded. LIGHTFOOT MISS stalked outside a rival, came under pressure three wide mid turn and weakened. SHE'S ALL COURAGE , off slow
when rank, regrouped and saved ground, made a slight run mid turn then gave way through the drive. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start of
SHE'S ALL COURAGE. No action was taken.

PATRIOTIC PARTY prompted the pace outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure after a half mile, responded to asking and took over into the lane,
kicked clear under a drive then steadily widened while kept to task. WILLOW WOOD broke a step slow, quickly recovered and edged up inside nearing the
five eighths, stalked the leaders, shifted out for the drive, gave willing chase to the wire and held down the place. BRILLIANT ICE , brushed at the break,
hustled up early, saved ground advancing past the five sixteenths, eased out, moved up between runners near the sixteenth pole and churned on. LATE
CALL , in the clear while past the half mile marker, swung out in upper stretch but lacked a solid kick. PHRA PHROM settled off the pace while saving
ground, worked outward for the drive and had belated interest. PHAROAH'S FURY stalked outside a rival, was urged chasing mid turn and faded. LUNA
WARRIOR accelerated inside foes leaving the chute to take command, set a pressured pace around the turn, ceded into the lane and weakened. RARE
BREED lost ground four to five wide and faded. MARCHED was outrun.

BARBERINI , patiently rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased off the rail leaving the far turn, moved to the four path turning for home,
secured command in upper stretch and drew out under steady handling. KING'S HONOR (IRE) saved ground around both turns, found room along the inner
rail in the stretch and rallied. BORDER TOWN hugged the inner rail on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, was five deep entering the stretch and
flattened out. J BERESFORD TIPTON lacked speed, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. B DETERMINED lacked speed, raced
in the two path on the far turn, remained in the two path between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. KENDAMA prompted the pace outside
POWER BACK and weakened. POWER BACK set the pace near the inner rail, moved to the two path in the stretch and weakened. NATHAN DETROIT
raced in the three path between horse on both turns and weakened in the drive. BOB MARCO , four wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and

Footnotes
HOV LANE , away well, was confidently rated tracking the leader, cruised up three wide to take aim nearing the half mile marker, forged to command soon
into the lane, quickly opened up when put to a drive then was steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. GOOD STORY , off a bit slow, advanced
inside rivals nearing the turn, eased out to work between, angled four wide with pursuit into the lane, kept on with some interest and held the place.
MANITOULIN ISLAND , off the pace and removed from the inside, circled five wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. RED PRIESTESS sped clear, set the
pace towards the inside, saw her lead quickly diminish approaching the quarter pole, failed to contain the winner soon into the lane and gave way in the final
furlong. JUST ONCE MORE broke a step slow, rated off the pace, angled out for the drive and failed to menace. SERIOUS MOMENT saved ground and
came up empty. CONDUCTANCE , three to four wide, offered a mild mid move then faded. DOOMSCROLLER was not a factor. SANCTIFIED TIME gave
early chase, race two wide leaving the far turn and weakened. I HAVE COURAGE failed to menace. MIDSUMMER STORM broke a step slow and was
outrun.

Footnotes
ONE LAS OLAS was sent up to contention along the rail soon after the start, rated back off the duelers past the five eighths, dropped back some mid turn,
gathered steam into the lane, altered out for the final furlong, closed under solid left handed asking, overtook GALACTIC TIDE in deep stretch and drew
clear at the wire. GALACTIC TIDE dueled between rivals, emerged in a battle to the inside of DUNDER BOSS leaving the three sixteenths, got the better of
that one and edged clear inside the furlong grounds, braced for an outside challenge from the winner and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. DUNDER
BOSS hesitated at the break and was away a couple lengths behind the field, regrouped and was taken wide, moved up in hand and reached contention
into the turn, quickly gained four wide and bid outside a trio of embattled foes past the five sixteenths, dueled on near even terms soon into the lane, failed
to kick on with GALACTIC TIDE nearing the sixteenth marker and faded. O ANNIE , three deep contesting the pace, could not go on with the leaders soon
into the lane, stayed on to chase to mid stretch and faded. EMPTY ENVELOPE failed to menace. GRASS CUTTER chased outside a rival early on and
faded nearing the lane. CAMI RACHELLE sped clear early, dropped in then was joined by rivals to her outside after a furlong, dueled to the head of the lane
then faltered.
