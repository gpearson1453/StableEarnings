OLDER BROTHER sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by LANGUAGE BARRIER nearing the three-eighths marker, re-cleared nearing the
quarter and drew off with complete authority. DESERT DANGER lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good energy to gain
the place. SOUTHERN SUMMER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late.
GUNNERS ONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WILD FIREMAKER was forwardly placed from the
inside and weakened in the drive. MEAN CANNON lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LANGUAGE BARRIER pressed
the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
NEW MEXICO LINDY was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, pulled to contend, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch,
reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew off as a handy winner. STORMY DAME lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, offered a
bid nearing the quarter, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. VIPERS PRINCESS was reserved just off the leaders
early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter and failed to gain in the drive. WHO'STHATGIRL was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. SINGING DELIGHT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and
gave way through the final furlong. BRANNY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ELEGANT EMPRESS settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. RENEGADE GIRL chased the leaders while racing three-wide, weakened after
going three furlongs and was eased through the lane.
