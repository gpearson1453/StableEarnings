Footnotes
COLD NIGHT AIR set the pace two off the rail, then held sway down the backstretch, rallied gamely on the far turn, then surged to the wire to prove best.
JUST CLAIRE chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady gain on the far turn to rally at the top of lane and was closing well in the end but it was not
enough. TRINITY QUEEN was well placed while two wide entering the first turn, then continued to stalk the leader down the backstretch into the far turn, bid
mildly mid stretch but gave way in the end. MORO NALA was rank on the first turn, then chased the pace down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the far
turn then flattened out in the final furlongs. BLACK CHEETAH settled along the inside and failed to menace. SHE'S A RIDGE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SALADO set the pace right out of the gate, clearing the rest of the field early, then hit the head of the stretch and continued to draw off, going wire to wire for
an easy win. DIA DE PAGO was in the middle of the pack, racing by himself around the turn, then angled out mid stretch, rallying to get up for place and
was second best. FIRST AVENUE had no early foot away from the gates, bumping a foe, then hit the middle of the stretch and closed, three wide to grab
show. BLING MOUNTAIN chased the pace from the two path and flattened out in the stretch drive. ABSTRACT KAT got pinballed leaving the gates and
was near the back, along the rail and had an even effort. MIGHTY MATT was forwardly place early on, racing on the inside and faded down the lane.
YOU'REOBADBOY was near the front early on, three wide and dropped back in the stretch.

Footnotes
RACY JAYCEE was allowed to settle near the back, then angled out around the turn, drifting to the five path and closing hard, clearing the field for an easy
win in late stretch. CHIKARA was mid pack, racing two wide, the rallied in the turn, steadily gaining in the stretch drive, but it was not enough to catch the
winner. FROSTY FLIRT made the lead early on, getting pressured by a foe all the way around, then gave way in early stretch but held on for show.
SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT was mid field early on, then made a bid in the turn and offered a mild rally, three wide down the lane. DUTCH TREAT was mid pack
early, racing along the inside, then offered a mild bid in the stretch drive, four wide. SIMPLE PLEASURE pressed the pace, three wide, made a bid in the
turn but flattened out in the stretch drive. LIZZ A BEE had no early foot, running three wide and offered a mild late run. SENORITA COMETA was near the
back, two wide and had a mild late bid. DORITA'S HEART was forwardly placed early, two wide and dropped back down the lane. COCO LOCO MAMA was
mid pack, four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
TENACIOUS LION was in the middle of the pack early on, traveling wide throughout, then made a bid at the head of the stretch, from the four path and just
got up with a driving finish. BOSQUE chased the pace early, from the inside, then started a bid in the turn, but was outfinished at the wire, getting up for
second. LAMP OIL made the lead early on, drew clear of the field into the turn but gave way grudgingly in late stretch, holding on for show. MORO
WARRIOR was mid field, two wide and rallied down the lane but it was not enough. UNBRIDLED POSSE pressed the pace early on, racing along the rail,
then made a bid in the turn, but hung in late stretch. ON THE HONOR ROLL was forwardly place early, racing four wide, then flattened out in the stretch
drive. POLICY LIMIT was mid field, three wide and failed to fire down the lane. TWELVE PACK stalked the pace, three wide and faded in the stretch drive.
TEXAN BOY was near the back, racing two wide and only offered an even effort. MORO COOL had no early speed, running three wide and lacked a late
response. FORTI got off slow, running along the rail and was no menace.. CRESSON had no early foot, two wide and was no factor.
