Footnotes
NO KA OI was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention, continued that move in the stretch and edged away late
to prove best under a drive. THISGUYCANFLY was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide, rallied well in the stretch but was out kicked by
the winner. OBVIOUSLY TOO set a slow pace early while clear, then dueled for command by the half mile marker, shook clear nearing the quarter pole but
faded the final furlong, held show award. JOEBOY was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was two wide on the turn, angled out for racing room and
offered a late rally. WATSONS BAY chased the early pace, then settled back on the inside on the backstretch, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and
had a belated rally for the minor rewards. QUIET PRAYER chased the early pace two to three wide, then was on the inside on the far turn and had no rally.
CHOPPA STYLE was off slowly, then made a four wide middle move to vie for command at the half mile marker and then tired.

OCEOLA was well rated early to track the pacesetter, made a three to four wide move midway on the turn, took over leaving the three sixteenths and drew
clear, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. COFFEE COUNTY was settled early three wide, came four wide into the drive
and finished well. TRIPPER JOHN set the pace while clear and removed from the rail, was headed leaving the turn and faded in the drive. INTO WISHING
was reserved early and had a belated rally on the inside. PAPIRINGO was settled early, came four wide into the drive and had no punch. FORTY THREE
stumbled at the start, then was two to three wide on the turn and swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. IN A BIND was settled early and was five
wide on the turn and stopped.
