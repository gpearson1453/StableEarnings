Footnotes
QIAN B C was stalking the leader from the onset, took command at the quarter pole to quickly open up and was drawing away in the late stages. PUGIN
took a stalking position outside early, rallied between horses at the quarter pole and finished well but could not catch the winner down the lane.
LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL was near the back outside early on, loomed up at the quarter pole while three wide, and chased willingly through the stretch to get
a small share. INGORDWETRUST was hustled inside to get position leaving the chute, asked on the turn but could not keep up with top three through the
lane. YZERMAN trailed throughout and picked up a tiring foe late. PRIDE AND PASSION was away alertly to get command, collared at the quarter pole and
offered nothing through the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT FLASH forced the pace outside, took over into the stretch then widened and remained safe while kept to a drive. EMICRACK (CHI) vied for the
advantage three wide, continued willingly and came again to gain place. TOMATO BILL stalked the pacesetters inside, angled out and split rivals into the
lane but was outfinished for the place. STRIKING HEIR dropped back outside and lacked a solid rally. CRAFTY CONQUEST was hustled to the front inside,
vied to the stretch and faded. ALACRITOUS broke a bit slowly and raced far behind throughout. KEEN SAMURAI broke a step slowly and was never in
contention. NEW TRACK RECORD.

Footnotes
SUMMER SUNSET kept close range of the leader throughout, took command at the top of the stretch and drew away easily. FOREST SELECTION was
roused three wide on the turn, dueled with an inside foe through the lane and gamely fought on to get second money. DIXIE BIN stalked outside early on,
hustled between horses on the turn, angled out for run in the stretch and was outfinished by an outside rival for place. ARQUEBUS set the pace in the early
stages, was headed by the winner at the three sixteenths pole and faded late to miss the top three placings. ULTIMATE ANSWER was reined in towards the
rear in the backstretch and showed little throughout. MR. AGRO was steadied briefly leaving the chute, shuffled back to the rear and passed a tired one in
the stretch. HE MISSES ME stalked mid pack early on, roused on the turn and stopped badly through the stretch.

ICE ROAD settled well back, advanced three wide on the turn, bid into the stretch, collared the pacesetters and gamely held inside rival safe. REPEAT THE
HEAT stalked the pacesetters inside, moved with the winner into the stretch but could not get by through the final furlong. WHERE IS ESSA dueled in the
two path and then inside in the stretch and continued willingly. MOMENT OF PEACE stalked the leaders outside, vied through the turn then was outfinished.
DOINGGOODTROUBLE raced within range in the two path then flattened out in the stretch. DIXIE'S FLATTER led early inside, dueled through the turn and
faded in the final quarter. NOT A GAME ducked in early bumping rival then weakened steadily. PRIMORDIAL FEAR broke a step slowly then was soundly
bumped early then moved very wide in the lane. ALL TIME CLASSIC lunged at the start breaking in a complete tangle losing any chance and trailed.

Footnotes
ANARCHY took command early on, well rated up front never to be challenged down the lane. BIG EXECUTIVE rated at the back early, saved ground on the
turn, angled out for the drive and was full of run late to get up for the place. REGAL INTENT slipped up the rail through the turn to offer a mild threat entering
the lane but gave way late to lose second. WOOD BE WILD chased the leader on the turn, weakened entering the stretch and made rebid on the rail to get
a minor share. LIGHT THE LAMP was outside stalking, made a move entering the turn to contend and evened out the final eighth. MR NARCISSISTIC was
shuffled back on the turn and showed some interest through the stretch. AL HEYBAY stalked outside four wide on the turn and ran on mildly to pass tiring
horses. RAPID RELOAD was roused on the turn in mid pack and never reached contention. DROP A CARIBOU stalked the leaders going into the turn while
three wide and offered nothing for the stretch run. LION OF THE SEA broke in and hit the gate, then made a brief middle move on the rail in the turn and
gave way through the stretch.

LOADED VIXEN quickly took control, was never challenged and remained well clear through the stretch but was kept to her task. MENAGERIE reserved
outside, advanced three wide on the turn but could only offer a mild gain. TALE OF PERFECTION went after the winner on the turn, proved no match and
tired. DREAMS AND SCHEMES settled off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. READY CANDY saved ground early then drifted out badly into
stretch while outrun. DREAM NOW broke awkwardly and ducked in at the break, rushed up inside and gave way.

RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, bid three wide to the front on the turn then remained clear under steady pressure. MAN OF
STEEL dueled for the advantage to the stretch and continued gamely holding the place. PHILZANO bumped twice in the early stages, angled inside rivals
deep stretch rallying too late. BORN HAPPY was urged close up inside, in tight into the far turn, angled wide to secure room and continued well.

Footnotes
VENENOSA was taken up near the far turn, swung wide rallying in the stretch then drew off quickly while drifting out badly. ROOKIE COURT vied through
the turn, led briefly into the stretch and finished willingly. MIZZ GEMMA broke awkwardly then ducked in, moved up inside then swung wide in the stretch.
SALADA was bumped and steadied very wide into the far turn and had a mild rally. NORTHERN PASSAGE was bumped from her inside and steadied into
the far turn. T'PRING raced close up three wide then gave way readily. JOLIE DAVINA trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. MY LAST DREAM led
wide down the backstretch, angled in, dueled and stopped. YOU THRILL ME dropped back early then moved very wide in the stretch.
