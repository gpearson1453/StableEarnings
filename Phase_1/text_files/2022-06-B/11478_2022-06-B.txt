Footnotes
DANCE SHOES allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, found running room along the rail at the three eighths pole, swept the lead, opened up into the
stretch and ridden out. JOY IN GRACE gained closer order into the far turn, came under encouragement at the quarter pole but was no match for the
winner. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE hustled to the front while five to six wide, was overtaken at the five sixteenth pole, and flattened out. MINE ME settled off
the pace while wide through the backstretch, lodged a bid near the quarter pole and passed a tiring rival late. ARIZONA SUN sat just off the pace between
foes, went three wide into the far turn, was roused at the top of the stretch but lacked a response that was required and tired. SHELTERED BAY stalked
outside and tired early.

CUVEE TEE contested the early pace inside of MISS DIRECTED, disposed of rival nearing the quarter pole, and kicked away. ABERDEEN ANNIE trailed
the field early, circled the field into the lane, rallied belatedly closing the gap on the winner late. WICKED WOMAN saved ground inside, swung out in the
final turn, rallied late to earn show. HUMBOLDTSTRONG chased the pacesetters outside, threatened at the head of the stretch and gave way in the final
sixteenth. MISS DIRECTED set a pressured pace, was overtaken in the turn and faded gradually. MUSICAL RELOAD sat off the pacesetters early, dropped
back in the turn and tired.

FLAT AS A PANCAKE saved ground from the rail, took closer order leaving the backstretch moving into a striking position, struck the lead at the head of the
lane, and kicked clear. CONVINCE reserved off the early pacesetters under a snug, moved up closer to LIGHT FAST FEET leaving the backstretch, rallied
determinedly outside through the stretch improving her position, but was no match for the winner late. EXACTLY last away the raced from the back of the
pack while five wide, raced evenly through the stretch and passed tiring. LIGHT FAST FEET led the field through the backstretch, was overtaken at the
quarter pole and gave way late. SHIP'S CREEK went five to six wide in the opening turn, sat in range in the three path through the backstretch, and had no
response when called upon. FLORIST rated off the pace outside, and failed to threaten. LETS GO ALL THEWAY was not a factor.

Footnotes
ONEOFTHEMGIRLS vied for the early lead, led the field through the turn, and held under a late drive. KEKE KIMONO fanned five wide through the
backstretch, dropped back into the far turn, rallied inside through the stretch, and was gaining on the leader late. LA PALINA last away, chased inside, went
three wide at the head of the lane, and lacked the kick needed. ADDYDIDIT chased from the four path and lacked a closing response. TONE IT UP fanned
six wide in the backstretch, fanned four wide through the far turn, and flattened out. SASSY BUT CLASSY sent for early speed but was outsprinted to the
turn, lost ground in the final turn, and faded. DIPLOMATICA chased wide early and tired soon after.
