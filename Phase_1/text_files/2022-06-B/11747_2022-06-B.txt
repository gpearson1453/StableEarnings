OL' L B pressed the pace two wide, took command on the turn then widened the balance of the trip while getting quick fractions to win as much the best
while being ridden out. OHIO EAGLE unhurried early, closed rapidly in the three path through deep stretch and got up for second. MANNFORD sped to the
lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside while getting quick fractions, drifted to mid track in upper stretch then was outfinished.
GALACTIC with the second flight, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and finished evenly. SPIN DOCTOR also with the second flight, drifted to the
seven path entering the stretch and lacked the needed response. FUNNY BACHELOR had brief speed. MOBIL MAGIC was no factor. QUALITY MAN miss
stepped out of the gate and was never close.

handed urging. EL CONDOR CAZA battled for the lead four then three wide into the stretch and was no match for winner. SOL DEL NORTE away alertly,
drifted inward steadily while setting a pressured pace, had speed into the stretch then weakened. NOT JUST GEORGE failed to menace. CAN'T
CRASHMYPARTY was no threat. KID VAN prompted the pace three wide, drifted inward bumping with TRUE HERO past the nine sixteenths pole, had
speed into the turn then stopped. TRUE HERO had good early speed along the rail, was bumped past the nine sixteenths pole, hit the rail, fell suffering a
catastrophic injury and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
LEOMBRUNO sprinted to a clear lead on the clubhouse turn, turned back a bid from SUPER VISION before a half, was nicely rated, widened into the
stretch and won under a hand ride. TIP SHEET allowed to settle, improved two wide n the far turn and finished second best in the four path. ALGORIX
never far back, finished with good courage in the five path. SUPER VISION chased the winner early, loomed boldly outside that one before a half, remained
a sharp threat into the stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. BUCKY failed to menace. SILVER G T O stalked the pace along the inside for six
furlongs, altered course to the six path at the top of the stretch then gave way. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD was no threat.

Footnotes
BEVERLY PARK prompted the pace two wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead, battled until deep stretch and edged clear late under confident handling.
COLOMBARD pressed the early pace three wide, drew on even terms for the lead before the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then couldn't handle the
winner. ADHHAR never far back, had a mild late rally in the eight path. THE DRAKE hopped at the start, trailed into the stretch swung wide and closed a
gap late in the middle of the racetrack. KOSCIUSZKO had speed from the start, loomed boldly four wide through the turn then was outfinished. CENTRIST
failed to menace. ODDS ON stalked the pace along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed to respond. POWERFUL MOON set a pressured
pace along the rail into the turn then flattened out.

PERFECT SENSE stalked the pace along the inside for six furlongs, angled out and split horses two wide past the quarter pole, made the lead then finished
full of run under a brisk hand ride through the final furlong to win as much the best. ITASCA never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path and got up for
second. IRISH UNITY broke in front, set a fast pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. WARRIOR'S DREAM within striking distance, moved closer
three wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then leveled off. EXALTED JOY passed tiring rivals. BOSS BEAR was no threat. SPEEDY
MOBILE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then gave way. MISTER MAN was through after a half.

Footnotes
SPECIAL BEACH broke in front, set all the pace while nicely rated and drew clear under strong handling. MAOILIN pressured the winner two wide and
finished second best. CANDLELIGHT HOURS never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. SHE'S CRAFTY failed to menace. R
THREE ANGELS with the second flight inside, faded in the stretch. BALLROOM BLITZ stalked the pace through the far turn then wilted. SMART PEGASUS
was outrun. CAUSE OF LOVE with the second flight three wide, stopped on the far turn and was eased to the wire.
