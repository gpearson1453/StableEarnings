Footnotes
FAMISHED stalked two or three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with MANOR HOUSE into the stretch, drifted in in front of that rival while clear
passing the furlong marker and edged away. MANOR HOUSE set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with FAMISHED turning
for home, checked at the eighth pole when that rival crossed over in front of him and then continued willingly but second best. ANTIGRAVITY raced three
wide off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and lacked a stretch rally. BOURBON FRONTIER raced three wide early, then pressed the pace,
bid two wide entering the far turn, chased and tired. FIGHTING FORCE tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry
and Jockey Objection by the rider of the runner up against the winner, the race was declared official.
