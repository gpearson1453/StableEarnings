late rally near the inside and finished second best. FRANKIE Z split horses entering the far turn, moved closer to the winner nearing the top of the stretch,
drifted out and lost ground. FLYING GUILLOTINE failed to menace. BUBBA chased the early pace, suffered an injury late and was eased to the wire then

Footnotes
ANIMO STAR bore in at the start bumping hard with QUIET LADY forcing that one into BOLD GINGER, was outrun early, closed with a burst of speed four
wide to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew off rapidly under left handed urging to win as much the best. KISS THE RED HEAD allowed to
settle, rallied determinedly along the inside through the stretch and finished clear for second. VAL'S RIPTIDE hopped at the start, chased the pace for a half,
inherited the lead then was outfinished. SEEKING THE MONEY stalked the pace and went evenly. CRIMSON LEGION improved position on the turn then
leveled off. STARLITESLEW had good early speed then faded. ETTA away alertly, set the pace for a half then gave way. QUIET LADY was bumped hard at
the start then no threat. SMOKIN MARE EVANA was outrun. ISLAND SHORES showed little. BOLD GINGER was bumped at the start, raced wide down
the backstretch, got out on the turn and lost ground.

Footnotes
TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, shifted out three wide, rallied to make the lead before the furlong marker and proved
best under strong handling. CAROL'S ROYALTY away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide then along the inside into the stretch and finished second best
in a game effort. WHOVILLE bore out at the start bumping WAR CAT, was outrun early then closed fast in the seven path for third. TALKBACK moved up
five wide into the stretch then was outfinished. OPULENT WAYS went evenly. DREAM FEVER never far back, improved position into the stretch then came
up empty. LUMINAIRE passed tiring rivals. ANTHONY'S GIRL was no factor. LAPIS STORM pressed the pace along the inside for a half then gave way.
ADULTING had brief speed. WAR CAT was bumped at the start and through early.
