Footnotes
D'WILD BARONESS broke alertly, allowed the leader to go early while in the two path, advanced on that rival late in the turn, lost some ground to that same
foe upper stretch, bid past the furlong marker, drove clear under steady handling. GABY'S PROMISE back off the pace toward the inside, continued to save
some ground turn, moved out around a tiring rival upper stretch, dropped back to the rail and rallied up the inside to be in time for the place, not a serious
threat to the winner. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL took command soon after the start, set the pace inside, continued to show the way upper stretch, responded
and offered brief resistance to the winner with less than a furlong remaining, yielded to that rival with a sixteenth remaining, nipped in the final stride for the
place. ENVOYS LEGACY fell back to trail after the start, continued to see them all into the stretch while between rivals, picked off a couple of foes to
improve position while not posing a serious threat. TOTALLY GRACE in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide into the lane, lacked a closing
response. ACHANCETOWIN last away, moved up the opening furlong to reach a forward position into the turn along the inside, remained in striking position
through the bend then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
COMMANDER SCOTT broke on top, crossed to the inside before leaving the chute, continued to set all the pace along the inside, rated kindly in the run up
the backstretch and into the far turn, maintained daylight into the stretch, responded when the winner came alongside with less than a furlong remaining,
dueled to the wire and proved very game late, refusing to let the runner up by. VARNISHED within striking distance outside, moved closest to the winner
second turn, challenged on the outside inside the furlong grounds, spirted duel the final sixteenth, could not get by. I'M D'CAT lacked early foot while saving
ground, moved out and began to advance three wide second turn, set down for the drive, slowly getting to the top pair late, clear of the others. PURIM KING
fell back to trail immediately after the start, continued to lag the middle half, came for wide for the drive and staged a mild rally while not a serious threat.
RUNAWAY TRACY lacked speed, continued back second turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. CALABASH broke out, bumped MY
GUITAR, was straightened to race forwardly for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. MY GUITAR bumped at the start to be last away, recovered to chase
the winner for five furlongs and then gave way.

Footnotes
KAITLYN'S COURT unhurried in the early going, made a good gain into contention along the inside second turn, steered out for the drive, engaged the
leader inside the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. TOOSIE broke best of all, set the pace along the inside firmly in hand through some soft
fractions, held a daylight advantage past the furlong marker but was unable to contain the winner in the late going, well clear of the others. OVERLY
SWEET last away, void of speed for five furlongs, moved a bit closer in the two path second turn, roused three wide into the lane, finished up best of the rest
without posing a threat to the top two. ABIGAIL G closest to the runner up off the inside, continued to pursue that one into and through the far turn in the two
path, weakened. AUNT JANA remained back throughout in failing to threaten. LAST DESTINY within striking distance early, was finished after a half.
ARCTIC GUITAR in mid pack for five furlongs, tired while four wide out of the final turn.

Footnotes
SPANKHURST away in good order, narrowly showed the way past the wire the first time, set a legit pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, shrugged
off a couple of rivals in upper straight to be clear again, drifted out with less than a furlong remaining, found more in the going to hold the runner up
comfortably safe in the waning strides. FORTUITY broke out to bother NEW EAGLE, was straightened to race unhurried for five furlongs, closer in the
second turn, continued to creep into the fray upper stretch, tried the drifting winner a sixteenth out, could not match that one late while holding sway for the
second spot. MINNESOTA MIRACLE chased the winner toward the inside, advanced and tried that rival while between foes exiting the final turn, failed to
sustain that advance the final furlong. NEW EAGLE bothered at the break, settled off the pace and the inside, also advanced and challenged the winner
turning for home, weakened the final furlong as well. WISE VERDICT behind the pace just off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. MICAJAH broke
back and never menaced. FLYING HONEYPOT fell back immediately after the start, pulled up first turn, vanned off.

DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE broke on top, clear early, soft pace, pressed briefly backstretch, quickly clear again before a half, steadily increased advantage
under confident handling, continued to draw off late while jumping the gate tracks, ridden out. VERDUNVILLE settled off the early pace, moved closest to
the winner off the inside second turn, chased that one into the lane, proved no match, clearly second best. WHEELS TURNING last away, void of early foot,
moved closer four wide before a half, lacked a further advance while along for the show, no threat to the top two. WILDCARD GOLD broke back, trailed
after a half, made little impact. CONQUISTADOR GOLD forwardly placed early inside the winner, moved out pursued that one onto the backstretch, moved
closer with the others before a half then began to give way.

Footnotes
CYPRESS QUEEN forwardly placed early inside, lost some position when covered up in traffic far turn, got through, challenged inside the leader when
straightened for home, powered well clear. SPIDER LEGS in the second flight early off the inside, raced in the two path through the turn when still within
striking distance, three wide into the lane, challenged a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late. GLADS LOVE CAT last away, trailed early, moved
closer toward the inside past furlong marker when in some traffic, also proved no match for the winner, gaining for the runner up spot late. CASH BIZNESS
sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to show the way into the lane off the inside, gave way from between the top two when headed by both nearing
midstretch. JULIO CHOICE lacked early foot outside, came four wide when with the second flight into the lane, lacked a closing punch. IN FOR A PENNY
back off the pace while also well out in the course, five wide turning for home, failed to produce a rally as well. MY GAL CHARLOTTE chased the early
leader off the inside, stopped late in the turn. RACE WAS HANDTIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
COSMIC TRAIN took back off the early pace, remained unhurried for five furlongs, swept up into contention with a five wide move turning for home, put a
head in front past the furlong marker and edged clear under confident handling. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE away well, dueled up front early inside, fell back a
bit the third quarter, rebid while remaining inside in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner late, clear for the place. EVERLOVINGHAND
moved up to duel in the two path, garnered a larger advantage late backstretch, briefly clear late in the final turn, briefly answered the challenges of the top
two nearing midstretch then could not keep up, comfortably clear of the others. FREEDOMFI settled well back off the pace toward the inside, improved a bit
in the drive without posing serious threat. DOCTOR LEO within striking distance while racing three wide, continued in contention in the three path turning for
home, had nothing left for the stretch run. RELENTLESS DANCER last away, moved closer four wide turning for home, gave way soon after, trailed home.

Footnotes
JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS in mid pack early outside, moved closer four wide through the turn, took over into the lane, drew clear under steady handling.
BULLETSREVENGE broke alertly, set the early pace inside, vied into the lane, could not keep pace with the winner through the lane, saved the place.
NVRFORGET URDREAMS back off the pace, saved ground through the turn, shifted out past the furlong marker, up late for the show. FLASHY PREMO
raced within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked the needed closing kick. SONG SPECTACULAR broke in mid pack, moved up to
duel outside the runner up through the turn, weakened when the real running began into the stretch. CHELSEA'S GLORY in the main body outside, five
wide through the turn, had little left for the stretch. GENES FEATHER in some traffic in the turn, fell back in failing to menace. ANGOLA VACATION off a
step slow, remained always back. YANKEE HAIL CAT was also always outrun.
