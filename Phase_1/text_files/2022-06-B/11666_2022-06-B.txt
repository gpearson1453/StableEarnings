Footnotes
RIGLET set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole and raced in hand with little urging to the
wire. LADAWN was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly
second best. BROADWAY ROMANCE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished evenly late.
DREAMING OF DIXIE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

MAJORWAYHOME broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with M G M'S LUCKY, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin with
a furlong to run and held SMOOTH BLUES safe to the wire. SMOOTH BLUES settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. WILEO PROCEED was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished
with a steady bid. JASMINE WHO raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed to
gain in the drive. M G M'S LUCKY was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half. LAUGHING
STORM lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not menace. POSTMANFOURTYEIGHT was off a step
slow, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

CHAMPITO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards.
MANOSO was away in good order to duel for the lead with DECK HUMOR while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch but could not resist
the winner from over the top. DECK HUMOR broke sharply to dispute the pace with MANOSO while racing four-wide, vied through a prolonged drive and
gave way late. NO DOUBT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. BOOMER WHO was void of early speed,
raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. GERDA'S GONE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
