bid belatedly for show honors. TRIPLE POWER vied inside, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, and faded. DANCING WILLIE hurried away,
saved ground inside, and was unable to improve position. HARD TO COME HOME chased three wide leaving the backstretch, and tired.

Footnotes
FOREVER JIMMY was quickest leaving the opening turn, contended the pace inside of CITY WOLF'S GUY, drew away in the final turn, then opened up to
good margins through the stretch to an easy victory. IMPERIAL DASH stalked the early pacesetters from the three path, finished second best and was no
match for winner. CITY WOLF'S GUY prompted the early pace leaving the opening turn, was unable to keep pace with the eventual winner and held on for
show. YNOTGIVEITAGO last away, saved ground through the backstretch, was asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole, and lacked a bid. REMAIN
CALM failed to threaten. AMIGO QUERIDO no contention.

Footnotes
MR. ARTISTIC quickly went to the front, took pressure leaving the backstretch, kicked clear at the head of the lane then opened up to good margins and
was ridden out. SPORTSCARR pressured the early pace outside, chased into the lane from the rail but was no match for the winner. RAILWAY hurried
outside, sat just off the pace outside leaving the backstretch, came under encouragement and secured a show placing. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER
reserved off the pacesetters, took closer order lodging a bid at the quarter pole and faded late stretch. KENTUCKY LEGEND veered in leaving the gate,
chased and closed the gap into the stretch. LIGHTENING ANNA lacked a bid. DAD'S LEGACY reared leaving and closed the gap. STEWARDS INQUIRY-
The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving KENTUCKY LEGEND and DAD'S LEGACY but after review made no change. It was
determined that both KENTUCKY LEGEND and DAD'S LEGACY received a fair start.

BRADYDABOSS jostled leaving, set sights on RUN ROSSCO RUN leaving the final turn, gained the lead into the stretch and drew clear. RUN ROSSCO
RUN hustled to the front, showed the way through the turn, was overtaken into the stretch and held for place. CHESTER SLEW broke in, into
BRADYDABOSS, rallied belatedly to earn show. JAKE THE RAKE fractious in gate, allowed to settle early, came under a drive nearing the three sixteen
pole, and improved position late. BIG Z stalked four wide in the backstretch, lodged a bid outside and failed to threaten in the drive. WIDE EYED WILEY
chased leaving the backstretch, angled to rail at the sixteenth pole, and yielded. COSMIC MARINE saved ground inside and lacked a bid. BLINK'S
ROCKET broke through gate prior to the start of the race, chased outside early and was eased.

the leader into the lane and gave way in the final sixteenth. BIG AL'S VISION pressed the early pace, was unable to move on with rivals leaving the
backstretch, and went evenly through the stretch. MAKE GOOD CHOICES stalked inside and failed to produce a bid. CONCUR settled outside early and

STONE CARVER vied between rivals for command, dueled outside of DEUCES ARE WILD in the final turn, came under heavy steady urging and refused to
relinquish control in the final strides after a multi-horse scramble to the wire. SEBASTIAN'S BOY rated well off the pacesetters early, gained closer order
nearing the three sixteenth pole, responded to challenge from WAR GIANT at the head of the stretch, rallied gamely then narrowly missed. WAR GIANT
trailed the field early, advanced quickly leaving the final turn, engaged SEBASTIAN'S BOY into the stretch, battled gamely outside and just missed after a
determined try. DEUCES ARE WILD contested the lead through the backstretch, dueled inside of STONE CARVER, was all out under heavy urging but
could not get by the fore mentioned and run down late. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT lagged early and bid belatedly. TORIADOR prompted the early pace
while four wide, was unable to keep pace with rivals leaving the final turn, and flattened in the stretch.

JULIUS THE GREAT rated a slim lead inside, moved clear in the final turn, and kicked away through stretch. CHARMING VINTAGE stalked the pacesetters
while four to five, went in pursuit of the leader but was no match and rallied to secure place. STRONG AND FREE settled inside early, advanced quickly
nearing the quarter pole, rallied inside of CHARMING VINTAGE but was edged out for second. TINY TYCOON unhurried early, launched an outside bid
outside leaving the final turn, and chased through the stretch. IMPERIALITE offered a late mild bid. AMBER PRINCESS rated off the pace from the three
path, and faded. DANZA UNBRIDLED failed to threaten. UNUSUAL ACCOUNT vied outside for the early lead, was unable to move on with rival and tired.

ASYOUBELIEVE vied inside for command, drew away in the final turn, and opened up to an easy victory. ABOVE AND BEYOND advanced quickly in the
far turn, moved up menacingly at the three sixteenth pole but was no match for winner and held safely for place. SLAATS trailed the field early, circled into
the lane, closed the gap and finished best of the others. SPOT ON DUDE stalked inside, lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole and tired. PUMP THE
BRAKES chased four wide and was done early. GLAVA showed early speed outside, and dropped back. PHANTOM MAC dueled for the early lead, and
gave way with two furlongs remaining.

Footnotes
ROOKIE YEAR sat in striking position from the four path, challenged the lead at the quarter pole, and edged clear after a long drive. DECOY led the field
through the backstretch from the three path, responded to challenge from ROOKIE YEAR, battled determinedly through the drive and gave way grudgingly
late stretch. COUNTRIFIED stalked from rail, dueled inside of BUCK WEST and just held on for show. BUCK WEST sat in range from the four path, moved
up alongside COUNTRIFIED at the head of the stretch, but was unable to muster the bid that was needed to get by. DOC COPE went wide through the
opening turn, lodged a bid at the head of the lane and weakened late. SEA SPLENDOR circled wide into the lane, and offered a late bid. SNAP COUNT
encountered traffic in the far turn, and lacked a response when asked. WILDCAT WILLY saved to no avail. ANKARA stalked the pacesetters wide through
the backstretch, and dropped back.
