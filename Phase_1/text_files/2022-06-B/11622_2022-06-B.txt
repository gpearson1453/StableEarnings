SYMBOLIST was sent to get a clear lead and the inside on the first bend, allowed to relax on the backstretch, roused approaching the quarter pole, under
steady urging stretch and held sway. ONE WAY HOME advanced from outside to share the lead with SYMBOLIST, was asked leaving the quarter pole and
gradually drifted out the final furlong. MEMORY BANK settled well back, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch to come into contention on
the second bend, still had a striking position with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. ROAR OF THE LION also well back early, steadily yielded from
inside after a half mile and was allowed to coast through the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction, the mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
BOLD ATTACK pressed from outside, edged ahead four wide on the turn, slowly angled in as he battled to hold on and got the nod at the wire. CLEVER
BOY moved up quickly from inside to vie for the lead, was all out in the stretch, fought on even terms with BOLD ATTACK in the late going but had to settle
for second best. COPPER CROSSING blocked behind rivals in the early going, split foes three wide with three furlongs left to vie for the lead approaching
the end of a half mile, was caught in tight quarters at the top of the lane, yielded, altered out widest at the furlong marker, could not close the gap on the top
pair but gained third late. SWEET LITTLE RUE broke on top, set a pressured pace between horses, was overtaken two wide on the bend, also caught in
tight quarters between horses at the top of the stretch and flattened out the last furlong.

Footnotes
THINK BLUE was a step slow at the break, bumped with MARIA'S GIFT leaving the chute, soon vied for the lead from outside, was two wide through the
turn, edged ahead under hand urging upper stretch, floated out slightly inside the final furlong, was under a drive in the late going and held on. SUPER FIRE
rated off the early speed, followed THINK BLUE on the bend, fanned outside that one for the stretch run and found best stride too late. JULIAISON rated off
the inside, had the rail on the turn, came into the lane behind THINK BLUE, gained a clear path inside the last furlong, closed well but was also too late.
MARIA'S GIFT bumped leaving the chute, chased from outside, came four wide into the stretch, bore out badly under left-handed pressure as she rallied,
surged the last eighth and narrowly missed third. TROUBLE FINDS ME shared the lead from inside then gradually wore down inside the final furlong.
MAJESTIC RAJ steadily gave way from inside and was unresponsive to urging in the lane.

TIZ APPROVED shared the lead in hand from inside, floated out some as he was urged leaving the turn, began to gradually drift out as he moved clear just
inside the furlong marker, was under steady right-handed pressure in an effort to correct his path and maintained full control. CREEKMORE shared the lead
outside TIZ APPROVED, was carried out by the latter into the lane, did not keep up midstretch, altered in for a clear path inside the eighth pole and failed to
have the needed late kick. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY came off the inside early on, lost ground staying outside D'ARCHER on the turn, took over third upper
stretch, showed some late interest and proved easily best of the others. D'ARCHER broke outward, was corrected after leaving the chute, chased while
toward the outside, stayed in path three through the turn and had no stretch bid. TALE OF THE NILE moved to the outside early on and showed little.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SICILIAN broke alertly, was quickly clear and moved to the inside into the first bend, was kept in hand when challenged on the backstretch,
moved clear again when urged on the second turn, lengthened command under a drive in the lane and kept ROAD GAME at bay under steady handling.
ROAD GAME was boxed in behind the early leaders on the backstretch and second turn, gained a clear path outside CARTE BLANCHE entering the lane,
floated out some further straightening for the drive, drifted out gradually under left-handed pressure inside the final furlong, came up short but was easily
second best. CARTE BLANCHE advanced outside WILDWOOD SICILIAN on vie for the lead on the first turn, did not stay with the latter on the second bend
and flattened out for the drive. AZRAEL raced in contention toward the outside for six furlongs then gave way. RULE FOLLOWER was a factor between
horses but faded four wide before finishing six furlongs. CHOCOLATE BUNNY steadily faded running widest once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
KHOZIE'S GHOST crowded briefly at the start, was hustled up in tight quarters between rivals to vie for the lead after the first sixteenth, moved clear
midway on the backstretch, was challenged from outside on the bend, lost the advantage upper stretch, came again to battle on even terms with
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE inside the final furlong and edged ahead in time. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE broke a bit inward, vied for the early lead from outside, did
not stay with KHOZIE'S GHOST midway on the backstretch, went to that one on the turn, fought gamely in the lane but did not have enough in the waning
yards. WAR COLORS rated at the back from well off the inside, lost considerable ground five wide as she commenced her bid on the turn, closed well the
last eighth, was too late but clearly best of the rest. TIZ HOPPIN was bumped shortly after entering the main track, came into contention three wide on the
bend, floated out some upper stretch and flattened out the final furlong. MARYS LAST SONG reluctant to load, altered in some when crowded by KHOZIE'S
GHOST shortly after entering the main track, bumped TIZ HOPPIN, altered out, chased from well off the inside and had no late bid.

Footnotes
COOKIN ROSES soon sprinted away from the rest while in hand, stayed just off the inside, was put to a drive midstretch, kept to task to the wire and was
clearly the best. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN chased COOKIN ROSES from just outside, closed the gap some when put to a drive on the bend, was no match for
the leader when set down for the drive but shook off HEART OF REASON for the place deep stretch. HEART OF REASON chased in midpack from
between rivals, took the rail on the turn, gained a striking position approaching the final furlong, leveled off in the waning yards but was easily best of the
rest. PRINCESS MANDII chased running widest of all and was never a factor. AKA LIONESS broke a bit awkwardly and outward, chased from inside and
steadily faded after three furlongs. THEYCALLHERPINKY hesitated at the break, trailed staying off the rail, her rider lost his whip leaving the bend, angled
in under hand urging midstretch and had little to offer.
