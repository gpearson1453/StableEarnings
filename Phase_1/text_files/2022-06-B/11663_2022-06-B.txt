show. PARTY IN THE SAND trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. WEST HORIZEN saved ground within range then gave way readily.

TIO WIL vied outside to the stretch, took over and gradually edged away under steady handling. KEEPING THE PEACE bumped at the start, rushed to the
front inside, dueled the winner and continued willingly. TOMATER GATOR saved ground throughout, lacked speed, rallied mildly and was just up for the
show. COBBLE HILL dropped back outside and passed rivals without menacing. AMERICAN FLEET came in and bumped inside rival at the start, saved
ground and was no threat. GRIT AND GLORY moved close up three wide early and faltered. NO FOOLING DUDE forced the pace wide briefly then gave
way readily. ANZIO BEACH lagged far behind, stopped and lost contact with his field.

vied to the stretch and continued determinedly. WALK ME HOME prompted the pace outside throughout and finished willingly. BACK CHANNEL raced wide
in the opening quarter, angled inside on the turn and had only a mild bid. EXCITABLE LADY saved ground, made a brief move at the quarter pole and
faded. MEMPHIS MAFIA forced the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. CAUSE I SAID was ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advise of

EXCURSION stalked the dueling leaders three wide, vied through the final turn then edged off through the stretch while kept to his task. MR. ROUNDTREE
well back inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well too late. MY FRIENDS BEER settled in the clear behind the pacesetters, rallied wide then
flattened out. JUMP FOR ALEX lacked speed between rivals then some showed energy wide late. WENTZ dueled in the two path then proved empty in the
stretch. RUNNINGFORHOME hustled to a narrow advantage inside, dueled to the stretch and faded. PIER FORTY lagged far behind outside and was
never a factor. FOREST FIRE chased wide and gave way readily.

Footnotes
MALIBU STAR trailed early, bid strongly inside, was blocked between foes in midstretch then surged away when clear. EXPENSIVE CUT stalked the
pacesetters inside, angled out on the turn and finished willingly. RYE SENSE OF HUMOR lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and into the stretch
rallying. UNCLE GARY G forced the pace outside, led briefly in midstretch then weakened. SKY TEMPLE dropped far behind then offered some late
energy. MAINE earned a narrow lead inside to the stretch and faltered. TOUGH TICKETS stalked the pacesetters outside then proved empty in the stretch.
JUST A THOUGHT was urged close up outside then was finished after half a mile. MUSK dropped back in the two path and gave way.

rivals down the backstretch, led narrowly to late but was nailed nearing the wire. FLASHING DIAMOND lacked speed inside then finished willingly in the
stretch. LIVE AID earned a narrow lead inside, dueled to midstretch then tired while remaining game. SNOW FORECAST raced close up between foes,
faded on the turn then came again while no threat. WILDCATTIN forced the pace three wide to the quarter pole and faltered. HAPPY LOUDON chased very
wide, was eased back into the far turn and had no further response. PEAK OF CHIC prompted the pace six wide to the turn then faltered.
