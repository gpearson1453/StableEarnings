Footnotes
ROAD SLEW raced close inside on the opening turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod at the quarter pole, drew clear midway
on the far turn and was kept sharp through the lane. ORANGEBURG saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and had to settle for second best. IN THE LIMELIGHT broke a step slow and rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, raced through the far turn still in the four path and came along for third the final strides. NEVERFOLD settled off the rail the
first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. COUNTRY OUTLAW angled to the inside
and set the pace inside, dug in to the pressure of Road Slew leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead to that one at the quarter, dropped back
midway on the far turn and weakened. KVELLION ran loose in the post parade, rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. HARDIN broke a step slow and dropped well back. This race was hand timed.

LADY KAZA quickly took over and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. DEVILISH BEAUTY rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three and four paths and dueled through the stretch for second. MORTAL STORM came through the first turn
in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then angled to the five path into the lane and closed for third later
yards. HAD THE NOTION stalked the early pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final
sixteenth. MARY'S JEWEL raced just off the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path
then weakened the final sixteenth. JUST A BIT SASSY raced well back. Per Stewards Ruling #57, Had The Notion is disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
SECRET SWIRL was bumped inward and into Siente El Amor then rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, steadily progressed in the four path of the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. TAXIT saved early ground, bid nearing
the three eighths pole and surged to a clear lead midway on the far turn, but, was met mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. RED HOT TODDY
stalked the early pace four wide, took a slim lead at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, was caught past the quarter,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. TIMMY took a slim lead into the first turn but was caught at the nine sixteenths pole, gave
chase nearing the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened into the lane. SIENTE EL AMOR was bumped at the break then stalked the
early pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, altered course leaving the eighth pole but showed little further.
ROCKET BALLAD broke a step slow and never factored. LOGSTRADAMUS broke in and made contactd with Secret Swirl, stalked the early pace three
wide then faded past the five sixteenths pole. CHARTERED COURSE showed little response.

Footnotes
TOUGH ONE set a pressured pace while tapering inward, dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn and
dug in determinedly to draw clear later yards. LA REINA SUSAN gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch but dug in under steady
encouragement to take second under the wire. JESS FOR KICKS contested the pace inside and dueled at even terms leaving the five sixteenths pole,
raced a close factor at the rail on the turn, relented mid-stretch and was nipped from second under the wire. HIDDEN PERSUASION settled back off the rail
early on, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail most of the turn, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and finished
evenly to pass rivals. SEE THAT GIRL gave early chase toward the outside, steadied off the heels of Noble City past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
turn about the six path then flattened. SUPERSTASIA raced in tight quarters in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the turn and finished
evenly. HOLY PINK chased outside, rounded the turn about the seven path, left the turn outside and showed little more. HURRICANE DIRECTOR was
crowded, exchanged contact with PRINCESS MIA ROSE and checked in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and was no factor afterward. PRINCESS MIA
ROSE was crowded, exahanged contact with Hurricane Director and checked in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and was no factor afterward. NOBLE
CITY gave close early chase, came in a bit past the three eighths pole then faded in the three path on the turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry and
reviewed the incident in the vicinity of the three eighths pole before deciding on making no changes.
