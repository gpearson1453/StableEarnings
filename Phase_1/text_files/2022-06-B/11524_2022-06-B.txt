gamely inside of the winner and battled to the end. FEAST dueled inside for the early lead, chased on the turn, weakened and saved the show spot. HE'S
SMOKIN NOW raced off the early pace, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. POWERFULLY BUILT broke in a tangle, then raced off the rail, off the pace,

Footnotes
STOLEN HOLIDAY set a comfortable pace on the inside, showed the way on her own into the far turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane,
finished willingly drifting a bit off the inside and won clear. VIGILANTES WAY tracked the pace while saving ground throughout, moved up inside on the far
turn, responded when asked, closed gamely inside but second best. LEMISTA (IRE) hopped at the start, settled off the pace with a ground saving trip,
moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and earned the show spot. FLUFFY SOCKS trailed the field early on, raced three wide on
the backside, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and was outkicked for third. ALMS raced off the pace between horses on
the first turn, then settled inside, two wide on the far turn, angled out at the eighth pole and closed belatedly. WHIMSICAL MUSE stalked close up two wide,
chased two wide on the far turn and weakened. PRINCESS GRACE bobbled slightly at the start, pulled early racing three wide, then stalked two wide,
chased between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

HOME BREW tracked close up on the inside, saved ground entering the far turn, slipped out midway on the turn, made a strong three wide bid at the
quarter pole, quickly took charge, responded when asked, pulled away under urging and coasted the final seventy yards. ELECTABILITY broke through the
gate prior, reloaded quickly, pressed the pace in the two path, bid on the far turn, dueled briefly between rivals, then dug in gamely outside of
CYBERVIKING in the stretch run and earned the place spot. CYBERVIKING sent early to secure the lead, set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the
far turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and was outfinished for second. MR JEFFERSON raced off the pace, had an inside trip, closed
belatedly on the rail and was up late for fourth. COOKE CREEK drifted out entering the first turn, bumped a rival and was checked, then stalked between
rivals, chased between on the far turn and tired. JAMIE DREAMS stalked three wide, chased three wide, chased on the far turn and tired. KING OF

Footnotes
MIND CONTROL set the pace on the inside racing with a clear early lead, then was pressured by HOT ROD CHARLIE, dueled with that rival on the far turn,
dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run, battled back determinedly inside in deep stretch and prevailed at the wire. HOT ROD CHARLIE settled nicely in
the early stages, stalked two wide on the backside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with MIND CONTROL into the stretch, put a head in front
nearing the furlong marker, then dug in gamely outside in a spirited stretch duel and was outfinished late. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT raced two wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and finished well in the stretch run for the show award. PHAT MAN raced three wide early,
stalked outside, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. MOHAAFETH raced off the pace inside, dropped back on the far turn and did not factor.
