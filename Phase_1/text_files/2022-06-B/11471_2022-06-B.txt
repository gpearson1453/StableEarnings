SAMURAI LEGACY set the pace inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the lane and held under steady pressure. K'S LITTLE BILL tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of
the rest. AJZAL broke a step slowly from the gate, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide, then drifted in and edged up for the show.
CATHMOR bobbled at the start, was well placed outside, held position three wide through the turn, then weakened the final furlong. GRAZED MY
BISCUITS stalked the pace on the outside, could not match strides with the leader through the turn, then faded in the lane. DONALD well placed and
between rivals, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, angled out and faded.

missed. ROLLING MO unhurried in the early going, held position on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well for the
show. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and edged up for a share.
LADY MARVEL sprinted to a long lead soon after the start and weakened the final furlong. WILD LOOKER was a brief factor. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY
hopped and broke awkwardly at the start, tracked the pace, then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, held that margin through the second turn, then dueled inside the
furlong marker, trading the advantage with FEETS OF FEATHER and nose out that one on the wire. FEETS OF FEATHER tracked the pace, saved ground
through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, dueled with the winner late, trading the advantage and was outfinished.
PEACEFUL SURPRISE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid, then drifted in slightly, was corrected
and lacked the needed late kick. SWEET MOOCHIE steadied slightly at the start, moved up on the two path through the second turn, was blocked and
steadied along waiting, then evened when clear. CASCADE PARK broke in at the start, taking SWWEET MOOCHIE'S path, then moved up two and three
wide through the second turn and had no stretch rally.

THE SINNER IS YOU tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader, then made a steady gain, shook clear and drew
off late. STEVIS MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and
held the place. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. UNFLAPPABLE MAX allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) well placed, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the lane and weakened. INCLUSIVE was

Footnotes
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX well placed and outside, gained position into the turn, held that position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into
the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead late and held. SQUIRREL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final furlong, then
could not threaten, while clearly best of the rest. WHISKEY DASH never far back, was unhurried and three wide to the stretch, bid on that path into the lane
and closed well for the show. RAYO COLORADO chased the pace on the inside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and flattened out. FIGHTIN PHIL well placed, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlonhg. HOUSE LIGHTS ran evenly. TITHED was no factor, widest.
