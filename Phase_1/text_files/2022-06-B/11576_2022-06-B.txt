Footnotes
MUNCH in hand early, gradually angled to the outside, went for the lead when allowed into the bend, edged ahead entering the lane, was put to a drive with
a furlong to go, floated out some under left-handed urging, lugged back in when switched to right-handed pressure and finished with steady hand urging.
CALL ME DROSSEL advanced from outside to gain the lead after a furlong and a half, was challenged from outside on the turn and was no match for
MUNCH, though under a steady drive, in the stretch. WILLIE ATTACK was hustled to the early lead and the rail, lost the advantage after the first furlong and
a half, came off the rail some on the bend and steadily gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
WILLOW RIDGE broke alertly, shared the lead from outside, moved in beside RIPE ATTACK nearing the bend, was asked leaving the turn, edged ahead
under hand urging then began to draw off the final sixteenth while kept task. W W RUSSIAN GOLD altered in some trying to keep a clear path inside RIPE
ATTACK shortly after entering the main track, bumped PENALTY SHOT, was corrected and steadied several times in traffic, boxed in on the turn, altered
out four wide when a path opened upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but edged ahead for second near the wire. BEL BIMBO forwardly placed
outside, advanced four wide on the turn, came widest into the lane, closed the gap belatedly the last eighth and was outfinished for the place. RIPE
ATTACK gradually angled in as he vied for the early lead, was just off the inside through the turn then slowly wore down the final furlong. PENALTY SHOT,
bumped after the first half furlong, was well placed inside but began to flatten out the last quarter mile.

Footnotes
KIANA'S LOVE soon had the advantage between horses, moved clear when asked upper stretch, was put to a drive the last furlong and continued to widen
command. ARCH FLYER showed first, was soon chasing KIANA'S LOVE from just outside, loomed a serious threat on the bend, proved no match for the
latter when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for second. LOUIE P prominent from inside, gained third along the rail on the turn, drew away for
the show upper stretch but could only hold her position late. JUKEBOX MONEY very reluctant to load, was a step slow once the race began, moved up
quickly between horses to help prompt the pace but began to fade from inside before finishing four furlongs. BOWS N LACE was squeezed and bobbled
shortly after the start, settled, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, stayed off the rail taking the turn, angled out widest midstretch and lacked a significant
response. HALO COUTURE pressed from outside, was four wide taking the bend then gave way for the drive.

TIME BREAK broke on top, was soon clear, showed the way in hand from inside, was challenged on the bend, moved clear again when asked upper stretch
and held on under steady handling. GHAALEB'S RANGER reluctant to load, broke with the pack but soon trailed, responded to urging to advance from
outside on the turn, floated out to path five entering the lane, was all out and edged ahead for second inside the final sixteenth. WILDCAT BOBBIE angled in
slightly after leaving the chute, bumped solidly with JUST A WONDER, was two wide taking the turn, altered out for a clear path midstretch and was also
closing in on the leader late. JUST A WONDER broke inwards and was quickly steadied, advanced between horses, was bumped solidly at the end of a half
furlong, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside TIME BREAK on the turn but slowly wore down for the drive. DIAMOND STELLAR was a contender
from inside on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
SAMARITA rated off the early speed, was three wide taking the turn, angled out some upper stretch, responded to a steady drive the final furlong, gradually
lugged in under right-handed pressure through the waning yards but got up in time. CARSON RESERVE settled at the back, saved ground through the
bend, gained a clear path along the rail upper stretch, surged, while all out the last eighth, came up short but caught MY MORNING GAL for second. MY
MORNING GAL pressed the early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, vied for the lead inside the final furlong, edged ahead inside the sixteenth
marker but lacked the extra needed between horses nearing the wire. PLAY TWENTY vied for the early lead from inside, moved ahead on the bend, came
off the rail some upper stretch and began to wear down inside the last eighth. MENDING contested the pace just outside PLAY TWENTY on the
backstretch, was in tight quarters briefly nearing the end of four furlongs, began to retreat leaving the quarter pole, angled outside MY MORNING GAL
upper stretch and continued to gradually yield. BEZEL SET chased from outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SACRED STORM broke on top, was rated on the front end just off the inside, took the rail into the turn, was roused with two furlongs to go, floated out
slightly as she moved clear upper stretch, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards but held sway. DUSTY MILLER prominent
from outside, was crowded and brushed several times in the early going, did not keep up three wide on the bend, was under steady urging through the lane,
moved clear for second inside the last sixteenth then did not have the extra needed nearing the wire. WATCHIN THE WHEELS was settled at the back and
well off the inside, picked up her pace from path three on the turn, drifted out some entering the stretch, closed well but was too late. LINDALOUIMAGE
raced in contention from inside, fanned out some coming into the lane, lost her path, altered to the rail near the furlong marker and made up minor ground
deep stretch. AFOOLER angled out some shortly after entering the main track, brushed several times with DUSTY MILLER, gained a clear path midway on
the backstretch and soon vied for the lead outside SACRED STORM, edged ahead on the turn but gradually wore down between rivals in the stretch.

Footnotes
CITY POSITION bumped with KING TITO shortly after the break, was rated just off the early leader, took the advantage on the bend, slowly drifted out
leaving the turn, came into the lane from path four, moved clear, was put to a drive nearing the last furlong, gradually drifted out despite right-handed urging
but narrowly held on between rivals. RENEGADE BOB well off the early speed, picked up his pace after two furlongs, closed the gap just off the inside on
the turn, fanned out behind CITY POSITION entering the stretch, altered to the inside soon after, came into contention, steadily drifted out the final
sixteenth, was too late for the win but edged ahead for the place. DARK NINJA was a step slow at the start, advanced from outside to press the early
leader, vied for the lead on the bend, was carried out by CITY POSITION leaving the turn and entering the lane, retreated slightly, gradually moved out as
CITY POSITION came out in the late going, finished evenly but was easily best of the rest. BABA LOU came off the inside early on, followed RENEGADE
BOB on the turn, fanned outside that one for the stretch run and made up minor ground the final furlong. FAST ONE bumped the rear of KING TITO shortly
after the start and steadied briefly, soon moved out widest and was never a factor. KING TITO bumped with CITY POSITION after the break then FAST
ONE, was hustled to the lead and the inside, was challenged after two furlongs and gave way after three-eighths.
