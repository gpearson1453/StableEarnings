was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. DODROPIN saved ground while racing close up early, steadied nearing the half mile pole in tight, angled out
three-wide nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly for the place. SASSY EDIE broke out then set the pace while racing along the inside, drifted off
the rail slightly late and held on fairly well for the show.. BEAU ROCKS broke in, then was prominently place while racing three-wide on the turn, came
four-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SHELBY R. was forwardly placed while racing between horses to the stretch and came up empty during the

Footnotes
DESHAMBEAU was prominent from the start while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. MISTER MIDAS saved
ground stalking the pace, steadied nearing the quarter pole briefly when Parker's Gold fell, responded when clear and finished well for the place from along
the inside. LLOYDS LOGIC broke in, then was unhurried early, moved up along the outside, steadied avoiding the fallen horse at the quarter pole, came
three-wide into the stretch and was going well at the finish. IT'S TURBO dropped back early, checked nearing the quarter pole trying to avoid the fallen
horses and finished willingly when clear. GUNNIN FOR GOLD sprinted clear at once, saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and tired. NASHVILLE
SKYLINE lacked early speed, checked nearing the quarter pole and failed to threaten. SECRET SAGA raced three-wide on the turn, attempted to jump over
his fallen rival and unseated his rider and was walked off. PARKER'S GOLD moved up between to force the pace on the turn, appeared to take a bad step
and fell nearing the quarter pole and was vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the running of the race, but after viewing the films, made no
changed in the order of finish.

DYF was never far back, moved up four-wide to join the leaders, dueled with Jersey Red for the final three-sixteenths and prevailed in a stiff drive. JERSEY
RED stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up inside of Dyf on the turn, dueled with him from that point point and lost a tough decision in a game effort.
MISO FAST saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out for room entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. TUMAC MOUNTAIN
stumbled at the start, then moved up between horses to prompt the early pace and weakened. TRIBAL IMPACT raced two-wide on the turn and lacked a
rally. BLUE BOY WHO saved ground setting the pressured pace to near the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SIR DEPUTY saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly during the drive and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive. WINE AT NINE saved ground
while being allowed to settle in stride, waited room nearing the quarter pole, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. CANDIED LUTE disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened slightly late. CREST DRIVE raced four-wide and finished willingly. BLOOD RED MOON .was off a step
slow, then was dropped back, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.. ZATTER was unhurried early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter
pole and failed to factor. ORCADIAN STORM prompted the early pace from between horses and tired.

Footnotes
HYDROGEN was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside, hesitated lacking room nearing the quarter pole, angled out three-wide for room in
the stretch and finished strongly to be up late. JEDI KNIGHT stalked the pace while racing along the inside, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole to
join the leader, dueled for the from that point, but wasn't quite good enough. MIKE OPERATOR dueled for the lead from along the inside, responded to
pressure and held on gamely during the drive. ROCKY TOUGH was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter mile and gained his best stride too
late. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT dropped back early, angled out to move while racing four-wide the final quarter and finished in a mild rally. HEY SEQUOIA failed
to threaten while saving ground. WESTERN RULE dueled for the lead from along the outside to near the stretch and gave way.
