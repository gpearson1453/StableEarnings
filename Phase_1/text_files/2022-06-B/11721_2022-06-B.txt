GREENRIDGE THUNDER was sent from the inside to set the early pace from the inside, raced well clear near the eighth pole and held under strong
handling. SOUTHERN SENSE broke in, bumped rival at the break, stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three wide through the far turn and kept on
to the wire to finish second best. HORSE DADDY raced in tight at the break, dropped to the back of the pack early on, made an advance through the far
turn, raced four wide through the upper stretch and moved up late. MIZZEN MAN chased the early pace from the inside and weakened a bit through the
drive. INKOSI settled off the early pace, raced in tight and checked near the quarter pole, eased out race five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had
not enough. FLAGSTONE was bumped soundly at the break, dropped off the early pace, raced three deep and lacked a bid. ON SPOT tracked the leader
while racing two wide early on and faded.

LAKESIDE MUSIC was off step slow, rated early on under a snug hold from the inside, swung out four wide through the upper stretch and prevailed late
under all out pressure. LITURGIA pressed My Baton Rouge from the outside while two wide, had a narrow advantage near the eighth pole, dug in late and
missed in a game effort. JANIS JOPLIN was off slowly, settled near the back of the pack early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted three
wide and gained ground on the top pair late. SHE'LL NEVER KNOW chased the early pace, raced three to four wide in the lane and had not enough. MY
BATON ROUGE showed good early speed to set the early pressured pace from the inside and weakened a bit nearing the eighth pole to the wire. GONNA

FAMILY MAN tracked the early leader while racing two wide, took command through the upper stretch and held gamely to be clear under strong handling.
LEADER OF MEN stalked the pace from the inside, continued to race near the inside at the quarter pole, eased out three to four wide through the drive and
finished second best. ALL WEST was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted four wide and moved up late. INDIAN
GULCH was bumped, squeezed back at the break, angled wide through the stretch run and made a good late bid. EXULTING was rated along early and
weakened through the drive while racing four to five wide. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN broke in, bumped with rival, settled off the early going, raced three
deep and lacked a rally. HOME RUN TRICK showed good early speed to cross over early on to set the pace and gave way the final furlong while racing
near the rail. EAGLE PASS failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
DOROTA settled off the early pace, moved up four to five through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to be clear late
under strong handling. CONTESSINA was allowed to settle early on, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, angled out to work through traffic in the stretch
run to race two to three wide and made a good late rally. MRS. NUSHI was off slowly, raced near the inside down the backstretch, shifted six wide through
the upper stretch and moved up late. LUNAR ICE was away slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, made an advance three deep through the far
turn, angled out six wide in the drive and showed good late interest. OAXACA was forwardly placed to lay just off the early leader down the backstretch,
raced in a bit tight near the three eighths pole and weakened a bit in the drive while racing three wide. RUFA RED KNOT was coaxed along early, raced two
wide between nearing the far turn and tired the final eighth of a mile. OPEN SAYS ME was off slowly, raced off the pace, raced six wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had no late rally. LUNCH LADY was quick to begin to cross over set the early pace and gave way in the drive while racing along the
inside. COOL CAROL was coaxed along early and faded.
