Footnotes
HIS ROYAL G stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, dueled for command with PROUD CIVILIAN leaving the turn, then slowly got
the best of that rival leaving the sixteenth marker and edged clear under right handed crop urging. PROUD CIVILIAN set the early pace while clear early and
in the two path, then was headed leaving the turn and dug in gamely in the drive but was out kicked late while staying on to be clearly second best. LATE
NIGHT LARRY tracked the early pace and then dropped back on the turn while saving ground, then lacked the needed rally while besting the rest. GHOST
OF KHOZAN was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was two to three wide on the turn and had no rally. ESPRESSO LUNGO was outrun early and
saved ground on the turn and was never a threat. DOUBLE O OTTO chased the early pace and made a four to five wide bid on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM was settled while four wide on the backstretch, made a four to five wide move on the far turn, took over leaving the turn and drew
clear to prove best under a drive. EVEN THUNDER was four wide into the first turn, tracked the early pace and then went up to vie for the lead four wide on
the backstretch, continued on four to three wide on the far turn but could not match strides with the winner while staying on for the place award.
BERMONDSEY was three wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace early three wide, then vied for command to the inside of EVEN THUNDER but while
in the three path, then continued to battle on through the turn and then gave way grudgingly, bested rest. PAY THE KID was void of early speed, advanced
four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and offered a belated rally. GENERAL PADDY pressed the pace on the inside and weakened.
SOCIAL GROUP was rated along between rivals and had no rally. WALL chased the pace on the inside and tired. RUNNER RUNNER INDY was five wide
into the first turn, then had a wide journey and stopped.

R AVERIE LYNN was well placed early and on the inside on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn and then edged clear after a long drive to prove
best. SNACKSTER tracked the pacesetter three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn to go on even terms with the winner nearing the furlong marker
but was outfinished after a long drive. HUSH Y'ALL was reserved early, then was five wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and rallied well on
the far outside. THEA'S THEME was allowed to settle early and was on the inside on the turn, lacked the needed rally while saving ground. DOMINEER set
the pace while two wide and clear, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE was reserved early, raced four wide on the
turn and came five wide into the lane and had no rally. AWESOME VIEW stumbled at the start and then raced two wide and failed to menace.

NEW DRAMA prompted the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, led by the sixteenth pole and then held sway late to prove best under a drive.
LIKELY CHOICE was allowed to settle early, was on the inside on the turn, eased out and came five wide into the lane and closed well to just miss.
CINDY'S PRAYER set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the furlong marker and then yielded, stayed on to best the rest. ROSY APPLE
tracked the early pace and was on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive but had no punch in the drive. WILLOW DRIVE was reserved
early, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the drive and had a belated rally. INANNA'S QUEST was settled early while three to four wide on the turn and
had no rally. MOON ME AGAIN lacked a rally. KASHAN chased the pace three wide, then bolted on the turn and lost the rider, walked off. The Stewards
had an INQUIRY into the running around the turn and after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TRICK was reserved early, advanced five wide on the far turn, continued that bid and drew away in the furlong grounds to prove much the best,
driving. BENNY'S FIDDLE was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and then went up to prompt the pace leaving the half mile marker,
made a three to two wide bid on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. SECRET SOULMATE prompted the
early pace three wide, then went on to set a pressured pace leaving the half mile marker, moved down to the inside on the far turn while dueling for
command but weakened in the drive, bested rest. CONNECTING tracked the pace along the inside, shifted out two wide to pass the early pacesetter by the
seven sixteenths, then back to the inside on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and was empty. MARCONIS set the pace on the inside and gave
way. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR chaased the pace three to four wide and then was eased in the drive.
