Footnotes
COLOR FAST saved ground from just off the pace through the final turn, angled out four wide and closed willingly to be up final jump. WHEN'S TEE TIME
was in the two path through the first turn then advanced up the backstretch to be in contention through the final turn and took the lead at the quarter pole but
was caught late in the drive. CALLINGINTHENIGHT broke well to lead just off the rail then battled through the final turn and fought gamely down the stretch
for the show. ANICLUDE was in the five path around the first turn then moved to challenge after a half but weakened in the stretch. VINCITORE was in the
two path around the first turn made a mild four wide bid on the backstretch but was never a serious threat. COWBOY HAY HAY was rank going around the
first turn by floated out to the five path then was in tight going into the backstretch, was taken back and was never a factor. JOCKEY OF ANICLUDE
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST WHEN'S TEE TIME FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
SEVEN FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME WAS 127.19.

Footnotes
LUCKY CRUSADER was pinched back at the start, was placed just off the rail in the middle of the pack made a four wide bid on the final turn and took
command at the quarter pole and drew clear. ACCEL JOE raced near the back from the three path to final turn moved out to five path to make a bid but
didn't have enough to catch the winner. BACKGATE RED broke to the outside, was forwardly placed in the two path made a three wide bid into the final turn
and improved late. FALCON HEAVY broke to the inside, then raced in the two path in the middle of the pack around the first turn and down the backstretch,
in tight in upper stretch, angled out at the eighth pole to make a mild gain. UNBRIDLED HOPE went to the lead from just off the rail to set the pace for a half
then retreated. MOONSHINE SURFER was off a step slow then trailed the field into the upper stretch, went five wide into the stretch and ran erratic in the
drive but was not a threat. INCARCERATE saved ground throughout while stalking the pace and never made a serious bid. DEMURO tracked the leaders
from the two path through the final turn and bumped with rival in the upper stretch and gave way.
