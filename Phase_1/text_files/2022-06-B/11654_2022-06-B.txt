Footnotes
GOSHEN GIRL dueled on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader around the turn, blew the turn coming into the stretch, ended up
in the middle of the track and gained ground outside from there to get up in the final jump. AMARI S. brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
stalked the frontrunners up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, gained ground between horses late and was caught at the wire.
LALUCHADORA chased the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, gained ground in upper stretch and
finished evenly. WATERMARK dueled on the inside in the early going, led the field while saving ground around the turn and weakened late. BEING
CREATIVE was blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and
flattened out in the final furlong. NEW CHINA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.
VICTORIA'S DOLL veered out leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still
entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
QUILTING PARTY settled two wide in the rear pair, continued patiently into the backstretch, began to inch forward near the five eighths, circled foes
comfortably in the five path around the far turn, raced five wide into the lane, drove to the lead near the three sixteenths, and continued to draw off under a
hand ride through the final furlong while racing a bit greenly. DRAGONFLY KISSES tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair
down the backstretch and in the four path on the far turn, came into the lane in the three path while chasing the leading flight, angled out, proved no match
for QUILTING PARTY but kept on willingly three deep to prove best of the rest. FULLY AWARE was a bit keen to the lead, was engaged by UNION PARK
GAL down the backstretch but kept on unfazed, edged clear again into the far turn, set the pace in the two path around that bend, carried a narrowing lead
into upper stretch as UNION PARK GAL and then QUILTING PARTY engaged, had no answer for QUILTING PARTY past the three sixteenths, and was
outfinished for the place. READY AT MIDNIGHT settled at the rear inside of QUILTING PARTY early, inched up inside of LOCASH into the backstretch,
raced at the rear in the three path around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, and kept on mildly past tiring horses in the lane. UNION PARK GAL
(IRE) tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, was keen into the backstretch to engage outside of FULLY AWARE, tracked that foe in the three
path around the far turn after that one edged back clear, reengaged outside FULLY AWARE past the five sixteenths, was turned back in upper stretch,
chased on between horses to the sixteenth and weakened late. HARD LIKE HOLLY chased midpack while saving ground, went to a drive in upper stretch
and weakened. LOCASH settled at the rear of the main group, raced between horses in the rear flight past the five eighths, took the far turn in the two path,
raced three to four wide in upper stretch, and mustered no rally.

JOY ENAMORADA angled over to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and held that margin to the wire. BELLS OF JOY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and
gained ground on the outside late. FRIEND trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late between horses. TAP N TWINE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going,
began a mild bid while racing in the three path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. HEY MA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. CERTAIN HEARTS tracked the leaders
on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch.

POWERFUL MAN stalked the pace three wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, engaged outside of BLOOMING GARDEN near the
seven sixteenths and pressed him in the three path around the far turn, drifted out significantly from upper stretch but nonetheless remained engaged, led at
the sixteenth, and cleared late. BLOOMING GARDEN sett the pace inside while taking some pressure from CAPTAIN CARNEGIE, was pressured by
POWERFUL MAN while racing in the two path on the far turn, was engaged by POWERFUL MAN into the lane, continued to vie while drifting out from
upper stretch, and could not hold the winner at bay in the final sixteenth. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE prompted the pace between horses, settled back to chase
the leading pair while saving ground around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch, drifted out midstretch and carried out MADELYNS HEAT slightly,
proved no match for the leading pair in the final furlong but was safe for third. MADELYNS HEAT raced two wide with the rear flight through the clubhouse
turn, edged closer three wide into the backstretch, chased in the four path while hand urged around the far turn, was driven into upper stretch, got carried
out slightly by CAPTAIN CARNEGIE through midstretch, but ultimately lacked the needed kick in the final furlong. WHERE'S LUCKY settled at the rear
inside early, continued at the rear down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the far turn, dropped inside of ON THE MUSCLE into the lane and
had no rally. ON THE MUSCLE settled near the rear, edged a bit closer between horses into the backstretch, chased near the rear in the three to four path
on the far turn and came up empty in the lane. LEE LA DEW chased inside, pulled up past the nine sixteenths, walked onto the van and was vanned off.

Footnotes
JACK'S ADVANTAGE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear with a
furlong to go and held that margin to the wire. ANDREW THE GIANT tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and
chased the eventual winner home. NYOMAN pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path
and finished evenly. Z U SOON raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, improved position in upper
stretch and was outkicked from there. GRAND HIDEAWAY chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three and four
path and faded on the far outside in the stretch. CONTRACTION broke sharply and dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, began to give way
while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire while drifting out in the final furlong. YALIKEANYTHING trailed the field through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and came up empty from there. OUR THOMAS raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out late.

TWO EMMYS tracked the leader inside of BIZZEE CHANNEL early, settled back to chase behind that foe and LAVENDER EARL into the first turn, chased
inside foes down the backstretch, was boxed in while racing in the two path around the far turn, found room to pop out three wide nearing the quarter pole,
bumped with BIZZEE CHANNEL to his inside in upper stretch, continued unfazed under a drive, reeled in BETWITHBOTHHANDS near the furlong mark
and kicked away. CAPTIVATING MOON settled at the rear, took closer order past the five eighths, raced at the rear of the main group in the three path on
the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied willingly down the lane under a drive but could not get to the winner. BETWITHBOTHHANDS was sent to the
lead, set the pace through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was engaged by BIZZEE CHANNEL to his outside into the far turn but maintained
a narrow lead, repelled that foe in upper stretch despite drifting out, dug in when challenged by TWO EMMYS, reluctantly relinquished the lead midstretch,
and was outfinished for the place. CURRENT settled near the rear, pulled between horses past the five eighths and improved to midfield, chased four wide
around the far turn, was outkicked by the leading group into the lane but remained interested and improved mildly late while drifting out. BIZZEE CHANNEL
was very keen early while held to track behind the leader, continued to track the leader while a bit better settled down the backstretch, was pushed along for
a bid between horses approaching the far turn, prompted two wide around the far turn, bumped with TWO EMMYS in upper stretch, drifted out and carried
TWO EMMYS out with him, and flattened from near the furlong mark. TEMPER TANTRUM chased midfield early, settled back outside of CURRENT into the
clubhouse turn, improved to midfield three wide past the five eighths outside of a keen CURRENT, weakened in the three path on the far turn and had no
more for the drive. LAVENDER EARL was keen three wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader outside of BIZZEE CHANNEL, came three wide into
the far turn, was outpaced from the three eighths, raced four wide into the lane and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to edge clear while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to draw off down
the lane. CHOPPER dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leader from the two and three path
coming around the turn, and was no match for the winner in the stretch. W W KAN DO chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and finished evenly on the outside. OFFLEE FUN brushed with the horse to his inside leaving
the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground between horses
late. GIVIN UP NONE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. GREELEYS ICE raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and came up
empty in the stretch. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path
and flattened out in the lane. PITAMAN brushed with the horse to outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, saved ground
around the turn and tired from there. SKOL FACTOR hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing
in the three path around the turn and was not a factor.

the lane inside, and chased evenly down the lane. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY chased toward the rear into the clubhouse turn, continued patiently down the

path, raced four wide into the lane and came up empty under a drive. DARE GOES DA DEVIL settled toward the rear, raced two wide on the far turn and

into the far turn, was headed by SIMPLE LOGIC past the three eighths, remained in close order to upper stretch and emptied out in the lane. DEWY'S HIT

Footnotes
TRAIL RIDGE ROAD settled toward the rear, took closer order approaching the half, split horses into the far turn and launched a three wide bid, engaged
outside of TANGO CITY approaching the quarter, was driven in upper stretch, led at the furlong mark and kicked clear. TANGO CITY set the pace inside
while clear, was engaged by TRAIL RIDGE ROAD nearing the quarter, maintained a narrow lead under a drive in upper stretch, was caught at the furlong
mark but chased on well enough to save the place. VIEWERS DISCRETION chased outside of MISS KITTY PIE through the clubhouse turn and into the
back straight, joined the tracking flight between horses approaching the far turn, raced in range in the two to three path around the far turn while inside of
WANDA STRONG, chased the leading pair with continuing interest under a drive in the lane, proved no match for the winner and could not quite reel in the
pacesetter for place. TAKE JOY was lightly bumped by LEA'S DREAMER in the opening strides, settled near the rear between horses, took gradually closer
order down the backstretch as the field contracted, improved in the four path around the far turn, swung five to six wide into the lane, and kept on willingly to
the finish. MISS KITTY PIE chased inside of VIEWERS DISCRETION early, was relegated to midpack approaching the far turn as the field took closer
order, chased in the two path on the far turn, bid inside into the lane, and chased on mildly. WANDA STRONG floated wide into the first turn, dropped back
in to track the leading pair, tracked three wide down the backstretch, bid four wide into the far turn, raced in the tracking flight four wide on the far turn, was
outkicked by the leading trio in upper stretch and flattened between. LEA'S DREAMER broke inward and bumped TAKE JOY in the opening strides, settled
at the rear of the main pack, raced three wide at the rear of the main pack down the back straight, trailed the main group while racing in the four path around
the far turn, swung six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. BACKSTAGE BAMBI was rank inside into the first turn, raced near the rear, was driven
in the three path on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. SHE TAKES FLIGHT raced keenly early, tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn and
down the back straight, was swallowed up into the far turn, weakened between horses around the far turn while driven, and had nothing further for the drive.
FEATURED POWER was taken to the rear while a bit keen into the first turn, always raced well behind the rest of the field and was allowed to trail home.
HALF MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.
