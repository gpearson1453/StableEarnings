Footnotes
JOJOMAR set the early pace while clear and removed from the rail, then let the loose horse go by to the inside leaving the three eighths marker, then drew
off in the drive to prove much the best, ridden out. MOTI was allowed to settle early, moved to the inside and made a bid on the turn, swung out four wide for
the drive and finished willingly while no match to the winner, second best. CURLINGTON steadied after the start to avoid the fallen rider, then raced four to
five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn while trying to lug out, then was empty in the lane. BAVARIA chased the pace four to three
wide on the backstretch and tired. SPIKES SHIRL was settled early on the inside, made a four wide middle move and tired. DRENA'S BULLET stumbled at
the start and lost the rider, walked off. The Stewards posted an INQUIRY concerning the start but the race was left as is.

COLBALOAF was away alertly to set the pace on the inside and while clear, drew off on the turn, then remained clear to prove best under mild urging.
YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA tracked the early pace two wide into the first turn, then shifted to the outside on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and
finished willingly to finish on even terms for the place award. LOXODROME tracked the winner and then chased the winner three wide, came four wide into
the lane and kept on to finish on even terms for the place award, needed more. FOLE'S NOTION was allowed to settle on the inside, was two wide leaving
the turn and had a mild rally. BE YOURSELF was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out two to three wide leaving the turn, then
dived back to the inside and had a late rally but hung late. PRATT was settled three wide and weakened. COMMODORE PERRY dropped back. SWEEPIN

Footnotes
SAVAGERY dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then drew off leaving the turn and then lasted late to prove best under
left handed crop urging. PECOS BILL was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, angled off the inside and closed well. COLOUR GUARD
was settled three wide early, came five wide into the drive, rallied but was outfinished for the place award late. WONDER IN dueled for the lead on the
inside, then was lugging out on the turn, then continued to drift out in the lane while weakening. GRANDFIRE chased the pace and was three wide on the
turn, weakened.
