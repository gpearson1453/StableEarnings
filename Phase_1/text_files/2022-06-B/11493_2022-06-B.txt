Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied between horses, made a late run and surged in deep stretch to be up
in time. BASSO raced close up three wide early, then stalked the dueling leaders, bid two wide on the turn, rallied to a short lead, edged away and dug in
gamely to the finish. EXUMA (IRE) was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, made a three wide bid on the turn, dueled and was outkicked. LARGER THAN
LIFE raced off the pace inside, steadied and was shuffled back entering the far turn, then came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. ROAD TO
MEATH dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the backside, briefly shook free entering the far turn, then dug in on the rail and weakened late. SPARK (PER)
raced off the pace, had an inside trip and lacked a rally. HURRICANE ANDREW dueled two wide and gave way on the far turn.
