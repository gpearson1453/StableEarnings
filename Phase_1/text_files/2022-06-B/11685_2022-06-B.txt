lead racing three deep in upper stretch edging out to win clear in a very impressive effort. ENJOY BASEBALL went evenly to the far turn picking it up there
vying between horses in upper stretch proving game late though second best. AUTS REVOLUTION sent clear set the pace holding daylight through the far

rally there at mid track to best the others. TILL THEN was never involved. KITCHI chased the pace extending in pursuit on the far turn wearing out in upper
stretch. UNCLE CARLITO stalked the pace looming a threat on the far turn before wilting abruptly in upper stretch.
