stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. THISAINTJUMPSTREET tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, came
through on that path into the stretch and closed well for the place. HOXIE angled out through the first turn to stalk the leader outside, took command from
that one down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged through the second turn and weakened the final furlong. SECRET TEMPLE never far back,
saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and weakened. LACEE well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide

Footnotes
FIERCE WARRIOR rated back in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear. ADIOS BOBBY well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader
into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. GOLDEN OAK allowed to settle, moved up on the two path
through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then drifted out while gaining in the lane. WHOOPS stalked the pace in the early going, dropped
back and angled in through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. KOOSMAN tracked the
pace, lost some ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and faded. BAHAMIAN PARK allowed to settle, improved position, inside.
PUNX sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. HOMEMADE
MOONSHINE four wide through the first turn, was well placed outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn, then had no rally.

TRIPLE R RATED sprinted away from the field quickly, then held through the turn, and drew off in the lane while being kept to the task. SHOSHANAH
hopped at the start, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then could not threaten and held the place safe. ETTAPLACE
never far back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, closed willingly and missed the place. RIVETRIX tracked the
pace, lost some ground through the turn, then faded into the stretch. STRAIGHT MADNESS steadily lost ground.
