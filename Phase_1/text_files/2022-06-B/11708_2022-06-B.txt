MISS SURPRISE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. CASSIE'S
RAINBOW set the pace, was headed on the turn, vied through the stretch and held place. GIZMO'S PRINCESS was unhurried early and had a mild gain on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. FLECK was well back, roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the
stretch was up for a share. MISS TEA BLONDE was in range and raced evenly on the turn but leveled off through the stretch. MUSICAL FLIGHT was off
slow, showed little and was not a factor. TIZ MY RIGHT was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

OVERBEARING set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and proved best through the stretch. SOFIA'S SLUGGER tracked the early leaders from
the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MAGICAL TALE was in touch and
roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. BALA FALLS forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the three path
at the top of the stretch had nothing left. BORN TO BE KING was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire.

unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and was up for place. HASN'T HIT ME YET set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but was headed in
mid stretch and gave way. SAVVY'S SISTER was well back and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more.

evenly. SHOW SOME SKIN was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. NEW YORK

Footnotes
JAMAICAN JIMMY was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and prevailed. CORE was in range, raced evenly on the turn and from
the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. M C JACKHAMMER tracked the leader and had a good position on the turn but needed more. INVISIBLE
FRIEND had no speed and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. INNUENDO was well back, saved ground on
the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. GUS'S GAMBLE stalked the early leader and was hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch weakened. BEAUFORT was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and had nothing left. STREET MAX was off the pace and showed
little while outrun.

the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. DREAMINOFPASSION stalked the leaders and

MONEY MATTERS showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and was kept to task. VOYANT tracked the leader from the outside and was a
factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. LETTING LOOSE has no speed and raced evenly from the
inside on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. LIVERPOOL MAN settled off the pace and was roused on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. FINAL STRIKE was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but had no rally through the stretch.
BLIND TRUST was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no threat. HALF LIT was checked early,
showed little and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was outrun. SAILIN STREET stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and was
empty.

STRONG ENDING was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and from the four path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. STORM RISK set
the pace and had a clear lead on the far turn but failed to hold. A I INITIATIVE showed no speed, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the
top of the stretch rallied late. CHASING VINNY stalked from the inside and had a good position on the far turn but had no late kick. FOUR KNIGHTS was off
the pace and saved ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. DEEP EXPLORER was hustled early but lost
ground on the far turn and was empty. CONQUER THE BREEZE was well back, showed nothing and was never in contention.

Footnotes
SILENT FIRE set a pressured pace, had the lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch to proved best. MR. DYNAMIC tracked the early leaders, was
a factor on the far turn and was second best in a good effort. DYNAMIC MISSION was in touch, roused on the far turn and from the five path at the top of
the stretch finished well. PIPER AT WAR was away alertly, raced evenly on the far turn and was up for a share. SENSIBLE PORTIONS showed speed from
the outside and forced the pace on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MY BUYBACK was in mid pack but lost
ground on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. CALMING INFLUENCE was off the pace and saved ground on the far
turn but had no impact. HYPERACTIVE broke poorly and showed little while outrun. HIGH RESERVE had no speed and showed nothing while outrun.
