KENTUCKY KNIGHT showed good early speed, then dueled inside for the lead, chased on the turn, re bid in upper stretch, took over and drew clear under
urging. WINE TIME was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, rallied on the rail in the stretch and was up for second. BAYOU SHACK broke in
bumping a rival at the start, moved up three wide to contest the pace, took over on the turn, dueled with the winner in upper stretch and weakened. WHATA
GUY vied two wide for the early lead, steadied between rivals on the turn and raced evenly in the stretch. MORETHANICANHANDLE raced off the pace,
moved up four wide on the turn and lacked a stretch rally. URMIZZENTHEPOINT was unprepared for the start and still in the hands of the assistant starter,
then trailed the field. CHIQUITO BABY was off slowly, gave way on the turn, was pulled up in the stretch and vanned off. After a Stewards' Inquiry,
URMIZZENTHEPOINT was declared a non starter for wagering purposes.
