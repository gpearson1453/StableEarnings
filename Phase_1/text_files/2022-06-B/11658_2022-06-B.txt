Footnotes
BLACKROCK CASTLE was in the middle of the pack, racing along the rail, got boxed in, looking for racing room heading into the far turn, finally broke
through, angled out around the turn and closed down the lane for a driving finish at the wire. GOLD VERMILION stalked the pace from the two path, gained
command at the head of the stretch, clearing the field, but was outfinished in late stretch by the fast closing winner. DECLARE WAR was mid pack early,
angled out around the turn and rallied down the lane to get up for show. SOUTHERNER was mid pack, traveling four wide, made a bid in the turn but hung
in late stretch. COWBOY RIDGE took the early lead, drawing away from the field down the backstretch, and gave way at the quarter pole. GORDON
ANTHONY was forwardly place early, racing three wide and flattened out down the lane. NANAS BOY was mid pack, four wide and lacked a late response
in the stretch drive. NOT NECESSARILY had no early foot, four wide and had a mild bid late. GEORGIA DEPUTY was near the back, three wide and failed
to fire. TENOR was mid pack early on, two wide and had no late run. LOOKIN HIGH was near the back, along the rail and failed to respond. KING
JINGALING was near the front, on the inside and dropped back in to the fart turn. Following the running of the race, the jockey of GOLD VERMILLON
claimed foul against the jockey of BLACKROCK CASTLE for interference in the stretch After reviewing the films, the claim was disallowed.

then continued to race erratically down the backstretch, bid two wide on the far turn to flatten out in the end. WITTS SHOWTIME tracked the pace while four

KING KONGO was near the front early, made a bid around the turn and closed well, drifting to the four path, to grab the win at the wire with a driving finish.
COSMETOLOGY made the lead, dueling down the backstretch with PAPAWS BOY, and was outfinished at the wire but held on for a game second.
PAPAWS BOY pressed the pace, two wide, dueling for the lead down the backstretch, made a bid down the lane, but it was not enough. IMA BIG BOPPER
trailed the field early, angled out in the stretch drive, four wide, and had a late rally. TRUE RUNNER stalked the pace early, running along the rail and faded
in the stretch drive. INFINITE MORO was near the back, along the inside and was no factor.

Footnotes
CAIRO WARRIOR stalked the pace, from the rail, then angled out at the eighth pole, looking for racing room and rallied down the lane to get up for the win
with a driving finish. BLUE BOON set the pace from the outset, drawing clear of the field early, got pressed hard going into the turn but drew off once again,
only to get caught at the wire. BROCK ON BY chased the pace early on, racing on the outside, then rallied down the lane, four wide to get up for show. OH
MY ACHING ARCH was in the middle of the pack, racing just off the rail, then angled out, three wide down the lane with a late bid. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY
showed no early speed, traveling four wide and offered a mild rally down the lane. HIGH TONE pressed the pace early, from the two path and faltered in
mid stretch. NAUTICAL MOON bore out going into the first turn, bumped a foe and failed to fire in the stretch drive. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE was near the
back early, racing along the rail, angled out in the stretch and failed to respond down the lane. MORE LIKE IT had no early foot, racing four wide throughout
and had an even effort. LAB RAT got bumped by a foe and pushed out in the first turn, went to mid field down the backstretch, made a bid on the turn and
faded. READY TO ROLL showed no early speed, then ran up on heels and was steadied in the first turn then showed little. WEST TEXAS RAIN was mid
pack, got pushed out in the first turn, racing in the four path and was through early.

FAYETTE BLUE pressed the pace early on, racing in the two path, then gained command around the turn, getting pressed hard by ENDLESS ROMANCE,
and just hung on for the win. ENDLESS ROMANCE stalked the pace in the early goings, from the 3 path, then rallied down the lane, but could not catch the
winner, for a game second. STREET SHADOW was mid pack early, two wide, then angled out at the head of the stretch and closed well to get up for show.
GLITTERARY was near the back, racing along the rail, then rallied down the lane, but it was not enough. CHATON ROUGE was allowed to settle early on,
the closed, four wide down the lane. GREAT IN RED was in the middle of the field, on the inside and offered a mild rally late. AUNT GEM was in the middle
of the pack, three wide and had an even effort. BECKY'S TATTOO made the lead, keeping the pace until the eighth pole and got tired. FLOWER HOUSE
had no early foot, two wide and failed to respond. CASHEW chased the pace along the inside and dropped back in the stretch. FETCHING was mid field
early, then made a bid around the turn but faded in the stretch drive.
