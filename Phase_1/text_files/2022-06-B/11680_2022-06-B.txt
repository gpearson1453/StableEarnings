Footnotes
COJO away well, led along the rail on the backstretch, continued to lead along the inside on the turn, drifted out into the three path at the top of the stretch,
and responded well to urging to win convincingly. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF tracked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the
turn, continued on the rail entering the stretch and kept to task to the wire while holding place. JOURNEY CAKE bumped at the start, found a good tracking
spot behind a pair of leaders on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, floated out a bit by rival entering the stretch and got up for third in the five
path. JAY BOY stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide entering the turn, went two wide the second half of the turn and showed
a mild rally in between rivals in the lane. NEAH BAY bumped at the start, pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, continued to press the pace on the
turn, entered the stretch in the four path and weakened under urging in the lane. DAPPER saved ground throughout and failed to launch a bid under urging.
MOOGIE CAT stalked the pace in between rivals on the backstretch, began to be outrun on the turn and came up empty in the lane while being well beaten.

DISRUPTOR came out three paths at the start, lightly asked right handed, drifted in steadily final half of the race while edging away. BUDDER OFF
FRIENDS broke in, showed good acceleration, dueled with outside rival and proved a game second under right handed urging. CAPORAL RUNAWAY
bumped with outside rival at the start, drifted in two paths early, asked steadily right handed throughout in a decent effort. MAHOMES MAGIC bobbled and
bumped with inside rival at the start, kept to task throughout under a hand ride and finished up with mild interest. KETCHUM broke thru gate prior, away
cleanly, did not level right away, lugged out early when rider attempted to straighten out, and lugged out again when asked right handed midway. HES
VALIANT ENERGY off bit slow, weaved in and out early, after a green start rider just educated and hand rode to wire.
