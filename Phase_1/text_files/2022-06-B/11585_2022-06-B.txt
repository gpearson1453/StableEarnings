Footnotes
THE DEVIL'S DREAM dueled inside early on, took over into turn, drew off as much the best. ROCKY CHANNEL outside trip to the turn, rallied after leader,
proved no match. SPUN PRETTY chased leaders from inside, nothing left in the drive, saved show. SHADY BABY chased winner to the stretch, outpaced
in final furlong. STATE OF GRACE never factored. FAYEGOTEVEN unseated rider behind gate, brief speed, stopped from turn. LACY QUEEN through
early, gave way readily in the stretch run. MYSTIC ANN dropped far back.
