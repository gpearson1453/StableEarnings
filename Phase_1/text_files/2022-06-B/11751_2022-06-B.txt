Footnotes
DUNNIGAN was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide through the far turn and finished gamely to edge clear late under strong encouragement. OVER
CALENDARED showed good early speed from the inside, dug in through the stretch run while racing near the rail and held the place position. STARSHIP
WIZARD stalked the pace, raced three to two wide while racing between rivals in the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair late. DAKOTA BOY
was hard held early on, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid in the drive. BIRDNOTE broke awkwardly, lost ground at the
break, settled to the middle of the pack, raced five deep near the quarter pole and moved up in the stretch run. SHIPWRECK pressed the early pace while
racing between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GHOST FIGHTER clipped heels soon after the break, raced near the back of the pack early
and failed to respond. WIZARD SERRAT was unhurried early, raced three to four wide and had no late response. GEMINI MOON dropped back early,
raced four wide through the upper stretch and had no response. BETTINGONADREAM was bumped, took up break, dropped to the back of the pack and
never menaced. COYOTE RUNNER stalked the early going and gave way while racing near the inside. GRAY WARRIOR stalked the pace from the
outside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

LADY JAE was allowed to settle early, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. MONEY
FACTOR dropped back early on, made an advance through the far turn, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and closed in well late. PANOTTI stalked
the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. DOMINEERING stalked the early going, experienced traffic near the three
sixteenths pole, angled four wide and made a late gain. TWELVE RED ROSES pressed the early pace raced two wide and weakened a bit in the final
stages. STARRY HOPE pressed the pace from the outside and weakened in the drive while racing near the inside. MISZLO was slow early, raced towards
the inside and had no late response.
