WISE MARKET broke sharply and pressed the leader two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue three wide in the
run down the backside, assumed command entering the final turn, and held ACE DEUCE safely at bay late to prove best. ACE DEUCE away alertly, but
settled into a tracking trip two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly
three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. MASTER EWEN tracked the battling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the
rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a
share. OMBRE' ROSE hopped at the start, but rushed up entering the first turn to take the lead from along the rail, battled through the second turn and in
the run down the backstretch from the inside of WISE MARKET, was unable to match strides with that rival entering he final turn, and faded over the final
furlong. TRUPON ONLINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside,
raced three wide into the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid. The mile split for this race was unavailable at the current time

RUN LOLA RUN stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid smartly two wide entering the final turn,
tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly four wide in deep stretch to get up in the closing strides. KICK UP THE DUST away well and
tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn and quickly assumed
command, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive and just failed to last. FLORAL settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the
rail entering he backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering he final turn, but needed more late while finishing two out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. DEFINITE PLEASURE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the
backstretch, was overtaken midway through the final turn, and faded in the late stages. MI REYNA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, continued with a wide trip while racing three out from the rail entering the final turn, and failed to mount a serious late bid.
WE B THREE settled well off the early pacesetter while racing three wide into the backstretch, continued four wide into the final turn, but failed to respond
when called upon.

CALYPSO PRINCESS rushed up from the outside to assume command one out from the rail entering the turn, turned back a challenge by
REMEMBERTHEALAMO leaving the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. REMEMBERTHEALAMO away alertly, but drifted out to bump with
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND in the opening strides, rushed up from just off the rail to chase the pacesetter into the turn, loomed a danger leaving the turn,
but was unable to match strides with the pacesetter late while clearly second best. MS. STANFORD was devoid of the early speed to contend in the run to
the turn, saved ground through the turn, and found her best stride late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND broke
sharply and was brushed soon after the start, chased the top pair into the turn while racing two out from the rail, was never a threat to those rivals, and
wasn't a serious factor.

Footnotes
DEBATABLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, continued to bide his time at the back of the pace through the second turn, began to advance
three wide midway down the backside, rallied smartly two out from the rail through the final turn, took control in mid stretch and quickly drew clear late.
TUXEDO away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final
turn, took control midway through the final turn, but was no match late for DEBATABLE, while proving second best. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail from
between rivals in deep stretch to get up for a share. BETTIN' MAN away alertly and raced to the lead while angling towards the rail entering he stretch the
first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, while drifting off the rail, was overtaken soon after entering the final
turn, and had little to offer late. STAY ALL NIGHT broke sharply and steadied briefly leaving the first turn, before assuming a stalking trip from just off the rail
entering the lane the first time, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to make a late impact. ACCEPT NO OTHER stalked the leaders through the
stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to
respond when called upon.

AMANDA broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail into the lane the first time, continued to dictate the pace two wide in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by MISS THE HYPE in deep stretch to prevail. MISS THE HYPE away alertly and
tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail through the final turn, tipped off the rail leaving the turn, and closed with a late surge while finishing five wide in deep stretch to
just miss. VALUE DANCER settled at the back of a compact field while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, commenced her bid three wide
entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. CHICA HERMOSA tracked the leader through the lane
the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued to chase the pacesetter three wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong while drifting five wide in the stretch drive. CATTITUDE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time
while racing three wide while under snug restraint, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, and failed to mount a late bid when called
upon. The mile split for this race was currently unavailable

CHASE THE SUN broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from he rail, continued to chase the pacesetter in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, took control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear as much the best. PRINCE CAIRO stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to get up
for the place in deep stretch. MCMURPHY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the
inside of CHASE THE SUN in the run down the backstretch, battled from the inside of that rival through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that
foe entering the lane, and was outfinished late. DRILLER tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
