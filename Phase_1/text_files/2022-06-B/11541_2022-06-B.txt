EASY ACCESS was in touch, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. THY KINGDOM was unhurried
early and trailed the field on the turn but from the five path through the stretch finished well. STRONG ATTITUDE was in range, raced evenly on the turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. STERLING ICE was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left.
PERFECT GENTLEMAN had speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

READY TO RUMBLE showed speed from the outside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best.
HARDROADTOGLORY set a pressured pace and was a factor on the turn but was no match for the winner. KECAMEIFYOUCAN tracked the early leaders
and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. LAST ONE LAUGHING was off the pace and showed nothing in a dull effort.

ANTE UP ALEX was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. M V SPEED set the
pace, had the lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was outgunned. SUN FORESTER stalked the early leader and was roused on the far turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. MORE HARDER was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but was no real threat.
DOODLE DANDY showed no speed, chased on the far turn and was outdistanced. BOCELLI was off the pace, lost ground on the far turn and pulled up in

HIATUS set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and was kept to task through the stretch. FADE AWAY was off slow, gained ground on the far turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. DOCTOR UPTOWN stalked the early leaders and was a factor on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CORRELATE tracked from the inside but chased on the far turn and came up empty.
