Footnotes
MARCIE'S CANDY laid off of the pace in the three path, commenced a gain three wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, ranged up to vied for
place entering the lane before taking aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, then sustained her grinding rally to reel in that foe entering the final sixteenth,
and edged away late. SUMMER STORM sped clear early on, maintained a clear margin through upper stretch as MARCIE'S CANDY pursued, but met that
foe's challenge entering the final sixteenth, and was worn down. L. A. STAR trailed in the three path around the turn, shifted inwardly to surpass tiring foes
in midstretch, and stayed on to secure show. BREONNA tracked along the inside, but required urging to keep pace around the turn, shifted out at the
furlong grounds while beginning to tire, but saved fourth from an outer foe through the closing stages. PARKIN IN THE REAR broke a bit slowly before
being put to tight quarters between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, drifted out to the five path straightening for
home, and failed to threaten. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE stalked in the three to two path into the turn, chased the clear leader from between horses turning for
home, then tired among foes approaching midstretch. QUEEN LOUISE was briefly fractious in the starting gate, chased the clear leader from the four path
into the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
WESTERN RIVER pressed the leader from the outside while in the four path around the first turn, settled into stalking stride while remaining a path away
from inner foes through the lane for the first time, vied at the half mile pole, led between horses into the far turn as ALWAYS ABOVE attempted an outside
bid, showed the way well in hand around the final turn, drew off when let out entering the lane, and widened handily thereafter. ALWAYS ABOVE settled off
of the pace in the three to two paths around the opening two bends, tipped three wide and outside of the leading group down the backstretch, inched closer
to bid for the lead outside of WESTERN RIVER into the far turn, chased that foe turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and remained
well clear of show. JARREAU stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, pursued the top pair while getting outmoved by an outer foe entering the far
turn, surpassed an inner tiring foe for show approaching the five sixteenths pole, and lacked a bid while proving best of the rest through the lane. BAKWENA
trailed in the two path, pursued a tiring ARABIAN PRINCE for fourth in upper stretch, lugged inwardly in midstretch while bidding for that position, and
claimed it in the final furlong. ARABIAN PRINCE set the pace, met the eventual winner's bid approaching the final turn, then the eventual runner-up's
challenge entering the junction, and yielded to those foes at the three furlong pole before weakening through the lane.

Footnotes
MASTER OF ARMS settled behind the main flight, tracked the leading trio from the four path into the turn, ranged up well in hand turning for home,
assumed command on his own power entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure. SHAKEDOWN STREET was slow into stride and lagged
behind the field into the turn, trailed in the four to five path around the bend, then rallied five wide and outside of foes in midstretch to reach place entering
the final sixteenth. GENERAL STRIKE set the pace while hounded inside of a trio of foes through the opening quarter, clung to a minor advantage from only
a pair of rivals into the turn, but offered little resistance to MASTER OF ARMS' bid turning for home, proved no match entering the lane while battling for
place, fended of foes for that position into the final furlong, but lost place entering the final sixteenth. UNCLE BERLEY bobbled a bit at the start while still
breaking with the field, vied two wide and among rivals in the early scramble for the lead, sustained sparring position between a pair of foes around the turn,
but proved no match for a bidding foe entering the lane, and yielded between horses. SMARTY JOHN prompted the pace four wide, vied three wide around
the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival approaching the quarter pole before weakening in upper stretch. DIVISION STREET laid off of the pace along
the inside, tracked in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. UNCLE NICK prompted the pace three wide and
between horses for a quarter mile, but backed out at the half mile pole, and weakened between horses into the turn.

Footnotes
EAST OF INDIA chased in midpack in the three to two path around the turn, inched closer while tipped to the four path to split foes approaching the furlong
grounds, bid at that junction, and drove clear shortly after. T MONEY stalked the leading pair from the three path around the turn, floated to the five path
entering the lane while attempting to range closer, but lacked a kick to produce a bid before getting outkicked by an inner foe approaching the furlong
grounds, and kept on late to reach place approaching the wire. OFFUTT COLE vied for the lead two wide, led in the three path entering the lane, but failed
to match strides with a bidding EAST OF INDIA leaving the furlong grounds, gave way, and lost place late. DIALED A DAME broke slowly and lagged
behind the field early on, trailed in the three path around the turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on. MIZZEN MAN laid off of
the pace in the three to four path, but lacked a bid. RIGHT OF RUSH saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ON SPOT set the pace inside of a vying
rival, but weakened in upper stretch. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF laid off of the pace in the two path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SOCIETY showed the way via a loose lead in the three path around the first turn, managed a clear margin while well in hand down the backstretch, tucked
to the rail at the half mile pole, met MISS YEARWOOD's stern challenge at the five sixteenths pole, tenaciously clung to a advantage entering the lane,
gamely shook free of her outer counterpart entering the final sixteenth, and held to the wire. MISS YEARWOOD settled at the rear 2wd, gained three wide
into the far turn to bid for the lead outside of SOCIETY at the five sixteenths pole, battled with that foe entering the lane and through upper stretch, but was
turned way entering the final sixteenth, and kept on. TAP DANCING LADY laid off of the pace along the inside under a snug hold around the first turn,
settled into tracking stride soon after, chased the leading pair under urging around the far turn, tipped outside of them passing the quarter pole, and stayed
on to narrow the gap late. GLACKEN'S CAUSE stalked outside of the clear leader while in the four path around the first turn, tucked to the two path
approaching the far turn, but faded between horses at the three furlong pole. IMOGENE MALVINA tracked in the two path, then from between horses at the
five furlong pole, but sustained an injury at the seven sixteenths pole, was pulled up, dismounted, and untacked in the vicinity of the half mile pole, and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
REPEALING stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, drove past in the stretch and drew away while ridden out. PARK ANGEL raced
back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch with some late gain in the winner. ROMANCE NOVEL raced back early on, was in the
three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. BROADWAY BLAZE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened
late in the stretch drive. LADY PELE bobbled at the start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch.
EXPLICATE was a bit slow at the start and never a threat. ROYAL FLOWER set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faltered in the stretch.
DIVINE HOPE was never a factor. CLASSIC COYNE was never involved. BROADBAND showed little. LANDED GENTRY was outrun along the inside.
