Footnotes
BATTLEBUS sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and dug in tenaciously in the drive. BALISTICO , a forward factor in the two path
around the turn, gamely chased the winner through the stretch. HARD FOUGHT , off slowly, steadied behind horses mid way on the turn, swung out
approaching the stretch, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch and offered a slight rally. BACKWOODS BOOGIE , a forward factor in the three path
leaving the backstretch, failed to keep pace on the turn and lacked the needed rally. BLOODPROF , four deep chasing the pace to the stretch, faltered in
mid stretch. MYSTIC TIMES saved ground around the turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ NO CLOWN , away alertly, disputed the early pace outside of ICE COLD FROSTY, spurted clear mid turn, widened under a stout drive while on his left
lead leaving the furlong grounds then held firm. ICE COLD FROSTY , away in good order and to a slim early advantage, dueled inside the winner through
the opening quarter mile, saw that one get away a bit mid turn, stayed inside to pursue into the lane and dug in gamely through the final furlong to save the
place. QUINCY CAFE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and moved up to be in range while saving ground, dropped back some leaving the far turn,
eased out for the drive, worked between runners inside the final sixteenth and kept on with good energy. TALL ORDER stumbled outward at the break and
bumped with THEOLOVESAWINNER, corrected and hustled up three wide, took closer order past the five sixteenths, drifted out some while chasing in
upper stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. THEOLOVESAWINNER , bumped and forced out at the break, regrouped to give some early chase
off the rail, lacked a response past mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
VOTETHEMALLOUT raced in mid pack for six furlongs, worked between horses in the stretch, was on his left lead in mid stretch, switched to the proper
lead near the sixteenth pole, drifted in late and was up in time. RIPKEN saved ground on the far turn, eased off the rail turning for home, bid for the lead
between horses in mid stretch and just missed. GENERAL'S DUTY lacked speed, steadied in traffic entering the stretch, worked between horses, rallied
and was checked lacking room near the finish. THE LAST SCIP , four deep around the turn, floated out in upper stretch, loomed in mid stretch, drifted out
badly near the sixteenth pole and hung. A LOT LIKE XMAS , along the inner rail on the far turn, moved out for the drive, raced between horses and had a
slight rally. FLEETING ATTE raced inside horses throughout, was well positioned in mid stretch and faded late. SCINTILLIO , three wide chasing the pace
into the stretch, failed to sustain his move. CROSSLAND lost ground on both turns. SWALLOW BEACH was not a factor. WAR AND ROSES chased the
pace in the two path on the far turn and gave way the final furlong. SYNCOPATED hugged the inner rail setting the pace around the far turn and gave way
in mid stretch. RIXEY ROCKET raced outside horses and faltered.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN quickly went clear, set a rated pace toward the inside, increased his lead past the five sixteenths, responded two wide in upper stretch and
won under a steady hand ride. AMICALOLA FALLS , off the pace early pace three wide, angled five wide with momentum into the lane, straightened away
and finished with good energy to bridge the gap. DONTFORGETTOBLINK , off the pace while off the inside, angled six wide into the stretch, moved up past
mid stretch then flattened out late. ERAWAN saved ground, got through along the inside entering the lane but failed to kick on in the final furlong. LET ME
FINISH broke a step slow, hustled up and was the closest pursuer into the turn, chased three wide around the turn, lacked a response soon into the lane
and weakened. BANDFROMTHEBAR reared at the break and was away last, raced well back, saved ground into the stretch but failed to make any impact.
There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken.

horses to gain a short lead near the eighth pole then dug in late to prevail. LUNAR DASH , lightly bumped by PICKIN SEA GLASS leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn four deep and rallied outside the winner. PICKIN SEA GLASS came in leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside SURPRISE

the pace, angled out in upper stretch, raced between horses in the drive and lacked the necessary rally. FROG PRINCE saved ground around the turn,
remained along the rail through the stretch and was not a factor. SURPRISE HELLO showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch
and gave way. SKEPTICAL , fractious behind the starting gate, bore in at the break and was outrun. WORTHY OF GOLD , bumped leaving the starting
gate, was outrun. TIZ PATRICK was outrun.

confidently handled while dueling outside MUST BE LOVE through soft fractions, responded to left handed asking and wrested command past the three
sixteenths, carried the battle leaving the eighth pole, shook clear under a drive then held firm. TATE , between runners near the five eighths, chased inside

secure the rail, took pressure from the winner while under rating, dueled from mid turn to mid stretch then weakened very late. AUCTION KINGDOM saved
ground, dropped back some nearing the half, remained inside and under pressure past the three eighths but failed to generate a solid stretch kick.

Footnotes
HELLO GRACIE , three wide around the turn, eased out to the four path entering the stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. MADAME
CLAUDE , hustled to the early lead, set the pace off the rail around the turn and in the stretch and weakened late. OIL ON CANVAS , taken off the inner rail
mid way on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. BULLETS LADY , well placed in the three path leaving the turn,
flattened out. TRIKKI NIKKI hugged the inner rail on the turn and in upper stretch, was forced to alter course in upper stretch, raced between horses in the
drive and lacked the needed rally. ICY REPLY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in mid stretch. SHINY PENNY raced between
horses throughout and failed to rally. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , outrun, moved to the eight path in mid stretch. GOT A GOOD REASON was not a factor.
CABRA CHICA , well placed in the two path between horses on the turn, gave way. NO MORE MASK , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn,
remained inside horses in the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BURGEE rated kindly and tracked the loose leader while two to three wide, steadily advanced mid turn, went on the attack a sixteenth later, seized
command soon into the lane, responded to firm asking and kicked clear heading to mid stretch, widened and was kept to task. WONDER WATER , three
wide outside rivals, edged up under a hearty ride mid turn, gave hard chase heading to mid stretch, churned on with interest and was clear of the rest.
COASTAL CHAOS settled outside a rival, was under pressure mid turn, angled five wide for the drive and kept on trying. BLAMEITONTHEFUN sped clear
soon after the start, set the pace towards the rail, was joined approaching the stretch, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then gave way. MAILMAN'S A
FLYER saved ground off the leaders, was under asking mid turn but failed to respond. TWICE GOLD broke a step slow, moved up behind rivals nearing the
three quarter pole, steadied briefly, dropped back leaving the far turn, angled six wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
CREATIVE CAIRO hugged the inner rail around the first turn, was rated back soon after leaving the bend, stalked the pace outside CUPID'S STRIKE,
challenged that one on the far turn, dueled to the eighth pole then asserted herself and drew out under brisk urging. CUPID'S STRIKE bumped with WITTY
BANTER leaving the starting gate, two wide the first turn, opened a clear lead after the opening quarter mile, moved to the inner, hugged the rail, battled to
the eighth pole and finished willingly to hold the place. FIRE IN THE HOLE lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail for a mild, swung to the four path
leaving the final turn and rallied outside. TREASURE TAILS stalked the pace, was in a striking position on the far turn then weakened. WITTY BANTER
bumped with CUPID'S STRIKE leaving the starting gate, was no factor and swung to the five path leaving the final turn. SONG OF INNOCENCE , three
wide on the turns, gave way. DANCING TIL DUSK , four wide entering the first turn, angled in, hugged the inner rail on the second and third turns then
faltered entering the stretch.

failed to kick on with the winner but kept on willingly to hold down the place. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , brushed and in tight at the break, raced off the pace
and off the inside, angled four to five wide gathering some steam past the three eighths, angled very wide for the drive and finished up willingly to gain.

to mid stretch then faded. KEYS DISCOUNT stalked inside, briefly waited behind a tiring rival around the final turn, angled out for the drive but went evenly
late. THE THINKER , bumped and squeezed back at the break, was far back past the three quarter pole, saved ground into the far turn and offered a
belated gain. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE came out at the break, straightened and rated forwardly, bid three wide into the far turn, vied between foes into the
lane and gave way through the final furlong. DREAMING OF RAQUEL , rank off some pre race, three wide early on, dropped back a bit after a half mile,
angled seven wide for the drive but lacked a kick. AUSPICIOUS LAD saved ground within range past the seven eighths, dropped back leaving the five
eighths, angled out and failed to make an impact. MASTER OF MANHATAN cleared in the opening furlong, dropped in to set the pace, was joined by rivals
