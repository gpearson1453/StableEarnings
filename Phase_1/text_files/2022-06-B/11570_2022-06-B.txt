RIDGE WEST away alertly, set all the pace and widened through deep stretch to win as much the best while taken in hand late. PLATE IT UP chased the
winner into the turn, dropped back then came on again late in the five path to get up for second. GRAND STRATEGY never far back, offered a mild bid in
the four path entering the stretch then leveled off. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA stalked the early pace, moved closer along the inside in upper stretch then came
up empty. SCHMULTZY was no factor. MOBIL AT LAST was outrun. OUR PETITION was through early.

SEND ME ON slow early, swung wide, closed with a rush while drifting out past the middle of the racetrack and got up in the final strides. OVER ICCE close
up from the start, rallied determinedly in the seven path through the stretch and finished second best. EXPRIMIR stalked the early, pace, rallied three wide
to make the lead on the far turn, maintained the advantage until deep stretch then was outfinished. LUCKY STREAK forwardly place, moved up four then
three won through the far turn and leveled off. PRIVATE DRIVE broke in front, set the pace for nearly six furlongs, kept pressure until deep stretch then
weakened. SAMMY DA BULL failed to menace. TEAM HUCKY was no factor. HISTORICALLY chased the early pace, drew on even terms for the lead near
the half mile pole then was used up.

R THREE ANGELS close up from the start while inside, angled out on the far turn, swung out to the middle of the racetrack, closed willingly under left
handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and finished full of run to win going away. CACKI pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn,
made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. CHRISTMAS stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide on the far
turn then was outfinished. HERE COMES JIGS void of early speed, passed tiring rivals. QUEEN HIGH hopped at the start and lacked the needed response.

FAT DADDY stalked the pace into the far turn, responded with a rapid move to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip
under strong handling to win as much the best. COSMIC TREASURE pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs, dropped back entering the stretch then
came on again late and got up for second. KADESH made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside for a little over six furlongs
then was outfinished. TIP SHEET slow early, best his stride late four wide. PAT DADDY had speed from the start, moved closer four wide on the far turn
then failed to sustain that bid. DOCTOR LEE well placed, failed to respond. IMTHEPRINCE was outrun. CALORIC with the second flight, lacked the needed
response. ROSAS WAY was never involved. SHELL FIRE pulled up on the second turn bleeding from the nostrils and was walked off.

Footnotes
LIONISTIC pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, drifted to the six path and finished full of run to win as much the best while taken in hand
late. STARRY JAYLEN stalked the early pace, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and rallied for second. STARLIT SECRET broke in front, set a
pressured pace along the inside into the turn, chased the balance of the pace and was outfinished for second. INDELIBLE IMAGE hopped at the start,
trailed early then passed tiring rivals. IAMGOINGTOSHINE failed to menace. ARTIES CRYPTONITE was no threat. SWEET OUTLOOK was through after a
half. CLIFTONS BALLERINA had speed into the turn then wilted.
