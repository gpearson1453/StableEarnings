Footnotes
BETCHA set the pace from the outset while in the two path, continued on a clear lead into the lane, was challenged nearing the eighth pole, repulsed that
bid soon after and drew away. LADY AVE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, loomed a serious
threat with an eighth to go, could not go with the winner then had to settle for the place spot. PABLO'S MINX raced near the rail through the turn, came into
the lane from the three path then finished evenly to be gaining on the place rival. SHAPE OF YOU chased the pace from the two or three path, was asked
for more into the lane and weakened through the final eighth. BELLARIFIC raced in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the
three path and tired. GOLDEN COMMAND was never a factor while along the inside. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS leaned back and hesitated at the start spotting
the field some five lengths, rejoined the field through the turn and into the lane and was done after straightening in the lane.

widened through the final eighth. REED KAN vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, yielded to the winner inside the eighth pole then
stayed on to be well clear for the place spot. HOME BASE pressed the early pace three wide into the turn, settled back to chase the pace through the turn
while in the three path, came into the lane from the three or four path and won the show battle while not a threat. MISTER KELLY chased the pace while
along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, was not far back when straightened then weakened. K J'S NOBILITY was always
last while near the inside.

lane continued to widen inside the eighth pole while under a drive then jock did not persevere through the final sixteenth. BLOODY MARY MORNIN stalked
the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved with the winner, chased that one into the lane and could not make up ground while clearly second best.
IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN raced in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the four path for the drive and never was
a menace while finishing clear for the show spot. AZURITA in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path while under a
drive and was not a threat. DANCE MONEY set the pace while near the inside into the far turn then gave way once passed in mid-turn. LIEUTENANT
KITTY in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was in it. OCELIA saved ground through the turns and was done in

Footnotes
COLONEL ABY B was unhurried while off the inside, moved quickly four wide through mid-turn, swung into the lane from the five path with aim on the top
ones, caught the leader inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY set the pace while under pressure from the outside, shook
clear straightening in the lane, was caught nearing the sixteenth pole then yielded while staying on well to save the place spot. ATHENAIS pressed the pace
two wide throughout, lost contact with the pacesetter into the lane but stayed on well to be clear for the show spot. BALLOT INITIATIVE came off the inside
through the turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane from the two or three path and was slowly gaining. PERTINACIOUS TIZ made first run at the
leaders through the turn while in the three path, continued a threat into the lane then flattened out. KANGAROO TALK was unhurried while off the inside,
moved through the four to five path through late turn and never was a factor. PELLETIER never a menace while in the two or three path. U SO MONEY
BABY chased the pace while near the rail through the turn and was empty into the lane. LOFTYSHIPSLOWSAILS tracked the pace along the inside through
the far turn then faded.

Footnotes
SNOOTY set the pace while under pressure and in the two path, continued under pressure through the lane and gamely held. PROTOMAGIC was in the
four path through the turn and into the lane and continued with good energy. BEIRUT BEAUTY was off awkwardly to be last away, raced in the two to three
path through late turn, angled in entering the lane, looked for room along the rail to the two path late and offered a mild gain. KEEN ICE SIGHT pressed the
pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened late. JERSEY GOLD bobbled at the start, raced in the two path through mid-turn
when being shuffled a bit, bid into the lane from the four or five path and offered a mild gain. GUEST IN MY HEART was along the inside into the turn, was
shuffled when behind a tiring rival, bid into the lane from the six path and never was a factor. DEEP DISH pressed the winner into the turn while near the
inside, continued to chase the pace into the lane then faded. THIRTEEN STRIPES never a factor while in the four path through the turn and racing well off
the rail through the lane. WARIS outrun while in the five path through the turn. CAIRO DRIVER raced in mid-pack through the turn and tired entering the
lane.
