OUR HOISTED MAST broke outwardly at the start, set the pace while clear and in the two path, was tough to handle as he was trying to get out, then was
roused at the furlong marker, drew off and drifted out the final furlong to prove much the best. CRUSH IT was bumped at the start, then was rated along four
to five wide on the backstretch, then checked by the half mile marker and angled in to the inside, made a bid leaving the turn but could not sustain that bid
while being clearly second best. HASHTAG WINNING was rated along four to five wide, made a middle move four wide, then dropped to the inside mid way
on the far turn, then was along for the show award on the inside. MIAMI MUMBLES tracked the pace three to four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
TRAVEL GIRL was away alertly to be soon clear to set the pace while clear, remained clear by the furlong marker, then was getting tired late but held sway
under left handed crop urging. SMOKE AND MIRRORS was bumped at the start, chased the winner on the inside, eased out and came three wide into the
lane, then was slowly gaining but was too late, second best. LIL H was allowed to settle early, was on the inside on the turn and came two wide into the lane
and rallied. HONESTA was reserved early and had a belated rally while saving ground throughout. SEEKING THE THRONE was off slowly and lacked rally.
MISCHIEF MANAGED dull effort.
