WING COMMANDER was clear early and then dueled late, lasting under steady urging. RIVER REDEMPTION stalked inside, bid in the stretch, moved
outside of the winner for a late duel and lost the nod. EL SOCIO stalked the pace in the two path, bid three wide at the quarter pole buy couldn't close.
CAUSE A STIR saved ground but had no late bid. COUNTERSTRIKE raced evenly in the four path. CARTIER CAT saved ground to no avail. BERN N ASH
stumbled badly just after the start, raced inside, then raced evenly four wide in the stretch. ASCENDING MOON stalked pace between foes but had no
closing bid. HIGH DEFF (FR) angled four wide in the stretch but couldn't close. UNION SOLDIER was through early. CALL ME GUSTO raced evenly in the
four path. MR. PETERKIN stalked in the four path but faded in the stretch.
