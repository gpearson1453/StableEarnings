Footnotes
HAPPY FORTY EIGHT raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the
closing yards to be going away late. GORKY PARK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached SIDNEY'S
HOPE with a furlong to run, vied with that rival but could not resist the winner from over the top. SIDNEY'S HOPE dueled for the early advantage with
SOUTHERN SUMMER while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. SAMURAI JACK raced five-wide
through the first turn, settled off the leaders from off the rail and finished with some late run. SOUTHERN SUMMER disputed the pace from the inside for
five furlongs and weakened. BAYERN TO BE WILD showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
B A CHAMPION sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by IZA DADDY with a furlong to run,
vied with that rival and gamely prevailed. IZA DADDY broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe
nearing the eighth pole, vied and just missed. SAYIN GRACE bobbled at the break, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady bid. WILMAS IRISH ROVER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. RISKY
REVENGE was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and gave way. STRYDER raced four-wide through the first turn, showed no
early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. NEXT AFFAIR chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened
after going six furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

DIABOLICAL GATOR was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to
run and held off the closing GOLDEN BAND to gamely prevail. GOLDEN BAND was away in good order to dispute the early fractions while racing four-wide,
angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. ONE MARK dueled for the lead from between foes, stayed on well in the drive and gave
way through the final sixteenth. STORMIN FAST was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. MONTEREY SECRET
broke sharply to vie for the early advantage from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. REINING PESOS lagged throughout.

Footnotes
STORM LEADER stalked the pace of NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew off through the
lane as a handy winner. MARKED MONEY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with good
energy to gain the place. NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way to the winner after going a
half. Z MARKS THE SPOT was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. NEW MEXICO JEREMY was never far
back, raced four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. LEAVE THEM BEHIND settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
weakened. CROSSFIRE COWGIRL lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. WF FRANKLY MY DEAR lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RATTILA was off slow and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
INDIAN NIGHTS was reserved just off the leaders while racing from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin and was
fully extended to hold EL JOKER safe late. EL JOKER set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, dropped off the winner into the lane and came back
late to finished with good energy. C D POLDARC lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished williingly.
GOBLIN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, checked in mid-stretch and finished evenly when clear. OKIE CITY was away in good
order to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. JAZZ MAN DO was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the
turn and weakened. TANDES was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and did not offer a bid.
FANTASTICALLY FINE broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
