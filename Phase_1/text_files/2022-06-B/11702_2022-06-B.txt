Footnotes
LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. WILD
LOOKER well placed and outside, angled in from the three path through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then angled out for clear racing room
and closed for the place. POQUITO ROSE unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the
show. CHECOTAH tracked the pace, moved up inside through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded in the lane.
WHISTLER DIXIE stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the turn.

A REAL HERO allowed to settle, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made3 a steady gain and drew off
late. MON PARADIS well placed, looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, then was
no match for the winner and held the place. PRECISION PRADO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch,
angled out, closed willingly and missed the place. SCOOP THERE IT IS stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to take command down the backstretch,
stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. DOMINANT STRANGER tracked the pace in the
early going, angled out down the backstretch and gained position on the two path through the second turn, then angled out into the stretch and faded.
SHEZA HOOT set the early pace inside and steadily lost ground.
