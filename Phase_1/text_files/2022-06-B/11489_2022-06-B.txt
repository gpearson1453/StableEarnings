Footnotes
COSME was lightly bumped at the start, set the pace racing off the rail facing moderate pressure from an outside rival, extended the margin when shaken
up, lugged in a bit past the furlong marker, was eased up late and held safe. OFF TO THE BEACH raced off the pace two to three wide early, advanced
between runners up the backstretch, captured the place but was no match for the winner. KING ZION was just a bit fractious in the gate, tracked inside on
then just off the rail, lost ground heading into the far turn, raced in behind runners coming past the quarter pole, came out at the furlong marker and ran on.
CYBER MONDAY was just a bit fractious in the gate, switched outside foes heading into the first turn going two to three wide on that bend, began to pick it
up heading into the far turn racing mostly two to three wide in behind runners on that bend and angling out five deep coming to the quarter pole, ran on to
improve position. RAZ COUNTRY stalked outside four to five wide, was within range heading toward the quarter pole but weakened thereafter. DARREN'S
LEGACY bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, raced mostly three to four wide, pressed the winner up the backstretch, dropped back and faded. WAVE
THE GOLD was outpaced racing off the inside.

LADY ATLANTIC stalked the pace three wide through the turn, struck the lead near the furlong marker, edged away while being kept to the task. FOGGY
KITTEN moved clear and shifted in, set the pace racing just off the rail, was collared at the eighth pole and outkicked. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR was ridden
along by the three-eighths racing off the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, avoided a loose rival at the quarter pole, ran on to get up for show
honors. MINGO MAGIC appeared to false break and hop at the start, chased the pace up the backstretch going four wide on the turn, lugged in a bit in
upper stretch and weakened. LADY MAGNA raced inside, bobbled and lost the rider at the top of the stretch, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, OPENING QUARTER AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR set the pace facing moderate pressure from an outside rival, drew off when asked, was geared down the final sixteenth. DARING
DAMSEL raced four to five wide throughout, kept on in the drive to get up for second. SATIATE exchanged bumps at the break and just after then was
coaxed forward to press the eventual winner two wide, was no match and lost place late. ADDISON raced inside but just off the fence through the first turn,
switched out three deep up the backstretch, advanced on the far turn to reach striking distance but flattened out. PRESENT OF HERO exchanged repeated
bumps between rivals at the break and just after, was caught three to four wide on the first turn, moved in a bit on the far turn going two to three deep
through that bend, ran on but lacked the needed late kick. GODSGIFT exchanged repeated bumps at the break and just after, chased two to three wide
through the first turn, steadily retreated up the backstretch and far turn and faded.

JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL forced the pace from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, kicked clear under steady handling. STACK SHACK bumped the
inside rival at the start, was forwardly-positioned early but taken back off the leaders, attempted to move out heading into the turn but was briefly boxed in,
then managed to get out four wide later on that bend, secured the place. HEY HEY shifted in up the backstretch, saved ground on or just off the rail on the
turn, came out a bit turning for home, ran on to get up for show honors. KHOZYS CROWN contended between runners then vied inside on or just off the
rail, weakened in the stretch. GHAALEB'S MAGIC raced outside moving from three to five wide on the turn, showed some mild late interest. SILVERA was
bumped lightly by inside and outside foes at the start, moved nearer the rail early on the turn, failed to threaten. BLUES MARY bumped with the outside rival
at the start, saved ground trailing through most of the turn before coming out five wide at the top of the stretch, failed to rally. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

COWBOYS DREAM settled at the rear and shifted in, saved ground on the first turn, advanced inside with some mild coaxing late up the backstretch, came
out three wide past the quarter pole, struck a narrow lead just past the furlong marker, dueled briefly and prevailed with confident handling. WILD FOX
stalked the pace two to three wide, applied more pressure about the seven-sixteenths, took charge by the quarter pole but was challenged in mid-stretch
and outkicked. STALLONE set the pace inside, was mildly rated early up the backstretch, faced more pressure heading into the far turn, fought on through
upper stretch then yielded. JACK'S ADVANTAGE settled last but one racing just off the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
ULIKEAPPLES was a bit fractious in the gate but broke well and quickly moved clear to dictate terms racing near the inside, extended the margin in the
stretch and was kept to the task. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY angled in soon after the start, was allowed to settle after moving to the rail, kept on inside to get up
for the place. HEAVENLY SCENT was hard to load, broke through the gate then again a bit reluctant to load, broke outwardly, stalked the winner from off
the inside, drifted four to five wide on the turn, weakened and lost second. VALE OF EVESHAM was forwardly-placed tracking in behind the leaders, went
three wide on the turn, ran on evenly. UNLEASH THE QUICHE was coaxed forward from the break the chase while outside, drift out a bit from four to six
wide on the turn, kept on. INCENTIVIZED (GB) shifted in early, went three wide on the turn, passed rivals heading into upper stretch then went evenly. MY
LADY SLEW was hard to control bearing out nine wide on the turn, failed to rally thereafter. LONGLIVEROCKNROLL was in tight at the start, shifted in at
that juncture, raced well back two wide on the turn and had no rally. COWGIRL FRANKIE moved in from five to three wide on the turn and was never near
enough to threaten. LUCRETIA switched outside rivals heading up the backstretch, went three to six deep on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CYRIL'S BOY had brief speed inside then eased back to track the pace into the turn, switched out three wide coming past the five-sixteenths, put to a drive
at the top of the stretch, engaged the leader at the furlong marker and edged away late. ETCHED IN STONE moved forward between runners to force the
pace, edged clear late on the turn racing in the two path, was engaged in the stretch and outkicked. ALPINE GHOST tracked in behind just off the fence, ran
on to get show honors. COCO BRAVADO shifted in, went two to three wide on the turn and was not a threat. GOLDEN TONE trailed early after being lightly
bumped at the start, swung six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TALKTOEACHOTHER bumped a rival just lightly at the start, attended the
early pace from outside then chased through the turn three to five wide on that bend, came up empty for the drive. A BOLD RYDE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CAROLINE'S STORY was forwardly-placed and able to tuck in toward the rail heading into the first turn tracking the leaders, moved out leaving that bend to
stalk two to three wide, advanced inside foes but off the fence on the far turn, took the lead and edged clear then held safe. KINGSBURY DREAM saved
ground in the back half of the field through the first turn, lacked room coming past the half, came out four wide nearing the quarter pole, angled out several
more paths once in upper stretch, launched a rally once clear and was gaining but too late. MY SWEET STORY raced well back two to three wide early and
to the far turn, swung out nine deep leaving that bend, was gaining too late. CELESTIAL SPIN was reserved inside in the early going, still had much to do
on the far turn while continuing to save ground, came out a bit and found room between rivals near the furlong marker to loom a threat but was outkicked for
the minor awards. SENSE OF SELF came in and bumped rivals after the start, raced four wide through the first turn, advanced up the backstretch to the far
turn continuing four wide on that bend and reaching striking distance but evened out in the drive. ZANDREA'S was forwardly-placed heading to the first turn
and shifted in two wide, tracked up the backstretch on or just off the rail, had no extra for the stretch run. SEAWARD was bumped into a rival soon after the
start, raced mid-pack two to three wide on both turns and ran on evenly. MORRIE'S JOY raced mostly four to five wide and outside rivals, exchanged a light
brush and altered in once in upper stretch. HARD LIKE HOLLY set the pace racing in the clear, gave way. VERKLIMT was urged forward to pursue the
pacesetter but drifted out early on the first turn, moved back in three wide, continued the pursuit three to four deep on the far turn, drifted out and exchanged
a light brush in upper stretch, tired. BEYOND PROPER was bumped after the start, raced three wide between foes into the first turn, swung eight wide
turning for home, was lightly brushed in upper stretch and failed to produce a bid. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FIRST MASAMUNE had some early contact heading to the first turn, tracked inside, moved out early on the far turn, was three deep past the five-sixteenths
commencing a bid, drifted out in upper stretch and gradually throughout the rest of the lane but still prevailed. CONI'S COUP stalked the pacesetter two to
three wide, took the lead past the three-eighths, fought on in late stretch but just failed to last. PINEDALE exchanged some light contact at the start, stalked
two to three wide, came out a bit in upper stretch and showed late interest to secure show honors. KUNSHAN BRIDGE raced outside three to four wide,
was carried out a bit on the far turn while making a minor bid, evened out in the stretch. SEMINOLE BEACH clipped heels and stumbled early, saved
ground on the turns, moved out a bit and passed a tired rival. SYMBOLIST exchanged light brushes at the start and early, set the pace in the clear racing in
the two path, was challenged on the far turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
LIPLINER sped clear to dictate terms racing just off the fence, held while being kept to the task. CHROME ATTACK settled inside, angled seven wide
turning for home, drifted in a bit while gaining but was too late. SHE'S WANDAFUL settled mid-pack in the two path, angled six wide at the top of the stretch,
drifted in through the lane and gained some but needed more. ENGLISH saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn, came out turning into upper
stretch and again soon after while exchanging a bump, needed more late. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER stalked outside three wide on the turn, came into upper
stretch a bit wider, drifted in a bit and exchanged a bump in upper stretch then was in tight between rivals past the furlong marker while weakening. SAFE
TRAVELS chased the eventual winner two wide, weakened. NOT TO BE DENIED exchanged a bump at the start, raced four wide into the turn, shifted in
midway on that bend, had no rally. PALM COURT exchanged a bump at the start, was carried five wide on the turn, came up empty. MIDDIE chased briefly
two to three wide, dropped back while coming out a bit on the turn, faded.
