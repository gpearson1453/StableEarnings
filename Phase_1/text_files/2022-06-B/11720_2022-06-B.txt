Footnotes
SIR WELLINGTON was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, forged clear racing into the turn while shifting inwards and was kept to
his task. BIBLEMAN broke sharply, disputed the pace inside the eventual winner on the backstretch, soon proved no match but held for the place honors.
PUBLIC SAFETY tracked off the first flight near the inside and continued evenly into the lane. DEFLATER tracked the leaders between foes kin the last
flight but offered no closing bid. CAUCUS RULES settled outside foes in the last flight and failed to menace.

MAKEMEBELIEVE vied for command between foes from the outset, shook clear racing into the turn, then grudgingly held the challenge of ELI'S GIRL to the
end under firm encouragement. The latter was urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, conceded some ground to the eventual winner
into the turn, tipped outside that foe nearing the lane and continued willingly to close the gap while always second best. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY joined the
pace four wide in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders three deep between foes into the stretch and finished evenly. MISS DUTTON
settled last racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch to gain some position but made no impact. DANZIG STAR tracked off the first flight along the
inside, shifted out four wide racing into the lane but had no rally. MAGNIFICANT MONEY, fractious in the paddock prior to the race, flashed brief pace
between foes but dropped out early.

RANGER GUS sped clear of the field while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, dictated pace to upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin
under firm right handed pressure. TAPIT SAM tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing to the turn, tipped outside the leader nearing upper stretch
but proved only second best. STUN GUN, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, tracked the leaders three, then four wide to upper stretch
but had no closing bid. STILLWATER BROWN, urged outside a rival pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. JEROMIEO settled
between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. BURN BOSS steadily faded racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
KALLINIKI, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter under rating in the opening stages, steadily advance on that foe to wrest command midway
through the far turn, then steadily widened her advantage into the lane under firm encouragement. SHE B GLAMOROUS, reserved in the last flight along
the inside to the backstretch, gathered momentum tipping off the inside racing into upper stretch, split rivals while weaving a bit racing through the stretch
but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. STARLIGHT TWIST tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three
wide nearing the lane while being urged to advance but lacked the needed late kick. ALL NATIVE settled outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch,
angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. INDAWIN tracked the leaders inside rivals in the second flight for a half and faded
racing through the far turn. MIZZANNA tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the far
turn but soon emptied out. COUGER, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace to the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
DEVIL VISION reared at the start losing terms with the field, was settled into stride along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out six wide in upper
stretch, drifted out racing through the lane but rallied to the front in time under firm encouragement. TASHKENT tracked just off the pacesetter along the
inside to the far turn, shifted out to the four path nearing upper stretch advancing on the leader, wrested the advantage between calls late but was collared
by the winner. FLATOUT WINNER, reserved off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn and steadily improved
his position along the rail. ZOE'S DELIGHT, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, took over racing into the far turn, held
sway on a comfortable into the stretch but failed to sustain his momentum. T BONES TRICK tracked the leaders three wide between foes to the far turn and
continued evenly to late stages. KID FROSTIE settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch and never gained contention. BUGLER tracked just off
the leaders between foes into the first turn, switched outside rivals entering the backstretch to race in the four, then five path to the far turn and faded into
the lane. RIVER ROSE was urged dictating the pace along the inside from the outset to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
YOUR TIME'S COMING, reserved from out of striking distance while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes in second flight approaching
the far turn, shifted three wide nearing the lane while continuing with a steady advance, wrested the advantage in upper stretch, drifted out despite some
right handed pressure in the closing stages and maintained a safe margin to the end. MARK IN GREELEY was reserved a bit off the rail racing to the
backstretch, followed the winner's path splitting rivals racing through the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch, continued in pursuit of the winner
while being steadied slightly avoiding that rival in late stages but proved no match. COASTAL WATERS, reserved last to the backstretch, angled out six
wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. TOUR THE WORLD tracked off the first flight while racing a bit off the
inside, shifted three deep nearing the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SOUPER FORTUNE, urged
dictating the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn and gave way in the drive. I'M
CRENSHAW, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. SOUTHERN PECAN, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace to
the backstretch, advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn and gave out leaving midstretch. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE tipped off the inside tracking
just off the leaders in the opening half, raced four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and quickly came up empty. FOLLOWING THE
RACE, THE RIDER OF MARK IN GREELEY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH
WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
