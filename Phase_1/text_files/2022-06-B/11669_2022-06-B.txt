Footnotes
DA GHOST was urged to a contending position inside foes in the opening stages, steadied slightly avoiding close quarters entering the turn, continued
under reserve on the bend, angled out to the five path in upper stretch, then rallied to the front outside foes in the closing stages under pressure.
WEAREINITTOWINIT was prompted in the opening stages, came under rating to stalk a rival's pace while switching out four wide on the backstretch, was
prompted to advance three deep entering the turn to challenge for command, gained a narrow advantage outside rivals midway through, pressed the issue
outside a rival into the stretch, drifted out in the closing stages while being roused to resist the winner's challenge but proved only second best. SILENT
SAILOR, urged between foes to dispute the pace entering the turn, dueled inside a rival into upper stretch and gave way leaving midstretch. SIR
BARNABUS bobbled at the start, settled on the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress four wide nearing upper stretch but came up empty
in the drive. A P GUNNER was hustled to the lead outside foes, angled to the inside once gaining a clear advantage after the opening quarter but was spent
early.

Footnotes
CHOOS UR ADVENTURE broke readily to race on terms with the leaders between foes under rating in the opening three sixteenths, shifted out three wide
entering the turn pressing the issue outside the pacesetter, was fanned to the four path racing into the stretch but continued with a steady bid to prevail in
time under firm handling. COLLEGE PARTY broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing into the turn,
tipped to the three path racing through the stretch resisting the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe. MAJOR ATTRACTION, off slowly, switched off the
inside tracking the leaders between foes into the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share in late stages.
MIAMI CROCKETT was rated well off the first flight while angling to the inside, shifted out four wide entering the stretch but offered no rally. PERFECT
FANNY, urged disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE trailed throughout.

MIDNIGHT CURRENT broke readily, angled inwards stalking just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, moved to press the issue on
the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and went well clear in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. SWANAGE broke readily,
was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, proved no match
for the winner in the drive but was best of the others. COME ON SWEET PEA, reserved in the last flight while guided to the inside early, saved ground
gradually gaining position inside foes nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share late. FALL MOON, reserved outside foes
in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position. PLENTY OF VISION angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter inside the eventual winner in the
opening half, tipped off the inside to race between foes into the far turn losing some position, then continued evenly between rivals late. IF YOU WANT IT,
reserved off the third flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted to gain some position racing into
the far turn but had no closing bid. BADGER KITTEN was rated off the second flight inside rivals in early stages, made some brief progress along the rail to
gain some position racing into upper stretch but flattened out late. HOITY TOITY was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and
steadily faded after a half. LUVIN BULLIES tracked the leaders three deep behind the second flight to the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
ONE SON OF A CHIEF, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, continued with a steady bid to challenge
for command into upper stretch and edged clear late under firm handling. MAN U was urged prompting the pace between from the outset into the turn,
dueled inside the winner past midstretch and prevailed for the place honors. PASSED BY PAUL was settled between foes in the last flight on the
backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the turn, was fanned seven wide racing through upper stretch but continued to make some belated progress.
TEXAS LONG BOW tracked off the first flight four wide through the backstretch into the turn, was urged to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but
flattened out in the closing stages. I KICKN tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. LIBERTARIAN,
reserved outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch, angled out six wide in upper stretch but offered no rally. HI HO CHEERIO settled between foes in
the last flight early and failed to menace. MR NAVIGATOR was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the bend on a narrow advantage
and gave way after half.

Footnotes
WARRIOR BOSS was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the second bend, switched
outside foes on the far turn, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wear down MY DOMINATOR and go clear in
time under brisk handling. The latter was urged three deep between foes racing to the first turn contesting the lead, continued in that path to wrest the
advantage entering the second bend, forged clear racing through the far turn, held sway on a commanding advantage past midstretch but failed to sustain
his momentum. MONGOL ALTAI broke awkwardly, settled well off the field racing to the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and continued well enough
to prevail for a share. MAGIC CARPET, caught five wide racing to the first turn while being prompted to contend, continued four deep through the
backstretch, then three deep into the second bend pursuing the pacesetter to upper stretch but came up empty late. VALENTINE GUY, urged between foes
pressing the pace just off the inside from the outset past the half mile marker, gave way racing into the far turn. SMART CALL, caught four wide between
foes racing into the first turn, was held up up the first flight while pulling hard against restraint shifting inwards a bit nearing the backstretch to race between
foes, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing response. OUR BUBBY BOY, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to
the backstretch, gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
SHEZONEZESTREET was rated inside rivals stalking the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted out after a half steadily advancing on that rival, tipped three
deep racing into upper stretch while being roused to challenge for command and edged forward late under firm handling. DIGGS WON ducked out at the
start, was quickly righted, then was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance along the rail into the far turn,
came through inside the leaders to challenge for command midstretch but proved only second best. POCKETFULLOFPOSIES, off slowly, then cut off at the
start, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for a share on
the wire. CHAPLAIN sprinted to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave way between foes in late stages.
ELEGANCE N TONIC tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, was fanned three deep after a half and faded in the drive.
LEFT OF CENTER was rated off the second flight to the backstretch, tracked between foes under patient handling into the far turn, switched outside foes
racing into upper stretch and was fanned five wide while finishing evenly. I CINC EYE LUV U settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no
rally.

Footnotes
GHOST OF GENEVIEVE was urged to the lead along the inside soon after the break, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and was kept to
her task. SUMMER FIREFLYS was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, steadied momentarily avoiding tight quarters midstretch but
produced a solid closing response to prove best of the others. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn
but lacked the needed final bid while lasting for a share. HARLOW'S HARMONY, off slowly, settled while angling to the inside early, switched outside foes
racing four wide in the stretch but made no impression. RUNNERS HEAT broke awkwardly, settled last racing to the turn, was fanned six wide entering the
stretch but failed to menace. NOEL'S ANGEL broke sharply, flashed brief pace pursuing the pacesetter in the five path in the opening furlong, continued in
the three path into the bend and gave way into the lane. OH SO BLEU tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside early but offered no rally.
BELLEFIRE broke slowly, raced four wide into the turn and proved no threat.
