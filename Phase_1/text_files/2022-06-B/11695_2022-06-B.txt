Footnotes
FAFA FOOEY tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. SUMMER
RETREAT was away alertly and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. BIG TIME LOUIE stalked the
early leader and was roused from between foes on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. BE THE CHANGE was hustled early
and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but weakened. ROBUSTO was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

finished evenly. PRINCESS LAVENDER showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but needed more. AERONAUTICA was hustled early and forced

Footnotes
SEA ANNA DREAM was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. SWEET FINALE was in touch and
had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch just missed. LOADED ONCE MORE was off the pace, gained ground on the
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. PRINCESS MORO had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch needed more. JUNGLE GODDESS forced the pace and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. MS SUEDOO was off slow and
saved ground on the turn but was no threat. J M R BOLD VISION was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. LAXMI set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. OVERSTATE was well back, showed nothing
and had no impact.

FED FEVER stalked the early leader, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR
was away alertly, roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. BRADY O'BRADY was in mid pack and raced evenly
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. LOQUACIOUS was hustled early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven
path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. FEDERAL LAW was pinched at the start and closed the gap on the turn but had no impact. SEAL TEAM TWO
set the pace but was headed on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. FIRE FOR EFFECT was off the pace, showed little and was
never in contention. FRAT PARTY had no speed and saved ground on the turn in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN EXPRESS set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. KRZ SOCIETY stalked the leader from the
outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. SUBZERO PLUS was in touch, saved ground on the
turn and finished well. BLONDE ATTITUDE was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for a share.
ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was in range and hustled along on the turn but was no real threat. DIAMONDSINHEREYES was in mid pack, raced wide on the
turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. EIGHT SPEED had no speed and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch had no response. MARTINI SUE was well back and showed little while outrun. GIZMO FLASH was up close and had a good position on
the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
