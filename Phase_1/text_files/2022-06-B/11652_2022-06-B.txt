Footnotes
BART'S DREAM saved ground off the duel, tipped out in upper stretch, finished strongly and was up and clear late. HARRY'S ONTHEFLY dueled two wide,
drew clear and angled in in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. MAXIMO raced off the pace two and three wide, came five wide into the lane, had the
rider lose the whip near the sixteenth pole and was along for the show. TIGRE hit the starting gate to get away last, advanced three wide around the turn
then was one-paced through the lane. CHEERFUL CHARLIE dueled inside for three furlongs, swung out in upper stretch and weakened. DEAR DAD
steadied repeatedly while racing greenly down the backstretch, went three to four wide around the turn and never threatened. DIAMOND EXPLORER (IRE)
had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
TALTARIATE dueled two wide to midstretch then drew off under a drive. DYNAMIC DOM dueled inside of the winner to midstretch and held clear for the
place. EL DE LEO hit the starting gate then steadied when shut off soon after, advanced four wide around the far turn and ran on to gain the show.
ALWAYS THERE stalked the top two from the rail, angled out turning for home and weakened. PHOBIA saved ground off the pace, swung four wide
approaching the quarter pole and improved position. TWELVETWO stalked the pace two and three wide and faded through the lane. MORE DRAMA failed
to menace while racing two wide. RAGMAN played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
FLY THE W stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, reached near even terms late on the backstretch, dueled outside of METEORITO from there to
the wire and prevailed. METEORITO set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner through a long duel and just missed in a game try.
ESPECIALLEA settled off the early pace while racing two wide, went three wide around the far turn and rallied between foes in the lane. HEZA KITTEN
raced off the pace two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and was gaining widest in the lane. COLONIST saved ground off the pace, inched
closer two wide around the far turn and had a slight stretch gain. KING THEO led early, chased inside for a half and fade.

Footnotes
COMMANDANT raced off the pace five wide, was carried eight wide into the lane, closed down the center of the track and was up in deep stretch. CAJUN
HOPE stumbled at the start then steadied when shut off soon after, saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, took
the lead near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked late. MALCOMS ON THE RUN saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide in upper stretch, was bumped
nearing the eighth pole, got through, bid inside of foes and was outkicked. BEAST MARKET bumped with BIG JOHN at the start, chased the pace three
wide, lugged in nearing the eighth pole and bumped SUPER COMPUTING into MALCOMS ON THE RUN, took the lead in midstretch but was outfinished.
ADIOS PAPA CHICO hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, came five wide into the lane and improved position. BIG JOHN was bumped at the
start, raced four wide around most of the turn, came six wide into the lane and never threatened. DON'T ANSWER failed to menace while racing three wide.
J R 'S PRIDE sprinted to the front, set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane. SUPER COMPUTING raced closest to the runaway pacesetter
while racing two wide around the turn, was forced in and bumped nearing the eighth pole and was not persevered with from there. CONRADO trailed
outside. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SUPER COMPUTING, BEAST MARKET WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FOURTH AND PLACED NINTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
