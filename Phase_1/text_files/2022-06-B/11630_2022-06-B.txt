Footnotes
MADAME GAZELLE broke alertly and showed good early speed to the turn, set moderate fractions through the bend, extended the lead in upper stretch,
was kept to steady urging through the lane and held the runner-up at bay in the end. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY bobbled at the start, was hustled to be near
the pace while three deep entering the turn, closed on the winner in the final furlong but could not get by in the final stages and was second best. DANZING
ROAD tracked the moderate pace through the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not close the gap with the top pair in the final stages, while
holding safely for third. GENTLE JULIA chased the pace from the second flight, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. SILVER PERSUASION
lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals, dropped back on the turn and was not a factor. WESTERN TOWN bobbled at
the start and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, improved position approaching the top of the stretch but could not find the necessary late
response.

CAT GAMER was hustled leaving the break, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead in upper stretch and drove clear in the
final stages. NICKEL NICKEL NINE was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, gained ground and tipped out to
go two wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive by CAT GAMER but was best of the rest in the end. STAN THE HOT MAN bobbled at
the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace while outside of rivals, lost ground along the backstretch run, ran evenly to the stretch and lacked a
late response, while well clear for third. HAVAKASH READY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the quarter pole, could not
keep up in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
EMMA'S DANCE tracked the quick early pace, kept close attendance to QUEEN OF THE TRACK along the turn, overtook that rival leaving the bend, drew
clear in the final furlong and was geared down at the end. CROWN KITTEN chased the pace while not far back early on, took up off of heels when CHEAP
CHEAP CHEAP took a bad step nearing the three-eighths marker, mounted a steady rally along the turn and through the drive and was no match for the
winner in the late stages but was clear for second at the end. EYE ON TIGER chased the pace from a three wide position, was outkicked in upper stretch
and held safely for third in the end. TONI TWO POCKET was hustled leaving the break, took back off of the speed into the turn, gained ground nearing the
quarter pole but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the stretch. QUEEN OF THE TRACK was sent to the early lead, set quick early fractions while
prompted by the winner, was overtaken by EMMA'S DANCE approaching the head of the stretch and faded in the final stages. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP was
away a step slowly, chased the pace between rivals to the turn, took a bad step nearing the three furlong marker, was pulled up midway through the turn
and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GALWALKSINTOABAR broke in good order and was sent to the front, showed speed while setting solid fractions through the turn, extended the lead in
mid-stretch, came back to the field in the final sixteenth but held sway in the end. JUMPING JILL FLASH was forwardly placed in the run to the turn, gained
ground outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch but closed well in the final stages and was up in time for second.
NAMORITA was off a bit slowly and lacked early speed, swung out approaching the top of the lane and went widest through the drive, came on in the final
sixteenth and secured third in the end. SOMARA chased the pace, gained ground in upper stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the final
furlong. SPUN AWAY was a bit slow into stride early on, chased the pace from an inside position through the turn and could not muster a late rally.
BOWLMAGEDDON lacked early speed, ran evenly to the stretch and was not a factor. GEMMA ROYAL showed early speed and tracked the quick pace to
the turn, kept pressure on the winner to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
LIVIN' AT THE BU was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the solid pace to the second turn, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter
marker, came on even terms in upper stretch, finished determinedly and bested the game runner-up to prevail. HERE COMES RALPHIE settled just off of
the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, saved ground while gaining ground on the second turn, made an inside move into the drive, briefly took
the lead inside of the furlong marker and was nailed on the line for the win in a game run. DANCE LADY was sent to contest the early pace, edged to a
narrow lead into the backstretch run, set decent fractions while prompted into the second turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker and met
that bid to the eighth pole, was overtaken in the final furlong and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for third. SUE ETTAS GHOST was hustled to
be forwardly placed to the first turn, came four wide through the first turn into the backstretch run, maintained that four wide path into the second turn, ran
evenly to the stretch run and weakened in the final stages. HARBOR ABBEY was fractious in the starting gate, settled off of the early pace while never far
back, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the drive. LEIGH ANN was unhurried in the early stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, trailed
through the second turn and was unable to make a late impact. CONNIE'S PROMISE was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace on the first
turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, dropped back midway through the second turn and could not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
WINTER FALCON tracked quick early pace while well placed, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, angled out at the top of the stretch, gained ground
under firm handling and made a late surge in the final sixteenth to prevail. TRIP TO SPAIN chased the quick pace from a three wide path from the second
flight, mounted a four to five wide rally at the head of the lane, could not reel in WINTER FALCON in the late stages but was up in time for second.
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF settled off of the quick early pace, was roused along the bend and went two then three wide at the top of the lane, gained ground
in upper stretch, continued that bid through the final stages, steadied in tight quarters inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished, while getting up in
time to secure the show. HEAVEN SHINES showed early speed and disputed the quick early pace to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker,
inched away in upper stretch and was just caught by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and could not hold off fast closing rivals for the minor awards.
PRAYER OF JABEZ broke alertly, took back off of the dueling pacesetters, tracked the pace while three deep on the turn, was able to gain ground in the
final furlong but was outfinished in the end. ARTEMUS GORDON showed early speed and contested the pace to the turn, lost a bit of ground nearing the
quarter marker while still near the front, stayed in contention to the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages. BIG PAPA STEVE chased the pace
from an inside path, lacked room in the final furlong and could not offer a late response. IL CAPITANO chased the early speed, came three wide nearing the
quarter pole, was outrun in upper stretch and could not threaten in the late stages. BANDERA AZTECA lacked early speed, lost contact on the turn, was
eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
UNCAGED KITTY was sent leaving the break, showed good early speed while well handled through the turn, was clear into the final furlong, felt late
pressure from the runner-up and held that one at bay to prevail. RED HOT LASS chased the quick pace from midpack, came four wide nearing the quarter
marker, made a steady advance in the drive, closed in the final sixteenth and pressured the winner but could not get by in the end while besting the rest.
PERSUASIVE LIPS was unhurried early on, was steered to go three then four wide entering the stretch drive, was no match for the top pair in the end but
made a good late run to be clear for third. GOING TO SHABOOMS settled off of the early speed, saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch
and was outkicked in the drive. SWANEE stalked the pace, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. BENSON lacked early speed, came four
wide approaching the quarter marker and was not a late threat. LOUD FUSAICHI broke alertly, tracked the quick early pace, lost ground on the turn and
came up empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LADY IN A HURRY was hard to load, hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked speed to the turn, shifted out approaching the quarter marker and
came four to five wide into the drive, came within aim inside of the furlong grounds and offered a good late kick to prevail in the end. KERRYGOLD LADY
was forwardly placed while tracking the dueling pacesetters, shifted out at the head of the stretch, was set down for the drive, closed while on the left lead,
was outkicked in the final stages by the winner but was up in time to secure second. LYINATTHEBAR was asked to show early speed and contested the
early pace with BACALAR, dueled with that rival through the turn while carving out moderate fractions, inched to a narrow lead entering the final furlong,
was overtaken by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and was just edged out in the end for the place. LAKAYA was a bit slow into early stride and
lacked early speed to the turn, ran along the inside nearing the quarter marker, shifted out approaching the top of the stretch to come four to five wide into
the drive, could not reel in the leaders in the final stages but closed willingly with good late interest. BACALAR broke alertly and showed good early speed,
disputed the pace through the turn with LYINATTHEBAR, drifted out leaving the quarter marker, recovered from that drifting and continued to duel into
upper stretch but could not sustain that run and gave way in the final sixteenth. MAGICAL LADY broke out a bit at the start, losing some ground, moved into
contention around the turn but could not sustain the bid and tired late. LEFT EYE broke alertly but was outrun failed to quicken at any point to engage the
field and finished one-paced. RUNAWAY PRINCESS off a beat slow, advanced to be in the second flank down the backstretch, was under a drive from the
half mile marker to the quarter pole then had nothing left to offer in the lane. HILLSDALE NATION chased the early pace to the turn, lost ground while four
wide nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.
