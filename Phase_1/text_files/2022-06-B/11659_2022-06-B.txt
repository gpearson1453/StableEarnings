Footnotes
CATFISH CHARLIE away well, vied three wide for the lead, continued three wide on the turn, drifted into the five path entering the stretch and found another
gear late to nail clear leader late. VIVIAN'S BOY away well, sent to lead to vie for lead with pair of rivals, continued to hold the rail entering the turn, edged
clear heading into the stretch, stayed clear with a sixteenth to go and collared by re-rallying outside rival at the wire. WICKED BLUE away cleanly, rider
chose to stay well off the rail, stalked trio in the three path on the turn, entered stretch in the four path, angled inside of rivals in upper stretch, and rallied to
a be a willing third. LOVE AND HOLD away well and vied for the lead in between rivals on the backstretch, continued to press the pace on the turn, entered
stretch in range and gave way in upper stretch. W. WHITEHOUSE away cleanly, lacked speed per usual, continued near the rail on the turn and launched a
in between rally in the stretch to just miss fourth. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE stalked trio along the inside in a good spot on the backstretch, continued to save
ground on the turn, entered stretch in range and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHANCES ARE UP broke out, steady right hand urging, and proved best in a trouble filled affair. INDIAN OCEAN antsy in the gate, broke out and bumped
on hind end by rival, lugged out due to bumping, corrected and showed good quickness, but tiny filly was outkicked by outside rival in final sixteenth.
ELEGANT JESS broke in, lugged in two paths early, asked left handed to straighten out, leveled and kept on while being a tad green. VANISH off slow,
bumped around and took up at the start, after her chances vanished, she drifted in and hand ridden to the wire. FIRST DOWN ICON swerved out five lanes
at the start, ducked in four lanes early, lugged out last half of the race in a very green effort. AUTHORIZE THIS came in and bumped rival twice at the start,
lost path early, hand ridden throughout and never threatened.

Footnotes
MAD TOOL away cleanly, quickly cleared and on to way to victory, then lugged out hard late and under a stranglehold to not lug out. VAL QUERETANO
away cleanly, lugged out passing the gap, in range early and shied late from lugging out rival. JESS A COMET RIDE hesitated and bumped around at the
start, under a hand ride throughout and finished well. APOLITICAL FIRE broke in and then out at the start, lugged out passing the gap and showed mild
interest. KR ROCKET MAN broke out and bumped rival at the start, bumped early by rival, floated out by rival early, and lugged out late under a hold.
TERRIFIC PHOENIX off slow, came in and bumped rival at the start, bumping caused a stumble, once leveled showed big long strides to make up ground
and finish willingly. VGK CORONA CARTEL broke in and bumped rival at the start, quick strider in contention early, hand ridden until rival lugged out and
had to check off heels late. JOB OPENING bumped at the start, drifted in and bumped rival early, in range early, rivals on both sided drifted and took path
approaching the final sixteenth and had to take up sharply.

JETTIN GIGI away well, lugged in two lanes early, well clear in a convincing win. SENTAURO IMAGE came out three paths at the start, kept switching
leads early and tried to drift in and out in a green effort. TIPPA THE ICEBERG came out three paths at the start, tiny filly kept to task with right handed
urging and held third. SWEET FIRE GIRL off a bit slow, hand ridden throughout in a even effort. A REV off slow and lost path at the start, attempted to alter
out and ended up lugging out three lanes, under a strong hand ride throughout and made some progress late. WEST TEXAS PRIZE away cleanly, hand
ridden throughout and lacked response.
