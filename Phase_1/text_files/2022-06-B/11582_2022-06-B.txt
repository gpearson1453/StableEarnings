MCQUEEN'S BULLITT unhurried in the early going, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path, lugging in into the stretch, then closed
fast under strong left hand urging and drove clear. ZILLION never far back, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane,
shook clear, then was no match for the winner late. SAMURAI SONG well placed, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals
into the stretch and flattened out. PAID THE PREACHER set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, then jumped and lost stride at the
three sixteenth pole and weakened the final furlong. SHOOT YOUR CUFFS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside,
checked and faded. MAGICSTICK was no factor.

GROUNDED sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. NICE ACE
rated close up and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match
strides and stayed on to hold the place safe. PATRIOT DRIVE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed the place. RICHIESGOTGAME well placed and between, angled out into the second turn, clipping a rivals heels
and almost unseating the rider, then came widest into the stretch and edged up for a share. DRIFTWOOD well placed, was clipped by a rival entering the
second turn, loosing ground, then faded in the stretch. JEN'S SONG was no factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE,
