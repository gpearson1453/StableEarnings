ONE set the pace from the rail, was coaxed midway around the turn, tipped into the two path while surrendering the lead at the top of the stretch, but held
on for show. NOTION INTERRUPTUS was slowly away, was cued while racing four wide around the turn, drifted into the four path at the top of the lane, but
finished evenly. LA ALHAMBRA chased between foes, was hustled inside rounding the turn, but faded. ALYS GREAT NOTION rated inside but was done

Footnotes
SUBSTANTIAL prompted the pace while two wide, made a sweeping bid in the three path around the turn, took over at the top of the stretch and was much
the best. CLASSY SOLUTION trailed while two wide, was behind and racing in the six path into the stretch, and rallied down the center to get up for place.
TOGA CHALLENGER stalked while three wide, was hustled three wide rounding the turn, but finished evenly. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN led from inside but
faded into the stretch. VEGAS LIFE rated along the inside but was done early.
