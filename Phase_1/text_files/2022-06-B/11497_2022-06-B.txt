Footnotes
GOOD BYE CHARLIE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, increased that advantage and held
sway to the wire. GOBLIN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive finished well to be clearly
second best. RAISE THE BID showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a
belated bid. JAZZ MAN DO pressed the pace from the inside and weakened through the final three-sixteenths. MISS NAVAJO was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. D C GUN RUNNER pressed the pace from between foes for three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
ZENFULLY ZESTY was away in good order to duel for the lead with CAUGHT STEALING from the inside, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive,
opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held off the late charge of WATFORD to prevail. WATFORD settled off the leaders early, angled in with a
furlong to run and finished with good late energy. SMOOTH BLUES tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and finished
with a late rally. CAUGHT STEALING broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied through a vigorous drive and gave way
through the final furlong. MARK'S WARRIOR was void of early speed, checked from between foes early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. FARMER FRED R F lagged far back and did not reach contention. TRUEZER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened.

KENTUCKY PEERLESS was away in good order to set a pressured pace, moved four-wide through the second turn, opened a clear margin with a quarter
to run and held off the closing BARBIERE to prevail. BARBIERE raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and finished with good late energy.
MASTERCLASS pressed the pace of the winner from the inside and gave way through the final quarter. PLATINUM GREEK raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. TROOPER showed brief speed, weakened and was eased. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO broke sharply to duel with FLYIN FALYNN from the inside, vied with that foe for a prolonged drive and edged away through the final
sixteenth. FLYIN FALYNN was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with the winner while racing three-wide, vied into mid-stretch and yielded in
the drive. MISS YOU MOM lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. WILMAS IRISH ROVER raced
five-wide through the first turn, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to gain late.
CERNAN pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. JAN'S RESERVE raced four-wide through the first turn, showed
brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
DIABOLICAL MIGHT broke sharply to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by MAJORWAYHOME nearing the quarter and edged away from
that rival in the drive. MAJORWAYHOME was away alertly to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the quarter
but could not match strides with that rival in the drive. LEAD MONTEREY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out
approaching the stretch and finished with good energy. LUCK IN MY EYES showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
TRUELY RIGHT pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
