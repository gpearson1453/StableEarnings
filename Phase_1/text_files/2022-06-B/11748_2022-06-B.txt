Footnotes
CAPTIVATING ART stalked the early pace just outside, took command at the five sixteenth pole to easily open up entering the stretch and won very
comfortably at the end. PHIL IN ECHO was roused at the three eighths pole picking off rivals through the turn, but while a clear second could not offer a
challenge to the winner who was long gone. TSUNAMI SUE hopped slightly on the break, rated mid pack behind the pacesetters on the rail, and finished
willingly to be a clear third. ORIGINAL ME broke in a bit at the break, rated mid pack outside of horses down the backstretch, showed some late interest up
the rail for a minor award down the stretch. YOU THRILL ME was near the back early while saving ground, and angled out through the stretch to pass a
stopping rival late. VERMONT HOLIDAY was away alertly to gain control, collared by the winner at the five sixteenths pole offering no resistance and
stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
VELOCITOR broke sharp to lead, repelled an inside challenge with a quarter to go, opened up comfortably by the eighth pole and won going away.
AWESOME BOURBON chased inside through the turn, loomed into contention three wide turning for home, finished well but never offered a threat to the
drawing away winner. VENTI was mid pack outside early through the backstretch, roused while four wide on the turn, rallied mildly while drifting in through
the stretch to hold third. CALUSA DONNIE was slow into stride, trailed and finished well on end outside of horses in the four path closing for a small share.
CONFUSING was away alertly chasing the pace inside, weakened at the quarter pole and faded through the field the final eighth. CANDY STREET hopped
mildly at the start, was briefly shuffled back through the turn and offered little through the stretch while between runners. SUNYANI broke in at the break,
was between runners on the turn and showed little interest in the final stages.

Footnotes
MY GIRL HOOTER rated inside behind the pacesetters, angled out turning for home to take command inside the eighth pole and was drawing away in the
final strides. MIA'S AUTHORITY put away her pace rival at the five sixteenth pole only to be collared shortly afterwards by the winner nearing the eighth
pole, held well to hold onto second. SUNDAY VISIT was near the back between runners after the break, saved ground through the turn and closed belatedly
between rivals to get third late. CHANCEWORTHTAKING was allowed to settle at the rear inside early, angled out widest through the turn passing horses,
loomed boldly in the four path entering the stretch but stalled the final eighth. BONNIECREST was outside near the back through the backstretch, asked on
the turn and never factored. FREE CARRYCOMB set the pace on the inside, headed at the five sixteenth pole and faded through the stretch.

POINT TO THE STARS broke outwardly, stalked in behind the leaders going four wide on the turn, found room between foes moving six wide into upper
stretch, drifted in a bit and engaged the leader past the furlong marker, dueled and edged past that one late under stout urging while drifting in to bump at
the wire. STAR SCHOLAR stalked from between runners, advanced three then four wide leaving the turn, bumped with a rival twice just past the quarter
pole, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths, dueled late and was outfinished while getting bumped at the wire. BARTICA settled inside, angled five wide
turning for home, finished solidly to get up for show honors. KLIMTOGLORY bumped a rival at the start, tracked mid-pack inside on or just off the rail,
looked for room in upper stretch and came off the rail a furlong from home, was outfinished for third. MAGIC SPIN was bumped at the start, pressed the
pace three wide, bumped with a rival twice in upper stretch, had no extra for the drive. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN set a pressured pace just off the rail,
moved nearer the rail in mid-stretch and weakened. MISTER M V P settled inside well back of the leaders, came out five wide turning for home and ran on.
CLASS IN MAX was in tight at the break and was just slightly taken back, settled well back inside, angled nine wide by upper stretch and ran on.
NORTHERN CONQUEST was forced out at the break, shifted in tracking in behind three wide, failed to rally. SCENIC HOLIDAY broke outwardly and lightly
brushed a rival, pursued the leaders four wide and between runners, floated seven wide into upper stretch and came up empty. THRILL OF THE DAY was
lightly brushed at the start, pursued the leaders outside five wide, came into upper stretch eight deep and turned up empty.

Footnotes
TWISTED PATH was bumped at the start, eased back and shifted in to race between foes into the first turn going two to three wide, was wider coming to
the far turn but angled in early on that bend, lacked room turning for home, came out and split foes at the furlong marker, bid inside and edged away through
the final seventy yards under strong urging. IVY'S STAR settled inside, tipped out heading up the backstretch, moved five wide on the far turn, swept to the
lead in upper stretch, was engaged in late stretch and outfinished. TEXT ME UP tucked in to the rail tracking inside into the first turn, was still
well-positioned in behind runners two to three deep on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch for room and gained late. MAMITA'S CHICA stumbled at the
start, shifted to the rail and saved ground on the first turn racing well off the pace, steadily advanced inside rivals up the backstretch, loomed a threat at the
top of the stretch, came out a few paths and had no extra for the lane. MUSKOKA LADY shifted in two wide early racing mid-pack, moved out up the
backstretch, dropped back three to four wide on the far turn, kept on in late stretch to improve position between runners. SAN NICOLA STAR stalked two to
three wide, lacked the needed late kick. PURE ELEGANCE was urged clear heading to the first turn and shifted in to set the pace inside, weakened.
COCOTARA tracked inside early, came out and was empty for the stretch. ROYAL CITY REIGN stumbled into a rival at the start, raced outside off the pace
three to four wide early and five to six wide on the far turn, came up empty.

TWELFTH MOON set the pace racing off the rail, was clear into upper stretch and held well while being kept to the task. LOADED QUESTION was reluctant
to load, settled into stride stalking outside, went four then five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. MOONLIT SILENCE bumped
a rival at the start, made a strong middle-move outside rivals four wide to loom a threat but could not kick on and just saved show honors. SILVER DAHLIA
raced well back early, came out in the stretch for room and had good late effort but missed third. FLIPPIN was bumped at the break, angled in early to track
two wide, lacked the needed late kick. OLD SECRETS failed to rally after racing three wide through the turn. DIAMOND CRUSH broke outwardly, chased
three wide, weakened. SASSY MARTINI was loaded riderless, in tight at the break, angled in and made an early advance inside to pursue the leader,
faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MY BOY CHRISTIAN hopped at the start, rated comfortably behind the pace early, weaved through tiring horses on the final turn to assume command at
the eighth pole and was inching away late. GRAND GIZMO made a middle move down the backstretch to assume command entering the final turn, opened
up through the turn but was collared by the winner at the eighth pole giving away grudgingly. SOCIETY EXPRESS waited on the rail behind horses into the
final turn, followed the path of the winner mid turn and into the stretch to contend turning for home, was briefly passed by a foe for third but gamely made a
rebid outside to get the show late. SUMMER HARRY trailed in the early stages, was steadied at the five sixteenth pole while on the rail , waited for a path
turning for home and briefly held third but lost that placing late to his rival he was battling down the stretch with. ANSELMO made a mild move while three
wide down the backstretch entering the final turn and stalled outside of horses down the lane. ASCOT BAY broke out after the start, took command on the
first turn and through the backstretch, was headed at the three eighths pole and weakened through the stretch on the rail. NOT A GAME was brushed on
the break, rated inside near the rear early and was never a factor. ZIJJ RUNNER showed speed, chased through the backstretch, weakened at the three
eighth pole and backed up through the field.

Footnotes
FUN COOL stalked in behind the leaders through the turn, moved out four wide past the quarter pole commencing a bid, struck the lead just past the furlong
marker and drew clear. IS THERE A FOREST raced in behind the leaders two to three wide on the turn, came out five wide in the stretch and gained late to
get up for second. SILENT GHOST was urged forward after the start, dueled outside three wide, kept on in the lane. BENNY'S BUTTON was urged forward,
dueled inside a rival just off the fence, yielded late. SHELLY THE ROCKET got away alertly then ceded the lead while content to stalk, was within range
outside, came to the quarter pole five wide, ran on evenly. GOLD FORESTER lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, weaved through runners in late
stretch to rally inside but was too little too late. ALLPAIDUP was outpaced early, raced off the inside through the turn, came out eight wide in the stretch and
was not a threat. J M R GEMMA raced outside three to four wide on the turn, seven wide in the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. LOAD
ABROAD tracked up close to the leaders along the inside, lacked the needed late kick.
