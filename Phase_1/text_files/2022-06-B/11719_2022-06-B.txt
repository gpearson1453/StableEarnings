TRAUMARAMA just off pace to far turn, took over and went well clear late. REDHOT KATIE steadied along early around first turn, raced evenly throughout
while never a real threat to the winner. FORBIDDEN FRUIT pressured on the lead to far turn, faded back in the stretch run. GENERAL GINNY unhurried
early, moved up while improving position only. TOP HAT INVASION had an off rail trip while never a factor. HERO OF THE BEST tried to keep up to the
half, gave way readily from there.
