Footnotes
HUNTER lacked early speed, advanced three and four wide around the turn, swept to the front nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. ASTRAL
WEEKS stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole, led to midstretch, was no match for the winner but dug in to hold second. PORK
CHOP raced off the early pace three and four wide, bid in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip nearing the eighth pole, swung out in midstretch and
missed third. STONE AGE chased the pace three wide and faded through the lane. SHEA D CAPTURE bumped with MIGHTY FROSTED at the start, sped
to the front, set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive. BROADWAY RUCKUS failed to menace while racing three wide. HECTOR B played no factor
while racing five wide. MIGHTY FROSTED bumped with SHEA D SUMMER at the start, chased the pace inside and retreated after a half. KING D had early
speed inside, checked near the five-eighths pole and was through early. JAQUE MATE COCO was outrun while racing two wide. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DEMOCRACY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
pulled clear under an outside drive in the final furlong. I'LL FINISH led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around
the turn, was collared passing the eighth pole and chased the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. NEGLIGENCE tracked the leader up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. CONGRATS AGAIN dropped back to trail the field through
the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses on the rail in the stretch. AWKWARD PAUSE hit the gate leaving it,
settled at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was empty from there. THOUSAND LOVES chased
the frontrunner between horses in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. PACIFIC LEGEND bobbled slightly leaving the
gate, recovered to race in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and flattened out in the
stretch.

Footnotes
TAKE THE PODIUM saved ground off the early pace, dropped back down the backstretch, raced three wide between foes around the far turn, rallied
between foes and was up in the final strides. WHAT KNOT tracked the pace four wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, edged
closer through midstretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and was unable to withstand the winner late. ICE LOVE was in tight nearing the first turn,
bulled through traffic three wide midway around that turn, took a short lead late on the bend, vied outside down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path
around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and held well enough to preserve the show. BACKSPARK saved ground in range, angled four wide nearing the
far turn, chased outside and was one-paced through the lane. SYLLABUS chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. PRESENCIA raced four wide in
midpack around the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn, ran up on heels midway around the far turn, shifted back out four wide nearing the quarter pole
and lacked a closing bid. ENOUGH RAIN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. STRAIGHT TO GO was outrun inside. CROOKLYN played no
factor while racing three and four wide. LADY MANHATTAN hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact. CASARENA HOTTIE was outrun
while racing four wide. LIFENHOWULIVIT set the early pace in the two path and retreated around the far turn.

DRINKS ON ME stalked the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in the final strides. AMERICAN TAP was in tight just after
the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, gained three wide around the turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and led until the final strides.
TURN IT ON set the pace in the two path, yielded near the eighth pole and held well enough to save the show. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT was up close
inside, steadied nearing the turn, raced two wide around the bend and lacked the needed rally. LUCKY GIRASOL chased the pace three wide and faded in
the lane. FOLLOW ME MOM trailed in the three path.

with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, led the field up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. ALBA'S STAR chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
was outkicked in the lane. RED WIND raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly while never
threatening. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and faded in the final furlong. UKIYO raced at the back of the pack early, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and was empty

stretch and gained ground on the outside to get up for the win in the final strides. VOLTE FACE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the
opening half mile, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground between horses down the lane and just
missed while drifting mildly in the final furlong. FISHING FOR FUN opened up a wide early lead racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
saving ground around the turn, had a five length advantage at the eighth pole and was caught late. VALHALLA AIR BASE chased the leader from the
middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked in the lane. GIVE ME TWO STEPS hopped up leaving the
gate, raced outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was empty from there. JUST SO YA KNOW was cut off mildly leaving
the gate, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and never fired. COMMANDER KEITH raced off the pace

Footnotes
WAR OF AGES set the pace along the rail and drew off under a steady drive. MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) pressed the winner two wide, could not match strides
in upper stretch but stayed on to hold second. MEET THE BEAUTY stalked the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally and held well enough to preserve
the show. YEARS AGO steadied nearing the five-eighths marker, chased the pace four wide around the turn and was no threat in the lane. GREGS POSSE
was outrun inside. ARROW SHAPE had early speed two wide between foes and faded around the turn. AMOR Y CONTROL was off a step slow, was in
range inside, took an awkward step midway around the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ASSERTIKO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and refused to yield down the stretch.
LUDINGTON chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two and three path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, dueled outside through the final furlong and could not get by the winner. EXAMINER dueled on the inside up the backstretch
and around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late. SEPTEMBERTEN raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages,
navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and finished evenly. MOTATAABEQ raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
up the backstretch, came around the turn three wide and was empty from there.. THE ICE BEAST hopped up leaving the gate, tracked the frontrunners on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong. ED'S DOG raced off the pace on the inside early, dropped back to
trail the field from the two path coming around the turn and was never a factor.

quarter pole, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear. ALBA MIA tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the
three path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival to the wire. THE JOKES ON ME raced in the

ground steadily on the outside down the lane and just missed second. SHE'S OUTTA HERE trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the

around the turn and faded in the final furlong. HOTTER THAN JULY raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
