Footnotes
MAXIMILIANO broke slightly inward and bumped with BUBBA CABALLO in the opening strides, was nudged to the lead inside, dueled inside of PO BOY
from the five eighths, took a slim lead in upper stretch, cleared under a mild drive and ran on well to the finish. CHRISTMAS PRESENT tracked the leading
pair outside of FINAL CALL early, tracked just behind the leading pair through most of the turn, tipped three wide past the three eighths, was urged for a
three wide bid approaching the quarter, was outkicked by MAXIMILIANO in upper stretch, but chased on willingly three to four wide under a drive. SIR
ACEALOT settled near the rear if the main group, chased in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane and chased on mildly for the show.
BUBBA CABALLO broke out and bumped with MAXIMILIANO in the opening strides, settled at the rear of the main group, continued toward the rear in the
two path on the turn, swung out four wide into the lane, drifted further out down the pane but nonetheless kept on well enough to pass tiring horses. PO
BOY was asked for speed, set the pace through the opening furlong, dueled outside of MAXIMILIANO from near the five eighths, continued to battle two
wide around the turn, was no match from upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SMART TRIAL stumbled at the start and took up behind BUBBA
CABALLO and MAXIMILIANO in the opening strides, trailed down the back straight and in the three path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and
had no rally. FINAL CALL tracked the leading pair inside of CHRISTMAS PRESENT early, settled back to the middle of the main group past the five eighths,
chased four wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and proved empty between horses.

Footnotes
RIVER FINN saved ground around the first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way around the far turn and held
that margin to the wire. JOLTING JOE was pinched back leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground
around the far turn and gained ground in late stretch. CAMMACK saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around the far turn and continued to gain ground mildly while drifting out in the final furlong. FLY
NIGHTLY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, offered a mild bid from the three
path approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked in the lane. CLEAR N CONVINCING fought his rider mildly while racing in the two path around the first
turn, settled in to race up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was empty from there.

Footnotes
KREWE CHIEF settled at the rear, edged closer while saving ground around the far turn, angled five wide into the lane and went to a drive, found his best
stride near the furlong mark, led at the sixteenth and kicked clear. BIG SPORT tracked the pacesetter early, engaged two wide from near the three eighths,
loomed at the quarter, took a narrow lead midstretch, was headed near the sixteenth by KREWE CHIEF and chased on second best. NORTH SIDE was
urged to the lead, set the pace down the backstretch, continued on the front in the two path on the turn while taking pressure from BIG SPORT from near
the three eighths, carried a narrow lead into upper stretch, was headed by BIG SPORT midstretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth. BOOM FIVE
THOUSAND chased toward the rear outside of SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE down the back straight, continued toward the rear between that foe and
WINGING WAYS while racing in the three to four path on the turn, was pushed along past the three eighths, swung four wide between horses in upper
stretch, and lacked the needed rally. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE chased toward the rear down the back straight, chased in the two path inside of BOOM
FIVE THOUSAND around the turn, and had no rally two wide in the lane. WINGING WAYS tracked outside of BIG SPORT early, settled back to track the
leading pair approaching the five eighths, flattened out in the four to five path around the far turn, floated six wide into the lane under a drive and made no
bid.

midstretch and continued clear through the finish. LADY WHITE SOX chased four wide down the back straight, joined the tracking flight into the turn and

CASH raced at the inside at the rear of the main group early, inched up to join the tracking flight approaching the half, saved ground with the tracking flight
around the turn, proved no match for CAMARGO into the lane, and chased on while outfinished for the place. RAZ COUNTRY was taken to the rear early,
got pushed along from the rear in the four to five path on the turn, was taken five wide into upper stretch, and chased on mildly under a drive. DIAMND CON
SUERTE was anxious in the gate, tracked the leader outside of A P BLAZING GREEN early, tracked three wide between horses on the turn, came two wide
into upper stretch while proving no match for the pacesetter, and flattened. J J'S SOLUTION raced two wide at the rear of the main group early, was
outpaced into the turn and chased at the rear in the three path around the bend, swung seven wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. A P BLAZING
GREEN tracked the leader early, raced two wide between horses in the tracking flight on the turn to the five sixteenths, began to flatten out, was driven
inside in upper stretch but proved empty.

Footnotes
MOVE ON OVER was placed on a narrow lead inside of NO MORE Z U, set the pace early while prompted by that foe, vied inside of NO MORE Z U around
the turn, edged clear in upper stretch, began to open up when shown the crop midstretch, and continued to edge further clear under a mild late drive. ART
HEIST tracked the leading pair outside of BOURBON DELIGHT early, continued to stalk the leading pair three wide around the bend, drifted out into upper
stretch, angled back in under a drive, and chased willingly for place while no match for the winner. NO MORE Z U prompted the early pace outside of MOVE
ON OVER, disputed the pace outside that foe around the turn, proved no match from upper stretch and flattened out. VALLEY VISTA broke outward, settled
toward the rear of a close-knit main pack early, chased while saving ground on the turn, was urged two wide in upper stretch, proved no match for the
leaders from the three sixteenths and flattened out. BOURBON DELIGHT was hustled for early pace but outsprinted by MOVE ON OVER and NO MORE Z
U, tracked the leading pair early, lost ground on the leading flights in the three to four path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch and came up
empty. MIGHTY CONTENDER was a bit slow to gather, settled at the rear trailed inside around the turn, was driven three wide into the lane and had no
rally.

Footnotes
MOM'S RED LIPSTICK raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and pulled clear
on the outside under a hand ride. SHARP HERO tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, moved up to
challenge approaching the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home. GIRL NAMED PATSY raced
off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, raced into tight quarters in midstretch, found room and
gained ground late from there. WAY TOO SMARTE trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, switched to the outside in
upper stretch and passed tiring horses in the lane. LIPLINER brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened late. LILY'S WOOFY brushed with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, chased the pace setters up the backstretch, swung wide entering the stretch, gained some ground in upper stretch and was
outkicked in the final furlong. MIZ BLUE dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground
around the turn and faded in the stretch. SHEZ STUCK UP raced off the pace on the outside early, began to drop back while racing in the three path around
the turn and was outrun from there.

SAY CHEESE settled near the rear early, began to improve three deep into the turn, chased in the seven path around the bend, swung seven wide into the
lane, continued to improve while drifting out, found her best approaching the sixteenth mark, took the lead past that pole and kicked away late. LONG TALL
WOMAN tracked the leading trio down the backstretch and into the turn, edged closer to the leading pair near the three eighths while positioned three wide,
swung five wide into the lane, drifted out under a drive but nonetheless continued to rally, headed the leader near the sixteenth mark but was outfinished by
SAY CHEESE. GHAALEB'S MAGIC chased inside horses down the backstretch, continued midfield in the two path on the turn, floated four wide into the
lane, was in a bit tight between horses in upper stretch, but continued willingly between horses down the lane and got up for show between in time. GO
STORMIN GIRL was sent for pace inside, carried a narrow lead inside of AVASARALA down the backstretch, vied inside of that one through the turn,
kicked away from that foe in upper stretch, kept on while confronted by LONG TALL WOMAN far to her outside shortly after, but was headed near the
sixteenth and flattened out late. HOT DAME broke outward, settled at the rear, trailed in the four to five path around the turn, dropped to the inside in upper
stretch and offered a rally inside horses, but was outfinished in the final furlong. BAILESTON LASSIE attended outside the leading pair early, tracked the
leading flight in the six path on the turn, raced into the lane six wide, and came up empty. HER GOLD MINE chased outside of GHAALEB'S MAGIC down
the back straight and into the turn, continued toward the rear in the four to five path around the bend, was driven three wide into the stretch, and lacked a
rally. AVASARALA attended the early pace between horses, pressed outside of GO STORMIN GIRL around the turn, proved no match from the quarter
pole, and weakened between horses while floating out.

Footnotes
PACKED HOUSE was a bit keen while saving ground around the first turn, settled in to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way on the
rail around the far turn and drew off down the lane. HANNITY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn still in the two path and pursued the winner to the wire, holding second from a late closer. TAP THE MOJO saved ground around the first
turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and improved position on the
outside in late stretch. TALLESTOFTHETALL saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to race inside around the far
turn, and gained ground while drifting out in the final furlong. MALIGATOR trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, and gained ground on the outside late. DEVIL'S RULE saved ground
around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming around the far turn and tired in
the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the far turn and flattened out from there. WILLING TO SPEED raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and was empty in the stretch. HONEST TO GOODNESS raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, improved position mildly while racing in the two path around the far turn and faded in
the lane. GAGOOTS hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, began dropping back coming up the backstretch and was done early.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED.
