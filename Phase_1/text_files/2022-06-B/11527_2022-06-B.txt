FALLON WHO was hustled along to open a clear margin before going a quarter, saved ground while setting the pace and held SUPER HUNK safe in the
drive. SUPER HUNK was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, could not reach the winner but
finished with good energy. SMOKE STACK lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. D C ALLIED FORCES
chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three furlongs. ELIAS GIRL settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn and failed to menace. IMAGINARY RIDE was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NOGAL CANYON bobbled at the
start and lagged throughout.

ZIPPIN BY U was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down FI FI
D'ORO in the closing yards to be going away late. FI FI D'ORO was away in good order to duel for the lead with INDIAN DIVA from the inside, disposed of
that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. STELLAR WAY was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. INDIAN DIVA broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way
after going three-eighths. LATENITE SLEWZY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. MCCIRCA was off a step
slow, lagged and did not reach contention.
