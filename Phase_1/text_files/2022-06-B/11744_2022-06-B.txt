Footnotes
ONE THAT GOT AWAY allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled with HIDDEN MEDAL and drove clear
from that one late. HIDDEN MEDAL mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled with the winner, was no match
for that one late and held the place. RIO DEL ARMOUR chased the pace in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out, then lacked the needed late kick. MORE RANSOM mid pack, looped two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into
the stretch, angled out and flattened out. SLENDER BETSY well placed, saved ground through the turn on the two path, came through on that path and
weakened. ALATION rushed up into the turn gaining a striking position, bid outside the leader and faded the final furlong. WINGS OF LOVE passed tiring
rivals. TUDOX I DON'T BRAG sprinted clear in the early going, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. IRON WILMA was a
brief factor.

outside the leader, looped three and four wide through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. BACKDOORPARTY allowed to settle,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled out in the stretch and improved position. GOLOVKIN tracked the pace, lost ground through the turn,

Footnotes
WHISKEY DASH rated back in the early going, moved to position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drove
clear late. JACKSON STRONG set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the winner late
and held the place. SILVER TOKEN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled widest in the stretch, then lacked the
needed late kick. CHAOS KID vied for the early lead on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. FIGHTIN PHIL unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and evened out.
TITHED ran evenly. ZAMAN was no factor. TRAFFIC THIEF was never involved.
