Footnotes
FINE ONE WON stalked the pace outside, took over midway on the final turn then pulled away driving. GLOWING STAR hustled to the front inside, was
collared into the far turn, proved no match but finished willingly for the place. BLUNT FORCE four wide into the first turn, raced close up then flattened out.
SWEET BLAME three wide early, was eased back to inside before half mile and lacked a rally. PENANCE broke sluggishly then raced far behind
throughout. SQUAN'S KINGDOM dropped back in the two path and gave way readily.

Footnotes
WILD UNION settled inside, bid on the turn, angled out, split foes advancing into the stretch and edged away. THE RIGHT PATH lagged far behind, moved
wide on the turn and in the stretch rallying. THE BIG BLUFF raced close up between rivals, remained prominent to midstretch then tired. DEFIBRILLATOR
chased outside the leaders, moved very wide into the lane and was outfinished. CRAFTY JACK stumbled slightly at the break, vied outside and weakened.
CAPE MAY STYLE dropped far back inside then narrowed the gap late. POLITICAL broke slowest and was never in contention. GO HUSKIES set a
pressured pace along the inside to the quarter pole and faded.

SWEET WILLEMINA reserved inside, angled out advancing at the quarter pole, rallied to the front soon after and drew away while kept to her task. BLUE
PAYNT eased back to the outside after the quarter, led briefly on the final turn but was no match for the winner. TOMARIE vied outside early then led inside,
continued well while no threat. ADHWAA saved ground far back then rallied mildly. IT'S SO EASY raced very wide throughout, was asked for run on the
final turn but faded. SUGAR STREAK broke slowest and raced far back throughout. TILSA stumbled at the start, raced close up and stopped abruptly.
LEAN ON E raced within range three wide and was finished after half a mile.

JULIET'S MUSIC stalked the pace outside, took over near the quarter pole then edged away under urging. CONNOISSEUR controlled the early fractions,
dueled on the final turn then weakened. MAGNETIQUE chased near the inside and flattened out through the stretch. VALERIE FIRST lagged far behind
then offered some late energy. TIME TO TWO STEP chased along the rail and was never in contention. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL raced very wide, moved
closer before the half then gave way. I'LL MAKE IT COACH hesitated at the start then trailed throughout. IRISH JUMPER ran off prior to the start and was
ordered a late scratch.

THE METHOD settled close up in the two path, vied from midway on the final turn to the finish and was up in the late stages. VICTORY IS OURS clear
briefly, was challenged from both sides and held on gamely. TEQUILA JR in tight nearing the first turn inside, forced the pace and faltered. AUSTIN
WHYLIE raced wide throughout, moved briefly closer before half a mile then faded. LIBERTY RUNNER trailed for five furlongs then moved very wide into
the stretch. OUR FREEDOM lacked speed saving ground, angled out on the final turn but had no rally. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM prompted the leader
three wide for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

start, led outside dueling, remained ahead to the final sixteenth and held on gamely. CELTIC HEART saved ground to the stretch, angled out and closed
well. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN lacked speed between rivals, faded on the turn and had only a mild bid in the stretch. NORTHERN EXPRESS raced
very wide then passed fading rivals. ICONIC LEGACY angled outside in the opening quarter and began weakening on the turn. JUGGLER raced just off the
leaders very wide and faltered.

Footnotes
CHUB WAGON pursued the leaders inside, angled out advancing near the quarter pole, engaged in a long stretch duel and gamely edged ahead late. HEY
MAMALUKE quickly clear off the inside, drifted out in the stretch, resisted the winner and battled to the finish. CASTILLEJA dropped back outside, then
remained very wide to gain third. HIPNOTIZADA prompted the pace in the opening quarter, lost position on the turn and continued to fade. SIDNEY SUE
saved ground while outrun on the backstretch and gave way readily.

back inside, angled wide into the stretch and closed well. AEGEAN SEA quickly took control, widened on the final turn then shortened stride in the stretch.
MISS LOYALTY saved ground trailing her field then reduced margin through the stretch. PEACH PERFECT lacked speed off the inside and failed to rally.
BRAVO REGINA raced wide, made a brief bid then gave way. CLOUT CHASER broke alertly and raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then faded.
MARIANNA QUEEN flashed brief speed and stopped abruptly.
