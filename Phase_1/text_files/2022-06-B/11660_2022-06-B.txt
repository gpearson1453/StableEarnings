Footnotes
YOUR RINGER went up to take control early and set the pace inside a rival, dueled around the turn, lost touch and tipped outside the leader at the top of
the stretch, re-bid with a furlong remaining and drew clear. BABY KRISTEN pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and carried a short lead
leaving the bend, cleared at the quarter pole, challenged by the winner in the final furlong, could not fend off that rival but was clearly second best. ASYLUM
chased in the two path through the turn, lacked a needed bid in the late stages but kept on to best the rest. DREAMER GIRL came in at the start, drifted in
and bumped early, went three to four wide around the turn and failed to threaten. SPRING SPINNING was off a bit slow to begin, raced widest into the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH got force into rival at the start, got bumped on both sides early, angled out
and came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MAMAS GOT CASH chased from off the pace, took the turn three to four wide, angled in entering the
stretch and never responded to urging. UNUSUAL BREEZE chased along the inside, angled out into the stretch and never menace. LIBERTY LIBERTY got
bumped from outside at the start, took another bump from outside on the backstretch, chased along the inside then eased off the rail and went three wide
into the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
VETOED pressed the pace three wide early, went up to duel and take over on the far turn, cleared into the stretch, responded when challenged by the
runner-up and drew away. SETTECENTO chased along the inside, tipped out on the backstretch, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and came four
wide into the stretch, bid outside the winner but lacked the needed late punch and held the place. DIVINE FEMININE chased two wide early, steadied near
the three-quarter pole, went between rivals to take control, dueled around the far turn, lost contact into the stretch and kept on to miss the place.
FUNKENSTEIN was off slow in the beginning, trailed four wide around the first turn, gained while angling six wide on the second bend and finished willingly
for a minor award. HEAVEN'S MUSIC broke a step slow, traveled three wide early, came five wide into the lane and weakened. LITTLE MISCHIEF pulled to
the front early and was taken in hand, lost command early on the backstretch, chased along the inside while losing positions on the far turn and faded.

FLATTERWITHJEWELS settled off the pace, went four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied widest in the drive and got up in the
final moments. RIGHTEOUSLY stalked the pace outside a rival, rounded the bend three wide, continued to give chase through the lane, put in a bid in the
final sixteenth but got outkicked by the winner. ISLAND LIFE sped to the front from inside, saved ground through the turn, roused in upper stretch, put to
left-handed urging in the final furlong and got caught in the closing strides. IT'S A RIDDLE threw his head, hopped and brushed the gate in the beginning,
went three then four wide on the turn and earned a minor award. SPARKLING GEM broke well, chased the lone leader two wide to the stretch and
weakened in the lane. NISHICO saved ground through the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WALL STREET TRADER broke a bit slow and got brushed leaving the gate, went up to take control and cleared around the first turn, opened up a
comfortable lead on the backstretch, padded the advantage on the far turn, drifted out some in the lane and was corrected with the right-hand, then
continued under steady handling to win easily. WHISKEY VISION went four then five wide around the first turn, remained well off the rail then angled inside
on the second bend, came out in the stretch and rallied to gain the place. ROYAL ORB chased two then three wide early, remained off the rail to the stretch
while closest in pursuit, lacked late response and lost the place. CARDOZA was off slow from inside, went two to three wide into the stretch, moved out in
the lane and lacked a rally. SIERRA PASS broke slow from outside, tracked four wide through both turns, came five wide into the stretch and tired. MR
FREEBIE away quickly then became rank when trying to be rated, stalked along the inside then two early, saved ground through the second turn and
weakened. MISSING MAURICE brushed with the winner at the start, tracked three wide early, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

HARPER'S GEM sped clear quickly, showed the way from inside to the stretch, met the challenge from SOUL PRODIGY, responded by drawing clear
approaching the eighth pole and was kept to a drive to the line. SOUL PRODIGY brushed with inner rival at the start, chased three deep then three wide into
the stretch, bit outside the leader with a quarter mile left to run, could not sustain the challenge with a furlong remaining and stayed on to hold second.
LUCKY RYAN SEVEN brushed with outside rival at the start, chased the speed from between rivals then two wide on the turn, was a bit crowded between
the top pair at the top of the stretch, tipped to the outside nearing the final sixteenth and finished willingly while almost gaining the place. GLENROY tracked
off the rail, two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the lane and never threatened. NO MALICE chased along the inside under coaxing, entered the
lane a bit off the rail, moved out in the drive and faded.

WEEGEE chased two wide early and took an awkward step late on the first turn, spun three wide into the lane, split foes at the quarter pole, kicked clear
quickly and drew off. SAMBA FLAVOR raced outside rivals or four wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair three, four, then five wide on the second
turn, put in a bid with a quarter mile left to run, could not kick on the with the winner but stayed on to secure second. ARMAVEER chased four then three
wide early, went up to press from outside, challenged and took control on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and kept on for third.
AMADMADWORLD sped clear then was rated early on the front end, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled on the far turn and lost
command, then weakened in the drive. PRINCE ZIGGY settled early, traveled off the rail then came out further on the far turn, entered the lane six wide and
lacked a rally. FORGOTTEN VOWS chased between foes around the first turn then dropped back, was on the backstretch, pulled up on the far turn and
walked off.

QUAGMIRE MAGIC took a bumped leaving the gate then sped clear, vied with rivals on the inside to the stretch, drew clear again past the quarter pole and
was kept to task to the wire. HOT MEMORIES broke in and bumped both sides at the start, went up to duel for command in the two path, drifted out a bit
and came four wide into the stretch, drifted out further in the lane and held the place. MENDEZ MILE raced up close four deep early, came six wide into the
stretch and flattened to third. SANTIAGO'S CAT was off a bit slow to begin, trailed three wide into the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend and
earned a minor award. CODIS BREAKER stumbled and bumped in the beginning, raced up close three deep, chased five wide into the stretch and
weakened.

ALL DIALED IN dropped back early, swung widest and came six wide into the stretch, closed in on the leader in the final sixteenth and drove clear.
STRESSED set the pace between rivals early, dueled inside EQUILOVE (IRE) while in the two path around the bend, disposed of that rival with a furlong
remaining but got run down by the winner late. EQUILOVE (IRE) pressed the pace outside rivals to the turn, dueled three wide outside STRESSED on the
turn, fought to midstretch then lost contact with the leader approaching the furlong grounds and flattened to third. SATURDAY HEIST pulled hard and had to
steady off the heels of the leader early, continued to fight the rider early on the turn, settled into stride and chased four wide into the stretch but flattened out.
OPTIMAS chased three deep early on, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN PANTHER up close early on the inside,
chased two wide leaving the bend and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

DESMOND DOSS dueled for command inside LOUD MOUTH, battled two wide into the stretch, disposed of LOUD MOUTH in upper stretch then met the
challenge from FASHIONABLY FAST, responded when called upon and held gamely to the wire. FASHIONABLY FAST stalked the top pair three wide
early, spun four wide into the lane, bid outside DESMOND DOSS but lacked the needed final kick to get by the winner. IRISH HEATWAVE broke a step
slow, went two wide around the first turn, angled out on the second turn and went four wide into the stretch and was along for third. LOUD MOUTH dueled
for command from outside, fought three wide into lane and gave way.
