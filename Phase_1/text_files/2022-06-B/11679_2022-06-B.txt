Footnotes
MAGAZINE STREET was unhurried early away from the gate, started a steady gain up the rail from the half mile pole, then angled out slightly around the
eighth pole, closing hard to get up for the win with a driving finish. GOLDEN FLASH made the lead, racing on the rail, then drew clear of the field in early
stretch but hung a bit nearing the wire and was outfinished late. TRUE DAKOTAN had no early foot coming out the gate and trailed by a distance, and
saved ground and closed up the rail to get up for show. DARE TO BE WILD got bumped at the start, moved up quickly to chase the pace but gave way in
late stretch. INITIATOR pressed the pace early, racing two wide and faded in the stretch drive. STUCK stalked the pace, two wide and dropped back in the
stretch. RIVER KAT stumbled at the start, bumping a foe and was no factor.

from the half, but it was not enough. MOONLIGHT BLAZE was mid pack, three wide with an even effort. SISTER SIS was mid field, three wide and lacked a

down the lane, but was too late. MOVER pressed the pace early on, two wide and flattened out in the stretch drive. BONFIRE PARTY made the lead out of
the gate, drew clear of the field in the turn, but gave way at the eighth pole. CARBON STRYKER had no early speed, running in the two path and had a mild

Footnotes
JOY IN THE BATTLE made the lead out of the gate and drew clear of the field down the backstretch, going wire to wire for an easy win. JUST PEEK'N was
mid field early, racing along the inside, then rallied down the lane, dueling with BALI DANCER, to grab place. BALI DANCER was in the middle of the pack,
racing four wide, then closed from the far turn but hung late, holding on for show. SIGNE was allowed to settle, then angled out around the turn, making a
mild rally four wide down the lane. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL was mid field, two wide, made a bid around the turn but flattened out in mid stretch. MISS WOW
WOW stalked the pace, two wide and faded in the turn. COME CORRECT was near the back, three wide and failed to fire. SCRAPPY PATCH had no early
foot, four wide and failed to repond. L G GIRL chased the pace early, racing three wide and was through after three quarters. SAGANAKI pressed the pace
from the two path and dropped back in the turn. SPINNING YEAR trailed the field, running along the rail and showed little.

Footnotes
TIZ THE BIG ONE bid for the lead while six wide, was gaining on the turn then drew clear in late stretch under a gamely drive to prevail. DOUGH BOY was
in a steady drive while two wide into the turn, then angled out mid stretch and was closing well and was up for second. MOR VICTORY was in a steady gain
while two wide, gained the lead on the turn, but was passed by an outside rival in the stretch and gave way for the place prize. PRETTY MACHO chased the
pace from the inside, was in a steady drive, was in tight on the turn then continued to bid mildly down the stretch but was no threat. RED DRAW was in a
mild bid along the inside into the turn then was evenly throughout the stretch drive. CRAZY MUGGS was unhurried early to bid two wide on the turn, then
drifted in mid stretch but was no factor. AMERICAN FOREST was in a hard drive to gain the lead early, was used up on the turn and faded. NIGHTWIND
was unhurried early and failed to menace. LET'S GO ROMEO was unhurried early and lacked rally. MORO TRENDSETTER bid while three wide, then

just held on for an exciting win. GUITAR GROUPIE had no early speed, racing from the outside, made a bid going into the turn and closed with a rush,
drifting to the three path and just missing at the wire for a game finish. JUSTCAUSEICAN was near the back, racing along the rail, then angled out around
the turn and closed, six wide to get up for show. HOP ON IN was mid field early, then got in tight and was steadied at the eighth pole, angled out slightly and
rallied to the wire. ANNA B chased the pace early, three wide, made a bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch drive. GRACES PACE chased the
pace early, two wide and failed to respond down the lane. PHUNK made the lead early, two wide and gave way in late stretch. GOVERNOR ANN was mid
pack racing along the rail and had an even effort. BLINGONMERCURY had no early speed, running in the four path and passed a tiring rival. PEYTON

Footnotes
RANTHEREDLIGHT was in the middle of the field, racing two wide, then closed willingly, between horses and just got up for the win in late stretch.
FEDERAL HILL had no early foot, saving ground, then making a steady gain from around the far turn, drifted slightly, closing hard for a game second.
BRICK TOWN made the lead early on, racing along the rail, then gave way grudgingly at the sixteenth pole to hang on the show. BRAZIL NUT had no early
speed, traveling on the inside, then rallied down the lane but it was not enough. WILDWOOD Z chased the pace, from a distance down the backstretch,
running in the three to four path, then offered a mild bid down the lane. RONIC was in the middle of the pack, angled out around the turn, four wide and
offered a mild rally. RVINDICATED was near the back early on, then angled out around the turn, four wide, while making a bid, but flattened out in the
stretch. KALEO got off slow, moving to the middle of the pack down the backstretch, made a rally in the turn, but failed to sustain the bid. EXCELLENCY
was mid pack, four wide and faded in the stretch. MALIBU THUNDER pressed the pace, two wide, dropped back stretch. GOD HELP US was mid pack
early, three wide and though after a half.
