Footnotes
HANS GRUBER stumbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered to settle just off of the pace while keeping a four wide path into the backstretch
run, advanced on the second turn, came to even terms with GALLANT OAK inside of the furlong marker, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and wore that
rival down to prevail. GALLANT OAK was hustled leaving the break, set pedestrian fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, came under
pressure approaching the quarter pole, was headed by HANS GRUBER inside of the eighth pole, dueled with the winner to the wire and was bested in the
end, while clear for second. UNUSUAL CODE stalked the pace from a three wide path on the first turn, lost position on the second turn, was outkicked in the
drive but gained ground in the end and was clear for third. CHARLIE THE GENT was forwardly placed in the early going, kept close attendance to the pace
through the second turn, was between rivals nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

MAGICAL THOUGHT came three wide along the first turn while attending the pace, tracked the fractions through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground to
JOYMAKER in upper stretch, was set down for the drive, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-pole and made a determined late push to prevail.
JOYMAKER showed early speed leaving the gate, set decent fractions while prompted by MAGICAL THOUGHT, extended the lead in upper stretch, came
under pressure in deep stretch and was bested in the final strides by the winner while just holding for second. IMPERIAL CREED settled off of the early
pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the rail on the second turn, made a steady gain through the drive under firm handling and just
missed for second in the end. CREATIVE ROMANCE settled just off of the early pace, lost ground on the backstretch run, lost contact on the second turn,
was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
FULL OF LUCK (CHI) was sent leaving the break, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted approaching the second turn by
PAINT ME LUCKY, engaged in an extended duel with that rival into the stretch run and determinedly dug in to prevail. PAINT ME LUCKY was away in good
order and took back off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run to confront the pacesetter, dueled with FULL OF LUCK through the second
turn and into the drive, was put to firm urging in the final sixteenth and was denied for the win, while besting the rest. DUB TOWN came in tight leaving the
break, settled off of the early pace, slipped to the rail on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while holding safely
for third. MAXINAMILLION stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, maintained position into the second turn while four wide, ran evenly to the stretch
and weakened in the final stages. KNOWN was unhurried early on, was three wide entering the backstretch run, came four to five wide nearing the quarter
marker, gained ground in upper stretch but could not muster a late rally. FINAL FINAL settled just off of the early pace, lost position on the second turn, was
able to close a bit on the leaders in upper stretch but lacked a final response.

Footnotes
TIME IS GONE broke alertly and showed good early speed to the turn, set quick fractions while extending the lead into upper stretch, was in hand into the
lane and was kept to task in the end while pulling away. DRUMADOON contested the pace to the turn, came in tight midway through the turn and was
shuffled back a bit, lost ground to the winner in upper stretch and was no match in the end but kept on to be second best. OUR EMPIRE was forwardly
placed to the turn, came four wide between runners nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages, while
holding for the show. I GOT SPEED chased the quick pace from a three wide path through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
PRINCE CINDERELLA hopped at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. ONE LAST THOUGHT chased the pace
to the turn, came five wide along the turn while maintaining position, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke alertly and ceded the early lead to DARKSABER, advanced along the turn to engage with that rival and dueled into upper
stretch, was put to steady urging and switched leads inside of the furlong marker and wore down DARKSABER in the end to prevail. DARKSABER was sent
in the early going and showed speed to the turn, was engaged by ZERO BUCKS GIVEN along the turn and dueled for pace duties with that foe, continued
to battle into upper stretch and through the lane and was bested in the end, while holding safely for second. HULA KING chased the pace to the turn,
advanced to take a tracking position while four wide approaching the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch, was able to gain ground on the top pair in
the drive but was outkicked in the end, while clear for third. RUNAWAY KRISTIN chased the pace to the turn, improved position while along the rail on the
turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. HAWK HILL chased the pace to the turn, gained ground while four wide nearing the
quarter marker, was unable to sustain that run in the drive and was not a factor. SPEEDY TRIP stumbled badly leaving the break and was away slowly,
recovered to chase the pace from the rear on the turn but was not able to threaten in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ORISSA took back to stalk the early pace, advanced on DADDYS NINA midway through the turn, overtook that rival in upper stretch, was kept to task
through the lane and geared down in the final stages as much the best. SOO BROOKLYN lunged at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear in the
early going, came four wide along the turn, gained a bit of ground in upper stretch and ran evenly through the drive but kept on to secure the place. R
SILVER FLASH chased the quick pace from a rail path, was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a late rally in the drive but was clear for third in the end.
DADDYS NINA broke alertly and showed good early speed, set quick fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner leaving the bend and
weakened through the drive. CREATIVE MOTION broke sideways at the start and was off slowly, was a bit green in the early stages, drifted off of the rail
midway through the turn and squeezed ON VACATION, could not muster a late rally and was not a threat. ON VACATION chased the quick pace to the
turn, was shuffled back midway through the turn and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted by DAY PLAN, was confronted by that rival
nearing the quarter marker, dueled to mid-stretch, was put to steady urging through the final stages and determinedly prevailed in the end. BUYBACK
stalked the early pace, came two wide along the second turn while maintaining position, tipped out at the top of the stretch, closed well in the final stages
and was denied the win while getting up in time to secure the place. DAY PLAN was forwardly placed into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch
run and advanced on the pacesetter nearing the half-mile marker, confronted TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL along the second turn, dueled with the winner to
mid-stretch and just relented in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. NORTHWEST FACTOR raced in midpack early on, was four wide into the
backstretch run, maintained that path into the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch but could not go on with that run and finished evenly in the drive.
LA VIKINA broke in the air and was off slowly, recovered to be not far back from the pace into the first turn, lost ground on the second turn and could not
muster a late rally. ASSIGNATION was unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground through the far turn, improved position in the stretch run and
was able to offer a mild late rally in the end. MISTY CAT stalked the early pace, was floated out a path leaving the first turn, gained ground while three deep
along the far turn, dropped back in the stretch run and gave way in the late stages. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA had her head turned then hopped at the start
and was off slowly, raced three wide along the first turn, improved position on the backstretch run, slipped to the inside on the second turn, lost ground
nearing the quarter marker and tired in the final stages. REIWA was away a bit slowly and was content to settle in the early going, was unhurried through
the backstretch run, improved position in upper stretch but was not a factor. LA REINE'S LEGACY raced in the second flight into the first turn, came in tight
and steadied leaving the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BANDEENA was sent to the front leaving the break, set contested fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, quickened when headed by
GOOD TIME DOLLY on the far turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and pulled away in the end. GOOD TIME DOLLY was hustled to be forwardly placed
into the first turn, kept close attendance to the pace through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn and headed BANDEENA, was turned away in that
effort and lost ground in upper stretch, was tiring in the final stages and drifted in under firm handling, causing SUGAR KISSES to steady late. SUGAR
KISSES bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was content to settle through the backstretch run, was roused on the far turn and mounted a three
wide bid into the drive, gained ground in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner and steadied inside of the sixteenth-marker when a rival drifted into her
path. CLASS CODE was four wide into the first turn while close to the pace, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, slipped to the inside
along the second turn while still within aim, ran evenly to the stretch and gave way in the late stages. SILK ROAD SALLY was unhurried in the early going,
maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground while four wide approaching the quarter marker but could not sustain that run in the drive
and flattened out in the end. SENORITA ESTRELLA broke alertly then took back on the run into the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch
run, dropped back on the second turn and gave out in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION broke sharply and took command into the first turn, set quick fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, came back
to the field a bit nearing the top of the lane, was kept to task through the final furlong, drew off in the end and was much the best. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB)
was unhurried leaving the break, saved ground while trailing through the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the second turn, rallied in upper stretch
and was no match in the end for the winner but was best of the rest. RUNNING LUCK tracked the quick early pace, maintained position while chasing the
winner through the second turn, was outkicked in the drive and was outfinished for second while saving third in the final strides. MIA SOLINA was forwardly
placed into the first turn, raced between horses on the backstretch run, raced evenly into upper stretch and was just edged for show in the final stages.
ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was off a bit slowly, was unhurried while three wide into the backstretch run, was roused on the second turn and came six wide
into the drive but could not muster a late response. BIG CHICK broke in at the start and squeezed I'M SO ADORABLE, raced in the second flight on the first
turn, advanced along the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn and came up empty in the stretch run. AUSTRIAN NAVY hustled from the gate,
crowded GARDEES WORLD trying to establish position entering the first turn while four wide, was never far back through the backstretch run, lost ground
on the second turn and gave out in the drive. I'M SO ADORABLE was sandwiched by GARDEES WORLD on the inside and BIG CHICK on the outside just
after the start, took the widest path of six around the first turn, stayed wide down the backstretch, got within striking distance of the leaders entering the far
turn but tired passing the three furlong pole and was running on the wrong lead most of the way down the stretch. GARDEES WORLD broke outward at the
start, bumping into I'M SO ADORABLE, once straightened was bumped and crowded on the other side by AUSTRIAN NAVY going into the first turn, was in
a bit tight through the turn, finally found some clear running room down the backstretch near the rear of the field, was asked to pick it up passing the half but
dropped back to last and had nothing to offer from that point.
