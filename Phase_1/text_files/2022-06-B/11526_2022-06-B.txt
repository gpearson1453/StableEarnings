Footnotes
DERONDA was well placed rated along the outside through early stages, moved up four wide late on the far turn, gained a slim lead nearing the furlong
marker then pulled away. SUE HAPPY stalked the pace to the far turn, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, could no move on with the winner past
upper stretch but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. FANCY DIVA was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the
far turn then tipped three wide for the drive and gained a share. MOONSHINE LILY raced four to five paths wide into the first turn then angled in and settled
just off the early pace, hustled up two wide around the far turn but had no response. TALLANDLONG was forwardly placed racing just off the pacesetter,
roused forward and held a slim lead at the quarter pole then got collared in the upper stretch and gave way. MANDONA led the way around the first turn and
set the pace up the backstretch, got overtaken by TALLANDLONG approaching the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
PROUD FOOT was forwardly placed in early stages and raced in striking distance around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the upper stretch,
reached the leader near the sixteenth pole and edged away. FEELIN MY OATS set a pressured pace in early stages and dictated terms by a narrow margin
around the turn, held a slim lead and dug in gamely mid-stretch then failed to hold off the winner. ROME'S BURNING tracked the pace into the turn, hustled
up four wide into the lane and stayed on with response to secured show. A J'S RIDE prompted the pace soon after the start, remained forwardly placed
around the turn, saved ground into the lane and faded in the final furlong. MIZHIPZLETUS lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled up along the outside
and failed to move on. DREAM PIRE chased three to four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
GLAMOROUS LIFE tracked the leader into the turn, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch, took over the lead from MILANA at the furlong marker
and finisihed going away. MILANA sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear around the turn, continued on top into the upper stretch then got
collared by the winner a furlong out and had to settle for second best. PALACE MAGIC rated off the early pace in the two path, tipped out wider late on the
turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane and gained show. MISS ALPHA BELLA tracked the pace in early stages, saved ground around the turn,
edged closer along the inside then flattened late. SLUSHY raced along the inside and steadied leaving the backstretch, cut the corner entering the lane,
showed some interest in deep stretch but lacked a clear path. SAYAAD AIN'T SO broke on top and raced in early contention, chased two wide around the
turn then gave way. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SHOT rated two wide into the turn, tipped wider and headed in pursuit leaving the quarter pole, gathered momentum under left handed pressure,
steadily gained on the leader and ran down TAPITS LADY in deep stretch. TAPIT'S LADY vied for the lead up the backstretch then held clear around the
turn, continued to show the way still unasked entering the upper stretch, came under right handed pressure leaving the furlong marker, dug in for more and
got edged out late. REDNECKER waited in traffic along the inside in early stages then hustled up around the turn, weakened off the top pair in the upper
stretch and held show. DELIGHT SURPRISE lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then tipped three wide for the drive and got
nipped for show. SLOOPY HANG ON vied with TAPITS LADY for the early lead, remained forwardly placed around the turn then faded in the lane.
ATOKAD ROSE showed response in early stages then came up empty late on the turn, dropped back and jogged in.

Footnotes
LITTLE TOE tracked the embattled trio into the turn then edged up closer three wide at the quarter pole, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane,
stayed on determinedly in pursuit of LODE OD BARNEY and edged away in the final sixteenth. LODE OF BLARNEY dueled for lead soon after the start and
battled on around the turn, shook clear turning for home, showed the way into the final furlong then got outfinished. FEARLESS WILL broke in and bumped
with rival at the start, tracked the top flight in the opening quarter then chased two wide around the turn, sustained response into the lane and gained a
share. CARPE VICTORIAM got bumped at the start, flattened inside entering the turn then tipped three for the drive and lacked a rally. CANDY'S LITTLE
TIP dueled in the opening quarter and battled on around the turn then tired in the drive. CATALOGUE lacked speed along the outside and failed to move
into contention. MIDNIGHT DRAMA dueled up the backstretch, retreated around the turn and continued to tire in the lane.

AMERICAN SUE tracked the embattled duo in early stages, chased three wide around the turn, steadied slightly in the upper stretch, tipped out a path
wider, dug in gamely and drew clear. KAYLOR dueled for the lead racing outside of I THINK I KNOW YOU, battled around the turn and into the upper
stretch, shook free at the furlong marker then got denied late. ADDABABY chased along the inside around the turn, came under left handed urging and
came out a path wider in the upper stretch and gained a share. NAUTICAL MISS raced near midpack heading into the turn, came four wide into the upper
stretch and produced a mild bid. FIREBAUGH raced off the early pace, came four wide into the upper stretch then angled in and had a mild improve. CAN'T
MAKE ME raced off the early pace, hustled along five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. I THINK I KNOW YOU dueled inside of KAYLOR leaving the
backstretch and around the turn, battled on into upper stretch then came up empty. BIT A BAD NEWS saved ground and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
OUR LAST CHANCE set a pressured pace in early stages and held a slim lead around the turn, dug in gamely three wide at the head of the lane and kicked
clear. JUSTA STREAK raced three wide up close at the quarter pole, sustained response into the lane but had to settle for second best. LATE FOR LUNCH
raced outside off the early pace, was ridden along four to five wide into the upper stretch and got up late for show. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED prompted the
pace in early stages and remained forwardly placed around the turn, ran on into the lane and got edged for show. STORMIN' J. J. angled inside and saved
ground around the turn, cut the corner and edged closer along the rail in upper stretch then gave way. CHINLEE raced in the back then came three to four
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GONE WITH THE FINN chased along the outside in early stages then raced two wide around the turn and failed to
threaten.
