Footnotes
FREEDOM FACTOR stalked the pace while well in hand and three wide, took over on the outside turning for home, drew away under steady handling.
CHAOSMOS brushed by FREE INDEED at the break, settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the second turn and into the stretch,
rallied up the inside to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. FREE INDEED broke in, brushed with the runner up, was straightened to
race with the pace past the wire the first time while bit rank, dueled the middle half mile, headed by the winner into the lane and began to weaken, allowed
the runner up the inside soon after and could not match that one to the wire. CALCULATE lacked early foot off the inside, raced in the two path second turn,
moved out for the drive, displayed only mild interest to the wire while remaining widest. ALIGNED INTEREST void of speed in trailing for a half inside,
continued to save ground second bend, also lacked a significant closing kick. NOSY BANKER dueled up front in the two path, gave way from between foes
turning for home.

Footnotes
JUSTA BUSTER in the second flight for a half off the inside, closer three wide exiting the turn, engaged the winner approaching the furlong ground, spirited
duel to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. JAMAICAN ME moved up to narrowly show the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace into and
through the turn inside, responded when the winner challenged when straightened for home, proved stubborn to the end. HOLIDAY DIAMOND pressed the
runner up from the outside for over a half, gradually yielded between the top two in upper stretch. MR ELVIN within striking distance early toward the inside,
angled out and was four wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BLAZING CHARM took command after the start inside, set a soft pace inside, quickened a bit late in the final turn, expanded her advantage in upper stretch
then had enough left to comfortably hold the runner up safe late. LIZZ A BEE within striking distance behind the winner along the inside, continued to save
ground while in the second flight through the final turn, remained inside and was slowly getting to that same rival late, clearly second best. GLANCE
prompted the winner from the two path, had little for that one in the drive, allowed the runner up the inside upper stretch, could not match that one to the
wire, remained well clear of the others. GEORGIA DAWN settled off the pace and the inside, continued evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick.
HAVINFUNYET fell back to trail just after the start, remained back for six furlongs, four wide into the lane, made little impact in the run to the wire. LUCKY
LINDA remained back in failing to rally. SMART PEGASUS raced in mid pack for a half, retreated.

Footnotes
FREE FROM GUILT asked to clear soon after breaking with the leaders, quickly opened a considerable advantage toward the inside, maintained that
comfortable edge through the stretch while being kept to task. LIFEASWEKNOWIT chased the winner in vain while off the inside, clearly second best.
TUCKER THE GRUMP back off the pace and the inside, got out to be four wide while floating a couple of rivals out turning for home, up late for the show
while not a threat to the top two. COLT'S BRIM broke alertly, fell back off the early pace, raced on the outside turn, carried out five wide into the lane,
dropped in, mild interest while being outkicked for the show. SWIFT N TRAFFIC balked at loading, last away while a bit rank, saved ground through the turn
to improve inside of several rivals, flattened out in the final furlong to lose the show. RACY BILLE well off the early pace, steered out in the turn, floated out
six wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. LUCA fell back to trail after the start, remained back while wide.

Footnotes
LA SMOOCHIE broke sharp, soon cleared to the inside, maintained daylight through the turn while given a bit of a breather late in the turn, remained clear
through the straight while kept to pressure. MO BELLA broke forwardly, second flight early, chased the winner into and through the stretch, could do little
with that rival the final furlong, clearly second best. A P HUMOR raced back off the pace, in the two path through the turn, split foes a furlong out, staged a
mild rally to be up late for the show, not a threat to the top pair. CHARLIE SKY chased with the runner up early outside that one, came three wide for the
drive, had little left the final furlong to be caught for the show. K V SQUARED raced back off the pace for three furlongs, lacked a closing response when
called on at the head of the lane. T J'S SUNSHINE in mid pack up the backstretch off the inside, dropped to the rail in the turn, improved slightly into the
straight and was also lacking the final furlong. KATIE'S C remained back and never menace. HOUSE OF ZONG broke to the outside and back, steadied,
trailed throughout in showing little. FRACTIONAL SPLITS AND FINAL HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SWEET PRAYERS asked a bit to clear early, showed the way through the turn in hand by a comfortable margin, not threatened through the stretch under
token encouragement. LIL ALLIE DANCER in the second flight while three wide, called on for some run into the lane, had little for the winner while drawing
clear for the second spot. GILDED APPLE last away, moved closer toward the inside before three sixteenths, in a bit of traffic early in the turn, got through
and moved closer to the top two for the drive, no match. ROSE CROWN chased the winner for three furlongs and had little left. OLD FASHION AMOUR
broke with the winner inside that one, fell back before a quarter, went evenly while continuing to save ground. KEHRON'S CREED lacked speed, raced
outside, came four wide out of the turn, failed to respond. BLONDIE LOX BABE fell back to trail while three wide, never a factor.

Footnotes
DREWPOWER bothered a bit at the break, fell in behind the leaders inside, continued up the rail backstretch, encountered some traffic into the far turn,
inherited the advantage when the leader bore out badly taking a couple of rivals with him exiting the final turn, clear to the wire. WISH UPON A STAR off a
step slow, raced back, saved ground through the second turn, also took advantage of melee unfolding in front of him into the straight, chased the winner
past the furlong marker, had little for that one to the wire, all out to hold the second spot. SCORING DRIVE void of speed in trailing for a half, angled out
three wide to advance through a large hole into the stretch, roused, getting to the runner up late. INTIMIDATION broke out, was straightened and prompted
the leader in the two path, was bothered when carried out turning for home, checked up to lose all chance before going evenly to the wire. CLEAR HUMOR
came in just after the start to bother a couple of outside rivals, forwardly placed early, was finished after a half. PLAY MO away well, narrowly set a
pressured pace along the inside, continued to show the way into and through most of the final turn, bore out suddenly with just under a quarter remaining
bothering INTIMIDATION and taking entrymate DEER CROSSING to the outside rail, took up and only resumed stride late. DEER CROSSING hopped at
the start then was put in tight soon after, stalked the leaders off the inside, was moving closer three wide in the second turn when abruptly taken to the
outside rail by his bolting entrymate and was eliminated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT EXITING THE FINAL
TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
PATMEPATMEPATME broke sharp from the outside, clear exiting the chute, remained clear in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, shrugged off
a foe entering the stretch, clear again while kept to pressure. BARRANCA in mid pack early, began to advance three wide midway on the turn, kept on
through the lane to be up late for the place, not a threat to the winner. SECRET MELODY moved up closest to the winner before a quarter, chased that one
into the turn, lodged a brief and mild bid turning for home, could not keep up in weakening a bit to the wire, caught late for the second spot. ASK DALE void
of speed, four wide through the turn when making a mild advance, continued to show some tepid interest through the lane to continue to improve a bit.
MYLIES STAR raced in the second flight along the inside, asked along into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. THE CALLING STONE remained back
while racing in the two path, also failed to produce a response in the drive. EASY ACES last away, remained back. MRS. NECAISE forwardly placed in the
early going, began a steady retreat before a half.
