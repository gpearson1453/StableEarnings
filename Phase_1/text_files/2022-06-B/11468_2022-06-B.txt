Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S FEVER raced on a clear lead while near the inside, was put under some pressure in late turn, was asked for more into the lane then quickly
widened to the eighth pole then held while under a hand ride late. FLYING SAMURAI hopped at the start, raced in the four path through the turns, asked for
more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner after straightening in the lane then kept on to settle for second best. BELLA'S PRAYER
raced in the three path through the turns, was asked for more in late turn, continued in the two or three path into the lane, shifted to the four or five path
nearing the eighth pole and finished clear for the show spot. OVERJOY raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane, shifted from the rail to the five
or six path nearing the eighth pole then lacked a closing response. GRAND IN BAY was along the inside through the turns when unhurried, came into the
lane from the five path and showed some energy late. CAPTAIN HARVEY was never a factor while in the two path through the turns.

Footnotes
FASHION DIVA set the pace into the backstretch, vied down the backstretch with EVIE JEAN, shook clear of that one into the turn, continued on a clear
lead into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then geared down through the final sixteenth. SWIFT RITHMS was in the three path through the turns, was
asked for more into the lane, stayed on well through the final eighth and was well clear of the others. LUSH BE A LADY was in the four to the three path
through the first turn, continued near the two path through the far turn, was in the two to three path into the lane then lacked a bid. EVIE JEAN broke to the
outside and bobbled, moved up to vie for the lead along the inside down the backstretch, chased the winner through the turn then was empty after turning
into the lane. ANOTHER ACCOUNT bobbled at the start, raced in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and never factored.

ROSE MARIE B stalked the three rival duel through the turn and into the lane, bid from the five path through the final eighth and was up in time. BETCHA
vied from the inside of a duo through the turn, shook off dueling rivals inside the eighth pole then was caught by the winner late. GRANITE CANDY vied for
the lead three wide through the turn and into the lane, was still a serious factor with an eighth to go then lacked a finishing kick. ANOTATION vied for the
lead from between rivals through the turn and into the lane and weakened inside the eighth pole. MAJESTIC CLIMB was in the two path through the turn
while unhurried, came into the lane from well off the inside and offered a mild gain. WICKED JUSTICE saved ground through the turn while trailing, came
into the lane from off the rail and gained belatedly from the eight path.

JUST PHIL pressed the early pace inside, settled, stalked the pace in the three path, rallied at the eighth pole and prevailed under mild urging. PRINCE
SHIM dueled early outside of a rival, bid at the half-mile pole to be clear, then couldn't hold off the winner. WHISKY RIVERS pressed the pace outside of the
leader, then gave way in the stretch. ONE FOR THE MONEY was unrushed early, then lacked a late bid. VERY BEST CAFE was not a factor.
