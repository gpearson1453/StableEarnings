Footnotes
TAP ATTACK was angled out heading up the backstretch to move three and four wide in the far turn, bid into the lane and went clear under steady handling.
WOKE UP WILD showed the most early speed to gain inside position about the two or three path, made the running to late in the far turn and could not go
with the winner. NEXTPORTOFCALL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up four wide into striking position in the far turn but could not threaten late.
THREE BALL moved up two and three wide while not a threat. THE GREATEST EAGLE failed to mount a bid three and four wide. UNSOLVED broke into
the side of the gate then bumped with a rival, chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. JIMMIE T was not a factor. PROOF OF PARANOIA tired
racing two and three wide.
