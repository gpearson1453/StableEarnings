FRIEND rated off the early speed from outside, responded when asked on the bend, took the lead with just one tap of the whip inside the final furlong, was
drawing away under hand urging and lugged in some through the waning yards. CREAL SUGAR broke alertly, floated out briefly, was corrected and
expanded her lead on the other two, saved ground taking the turn then gradually wore down the final two furlongs. COMMISSION chased from inside,
began to retreat after three furlongs, gradually swung out through the bend, was unresponsive to urging upper stretch and allowed to coast the last eighth.

FULL MAGAZINE stalked MIND YOUR OWN BIZ from just outside, came to that one after two furlongs, edged ahead when allowed midstretch, moved
clear and only received mild urging in the waning yards. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ reluctant to load and unruly in the gate, broke well once the race began,
broke on top, set a pressured pace inside rivals, was challenged on the bend, under a drive in the lane but did not have enough left. MON AMI FUZZIE
without early speed, picked up his pace under urging along the rail on the turn, angled outside FULL MAGAZINE for the stretch run, was all out, could only
make up minor ground on the top pair the final furlong but was easily best of the others. MARESONOFAGUN bumped at the start, moved to the outside
early on, raced in contention running widest for four furlongs then gave way. YOU'RE IN COREY attempted to wheel at the break, bumped solidly with
MARESONOFAGUN and his rider lost his irons, the jockey regained his footing midway on the backstretch but YOU'RE IN COREY was already hopelessly
beaten. There was a stewards' inquiry into YOU'RE IN COREY'S start but no action was needed after their review.

RAHFEE TOWN quickly recovered from a slight bobble at the start to gain the lead from between horses, edged ahead just off the inside on the turn, was
put to urging in the lane, all out the final furlong, brushed with ABSTRACT PAYNTER near the wire but held sway. ABSTRACT PAYNTER moved off the rail
early on, was widest taking the bend, rallied in the lane, slowly lugged in through the waning yards as he closed in on RAHFEE TOWN, bumped with that
one nearing the finish, came up short but caught FIXICO for second. FIXICO well placed inside, also rallied in the stretch but lacked the extra needed in the
waning yards. LINE OF DENHAMS prominent from the outside, found himself boxed in behind RAHFEE TOWN on the turn, gained a clear path into the
stretch but began to yield.

Footnotes
SNOOZER moved clear of the others after a furlong and a half, was put to a drive in the stretch and kept to task until near the wire. ROCKET MAN ATTACK
stumbled inward at the break, bumping hard with BLEEDING BLUE, vied for the lead briefly inside SNOOZER, moved out some when the latter drew clear
nearing the end of two furlongs, chased from off the inside and could only just hold his position late. TRUIST moved to the inside midway on the
backstretch, took over third upper stretch, lacked a significant bid but pulled away for the show. BLEEDING BLUE bumped off stride at the break, was briefly
settled, rushed up to contention, began to yield from path three on the turn and continued to flatten out in the stretch. THACKER FROMM failed to menace.
DEXTER'S HARD TIME showed little in a ground-saving trip. LELAND JOHN chased from well off the rail and was never a factor. There was a stewards'
inquiry into the start and the rider of BLEEDING BLUE lodge an objection claiming interference from ROCKET MAN ATTACK at the break. After their
review, the stewards disqualified ROCKET MAN ATTACK and placed him fourth for knocking BLEEDING BLUE off stride at the start.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE pressed from outside, responded when asked to gain the advantage three wide leaving the bend, moved clear upper stretch,
lugged in some with a furlong to go, soon straightened, kept to urging until the final forty yards and maintained control. DIAMOND MAXIMUS shared the
early lead outside MKAR THE FAST, two wide taking the turn, could not stay with KHOZAN'S VALENTINE in the lane but was unchallenged for place.
MKAR THE FAST displayed early speed from inside but began to gradually yield before finishing four furlongs, came off the rail entering stretch, angled out
some for a clear path just inside the eighth pole and finished evenly. D' YANK was boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch, angled out some on the
turn, moved out widest upper stretch and was making up ground belatedly inside the final furlong.

Footnotes
MIKE'S LADY prominent between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up after a half mile, came again three wide on the second turn, steadied briefly
when TWO MORE TIMES came out shortly after entering the final furlong, angled out some, was all out the last sixteenth and got up in time. TWO MORE
TIMES broke on top, was allowed to relax, gradually progressed from outside to gain the lead with three furlongs left, moved clear and stayed just off the
inside on the second bend, drifted out under left-handed pressure midstretch, was straightened approaching the sixteenth marker, lacked the extra kick in
the waning yards but was clearly second best. BULU was sent to gain a clear early lead, did not stay with TWO MORE TIMES into the second turn and
slowly wore down the last quarter mile. GRAMMAR very reluctant to load, raced in contention from inside for five furlongs then began to fade.
UNIVERSIADE showed little.
