path into the lane and drew away late in the stretch under a steady druve. EGO was a tad slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into
the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the late stages. RIVER ECHO (GB) raced on the inside along the turns, chased the
pace early, shifted into the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. JURISDICTION raced in the three path along the first turn, chased
the early pace, was in the six path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. MAJORS VINDICATION was never a threat. RYE HUMOR raced in
the four path along the first turn, was in the seven path into the lane and done early. UNIDENTIFIED MAN set the pace for a half then folded up.

Footnotes
ARMAN broke half a beat slowly, recovered to stalk four wide while perched outside of rivals, took aim on the leaders three wide into the turn, loomed a
danger while ranging up in hand to bid at the five sixteenths pole, battled with a game EAKLY through upper stretch, and drove clear in the final furlong.
EAKLY set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist ARMAN's bid turning for home, dueled gamely with that foe through upper stretch, but was headed
approaching the furlong grounds, and was second best. FIGHT FIERCELY chased along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, shifted to the
three path in pursuit of the leading pair entering the lane, and stayed on between horses in the final furlong to claim show in the final sixteenth. BLUFF CITY
pressed the pace setter from the outside, then from between horses turning for home after ARMAN produced a bid, but failed to keep pace with those rivals
entering the lane, held show to the sixteenth pole, but faltered late. TWO PHIL'S pursued while forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but
checked out from being among foes into the turn, chased the leaders from the four path while under urging around the bend, but failed to keep pace with
them in the five path entering the lane, and kept on in hopes of vying for minor placings. NAK NAK BOLT saved ground off of the pace, but lacked enough of
a rail kick to produce a bid. DAKOTA RUN broke a step slowly before steadying behind an outer rival t the start, laid off of the pace two to three wide around
the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly while outside of rivals thereafter. HOW DID HE DO THAT stalked two wide and
between horses, got keen while uncomfortable among foes into the turn, then steadily faded leaving the three furlong pole. SAILOR'S CHANCE was
outsprinted early on, trailed the field in the two path around the turn, and never got involved. SIVAKO broke a step slowly, took the turn in the four to five
path while far back, and made little impact.

Footnotes
SMARMY tugged forward leaving the chute to vie for the lead three wide and between horses, then two wide at the three furlong pole, then only inside of
ROOKERY turning for home after an inner rival faltered, shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, and held sway safely. ROOKERY pressed four wide as the
widest of the contestants in the scramble for the leader lead, vied three wide into the turn, then sustained contention outside of SMARMY turning for home,
but was turned away in upper stretch, and remained well clear of show. DUPLICITOUS tracked in the four path around the turn, chased the leading pair
turning for home, but failed to keep pace with them entering the lane, then secured show from inner rival at the furlong grounds. STELLAR GRACE
prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, faded between horses to trail the field approaching
the five sixteenths pole, then shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and surpassed tiring rivals. LADY TRAVELER vied for the lead inside of a trio of
rivals, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. CODE FOR SUCCESS bobbled at the start, moved forward to chase the leading quartet entering the
backstretch, but failed to sustain a bid, and made little impact.

Footnotes
MASQUEPARADE vied for the lead two wide while in the three path between horses around the first turn, cleared an inner rival and shifted to the rail
leaving the five furlong pole, showed the way inside of a vying SPA CITY around the far turn, shook clear of that one in upper stretch as an outer INTREPID
HEART pursued, dug in to resist that foe's bid leaving the furlong grounds, fought on gamely after getting headed approaching the final sixteenth, shifted out
subtly and brushed his outer counterpart three times in the closing stages, and regained a narrow advantage nearing the wire. INTREPID HEART stalked
behind the leaders while in the three path around the first turn, then from between horses down the backstretch before pursuing from the pocket around the
far turn, tipped outside of the leading pair approaching the lane, took aim on a clearing MASQUEPARADE in upper stretch, ranged up to that foe and
sparked a duel leaving the furlong grounds, forged a narrow advantage entering the final sixteenth, but was brushed by his inner counterpart three times in
the late stages, and got outgamed. SPA CITY prompted the pace outside of the leading pair and from the four path around the first turn, tucked down to the
two path at the nine sixteenths pole while continuing to press a leading MASQUEPARADE, vied with that rival around the far turn, but failed to keep pace
with him and an outer bidding foe at the three sixteenths pole, and managed show thereafter. YOU'RE TO BLAME trailed in the two path, shifted two wide
approaching the far turn, took that bend three to four wide while still at the rear, and improved outside of foes through the lane. MY SIXTH SENSE was
briefly antsy in the gate awaiting the start, then tracked two to three wide, but made little impact. SILVER DUST settled off of the pace along the inside,
shifted outside of foes and gained four wide down the backstretch to press the leading pair three wide around the far turn, but faded after getting floated four
wide approaching the quarter pole. WHISKEY DOUBLE set the pace inside of the eventual winner around the first turn, but faded at the five furlong pole,
and was done early. THE RIDER OF INTREPID HEART CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MASQUEPARADE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
INSIGNIA settled off of the pace in the three path, gained four wide to track into the far turn, loomed while inching closer in hand around the far turn, but only
chased a leading SHE'S KEEN though upper stretch, progressed approaching midstretch to bid leaving the furlong grounds, and drove clear. FOREVER
AFTER ALL tracked two wide, surpassed an inner rival to gain a stalking position from the pocket into the far turn, but only managed to chase through upper
stretch, and lacked a rail punch in the final furlong before reaching place at the wire. SHE'S KEEN vied for the lead inside of a rival, shook clear in upper
stretch, but flopped back to her left lead while an outer INSIGNIA claimed an advantage a the sixteenth pole and an inner rival threatened for place, and lost
that position at the wire. FINE COTTON vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, but yielded in midstretch. AMENSET
tracked in midpack three wide, but came under urging while getting outkicked by the eventual winner approaching the far turn, and lacked a response. FIVE
PRIZES was last away, laid at the rear two wide, gained four wide approaching the far turn, tracked the leaders from the five path around that bend, and
tired through the lane. CINQ SOUERS rated at the rear along the inside early on, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor. MUSIC STREET
stalked the top pair from the three path, but failed to bid under urging between horses around the far turn, and faded in upper stretch. HIGH RESOLUTION
tracked along the inside, but faded at the half mile pole. SOUTH GEORGIA never got involved.
