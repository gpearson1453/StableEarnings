Footnotes
HURRICANE AMIGO gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn, drifted to the outside leaving the turn and closed steadily widest
to get up the final strides. FOREST FROST chased and closed the gap off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch, dug in to a brief lead deep stretch but
was caught in the final strides. FOREVER THE BOSS cleared the field while tapering in and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole
and rounded the turn near the rail, lugged in through the upper stretch, was caught late yards and flattened nearing the wire. BUCKS LODGE chased inside,
was squeezed from his position at the rail nearing mid-stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. FAIRPIT gave only distant early chase well off the rail,
rounded the turn in the five and six paths and finished evenly to pass rivals in the lane. MY MIRACLE MAN gave chase, rounded the turn about the four
path then flattened. COOL DUDE gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. A Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of
foul against the rider of Forever The Boss, lodged by the rider of Bucks Lodge, resulted in the disqualification of the former to fourth place for coming in on
the latter nearing mid-stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE COLLAR BOY raced well back from early contention while saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the seven path of the far turn, dug
in widest through the lane, took over late and raced clear under the wire. LASHER rated a short early lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled
briefly at even terms, kept the edge from the three eighths pole, bore out toward the head of the lane, though, came back in a later duel for second. TYRY
TYRANNOSAURUS raced off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and took
a brief lead into the lane, was steadily encouraged from that point but gave up the lead while flattening stride late. LEG UP stalked off the rail the first turn,
challenged into the backstretch and raced close on the far turn, but was forced out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride later yards. SALTY J J
rounded the first turn about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn, though flattened inside the sixteenth
pole. MEGALODON'SREVENGE rounded the first turn about the four path then stalked from the half mile pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths,
rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. ON A WHIM rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole
then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

rail on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and just missed in a strong finish. EVANESCO pressured the pace to the head of the lane, but dropped

outside. FIGAROS FORTUNE chased, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened stride. ABENDEGO gave chase toward the inside, eased outward
approaching the head of the lane and left the turn about the four path, but showed little more. BERTRAM FLIGHT gave chase, rounded the turn about the

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased to the four path into the stretch and
dug in to get up under the wire. TALKTHETALK rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two
deep midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, was nipped under the wire and just lasted for second. TORCH CARRIER became
fractious in the gate and dropped well back to save early ground, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the six path of the
far turn, finished well to take third late and was gaining on the top two. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY tapered in to race with the early pace, took the nod past the
half mile pole and dueled from that point, drew clear toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn but remained a factor to
the finish. MORTAL STORM angled to the four path into the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five
path and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. SO RED THE ROSE settled in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole but faded on the far turn. FUDGE CAKE became edgy in the gate and never factored. LADY KAZA set the early pace inside, was headed past
the half mile pole and dueled from that point, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the far turn.

DRINKWITHTHESTARS gave chase and took the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear of IN HIGH GEAR past the quarter pole, moved to
the rail on the turn and was kept alert in the lane, while the latter set the early pace inside, was met at the five sixteenths pole and steadied at the rail past
the pole, dropped back into the turn then held on for second. ONE NIGHT MIKE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled through the
stretch for third and was gaining on the runner-up. JUBA BOUND chased toward the inside, raced two deep on the turn and ran evenly in the lane.
MANHATTAN WEAVE veered out leaving the gate and raced briefly close, but faded past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the four path and
weakened. WHATAPUNCH broke a step slow and saved ground. ANGELA'S ROMEO had a brief lead then dropped back. CHANGE YOUR LUCK gave
chase inside then faded at the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Drinkwiththestars for alleged
interference through the turn, lodged by the rider of In High Gear.

Footnotes
SHENANDOAH CAT rated a clear pace inside, raced near the rail on the turn and was steadily handled through the lane. SAYYESTOTHELADY gave
chase, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well at the outside flank of the winner. CHURCH KEY chased, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly to
late stretch before flattening stride. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved early ground, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, eased
out leaving the turn and finished well outside. SILVER RULES gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. TUESDAY TOO
gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. IT'S A REAL HONOR was not a factor. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the six path. SIENTE LA BRISA dropped well back early on.
