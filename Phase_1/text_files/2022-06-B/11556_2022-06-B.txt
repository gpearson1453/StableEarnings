Footnotes
LIL RICHARDS BELLO broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, got crowded in the chute, moved into range between rivals then steered to the inside for
the turn, waited for room behind the leaders while moving to the two path around the bend, rallied four wide in the stretch and got up late. QUEEN'S CODE
vied three deep into and around the turn, carried a short lead into the final furlong, resisted into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly in the end. DONNER
LAKE bumped at the start, raced in range two then three wide, steered out in the lane and closed well to earn the show honors. OFFLEE ICY vied between
rivals for command into and around the turn, fought from inside through the lane, got outkicked by the top trio but stayed on well to the wire. DARK
MARCUS took a bumped from outside leaving the gate, steadied crossing the dirt, was hard to ride to the stretch while off the rail, angled out in the lane
while still giving the rider some trouble and kept on to improve position. FORE FLAG broke in and bumped rival at the start, coaxed early and moved closer
between rivals on the backstretch, went three to four wide into the lane, stayed between in the drive but failed to threaten. GRAZED got bumped leaving the
gate, shuffled between rivals early, tugged to a forward position outside rivals, went four to five wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. GO LAKER GO vied
for command four deep to the stretch and weakened late. HOT LEGS ROMOLO raced up close inside the top trio then challenged for command, battled
around the turn and into the stretch, fought to midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. GRAZEN IN THE PARK took an awkward step crossing back
onto the turf, dropped back and steered inward, angled out into the stretch and could not rally. NAUGHTY NIKO checked off heels at the nine-sixteenths
pole, shifted ground and steadied entering the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace. DOYOUSTILLLOVEME tracked well off the rail
early, went four wide around the turn, entered the lane five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
EVER SMART pressed the pace from outside, took over nearing the quarter pole, cleared exiting the turn and held well in the closing moments.
BARRISTER'S RIDE sat off the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, finished well and kept gaining on the winner to the
wire. DRAMATIZER stalked the top pair from inside, tipped two wide around the far turn, moved back to the rail in the lane and finished willingly for the
show. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE steered to the inside at the back, went two wide through the far turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch, then summoned a
mild rally to round out the superfecta. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) stalked the leaders from off the rail, entered the lane three wide and never responded
when called upon. KUORA (PER) settled in the two path early, came three wide into the lane, tipped out further in the stretch and could not rally. ROSE'S
CRYSTAL raced in the two path near the back, rounded the far turn three then four wide and never made an impact. RESPECT MY CANDOR pulled to the
front from inside, set the pace in hand while under pressure up the backstretch, lost command nearing the quarter pole and weakened.

WHOBETERTHANTIGER broke a step slow, sent between to take control then cleared leaving the backstretch, met bids from a pair of challengers around
the bend, drifted out and brushed leaving the turn, carried a short lead into the final furlong and drew clear under a drive. STAY IN THE GAME stalked
outside rivals early, bid three deep on the turn, got brushed from inside leaving the bend, continued to fight three deep in the lane, could not match the
winner late but held the place. HACKING IT UP off alertly in the beginning, chased the leader two wide into the turn, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths
pole then vied between, got pushed out by the winner and brushed with STAY IN THE GAME leaving the turn, battled to the sixteenth pole and faltered late.
THEUNTOUCHABLEONE hustled from the gate, chased along the rail through the turn and lacked a late bid. MISS LUCILLA tracked from inside then
moved into the two path entering the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out and finished evenly in the final furlong. KRIXUS FLASH broke a step
slow to begin, chased four wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) brushed with inner rival at the start then sped to the front and moved to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch and remained clear
under strong handling. SCARABEA stalked three wide into the stretch for the first time then moved to the two path, traveled between rivals up the
backstretch, got put in tight entering the far turn, continued to give chase through the lane between foes and got up for second. FREEDOM LASS rated
along the inside, coaxed along while cutting the corner into the stretch, finished willingly next to the rail but got edged for the place honors. KEYFLOWER
(FR) tracked four wide into the stretch for the first time then moved down to the two path, chased four then three deep on the far turn, urged right-handed
through the final furlong within striking distance but lacked the needed late punch. NATURAL COLOUR (GB) brushed with the winner leaving the gate,
crowded between foes and checked shortly after then became rank, settled along the inside then moved out and came three wide into the stretch, then
flattened in the late stages. SCHERZO (GB) bumped with rival then became rank, continued to fight the rider first time through the stretch, trailed on the
inside to the stretch, moved out in the lane and was not a factor. AGREETODISAGREE bumped with inner rival and checked shortly after the start,
forwardly placed from outside early then stalked three deep, lost ground three wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ELENIAK broke a step slow, went up to take control from inside, led clear into the stretch and powered away in the final furlong. BESAME MUCHO broke
well then chased the pacesetter two wide into the turn, closest in pursuit entering the stretch, became rank in upper stretch while watching the leader kick
away and stayed on to prove second best. WESTPHAL chased widest up the backstretch, rounded the bend four wide, bumped with ARREST at the top of
the stretch and edged that rival for the show. ARREST brushed the gate in the beginning, tracked off the rail then three wide into the turn, continued three
wide to the stretch, bumped with WESTPHAL at the three-sixteenths pole and got outkicked by that rival for third. DIVINELY DIVERSE stumbled leaving the
gate, stalked behind the leader on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and weakened under left-handed urging. THE BOSS HARTY was off slow to
begin, traveled off the pace then angled in on the turn and made no impact. AWKWARD MORNING stumbled leaving the gate, dropped back early, angled
five wide around the turn and failed to menace. ADRIATIC bumped at the start, chased between and got put in a bit tight past the half-mile pole, went three
then four wide around the turn and weakened. SILENT DECLARATION bumped leaving the gate, raced in range early, dropped back two wide on the turn
and tired.

BREAKPOINT (CHI) sped clear from inside early to take control , gained company on the backstretch and dueled past the half-mile pole, battled through the
final turn, put away MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) with a furlong left to run, resisted in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. RED KING stalked off the rail, moved
closer up the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane, bumped with AVENUE at the top of the stretch then got boxed in between foes and behind
MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) in upper stretch, gained a clear path and went between rivals, tipped out and bumped with AVENUE again in the final sixteenth,
bid three deep late and missed. AVENUE settled off the rail, moved into range in tandem with RED KING on the backstretch, chased three wide into the
stretch, bumped with RED KING at the top of the stretch, closed into the final sixteenth but drifted in and bumped RED KING again and finished a game
third. DEAN MARTINI tracked along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, put in a bid along the fence but lacked the needed late punch. KAZAN (IRE)
unhurried off the rail then moved inward, came three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and flattened in the late stages. MODUS OPERANDI (IRE)
stalked off the rail, applied pressure on the backstretch then moved up to duel for command battled around the final turn and into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. MUHAMMAD ALI (PER) pulled early racing down the hill, settled on the inside, coaxed along up the backstretch, saved ground to the
stretch and had little left for the drive. RIJEKA (IRE) sat off the pace outside a rival, trailed on the backstretch, pulled up on the final turn and walked off.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF AVENUE AGAINST RED KING FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS CONTACT AT TWO POINTS IN
THE STRETCH BETWEEN THE RUNNERS, THEY FOUND AVENUE TO BE AT FAULT AND THERE WOULD NO CHANGE. FIRST QUARTER WAS
RUN IN 23.61.

Footnotes
STANDING O settled on the inside, lacked room behind rival midway around the turn, tipped out a bit on the bend then angled out in the stretch, surged late
and got up in time. TIME TO PARTY away quickly in the beginning then ceded control to FAST BUCK, went up to duel from outside around the turn, battled
into the stretch, took a short lead over FAST BUCK in the lane and got run down by the winner late. FAST BUCK bumped leaving the gate, sent early and
went up to take control then cleared, dueled with TIME TO PARY around the bend, lost command in the stretch but fought back through the lane and went
gamely to the line. CEES GET DEGREES stumbled leaving the gate, moved up to a forward position and chased along the inside through the turn, finished
willingly down the lane, but needed more late. GOLIAD raced in range four deep leaving the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch and finished
evenly late. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) bumped at the start, sat off the pace, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, got floated out a bit in the
lane and needed more late. VICENTE'S SHADOW was off slow to begin, dropped back then steered to the inside to save ground and failed to menace.
RAGING WATERS dropped his head and got bumped leaving the gate, raced off the rail and made no impact. TRAINER PLEASE bumped rival leaving the
gate, chased outside a rival then three deep into the turn, bumped with COASTAL KID into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
COASTAL KID pulled between rivals early then bumped with TRAINER PLEASE into the turn, went two to three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
ADARE was off slow from inside, angled four wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PATRON D'ORO was closest in pursuit of the lone leader, gained ground from off the rail through the bend, took over and kicked clear in upper stretch, then
held over the runner-up in the closing moments. HERO STATUS settled off the rail, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane, rallied but
was too late. PRAY FOR ME RAY was off slow to begin, raced three then two wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally for
third. FAMOUS STAR away quickly to take control opened up a large lead early, held a rapidly diminishing lead into the stretch, overtaken in upper stretch
and weakened. CLUTCH HITTER broke slow, raced erratically from the kick-back early, saved ground while passing rivals on the turn and kept on through
the lane but was unable to pass FAMOUS STAR for a minor award. NAISMITH raced in mid-pack early, traveled two then three wide around the turn and
made no impact. MEMES was also in mid-pack early, went four wide into the turn, tipped five wide around the bend, remained wide into the stretch and
could not rally. CHAOS REIGNS raced near the back early, took the turn four then five wide and was never a factor. MULTI PLATINUM came in leaving the
gate, shifted ground early, chased from inside and faded. ONE TIME MARK sat off the pace near mid-pack, dropped back off the rail on the turn and had
little left for the drive.

Footnotes
AFTER MIDNIGHT away quickly then stalked RESPECTFULLY from outside, launched a bid crossing the dirt, took over into the lane, cleared in upper
stretch and held well. KLEEN KARMA was off slow to begin, took a bumped from outside early, chased on the inside, tipped out into the stretch, steered
back to the inside and finished willingly to prove second best. ALMOST A FACTOR brushed leaving the gate, trailed two wide to the stretch, angled out in
the lane and rallied for the show. SCENIC MASTERPIECE got brushed on the outside at the start, put in tight and shuffled back and bumped with rival,
steadied into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and got outkicked for third. DEL MAR DRAMA stalked in the two path, drifted
out crossing over the dirt and lacked a late bid. LALIC (FR) pulled early, ground to the stretch, had her path taken and steadied in upper stretch, tipped out
to a clear path and was ridden out to the wire. KRISTI'S TIGER chased five deep into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and could not rally.
RESPECTFULLY sped to the front and cleared early, challenged crossing the dirt, lost command into the stretch, floated in upper stretch and gave way.
CHLOE'S CROWN sat off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to menace. FEATHERS (IRE) tracked three wide into the turn, exited
the bend six wide and weakened.

Footnotes
HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) stalked on the inside, waited for room with a quarter mile left to run, tipped out at the top of the lane, took over quickly and
drove clear. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) broke a step slow and was crowded at the start, settled three wide early, gained three then four wide on the far turn,
drifted inward in the lane and finished gamely for second. TARANTINO came in early, went up to press the pace from outside, dueled for command on the
far turn and took over past the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the show. TRIPOLI forwardly placed early but got put in
tight entering the first turn, tracked in the two path, lacked room on the far turn, gained a clear path in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award.
RESTRAINEDVENGENCE got forced in and checked between rivals early, became rank shortly after, settled on the inside, became a bit rank again on the
far turn and could not rally in the late stages. MAJESTIC EAGLE stumbled leaving the gate, raced in range early in the three path, spun three wide into the
stretch and faltered. ECRIVAIN (FR) forced to check along the rail early, trailed from inside then tipped out into the stretch and failed to menace. GREGDAR
was forced in, bumped and checked hard between early, raced near the back outside a rival into the far turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch
and could not make any late impact. VANZZY forced in and bumped early, settled on the inside, angled out and came four wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. KENTUCKY PHAROAH sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, set the pace under pressure from TARANTINO, dueled with that rival around
the far turn, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole and gave way in the lane.
