SIDE STREET DAVE was urged clear while angling to the inside setting the pace on a comfortable margin into the turn, held sway into the stretch and was
kept to firm encouragement. FREIBURG broke readily, was urged to a forward placing pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, then continued with a steady
bid into the stretch while proving only second best. EL CENTENARIO tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight through the backstretch into the turn
and continued with interest to gain some position along the inside late. DAYS OF GLORY tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the turn
and faded into upper stretch. YESTERYEAR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and emptied out in the drive. GLASS
EATER dropped out early.

CENTRAL PARK vied for command between foes through the backstretch, then inside a rival on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement. TIGER DAD, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset three wide between foes on the backstretch, dueled for command
outside the winner forcing the issue to upper stretch but proved only second best. TONY'S TAPIT ducked out at the start crossing into the path of
NORTHCUT, was urged along four wide prompting the leaders into the turn and continued evenly in late stages to prevail for a share. R MERCEDES BOY
was urged pressing the pace inside foe a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, then faded racing into the turn. UNLEASH THE BEAST tracked off
the first flight along the inside under light rating, switched out five wide on the turn, then continued in that path into the stretch but offered no rally.
NORTHCUT, carried out a bit at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RAY'S ANGEL was urged clear racing a bit off the inside in the opening stages, angled inside entering the turn setting the pace on a clear margin, then held
sway through the stretch to prove best under firm encouragement. HOLY VOW tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight in the opening stages,
continued between foes into the turn, was fanned four wide in some traffic racing through the stretch but found his best stride late to edge a rival for the
place honors. P CLUB tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, tipped outside that foe entering the turn while being prompted
to advance, drifted out a bit racing through the stretch and weakened late. PALACE PRINCE angled inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second
flight racing into the turn, shifted out to advance three wide between foes entering the lane while racing in close quarters but had no final kick. BOURBON
TAN threw his head early while being rated off the second flight, switched outside rivals racing into the turn, but had no closing bid. JILOTEPEC was soon
outpaced.

SHAQ'S MY DADDY broke readily to force the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, continued to dispute the issue in a protracted skirmish into the
far turn, drifted out racing through the stretch while continuing with a grudging effort and prevailed while shifting to the four path nearing the wire. HUNTER
JUMPER was urged along the rail into the first turn disputing the pace inside the eventual winner, pressed the issue through the backstretch into the far turn,
tipped out entering the stretch while continuing with a sustained bid between foes but proved only second best. PIRATE BIRD was settled well off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, responded when prompted to advance between foes on the far turn, was urged to challenge inside the top pair
racing into the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. OPTION, forwardly placed three deep racing to the first turn, eased off the leaders to track those foes
outside a rival into the backstretch, then to the far turn and faded three deep racing into upper stretch. SLIM CHANCE settled along the inside in the last
flight in the opening half and failed to seriously menace. FLY WITH CLASS tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn
and faded into upper stretch. SCREAMIN JALAPENO was shuffled back avoiding close quarters at the start and never gained contention.

Footnotes
SILVER DASH, caught in tight quarters momentarily at the start, was rated inside foes in early stages, advanced to contention along the rail racing into the
turn, tipped off the inside to split foes nearing upper stretch challenging for command, quickly wrested the advantage, then shook clear while angling back to
the inside and widened under pressure. BIG MERRILL was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside entering the
turn gaining position, tipped out nearing upper stretch following the winner's path into the stretch and proved best of the others. COURAGEOUS TIMMY,
reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, split foes racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to gain position three deep between foes
to the end while earning a share. HIGHTAIL COWBOY tracked off the first flight from just out of striking distance in the three path racing to the turn, altered
inwards nearing upper stretch avoiding a stricken rival but offered no closing bid. BRASKA was a bit outpaced in early stages while angling to the inside,
saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but had no closing bid. DAREABIGDREAM broke outwards at the start into the path of the eventual
winner, was hustled to the lead along the inside through the backstretch, set the pace through the bend but gave way abruptly once headed by the winner.
YOU'LL BE LUCKY was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide leaving the turn, jumped a fallen rival approaching the
three sixteenths marker and was taken in hand racing through late stages. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight racing to the
turn, was caught four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, fell over MALINTENT nearing the three sixteenths marker dislodging his
rider, but was collected after the race and walked off the course. MALINTENT was urged along prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch
into the turn, tipped to the three path nearing upper stretch, suffered an apparent catastrophic injury approaching the three sixteenths marker while falling to
the track and was vanned off the course following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WAR MUSIC, caught four wide in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced in that path racing
into the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, struck the front nearing the furlong marker and edged forward late under firm
encouragement. FORTUNATA urged to terms prompting the pacesetter racing to the first turn, pressed the issue outside that foe to gain the advantage on
the backstretch, dueled for command inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no match late while narrowly prevailing for the place honors.
CERULEAN broke inwards brushing a rival, stalked just off the first flight inside rivals under rating racing to the backstretch, tipped off the inside to advance
between foes on the far turn while briefly awaiting an opening, shifted to the four path racing through the stretch and continued willingly while failing to gain
even terms with the top pair. PRINCESS OF MALIBU, brushed at the start, was reserved in last along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground on the far
turn, was held up when lacking a path nearing upper stretch, then shifted out five wide through the closing stages to make some belated progress. WINTER
MUSIC was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
shifted out, then inwards racing into upper stretch to race between rivals but lacked the needed closing response. BONES AND ROSES tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight in the opening half, was eased back out of close quarters nearing the far turn, switched outside foes on the second bend, then
was fanned six wide in the stretch while failing to mount a rally. RATTLEME sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dueled for
command into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.
