Footnotes
MESABI was prompted to the lead under pressure rival drew even and matched strides with that one and won the head nod. TRAFFIC CONTROL pressed
the pace from the inside drew even with the leader while matching strides to the wire but lost the head nod. SAINT PIO trailed the field early then made a
three wide bid on the turn but raced evenly late. GOLD PRIZE raced in the middle of the pace from the two path moved between horses on the backstretch
and around the turn and weakened late in the drive. THEO D'OR raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then angled out in upper stretch but was
one pace in the drive. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO raced near the back and was never a factor. BILLHILL tracked the leaders from the inside made a mild rail bid
going into the turn and faded. HELAIRE was not a threat. UNCLE BRAD was reluctant to load then vied early from outside then retreated after a quarter.
