Footnotes
NANA'S GRAY prompted the pace outside of the leader, got floated to the five path entering the lane while sparking a duel, failed to reach the leader's
throatlatch through upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead inside the furlong pole while pursuing, ranged up entering the final sixteenth, took a bump
from her inner counterpart leaving that junction while sustaining the battle, and prevailed at the wire. RED QUEEN set the pace inside of the eventual
winner, drifted out to the four path while sparring with that foe entering the lane, gamely managed an advantage through upper stretch, inched away to a bit
of a further margin in midstretch, but was asked to lean outwardly by the rider entering the final sixteenth as her outer counterpart menaced again, bumped
that foe soon after causing her to flop back to her left lead, and was bested late. HASHTAG WINNER stalked the top pair two wide early on, chased them
under urging in the three path around the turn, then failed to progress through the lane and proved best of the rest. MOHAYLADY saved ground off of the
pace, but to no avail. LA TOURISTA hopped and brushed the outer part of the gate while spotting the field multiple lengths at the start, took the turn in the
three to four path while at the rear, and failed to factor. MURGATROYD stalked along the inside, but faded into the turn, was done early, and eased through
the lane.

Footnotes
OILER stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, and kicked clear leaving
the furlong grounds. RERALLY brushed the outer part of the gate at the start, recovered to set the pace, inched a clear margin into the turn, showed the way
before meeting OILER's bid entering the lane, fought on after being headed in upper stretch, but gave way passing the furlong pole. VERSATILE tracked
behind the pace setters two wide, lost position down the backstretch before pursuing from off of the pace in the two path around the bend, then chased
along the rail entering the lane to claim show from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole. LOCO pressed the pace two wide, failed to keep pace while
under urging into the turn, sustained the chase from between horses while getting outmoved by an inner foe turning for home, and gave way through the
lane. ANAHEIM tracked three wide and outside of foes, stalked around the turn, but was outmoved by an inner foe turning for home, and tired. MR GHOST
took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, and made little impact. BANDIMERE showed little.

Footnotes
DECLARE THE MOON took a mild nudge from an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside, chased the trio of leaders around the far turn before
tipping outside of them entering the lane, took aim on a clearing MIDNIGHT RAID in the final furlong, rallied with a good kick in the closing stages to
produce a late bid, and forged an advantage at the wire. MIDNIGHT RAID tracked three wide, pressed into the far turn, vied turning for home, led entering
the lane, drew clear inside the final furlong as an outer DECLARE THE MOON pursued, then met that foe's bid in the closing stages, and was nailed at the
wire. PORT ROYAL set the pace, sparred inside of a pair of vying rivals around the far turn, got headed by his outermost counterpart entering the lane,
fought on through upper stretch, but yielded approaching the final sixteenth. TWIRLING BLUES bobbled outwardly at the start, stalked the pace setter from
the outside, vied between horses around the far turn after an outer rival joined the fray, and gave way between those foes passing the quarter pole. BAD
DECISIONS bobbled at the start while breaking a step slowly, settled off of the pace along the inside, but was driven for run in the four path around the far
turn, and drifted out entering the lane while fading. BUCKEYE JIMMY took up when crowded in tight quarters between horses at the start, lagged well
behind the field, and showed little. BLUE BONZAI laid off off the pace in the four path, but was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
STELLAR TAP tracked along the inside, slipped inside of the pace setter to vie at the three furlong pole as an outer BUCKINGHAM PRINCE did the same,
sparred with that rival turning for home, gamely inched an advantage in upper stretch, and held tenaciously thereafter. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE stalked in
the three path, produced a bid for the lead three wide at the three furlong pole while an inner STELLAR TAP did the same, vied with that foe turning for
home, dueled gamely through the lane, but was denied in the spirited tussle. RED LABEL trailed in the two path around the turn, split foes two wide in upper
stretch to reach show at the three sixteenths pole, and maintained that position while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong. DOCTOR LOVE took
the turn in the four path while off of the pace, bid for show while being floated to the five path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that
position in upper stretch. FIREMAN DAN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BABY QUINN bobbled at the start while still breaking on top, sped
clear early on, shied inwardly yet inconsequentially leaving the chute, managed a clear margin while tugging in the bit in the two path, but weakened
between a pair of bidders passing the three furlong pole.
