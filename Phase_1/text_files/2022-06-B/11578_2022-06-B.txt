Footnotes
BROKEN JUSTICE tracked the pace while near the rail into the far turn, came off the inside while being guided into the three path, bid three wide in late
turn, lost a bid of ground when straightening, gained momentum approaching the sixteenth pole and edged up. MOTION TO ADJOURN pressed the pace
two wide through mid-turn, dropped to the inside into the lane while dueling with outside rival, inched up on that one inside the sixteenth pole, led late and
was caught. INDY BIZ pressed the pace three wide through the far turn, came into the lane two wide, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then could not
keep up late. ROOKWOOD was in the three of four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three or four path with aim on the
top ones then lacked a bid. WHITE SILVER SANDS set the pace along the inside through mid-turn then gave way before turning into the lane. VORTEX
RISING raced in the two or three path through the turn and never was a factor. BASSCOAT was never a factor while in the four path through the turn.
WHERE'S MOE never made an impact while in the two path. PABLO'S SUN was close up through the far turn then was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
AIN'T SHE A PISTOL chased the pace from the two path into the turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, quickly moved past the leader approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, extended the advantage into the lane then drew off while being kept to the task. SELENA SING chased the pacesetters from the three
path into the turn, moved to be closest to the winner in late turn, was steadied into the lane, dropped to the rail for the drive and was no match for the top
one while clear of the next. PROTOMAGIC was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and was never a serious threat. THIRTEEN STRIPES
stepped in at the start and brushed inside rival, settled well back into the turn, continued to trail into the lane while entering from the four path and never was
a factor. BLEST LIFE was brushed at the start, settled off the pace along the inside and never was a menace. DREAM MUSIC was away alertly to gain a
clear lead soon after the start, was put under pressure before mid-turn then gave way once headed.

Footnotes
WICKED INTENT was unhurried while near the inside, came off the rail after mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path with momentum, gained the
lead soon after the eighth pole then cleared while drifting from the three to the six path to the wire. AUNT RUTH stalked the pacesetters while in the three
path, bid three wide in late turn and into the lane, edged to the front outside the eighth pole, briefly cleared then was no match for the winner while staying
on for the place spot. MOSE DEFINITELY was dueling for the lead into the first turn when getting out into the three path and bumping rival, vied with that
one into the far turn, was joined by the runner-up into the lane then could not keep up while just lasting for the show spot. MISS SUSIE R was unhurried
while in the three to four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the six path, looked to be a serious threat with an eighth to go but could not
sustain the bid while just missing the show spot. MORNING ANGEL was in the three path through the far turn,came into the lane from the five path and
lacked a closing kick. MEDWAY QUEEN was forced into the four path and bumped when dueling for the lead into the first turn, continued to vie for the top
spot through the far turn then was empty through the lane. TREMILA was never a factor while saving ground through the turns. TIZ SO FINE was done into
the far turn while in the three path.

Footnotes
GRAY ATTEMPT raced in the two or three path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path then found good momentum
inside the eighth pole and was up in time. CITY DRIFTER raced along the inside through the turn, tipped into the three path entering the lane, caught the
leaders inside the eighth pole, led late then was caught near the wire in a good effort. AMERICAN MANDATE vied for or pressed the leader through the turn
and into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go, was joined by the runner-up soon after then could not stay with that one late. BOA NOVA (IRE)
was in the two to the four path through the turn, straightened in the lane from the six path and offered a belated gain. PURE PANIC chased the pace from
the three to the two path and weakened inside the eighth pole. ROLIN WITH OLIN set the pace while under pressure through the turn and into the lane, was
still a contender inside the eighth pole then gave way just outside the sixteenth pole. WAR ACT was never a threat while saving ground into the lane. ALL
THE DIAMONDS was outrun while in the three to the two path through the turn. STAR OF KODIAK never made an impact while in the four path through the
turn. KITTENS ADAIR raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and lost ground. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS was pulled up before the first call
and vanned off.
