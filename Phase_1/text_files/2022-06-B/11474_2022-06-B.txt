Footnotes
A MAIZE ZING DOTIE stalked the pacesetter, took command through the turn, quickly opened up turning for home and held on comfortably. LA
PRINCESSA POLLY allowed to settle at the back early, then made a three wide move splitting horses on the turn but could not close enough to threaten the
winner. MY BABY JANE chased on the rail, was hustled while inside on the turn, angled out for clear run and finished with interest to capture third.
WALTZOFTHESAMURAI showed early speed, was headed mid turn and offered little response through the lane. CLOUD RUNNER stalked down the
backstretch, moved up early in the turn while outside horses and quickly retreated. FIERA trailed throughout and was never a factor.

BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND stalked the pace throughout, took command at the eighth pole and had enough in reserve to hold off the late closer. ROAD MAP
chased inside early, lost ground entering the turn, angled out in the stretch and was closing well in the late stages. MIA'S AUTHORITY was away sharply,
rated on the the turn, then headed at the eighth pole and ran gamely inside to be a clear third. DEVIL IN HER HEART was stalking while outside, widest
through the lane and levelled out. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS stalked between horses early, chased leader on the turn and faded on the rail. NICOLE'S

SWOOP TO FINISH stalked the early speed throughout, took command at the quarter pole, opened up entering the stretch and held safe. BUTTERED
TOAST saved ground going into the first turn and backstretch, angled out on the final turn and closed well in the stretch to be a clear second. GREY
SOCIETY rated mid pack in the first turn, advanced through the backstretch then loomed up to the leader turning for home but weakened the final sixteenth.
INTRO was rated at the back early on, asked outside of horses on the final turn and showed some late interest. GIO MARIA saved ground behind the
leaders early, asked on the final turn and passed tiring foes. MYSTICAL JOURNEY showed good early speed ,was headed at the quarter pole and offered
little in the stretch drive. GAV'S DREAM GIRL stalked between horses, was roused on the final turn but had nothing for the drive. RETAIL THERAPIST was
four wide throughout, moved up on the final turn, appeared to take a misstep entering the stretch and faded to last.

Footnotes
ENCHANT ME was at the back alongside a rival on the first turn, circled up three to four wide into contention on the far turn and bid for the front in upper
stretch, wore down the leader at the sixteenth pole and inched away late. CITY LEGEND stalked and pressed the leader the entire trip and took over at the
quarter pole, but could not hold the winner in the final sixteenth, grudgingly giving way. TARANTO TITAN sat in midpack on the first turn, moved up to track
the leaders along the rail on the backside, dropped back on the far turn but did manage to re-rally for the show spot in deep stretch. SPANISH PRINCE set
the pace while stalked and pressed by the eventual place finisher, lost the front to that rival at the quarter pole and retreated in the lane. FIFTY THREE
trailed inside the winner around the first turn, rallied mildly outside on the far turn but could only pass one tiring rival late. ZAKHARI broke inward at the start
and recovered to track the two pacesetters, was roused outside a rival on the far turn but came up empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BROWNING ISLAND was well rated on the lead inside of horses, headed turning for home while on the rail, repelled the outside challengers and drew away
the final eighth. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS waited inside behind the leader on the turn, then angled out to bid for the lead entering the stretch, was repelled by
the winner at the eighth pole but held game to keep second. SUPER BREW was slow in stride after the start, saved ground throughout and finished with
interest up the rail to capture third late. BULLET SPEED tracked the leaders outside, loomed up to contend turning for home but could not offer a serious
rally in the late stages. GUNZIG STINGER chased the leader early on, was between horses contending for the lead turning for home but could not keep up
and faded the final eighth. TARA TATTOO trailed down the backstretch, was roused at the three eighths pole and never contended.

Footnotes
A. A. SWEET CHILLI showed good speed early, was well rationed on the front end, repelled a brief challenge turning for home and was kept to the task late.
GREEN GABLES waited inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed well outside to secure the place. HEKLA'S AURA chased the leader on the
turn, made a mild bid entering the stretch, and gave way grudgingly down the lane. INFINITE PASSION was mid pack in the early stages, rallied outside
between horses entering the stretch, encountered some bumping while between runners but still ran on to get a small share. CEDAR VALLEY rated mid
pack and angled outside for run entering the stretch ,drifted outwards slightly turning for home and evened out in the final stages. MY GIRL HOOTER
hopped at the break, roused on the turn while widest ,was pushed further out through the lane and levelled out the final eighth. REINS OF PURPLE broke
poorly, trailed, and passed a tiring foe down the lane. SILENTANDDISCREET was in tight entering the turn, got shuffled back, was roused but had nothing
to offer and faded through the field.
