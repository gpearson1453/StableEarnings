HIGH VELOCITY moved clear inside, repelled a challenge near the quarter pole and edged away while kept to his business. SPEAK UNITY pursued the
winner, bid on the final turn and continued gamely for the place. MR. DODA trailed early, angled out on the turn then swung wide in the stretch rallying.
MIDLANER chased inside, moved closer into the stretch then flattened out. DALTON lacked speed, moved extremely wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. HIM SHE KISSES raced in the two path, made a brief bid on the turn then faltered. I'M BLAMING YOU lacked speed along the inside then
weakened steadily. PER RULING #2222BPP FROM THE PENNSYLVANNIA HORSE RACING COMMISION DALTON WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

COACH HAS SIX ACES broke slowly, advanced three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole then edged away driving. SMARTY PANTS SANDY lacked
speed, bid between rivals on the turn and closed well while no threat. SUPER DUPER FLY chased along the inside then came up empty in the stretch.
JUST ADD MOONLIGHT dueled along the inside and stopped after half a mile. NARYUA W forced the pace outside, began fading on the turn, took a bad
step near the 5/16 pole and continued her retreat.

J D'S VISTA broke slowest, rushed to contention, took over midway on the turn then steadily increased her advantage under mild drive. TITANIC ROSE
dropped far behind then rallied along the inside and got up for the place late. FRAME THIS lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch narrowing the gap while
no threat. WHATRUWAITINGFOR opened a long lead in the initial quarter, was collared midway on the turn and weakened. CLOUD SKIPPING raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter inside then faltered. POOR NO MORE angled outside early, moved very wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FAST BOB outrun for half a mile, angled wide in the stretch then surged and was up in the final yards. FOR THE DREAMERS dueled briefly inside, took
over on the turn, maintained a long lead but tired in the final furlong and was nailed. DIVINE MIRACLE chased off the leaders outside, moved four wide on
the turn and offered only a mild rally. SCREEN SAVER saved ground throughout, made a brief bid into the stretch and flattened out. CELTIC HEART trailed
for half a mile, bid inside on the turn then showed some late energy. THE JONES BOY lacked speed racing wide and was never a factor. RUFFY chased
the leaders in the three path and was finished after half a mile. CHROME DIXIE flashed speed outside down the backstretch and stopped.

TOO BOSS alternated for the lead outside, drew clear on the final turn then pulled away through the final furlong. YOU MUST CHILL stalked the dueling
leaders outside, loomed a stretch threat but proved no match. IRISH CORK vied inside the winner for five furlongs and faltered. BIRD KING underwent a
shoe repair in the paddock, lacked speed and raced wide. BROAD STREET BULLY dropped far behind and was never in contention. WAIT FOR IT moved
closer inside after half a mile then had no further response. BORRACHO vied three wide for nearly half a mile and stopped.
