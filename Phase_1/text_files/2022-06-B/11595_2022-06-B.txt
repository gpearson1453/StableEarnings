GENERAL WINSTON set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch and held under steady pressure. SPIRITED SOL tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals, then lacked the needed late kick. BENEDICTUS well placed and outside, held position three wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened out. LIGHTNING CHARLIE stalked the pace from between, held position on the two path
through the turn, bid, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. SWEET AMY well placed, faded through the turn. SUNSET CHASER broke slowly
and was outrun.

while clearly best of the rest. KEYSTONE HANK hopped at the start, held position two and three wide through the turn, then evened out in the lane.
DOWNTOTHEHONKYTONK well placed, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then could not gain and held a share.

POLLOCK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear from rivals through the second turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
LAUDERDALE well placed in the early going, moved up to stalk the pace down the backstretch, then could not match strides with that one, stayed on and
held the place safe. SHAKEDOWN unhurried in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
weakened, holding the show. GO HIPPO GO allowed to settle, gained position into the second turn, raced boxed and waited through the turn, came through
when clear and evened out. HOUSE LIGHTS rated close up, faded after three quarters. MAMBOCELLO hopped at the start, was no factor.

I BELONG TO BECKY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. ANOTHER SOFTBALL
mid pack, looped to position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened out and gained the place. SAVE THE DRAMA well placed,
moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. LEAVEITALONELARRY mid pack, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SCOBY vied for the early lead on the outside, lost some ground through the turn,
then faded in the lane. ARAZI LIKE MOVE was no factor.

Footnotes
SUMMER PALACE unhurried in the early going, moved to position three and four wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged ahead late. BOURBON BROWN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the late going
and was outfinished. FLIGHT TO PARADISE allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and
weakened late. BIG FRANK rated back in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid, lost his path into the stretch, angled out and
evened out. MARK THE MOOSE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and faded the final furlong. BRYTON'S D J well
placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, then faded in the stretch. GOLDEN OAK well placed and between, held
position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
SIDE TRACKED well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader gaining the lead into the
stretch, shook clear quickly, then drew off and was kept to the task. CASTLE KING well placed, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that
path into the lane and closed well for the place. KICK IT CHARLIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then weakened late and held the show. BEACH PASS ran evenly. TRAFFIC THIEF unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally. VERY REPLACEABLE was no factor.
