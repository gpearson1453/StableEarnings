MY BOBBY MCGEE tracked the leader up the backstretch, vied with STORM THE FIELD at the quarter pole, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and
cleared the lead, pulled away from the field under a mild drive then finished in hand. TEQUILA stalked the top pair into the turn, launched a two wide bid in
upper stretch and finished second best. STORM THE FIELD sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, vied with eventual winner at the quarter
pole then failed to match strides leaving the turn and weakened to show. FLAT OUT FREED raced off the early pace, edged closer three to four wide
around the turn then faded in the lane.

DIXIELAND CANDY was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole,
sustained response into to the lane, dug in three wide a furlong out and edged away deep stretch. JAVISTHA sped to the lead at the start and set the early
pace, held firm over challenger's around the far turn, stayed on gamely in the final furlong then got reeled in late. FANCY GI GI was unhurried and saved
ground around the far turn, roused forward into close contention along the rail in the final furlong and cleared the rest. UNHERDOF stalked in good position
up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, failed to sustain response into the lane and retreated. FIVE ROSES LUNA raced four wide
into the first turn, settled off the early pace and had no response when called upon. FLYTA had no response.

VISION OF ELIAS hustled along in steady pursuit into the turn, edged closer then lacked a clear path approaching the furlong marker, got in tight quarters,
steadied but fought on gamely, split foes and edged away. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR tracked the leader in early stages, challenged CLEARLY MAD for the
lead mid-way through the turn, dueled for command two to three wide into the final furlong and failed to contain the winner. CLEARLY MAD sped to the lead
at the start and showed the way into the turn, dueled inside of LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR into the lane, fought back into the final furlong then yielded late.
BRASSY FIRE raced in range along the outside through the turn, sustained a four wide bid into the lane and needed more for impact. ORDER OF THE DAY
saved ground around the turn and failed to rally. FEISTY BIRD raced two wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and failed to kick on. SNAP AWAY
raced off the early pace, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TROMPO raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and never
menaced.

FREER sped to the lead soon after the start, widened to a commanding margin around the turn, continued well clear into the lane and kept to task under
steady urging. CORRENTE DE OURO chased two to three wide around the turn, sustained response in the lane and finished clearly second best. MEET
GEORGE JETSON raced off the early pace, hustled up five wide into upper stretch and gained a share. OH LITTLE BRUTHA raced two wide in the mix
around the turn, urged two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. YOUNG O' DAINE was ridden up four wide late on the turn and failed to kick on in
the lane. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT chased along the inside around the turn and faded in the final furlong. OKLAHOMA TWISTER failed to move into
contention. HEART HEADED ARKY was the closest pursuer of the leader in early stages and came up empty nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MOLLIES ROCKET sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch, turned back
bids and kept clear. BASIC CHANCE tracked the pace along the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, launched a two to three wide bid for the winner and
cleared second best. MINECRAFT MANIAC raced off the early pace, chased four wide around the turn, swung wide into the lane and gained a share. TIME
GOES ON raced in contention two wide between rivals around the turn then ran on evenly in the final furlong. SECRET BLARNEY was forwardly placed in
the opening quarter then flattened around the turn, launched a two wide rebid in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. SIR WALLY WALLY raced outside
near midpack mid-way around the turn then flattened in the lane. SMART N INTUITIVE saved ground through early stages, cut the corner and advanced
into contention a furlong out then gave way. WOKE UP IN LOVE lacked early speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to rally.
TOPPER T chased three to four wide and had no late response. SHIP BOSS was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, sustained bid around the turn
then tired in the drive.
