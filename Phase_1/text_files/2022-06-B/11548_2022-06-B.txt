down the lane, but hung late. GET WITT GONE stalked the pace early from along the rail, made a bid in the stretch drive but it was not enough. SIR

the end. ZAPATA'S WAY chased the pace while five wide, rallied on the turn then continued to closed belatedly in the end. GOLDEN HAMMER chased the
pace while in the four path, then rallied mildly mid stretch but gave way in the end and missed show. SI QUERE was unhurried early then made a mild bid
while five wide in upper stretch but was no threat. SHERRYS BABY was unhurried early and failed to menace. L L COOL GREY pressed the pace while two

G'S TURN pressed the pace hard from the three path, then rallied down the lane, under strong urging and just got up for the win with a driving finish.
RANCHO BARGO took the early lead, racing along the rail, but gave way in late stretch, holding on to place. WITT'S TAQUITO stalked the pace, from three
wide, made a bid from the head of the stretch, but hung a bit late. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE chased pace, two wide, made a bid from mid stretch but it was
not enough. ELITCH had no early foot, racing three wide and lacked a late response. AMERICAN MADE was near the back early, made a bid around the
turn, from the four path and flattened out in the stretch. MR. UNUSUAL pressed the pace down the backstretch, two wide but was though early.

command down the lane, drawing off from the field and just held a fast closing foe off at the wire. STANS HOOKIN BULL was mid field early on, then angled
out at the head of the stretch, closing fast, but was outnodded at the wire. DUST EM chased the pace, from two wide, rallied between horses and got up for
show. BIG ONE stalked the pace, from three wide, then offered a bid in the turn and hung a bit mid stretch. EASTER SNAP was unhurried early, then come
up with a mild rally, from the four path. MEN OF KYLE made the lead at the six furlong pole, getting pressed hard on the outside, dueled through the turn
and gave way in the stretch drive. BUBBA BLING had no early foot, running three wide and failed to respond. JOHN DOUGH was mid field, on the inside,
and faded in the stretch drive. WHISKEY OVER ICE was mid pack, four wide and dropped back in the far turn.

Footnotes
COME TO THE PARTY made the lead out of the gate, drawing clear of the field early on, and just held on for the wire to wire win. IZATIZ chased the pace,
from the inside, then rallied down the lane, drifting slightly and got up for place. TWISTED BRADE was in contention early, racing two wide, then rallied
down the lane and got up for show. MUCH ALOHA bore in at the break in a tangle, getting knocked off his feet, then closed well up the rail but it was not
enough. WAVING BYE was near the front, racing four wide, made a bid in the turn and flattened out in the stretch. SATIN HEART got sandwiched at the
break, coming up in a tangle and bearing out hard, then straightened out and had a mild rally down the lane, six wide. GOLD MEMORIES bore out at the
break, bumping foes, then ran up to mid field, two wide and had an even effort. VOODOO MISTRESS was mid pack, early on, running six wide and failed to
fire. SING IT BESSIE had no early foot, racing in the three to four path and failed to respond. KAYLEE'S SHADOW stalked the pace, three wide and
dropped back in the stretch drive. LET FREEDOM BLING bore out at the break, bumping foes, then was mid pack, two wide and faded in the stretch.

taken mid stretch but held on for second. IMALUCKYCHARM pressed the pace early on, three wide, but hung a bit in late stretch and held on for show. IMA
