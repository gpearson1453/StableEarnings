Footnotes
LADY KIM slow early advanced out of the far turn splitting horses in mid stretch angling out while edging up near mid track. MAGNA G FORCE slow early
circled out to upper stretch bidding gamely late nine wide. FASHION FRAME set a pressured pace clinging to a narrow lead through the turn digging in from
the three path in upper stretch proving no match late for wide pressure. BLUEGRASS CANDY went evenly racing inside through the far turn angling out
seven wide in upper stretch putting in a mild late bid. AZLYNN'S DREAMER raced evenly moving between horses on the far turn saving ground into upper
stretch looming a threat before hanging late inside. BEND THE KNEE pressured the pace from the outset through the far turn extending from mid track in
upper stretch weakening while in a bit close late. CURT'S ANGEL lost ground to the backside moving to contention into the far turn leveling off in upper
stretch. SHESAROCKSTARTOO played no factor. MY WYNTER ECHO was always outrun. VIVE EL MOMENTO was checked hard along the rail on the far
turn.

moving to bid on the far turn weakening in upper stretch angling out to mid track. CENTRE STREET raced evenly throughout holding position while never

Footnotes
FEDERALE sent clear set the pace under pressure on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch being ridden out to the wire. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT pressed
early then chased to upper stretch proving no match for the winner rallying late to salvage place. MY PATRONUS pressured the pace dueling through the
turn ceding in upper stretch weakening the final eighth. JERSEY DIAMOND slow early lagged to upper stretch finishing evenly to improve there. I'M A
COOL MAN chased the pace through the turn weakening in upper stretch. DISTORTEDATTHEBAR was never involved. BLOWING STRONG gave way on
the turn.
