DAISY FIFTYSEVEN hustled from the start and trekked three wide through the opening bend while stalking the pace, gained command at head of final turn
and kicked clear in the homestretch for the score. SMOKING GUITAR finished with a good late kick and earned the place after settling into second flight and
giving chase from a three wide stance. RUBY BE JUDGED rushed form outset and set the pace as the inner most rival of three abreast through the opening
half, rated close up along the inside at upper stretch, but could not match strides with eventual winner in final sixteenth. LILLY BELLE was unhurried and
trailed the field through the opening half before passing a tiring foe in the late stages. GEORGIANO faded rapidly in the closing quarter after pressing the
pace from between rivals in the early going.

DAKAMO ROSE rushed from outset to gain first command, led the field around the turn while saving ground, then held off the late charge of rallying foe to
secure a gate to wire victory. LUCKILY stalked the pacesetter from a two path stance, was roused around the turn, closed the gap on leader at upper
stretch, and just missed the score. LADY ABIGAIL earned the show with late interest after travelling widest of all around the turn and trailing the field along
the backstretch. DIAMOND LEGACY settled behind the front runners along the backstretch, trekked the three path through the bend, and weakened in the
final furlong.

CANEY'S GHOST settled into the second flight while saving ground and secured the place by mildly gaining on leader at finish. REVEREND AJ retreated
rapidly in the crucial stages after rushing away from the start and leading the field early while saving ground. MORO CHARLIE lacked a needed rally after
settling into mid pack and trekking the three path throughout. HUNTER QUICK lacked a serious bid and trailed the field from outset.

HUNNY HUSH pressed the early pace from a two path pose, gained command along the backstretch, and kicked clear in final furlong. PEARLY settled into
second flight between rivals through the opening bend, closed the gap on the pacesetter along the backstretch, rated two wide at upper stretch and finished
a clear second. BILLIE G showed reserve early and trailed the field through the first turn, angled out three wide at upper stretch and rallied to earn the show.
RIVER LIBERTY settled into second flight as the outer rival of three abreast through the first call, was on even terms for the show at upper stretch, but
lacked a late rally in final sixteenth. MAGIC MINDY tucked to rail shortly after start, saved ground while tracking the pacesetter from the second flight, and
weakened in closing strides. SHERIFF FEMENINO flashed early foot and led the field into the first turn then stopped at head of backstretch. PER RULING
FROM THE OKLAHOMA RACING COMMISSION, HUNNY HUSH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SERENDIP RULER rushed form outset and led every step of the way for a gate to wire score. ST PATRICKS SWORD stalked the pacesetter along the
backstretch, angled out at upper stretch and earned the place with a strong late kick. SILVER SHADOW had to settle for show after pressing the pace from
an inside stance and lacking a response in final sixteenth. GOLDEN ZIP lacked serious bid while giving chase from the two path. UNCLE O. G. broke
alertly, gave chase from mid pack, saved ground through the turn then weakened in final furlong. BENT TO WIN failed to threaten from a back rated pose.
CITY PRINCE failed to menace and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOX SEAT proved best in the end by inching away in final furlong after looming boldly three wide in the early going and saving ground through the final
bend. ROCKPORT KAT was gaining on the leader and finished with best stride late to earn the place after giving chase mid pack as the widest of all rivals.
GUINESSEY hustled to share early command from between rivals and tracking the two path, rated close up entering the final bend, but was outfinished by
top pair in final furlong. A FLICKER OFSILVER improved placing with late interest after being unhurried in the opening half and trailing the field from a two
path position. SPANISH HOMBRE flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance before fading in the closing
strides. ELECTORAL tucked behind the front runners to save ground, maintained the inside line while giving chase and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MR L B J hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem while trekking the two path, gained slight advantage at head of stretch, dueled with rival in final
sixteenth and proved best in the end. PAID THE PORTER showed reserve early, travelled widest of all through the both turns and was gaining on leader at
finish. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE rushed form outset and established an inside stance, had the slightest of advantages through the opening half, was
challenged at upper stretch and then was outdueled in the final sixteenth. GOSPEL BUZZ lacked a needed rally after tucking to rail behind early
pacesetters. BEAR DEN lacked a closing bid after travelling three wide early and losing ground to leaders along the backstretch. ROGUE BOY came up
empty in final strides after giving chase from between rivals and angling wide at upper stretch.
