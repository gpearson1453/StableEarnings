Footnotes
GERDY'S BOY was on the pace three and four wide outside rivals, edged clear into the far turn then dug in through the lane and held safe to the wire.
PERVASIVE was on the early pace about the two path inside rivals, settled back a bit in the turn then rallied back late to close the gap. I C WELL stalked
the leaders four wide to bid through the far turn but could not go with the top pair in the lane. CARIOCA contested the early lead between foes and
weakened. LET IT RIP was not a factor racing outside.

Footnotes
DIAMANTE JOSE made the pace on a short lead about the two path then held well in the lane to keep TIZ BRIGHTER at bay. TIZ BRIGHTER prompted the
pace outside the winner throughout and could not get by that one in the drive. SMILIN JOSIE stalked the pace three to four wide and could not produce the
needed late run. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN saved ground and made a mild bid. JUST SEND HER was just off the leaders along the inside and had no
final rally. LUCKWOULDHAVEIT failed to mount a bid four wide.
