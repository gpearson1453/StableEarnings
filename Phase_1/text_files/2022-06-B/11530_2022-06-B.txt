TOO LEGIT stalked inside early, angled outside of horses in early stretch, then took the lead at the sixteenth pole to draw away late. HIGHLAND SOCIETY
broke out at the start, roused at the quarter pole splitting horses while four wide and rallied widest to capture place late. CORA was brushed at the break,
chased on the turn to get the lead at the quarter pole, was collared in deep stretch, just missing second. DR CHAPPELL made a mild outside rally on the
turn and ran even through the lane. TWICE AS SMART took command heading into the turn, opened up, was headed at the quarter pole and levelled out in
the stretch. SHISHKA was near the back and never threatened. HELMS BEAR showed early speed, lost the lead at the half mile pole and retreated while
inside through the turn. MURCIELAGO was never involved, trailing throughout.

ERASMO'S GIRL reserved inside, swung wide advancing into the stretch then eagerly moved clear while kept to her business. CARPE HORSESHOE
stalked the pacesetters three wide, bid near the quarter pole, loomed boldly but was outfinished. GORMLEY GIRL set a measured pace inside, was collared
at the quarter pole and weakened while holding on for show. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA settled three wide off the pace, swung extremely wide into the lane
with a mild rally. SUPER LEGGERA tugged her way closer into the far turn, rallied then flattened out in the stretch. REIGN BY REIN was well placed inside
the leaders then proved empty in the stretch. MUMBLEBEE prompted the pace outside, led briefly into the stretch then faded. ZAFEATHER dropped back
after the start and trailed throughout.

SIX FEET APART took command early on, was well rated on the turn and held on grudgingly to the wire. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) took a stalking position
just outside, while mid pack early, loomed up on the turn and rallied well through the stretch just missing out for the win. SPARKLE SAMMY chased the
leader throughout and was inching closer down the lane but could not get there late. MARAIS was in a good stalking position early while saving ground,
contended on the turn but evened out late on the rail. BODACIOUS MISS broke in at the start, was rated outside and finished with some interest through the
lane. SCATTER THE CLOUDS was allowed to settle along the rail and showed little throughout.

Footnotes
FOREST B led off the rail early then inside on the turn, shook loose in the stretch and lasted while shortening stride late. KERICS BEAUTY lacked speed,
advanced four wide on the turn then made a gradual late gain. VOLATA saved ground off the leaders, moved out in the stretch with a mild bid. SIMPLE
SOUVENIR trailed briefly on the turn, angled out and closed well too late. KHOZZY VALINTINE prompted the pace between rivals down the backstretch
and tired. ROSIE AMOR forced the pace three then two wide dueling through the turn and weakened in the stretch. GIANT ILLUSION raced off the pace
and was never in contention. GOLD FORESTER was urged close up inside forcing the pace then gave way on the turn. MOMMA CARRIE dropped back at
the start and moved very wide on the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
STORMY SILENCE was away alertly to contend for the lead, wore down his rival at the quarter pole, opened up in the early stretch and held on well.
SECRETS TOLD was stalking behind the dueling leaders early on, angled outside to pose a challenge turning for home but could not run down the winner.
SILVER BULLET LADY broke sharp on the rail, battled on the turn for the lead, gave way at the quarter pole but hung on the for third. DAWN PHAROAH
settled in mid pack through the backstretch and turn and offered a mild rally down the lane to just miss getting the show placing. QUALITY COLLECTION
was last in the early going, and angled out widest through the lane to finish with late interest. BESSIE was mid field while outside on the turn, went to the rail
in the stretch and finished evenly. SWEET BOMBOLINI was mid pack outside early and showed little through the stretch. I HAVE AN IDEA was at the back
and did not contend. LILLZ HOPE was near the rear throughout and never factored

SPEEDY RIVER broke alertly and took control early, moved clear on the turn and gradually widened under moderate pressure. I'M A BOURBON GIRL
steadied behind the winner into the far turn, angled out, pursued and was second best. SOUPER SUNDAY chased the pacesetters three wide and flattened
out in the stretch. CHROME'S ANGEL lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and failed to respond. CANADIANSWEETHEART saved ground off the pace
and weakened steadily. HELLUVA HOLIDAY broke very slowly, raced wide and was no factor. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY ducked in at the start, rushed inside
and faltered. FAST'N SEXY was placed in tight in the early stages then was always outrun. MORE GELATO was in tight between rivals early and raced far
back throughout.

GOLDSTORM GLORY chased the leader down the backstretch, took command at the five sixteenth pole and repelled an inside bid to inch away late.
FOREST VIXEN stalked throughout on the rail, slipped up on the inside entering the stretch to offer a challenge and ran gamely but could not overtake the
winner. HIGH TREASON was near the rear in the early stages, was asked while outside horses on the final turn and rallied well while widest through the
lane to get third. SUSPICIOUS MINDS waited mid pack early, then rallied up the rail through the stretch to just miss out on the show. FRAC TALES was
headstrong causing her to go five wide into the 1st turn, circled horses around the second turn to contend entering the stretch and levelled out the final
eighth. CLASSIC QUEEN near the back in the beginning, made a mild rail rally in the stretch to be steadied at the sixteenth pole and faded afterwards.
NADIABIZNIZ stalked leaders early, contended while turning for home and gave way the final eighth. VICTORIA ELIZABETH hit the gate on the break, was
slow into stride, asked through the second turn and faded in the stretch. VIOGNIER trailed and passed tiring foe final eighth. LAILA'S CHARM took the lead
early, was headed at the five sixteenth pole and stopped inside. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 CLASSIC QUEEN AGAINST #6 SUSPICIOUS MINDS AT
THE EIGHTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED.

ENDORPHIN RUSH reserved inside, slipped through at the top of the stretch then edged ahead outfinishing wide opponent. CHEEKY PINT settled outside,
swung very wide into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. CRUMLIN TIME alternated for the advantage inside then weakened slightly in the
stretch. PLUIE D'AVRIL joined the pacesetters three wide on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. CALL HER JOEY lacked speed, moved outside on
the turn and failed to rally. AMI'S LINK broke slowly, chased inside and was always outrun. ANITA GRIGIO earned a narrow lead outside, dueled to the
stretch and gave way.

VERDEJO was rated back off of horses early on, circled foes around the turn, took command at the eighth pole to draw away the final sixteenth.
AMERICAN GAMBLE set the pace, shrugged off the chasers on the turn but could not hold off the closing winner for the final eighth. DIXIE MORNING
made a rail run on the turn and into the stretch to determinedly get up for third. BASALT STREET was in between horses down the backside, reined in
entering the turn, rallied outside horses turning for home for a minor share. VEERY pressed the leader while outside four wide, made a bid entering the
stretch and levelled out in the final stages. FOURTEEN DAYS chased the leader while between foes and weakened through the stretch. SILENT GHOST
chased between horses on the backstretch, gave way on the turn offering little

ground close up, angled three wide into the stretch then faltered. QUIET REBEL set a pressured pace inside for three quarters and stopped. THE BAND
