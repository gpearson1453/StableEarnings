Footnotes
HEZA PICKLE broke back, continued to lack speed up the backstretch, made a good gain along the rail turn, roused in the two path entering the stretch,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. BRYKEN N MITCHELL broke on top, soon clear, continued to hold a comfortable advantage through the turn and
into the stretch, continued to lead by daylight late, caught final strides, remained far clear of the others. BIG TIME BANDIT chased the runner up off the
inside, weakened through the stretch, saved the show. JOHNNY JUDE back off the pace, lacked a closing kick. PURPLE ICICLE settled off the pace and
the inside, also lacked a closing response in the drive. K V TARGET a bit unruly just after the post parade, last to leave, finished early, trailed well back
through the stretch in showing little.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED MOON asked early to make the advantage from the inside, clear through the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through the stretch
while being kept to task. MARVELOUS RED broke alertly, briefly dueled with the winner soon after, chased that one into the turn, continued to pursue into
the stretch, fell back a bit past the furlong marker then was slowly getting back to that rival in the late going. FULL POWER broke back, lacked speed well
off the inside, remained four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally upper stretch to gain the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. FELLER off a step
slow, trailed for a half, came five wide into the lane, improved position while remaining well out in the strip. BALKY closest to the top two for three furlongs,
had little left for the stretch run. PAT ME DOWN remained back while racing three wide through the turn. LEYTON'S HIPPIE in mid pack early, began a
steady retreat before three furlongs.

extended to last for the place. GOTTATAKEHIMTO stumbled at the break, was righted but lacked any early speed, continued back the middle half mile,
came three wide for the drive, gaining for the place late, not a threat to the winner. FIFTYFIVE STRONG settled off the pace along the inside, continued to
save ground, had little for the stretch run. CYBER GUN raced in mid pack, also came up empty for the stretch run. SCHEMER off a step slow, trailed,
showed litttle.

Footnotes
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY sprinted out to a long early advantage, continued to lead by a large advantage along the inside into the lane, enough left to last.
ANOTHERINTHEFIRE lacked early foot, asked along in the two path late in the turn, continued to advance just off the inside through the stretch, finished
well to be getting to the winner late. APHRODITES REVENGE in the second flight off the inside, between horses into the lane, closest to the winner a
furlong out, closed the gap on that one late while being caught for the place while widest of the first flight at the wire. MISSGREELEY'SSONG in mid pack
while well out in the strip in the run up the backstretch, fell back, was four wide out of the turn, improved position through the stretch while not a serious
threat to the top three. THINKING OF HER closest to the winner in the run up the backstretch, began to weaken midway on the turn. JOEY'S SASSY
SHANA void of speed, made little impact down the lane. AGIRLNAMEDSYD headed up the second flight for three furlongs toward the inside, stopped when
the real running began at the head of the lane. EASTER GIRL last to leave, trailed, showed little.

Footnotes
FOUR PRINCESSES behind the lead group first turn toward the inside, moved closer when asked a bit far turn, ranged up three wide into the lane, took
over and drew strongly clear while kept to pressure. CRIMSON FELINE void of speed early, continued to lag up the backstretch, two path through the final
turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for home, finished willingly to be clear for the second spot, no match for the winner. ANGEL OF VERDUN vied up
front three wide and between rivals, continued to contest the issue up the backstretch and into the far turn, offered brief resistance to the winner nearing
midstretch, proved no match for that same rival or the runner up late, comfortably saved the show. MONEY WELL SPENT also with the pace while between
foes into and through the first turn, remained with the lead pack the middle half mile, also faltered when turning for home. FLURRY OF FEATHERS last to
leave, trailed most of the way while four wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. SABER CUT flashed brief speed
along the inside, finished before a half. KIND WAYS with the pace four wide through the first turn, also gave way. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LOVE THAT STAR in the second flight early while outside, raced four wide through the turn, roused when entering the stretch, collared the leader quickly
once inside the furlong marker, drew well clear under pressure. CECE WAVE broke sharp, quickly clear, dueled, shuffled back slightly early turn from
between foes, stayed on for the run into the lane, in a bit tight nearing the furlong marker, continued to show good resolve to be up for the second spot late.
SCARLET STORM in mid pack early, three wide into the turn while inside the winner, dropped to the rail late in the turn, rallied up the inside, not enough for
the second spot, clear of the others. MY LITTLE MIA moved up to duel just after the start, vied into the turn closest to the inside, shook well clear when
straightened for home, fell apart inside the furlong grounds after being confronted by the winner. TALENTS HOT DEAL fell back steadily along the inside the
opening furlong to trail into the lane, steered out four wide turning for home, showed some mild, belated interest to improve position. DIVINE DEFENCE
joined the fray soon after the start to vie three wide, briefly dueled in the two path early in the turn and began to give way, continued to weaken through the
lane. SUM CHARM remained back while racing outside. ATLANTIC BAND in the main group early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs. BETT THE
LIMIT refused at the start.

Footnotes
CHARLIE T close up inside in the run up the backstretch, fell back into the turn, moved out a bit entering the stretch, challenged outside the leader a furlong
out, edged clear under steady handling. LAKE MARIE broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace in the two path, shook well clear by late in the turn, offered
but brief resistance to the winner the final furlong, remained well clear of the others. FUNKYLITTLESHACK broke in the air, recovered and moved up to race
in mid pack for three furlongs inside, angled out three wide turning for home, improved to race closest to the top pair past the furlong marker, could do little
with that pair to the wire, finished up best of the rest. SPEAK TO ME lacked speed off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, improved through the
stretch and was gaining for the show spot. MIDNIGHT TRIP fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to see them all through the turn, improved
position through traffic by passing some tiring rivals. A. K. A. GRAMS lacked speed off the inside early, dropped to the inside by late in the turn, failed to
produce a rally. MADAME JANE in the second flight early outside, floated out four wide turning for home and began to tire. KNIGHTS SWORD pressed the
issue for almost three furlongs in the two path, steadily retreated through the lane. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
HIGHHOPES DIAMOND broke sharp, raced with the pace the opening quarter outside, spurted suddenly clear far turn, not threatened through the lane in
cruising home. ORPHAN CREEK bothered at the break to be last away, moved up to mid pack in the opening quarter, came three wide for the drive, left
with too much to do with regard to the winner, far clear for the runner up position. CABOCHON TREASURE broke alertly, raced with the winner to that one's
inside, could not keep up with that one by midway on the turn, no match runner up, clear of the others. COLE'S SENSATION broke in, was straightened to
race in the second flight, had little left for the drive to lose the show. WILD FIST was never involved in remaining back. LAMONT off a step slow, was
finished early, reported home far back.
