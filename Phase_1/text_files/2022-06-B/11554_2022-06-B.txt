MINE MY TIME dueled outside of JERRYS PRIDENJOY around the first turn and up the backstretch then shook clear entering the far turn, continued on top
two wide into the lane and held firm under steady pressure. CLIFTON PARK rated off the clear top pair through early stages, picked up the tempo midway
around the far turn, edged closer along the rail but could not reach the winner while clearly second best. PLUMBAGO rated off the clear top pair in early
stages, hustled up four wide into upper stretch and gained a share. JERRYS PRIDENJOY dueled inside of MINE MY TIME around the first turn and up the
backstretch, could not match strides with the eventual winner entering the far turn then came up empty in the lane.

SMOKIN BOOTS rated along the outside up the backstretch then launched a three wide bid around the far turn, took over the lead at the head of the lane
and held clear under steady urging. TANGO KILO was allowed to settle through early stages then picked up the pace four wide around the final turn,
sustained response into the lane and finished clearly second best. GUN WAR tracked the early pace along the inside, hustled up along the rail around the
far turn and cut the corner into the lane, tipped out a path wider in the final furlong and churned for a share. LUCKS BIG BOY quickly cleared on top and
angled inside soon after the start, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn then got collared by the winner at the head of
the lane and gave way. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR pulled while being rated heading into the first turn then settled and tracked the pacesetter up the
backstretch, came under a ride mid-way around the far turn but failed to respond. FLAT OUT FREED came up empty around the final turn, dropped back
and jogged in.

ARIZONA KALEI vied outside of BLONDES HAVEMO FUN around the turn, shook clear at the head of the lane and finished going away while never really
asked. OLD SCHOOL FLASH was forwardly placed and three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and secured place. BE SINCERE raced off
the top trio entering the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and showed response to gain a share. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN dueled inside of ARIZONA
KALEI around the turn then gave way in the lane. UNGLUED hustled up in opening strides then lugged out and steadied, dropped to last, angled back in
under right handed pressure, saved ground into the lane and never threatened.

MYSTERY MAN sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held clear around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, had plenty left
in reserve and finished going away. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER raced two wide between foes entering the turn, coaxed three wide at the head of the lane,
responded and gained place. CARL G raced in contention along the outside around the turn, sustained a four wide bid into the lane and secured show.
HERITAGE PARK steadied slightly just after the start, tracked the pace into the turn, edged closer along the rail in upper stretch then yielded in the final
furlong. DRILL'S LI'L MAN prompted the pace up the backstretch, remained forwardly placed around the turn then weakened late. BROTHER AARON was
not too far back early on then flattened around the turn and had no response in the lane.

SOMEONE SAID SO was well placed tracking the embattled duo into the turn, given cue three wide in upper stretch, dug in three deep a furlong out, seized
command and held firm. EURO ME tracked the top trio in early stages, shifted out four wide at the top of the lane, sustained steady response and gained
second best. ELLE'S TOWN dueled outside of MISS MELODY for the early lead, continued to battle two wide into upper stretch, got collared by the winner
a furlong out and stayed on for a share. ZOFIA lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then tipped three wide for the drive and
failed to rally. MISS MELODY dueled inside of ELLE'S TOWN in early stages and continued to battle for command into upper stretch, got overtaken by the
winner at the furlong marker and steadily faded.

Footnotes
HOOKED ON DREAMS set a pressured pace in early stages then shook free to clear command at the head of the lane and held clear inside under steady
urging. ROWDY RAY raced off the top trio and chased two wide around the turn, shifted wider for the drive and produced a solid finish. ALL OVER OLIVER
tracked the top pair into the turn, raced in aim to strike going by the quarter pole, given cue turning for home, could not reach the leader, chased evenly and
lost place. FRANKLY EPIC prompted the pace in early stages, remained forwardly placed around the turn then flattened in the lane. WE'RE ALL NUTS
raced three to four wide and failed to threaten. STROLLN DOWN WELCH chased three to four wide late on the turn and failed to move into contention.
BLUEGRASS FLIGHT raced in the back throughout.
