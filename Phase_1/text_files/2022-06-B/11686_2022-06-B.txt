Footnotes
ARMA D'ORO tracked the moderate pace, came outside of rivals and mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, overtook PLAISIR inside of the furlong
marker and edged away in the final stages to prevail. PLAISIR was sent leaving the start, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, came under
pressure from the winner nearing the furlong grounds, could not hold off ARMA D'ORO in the drive and was outfinished, while besting the rest. MIKE DAD
stumbled leaving the gate and spotted the field in the early stages, shifted to the inside leaving the three-furlong marker, gained ground in upper stretch to
come within aim but was outkicked in the drive and just held for third. MEDAL ICE stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and weakened in the final stages, while just missing for third.

Footnotes
JAN JAN CAN settled off of the quick early pace, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, mounted a three wide rally into the drive, came within range of
the top pair in upper stretch and responded to steady urging in the final stages to draw clear. A DIME FOR ME was off a step slowly and was hustled to the
early lead, set quick fractions while pressed by TRAFFIC STOPPER on the turn, dueled with that rival into upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner
leaving the furlong marker and dead-heated for the place in the end. TRAFFIC STOPPER tracked the pace to the turn then advanced to press the quick
pace to the quarter marker, dueled with A DIME FOR ME to mid-stretch, was passed by the winner inside of the eighth pole and was outfinished, while
dead-heating for second at the wire. ST. ANNIE'S INDY lacked early speed, was roused three wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild late rally.
SEASIDE DANCER stalked the quick pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the drive to be five wide at the head of
the stretch and could not muster a late rally. OYSTER SHOOTER chased the solid pace from an inside position on the turn and lacked a late response.

CLOSED CIRCUIT broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn while extending the lead nearing the quarter marker,
was clear in upper stretch, felt pressure from the runner-up in deep stretch but held safely for the win. SUPER ANNIE was hustled to show early speed and
disputed the early pace then took back to stalk into the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, closed well in the drive and just missed at the end while besting the
rest. FIRST TIME PLAYER stumbled leaving the break and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace to the turn, steadied off of heels approaching the
three-furlong marker, advanced from a three wide path on the turn, swung widest into the stretch run and made a late rally to be clear for third.
INEXPENSIVE STAR lunged at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed while traveling along the inside, gained ground in upper stretch but flattened
out in the final furlong. UNBRIDLE THE WILD was forwardly placed to the turn, gained ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not
sustain that bid in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

PLAYING HARDBALL chased the quick early pace from the rail, ran evenly while tracking the speed to the quarter marker, overtook POLACCO in upper
stretch, was clear nearing the furlong marker, came under pressure in the final sixteenth and held for the win over the quickly oncoming runner-up. KINGS
RIVER KNIGHT settled off of the early quick pace, gained ground while outside of foes on the turn, mounted a four wide rally at the head of the lane, closed
with a rush through the final stages and just missed for the win in the final strides while besting the rest. I CAN'T HEAR YOU chased the quick early speed
to the turn, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch but stayed on in the late stages to be clear for
third. ALWAYS LITT stumbled sharply at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, improved position while two wide nearing the quarter
pole, gained a bit of ground in upper stretch and was able to offer a mild late rally in the drive. POLACCO broke sharply and was sent to the early lead,
showed good speed through the turn while setting quick fractions, was overhauled in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. RODEO JOE bobbled at
the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WICKLOW HILLS was crowded at the start when GOOD FOCUS broke out, recovered nicely to show early speed and took command into the turn, set the
pace to the top of the lane, extended the lead in mid-stretch and drew away under a hand ride in the end. OLYMPIC SILVER broke through the gate before
the start, was away alertly and was outrun to the turn by the winner, tracked the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was no match in the
end but held safely for second. PICK BYMY FRIEND chased the pace from midpack to the turn, gained ground while two wide nearing the quarter pole, was
outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the drive but was up for third in a blanket finish for show. GOOD FOCUS broke out at the start and crowded
WICKLOW HILLS, chased the pace to the turn, improved position approaching the top of the stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the
end. HUNTERS GHOST was away a bit slowly and lacked early speed, was roused four wide into the drive and ran evenly in the late stages while passing
tiring rivals. MADE THE TEAM chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while three wide nearing the top of the stretch and was not a threat. THUNDER OF
ZION was forwardly placed to the turn, lost position on the turn while racing from the inside, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
EMILY SMILES was forwardly placed early on, steadied off of heels nearing the half-mile marker, came three wide along the turn and improved position
approaching the top of the stretch, confronted the dueling pacesetters in mid-stretch and made a late push to prevail. BIG JOLT was hustled to show early
speed, dueled for pace duties through the turn with RIVIERA SUNRISE, kept up that duel into upper stretch, was engaged by EMILY SMILES nearing the
furlong marker, battled with the winner to the final strides and was edged out for the win, while holding safely for the place. RIVIERA SUNRISE was sent in
hand to contest the early lead, dueled with BIG JOLT through the turn while setting modest fractions, was confronted by the winner nearing the eighth pole,
could not match strides with the top pair in the final sixteenth and was outfinished and just held for third in the end. GOVERNOR SPECIAL chased the pace
from an inside position, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, lacked room in upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong marker and finished evenly
in the final sixteenth. CALLHERCONTESSA chased the moderate pace, gained ground from a three wide path on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch
and lacked a late rally. SWEET VENGEANCE chased the pace to the turn, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN broke alertly, showed good early speed while in hand, pressed the early pace to the turn, overtook THE ARCADIAN WAY midway
through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and drew away in the final stages. LA AGUILILLA chased the pace from the second flight, improved
position while two wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked in the late stages but held for second in the end. CANAM GAL raced in
midpack while just off of the early pace, lost ground while three then four wide on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final
furlong and was just edged for second. DAMN THE TORPEDOES chased the pace to the turn, improved position while outside of rivals nearing the quarter
marker, was outrun in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. KITTY'S CANDY bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed while trailing
through the turn and was not a factor. THE ARCADIAN WAY was asked for early speed leaving the break, contested the pace to the turn with the winner
and took a narrow lead into the bend, was overtaken by MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN approaching the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in
the final stages. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU was forwardly placed in the early stages and chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn and came up empty in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
SALTO DE TIGRE raced in mid pack in the early stages while settling off of the pace, rated nicely through the backstretch run, was asked for run while
improving position on the second turn, steadied at the top of the stretch when LIL MIRACLE MAN drifted in, dueled with that rival to the wire and gamely
prevailed. LIL MIRACLE MAN was sent leaving the break and set the early contested fractions, set a moderate pace while prompted through the second
turn, was confronted by SALTO DE TIGRE leaving the second turn, drifted in under right-handed encouragement and crowded that foe, straightened out
and dueled with the winner to the wire and lost the nod at the end, while well clear of the rest. LOVE OF THE SPORT settled three wide off of the early
pace, advanced along the backstretch run, came two wide to the quarter marker, was no threat to the top two in the drive and passed tiring rivals to get up
for the show. MESA EMPIRE raced close to the early pace while saving ground, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second
turn, was outrun in upper stretch and was just edged out on the wire for third. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was unhurried in the early stages, trailed through the
backstretch run, improved position while three wide on the second turn, could not sustain that run in upper stretch and lacked a final response. COMMAND
A PREMIUM came three wide on the first turn while stalking the early pace, lost position on the backstretch run, maintained that three wide path through the
far turn and gave way in the drive. J T'S CREDITCARD settled off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, was asked for run from that
four wide path on the second turn and could not threaten in the stretch run. ROARING TIGER had an awkward start but recovered and was sent to be close
to the pace into the first turn, kept close attendance to the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and weakened in the final stages.
