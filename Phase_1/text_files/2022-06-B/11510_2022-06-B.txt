WILLING TO BURN saved ground setting the pace in hand, responded when challenged and drew off to win as the rider pleased. MEAN SHARON was
allowed to settle in stride early, launched a three-wide bid nearing the three-eighths pole, but was unable to match strides with the winner during the drive
while finished well for the place. KERRALIA unhurried early, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and made up some ground late. SIMPLY
PERFECT saved ground stalking the winner, moved out to offer her bid nearing the three-eighths pole, but was unable to sustain her bid and flattened out
during the drive. SMASHING SUCCESS failed to seriously threaten while saving ground. COCOA CENTS bobbled slightly at the start, then race three-wide
on the turn and gave way during the drive.

FORTY SMOOCHES was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished with a rush to win going away. RINGS OF SATURN bobbled slightly
at the start, then saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. JUSPASSINTHRU saved ground setting the early
pace in hand, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and failed to last. AMERICAN BUDDHA was off a step slow then lacked early speed, came four-wide
into the stretch and gained some ground late. LINCHTOWN was forwardly placed while racing along the outside, came three-wide into the stretch and tired.
MIDNIGHT LUTER was three-wide early and gave way after three furlongs.

IRISH KNIGHT was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was up with a rush in the final strides. EXECUTIVE ACTION was allowed to settle
in stride, moved out four-wide to launch his bid leaving the quarter pole, gained the lead between calls in the stretch and just failed to last. SUMMANUS was
reserved off the early pace while saving ground, angled out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished well. CURLING SECRET broke in slightly,
then dueled for the lead into deep stretch while racing three-wide and weakened. SYZSLAK bumped start, dueled for the lead from the outset while between
horses and tired in the final sixteenth. MISCHIEF ROAD was bumped at the start, then was unhurried, steadied nearing the eighth pole running up on a
tiring rival and finished willingly when clear. DECIMATE dueled for the early lead from along the inside and gave way willingly after a half mile.

HOUSE OF LORDS stalked the pace while racing along the inside, angled out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, then quickly angled back to the
inside, caught Missed the Boat at the sixteenth pole and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive. MISSED THE BOAT saved ground setting the pace, drifted out
slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged and just failed to last. BRONZE WARRIOR prompted the pace into the stretch from
along the outside and held on fairly well for the show. BERNALINHO was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, but lack a response when asked.
COMPLICATE saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. MUNCEY was prominently place for six furlongs from between horses
and weakened.

Footnotes
WAHASHA stalked the pace while racing three-wide, caught Flyin By at the eighth pole and proved best under right hand pressure. FLYIN BY set the early
pace from along the outside of Her Royal Duchess while racing in hand, responded when challenged by the winner, but wasn't good enough. NOOSITA
unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. HER ROYAL DUCHESS dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and
weakened slightly. SUSY'S HEART was allowed to settle in stride early, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally when called upon. QUICK TIME
(GB) failed to be a serious factor while saving ground.
