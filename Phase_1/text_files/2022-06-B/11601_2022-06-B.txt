MY DANNY BOY led throughout, was roused while racing in the three path in upper stretch, rebroke and kicked away. LIVEFORTHESONG prompted the
pace from the two path, made a bid two wide rounding the far turn, was repelled but dug in to hold on for place. SHED A TEAR stalked along the inside, was
driven in the three path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly to show. PAPA JIMMY trailed inside, was hustled in the four path at the top of the stretch,
but flattened. ROCKY DICE raced well back in the three path but was no factor. CHIEF ALPHA raced in mid pack while three wide but backed out around
the turn.

STRAIGHT SHOT prompted the pace from three wide, made a bid while racing in the four path around the turn, and forged clear in the stretch. RILEYS
DUDE bumped at the start and rated from three path, swung into the six path coming into the stretch, and rallied down the center to place. THE KING
CHEEK raced in mid pack from the rail, was hustled along the inside rounding the turn, and ran on for show. KENNY HAD A NOTION trailed early from the
inside and was no threat. SHACKS WAY was bumped and the rider lost her iron at the start, regained her iron while pressing between rivals early but
backed out around the turn. FOURTEENEIGHTYFOUR led from inside, floated into the three path coming into the stretch, but was eased.

late. DETERMINED STAR chased from the three path, was driven between foes rounding the far turn, drifted into the six path at the top of the stretch, and
ran on. A REAL JEWEL led from the two path, opened up at the top of the stretch, but yielded late to show. EQUAL MEASURE prompted the pace from the
three path, was hustled inside rounding the far turn, and finished evenly. DAWN stalked in the four path, was asked while racing in the three path into the

Footnotes
YO NESSROUNDONKERN stalked in the three path, was coaxed from the three path rounding the turn, and rallied up the inside to win. ALWAYS
DRINKING led from the three path, opened up around the turn, but yielded late to place. BACKATYA prompted the pace inside, was roused inside around
the turn, but finished evenly to show. BUTTONED UP pressed two wide, was hustled between rounding the turn, but flattened. AKINGISALWAYSKING
trailed into the stretch and was no factor. SIMPLY VALID tracked inside but never threatened. LOYAL TO THE GAME rated in the four path but was no
menace.
