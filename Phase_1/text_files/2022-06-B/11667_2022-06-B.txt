Footnotes
GRUDGE stumbled badly at the start but broke on even terms at the front, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path around
the turn, was roused for more outside the quarter-pole, gained the lead under a drive in upper stretch, inched clear into the final furlong and proved best
under strong urging. BAY JEWEL broke a bit awkwardly but with the field, settled just off the pace on the outside, tracked three wide around the turn, was
given her cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, swapped back to her inside lead
inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while just able to get the place. RED PEPPER GRILL was restless in the gate, brushed the inside of the stall
door at the break, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, gained in the final furlong
and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. GUNS BLAZING bumped lightly with foes on both sides at the start, was well placed
just off the pace, raced under a tight hold behind the leader late on the backstretch, drafted inside to the two path around the turn, was asked with
five-sixteenths to run, turned into upper stretch under the crop, chased to the wire and lacked the needed kick. MISSING LINK broke out and bumped lightly
with a foe, went to the front, set the pace on the inside while under pressure from the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. JEN'S BATTLE made light contact with a rival at the
start, was ridden along at the rear, went three wide around the turn, moved out into upper stretch and faltered then was placed under a protective hold in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
SARATOGA GAZE established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, held well while
geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the wire. ROAD TO REMEMBER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors while clear of the rest and along second
best. LOLLYGAG three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go and angled out four wide at the head of the stretch, then kept
on to the finish to secure the show honors. ARD MACHA coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH coaxed from the start, got taken in hand and steadied off the heels of a rival
nearing five and a half furlongs to go when COOLCATSNKITTENS tucked directly in front and conceded two to three lengths of ground, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. COOLCATSNKITTENS just off the
inside briefly, tucked directly in front of the aforementioned foe forcing that rival to steady off her heels with near five and a half furlongs to run, chased along
the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MISCHIEF MOTION chased greenly from the two
path down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, came under
light urging and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF PHAROAHS came in some at the start then went to the front, angled in while going clear early, was urged along against the rail around the
turn, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. TIERGAN broke a
step slow then was asked to move forward, settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer in the three path around the turn, was given his cue inside the
five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed crop in pursuit of the winner outside the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while well
clear for the place. TROUBLESHOOTER settled on the inside of the winner, dropped back with six furlongs to run, was urged two then three wide around
the turn, drifted out under a left-handed crop just inside the furlong marker and got up for the place while no threat to the top two. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD
was hustled from the start, moved out early then followed the leader under coaxing, chased in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and tired. STATE PLANNING broke a bit slow, was reserved behind horses early, tugged hard at the bit outside the three-quarter pole then moved to
the outside inside that marker, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond. CONTROL GROUP stumbled at the start, settled under some urging,
came under stronger encouragement while inside to the two path around the turn and faltered then was distanced in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SAINT TAPIT hustled from the gate, advanced inside and was forced to steady when latching on the leader with five and a half furlongs to go as that rival
tucked directly in front, lost about a length to a length and a half of ground and tipped to the two path five furlongs from home, advanced outside the leader
through the turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole seizing command before spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a
drive greenly on his wrong lead early in the drive, then shied in when correctly switching just inside the eighth pole and was kept to task to the finish.
GOLDEN ALCHEMIST shied in at the start and brushed with TRIPLE ELVIS, chased two then three wide down the backstretch before going four wide
through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, dug in under a drive dueling through to the finish with MOUNT
CRAIG and just bested that rival for the place honors while never threatening the winner. MOUNT CRAIG chased just off the inside from near the rear of the
field, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive knocking heads to the finish with the aforementioned
foe while never threatening the top one and was ultimately narrowly bested on the wire while clear of the rest for the show honors. UPPER LEVEL broke in
at the start and was corrected, came under coaxing and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside directly in front of SAINT TAPIT five
and a half furlongs from home forcing that rival to steady off his heels, remained inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got
headed near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. FLUTE MASTER coaxed from the gate, chased
three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. TRIPLE ELVIS got brushed at the start by
GOLDEN ALCHEMIST, who shied inwards in response to UPPER LEVEL breaking inwards, chased three wide in aim of the front, got placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, faded three wide into upper stretch and tired in the stretch. FELICIANO shied in at the start in reaction to TRIPLE ELVIS coming inwards
when brushed due to pressure to his outside, came under coaxing and chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the
turn under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, continued two to three wide at the top of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
THEODORA GRACE bumped with a rival at the start then was carried in and dropped back, settled towards the rear of the field, saved ground for most of
the turn then moved to the two path, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker and held off the runner-up
under strong urging. STELLA MARS broke awkwardly then bobbled, spotted the front several lengths, was unhurried at the rear, raced inside for the
majority of the turn then moved to the two path, swung six wide into the stretch then rallied on the outside and closed strongly to just miss while clear for the
place. SUMMER AT THE SPA charged the front of the stall just as the gate opened and broke a bit awkwardly, was taken back between foes then settled
off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid around the furlong marker but
was out-kicked while clear for the show. GET THE CANDY came away in good order, quickly angled in front of the field, showed the way while getting
pressure from the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was collared shortly
thereafter and weakened. WEEKEND FUN tracked the pace down the backstretch, rounded most of the turn in the two path, shifted three wide outside the
quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging in the three
path around the turn, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. BLISSFUL CHANGE settled on the outside towards the back, was urged
along late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MY SWEET WIFE raced well
back on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then moved inward and was no factor. JACRODRA'S DEVIL was
taken up briefly when the leader crossed in front early, raced under restraint while tugging keenly at the bit, saved ground while let out around the turn and
had nothing left. LIONESSOFBRITTANY bumped with a foe at the start then came inward, raced in hand while the leader crossed over then moved up on
the outside to press the pace, vied in the two path through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
ACCRETIVE five then four wide in pursuit, advanced through the latter portion of the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole when narrowly
taking over command, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, drew clear under a drive and was under light hand urging through
the final seventy yards, the outcome in no doubt. HAPPY BOB broke in at the start under coaxing coming together to trade a bump with NAKED AND
FAMOUS while taking over the lane of the slow breaking CAPITAL VELOCITY, chased just off the inside until tucked inside midway on the turn, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out five wide into upper stretch straightening away four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while
running on to procure the place honors clear of the rest. SUL PHAROAH coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PROVEN HOPE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide
under a ride from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SOUTHERN FLAG four then three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five then four wide into upper stretch straightened away for home and tired. CAPITAL
VELOCITY broke a beat slow and lost his lane at the start when both flanking rivals broke his way, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. IMPULSIVENESS four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
chased three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.
NAKED AND FAMOUS broke out at the start trading a bump with HAPPY BOB, showed the way safely in front lightly coaxed along the inside, came under
growing threat midway on the turn, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then backed away to the finish
when tired.

Footnotes
RUNNINGWSCISSORS bumped with a rival at the start and bobbled slightly while last to commence, settled in the middle of the field under some restraint,
was roused three wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth then moved clear under good
handling. PHANTOM SMOKE tracked the leading duo on the outside, chased in the two path around the turn, gained four wide into the stretch, took over
outside the furlong marker then moved clear, was collared while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and weakened while able to hold the place.
SHIRAZ was unhurried near the back of the field, came under urging in the two path around the turn, gained under a drive into the final furlong, moved out
coming to the sixteenth-pole then split foes and finished willingly to just get the show. MISSION WRAPITUP settled outside under some urging, was roused
four wide on the turn, moved inward in upper stretch, gained into the final furlong, raced between foes into the final sixteenth and also finished willingly but
just missed the show. PANSTER settled towards the back, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, came six wide into
the stretch, gained outside in the final furlong and just missed the superfecta. DEEP COVER broke and brushed with a foe then was hustled, pressed the
fast pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn and tired. NOT PHAR NOW bumped with an opponent at the start then was sent to the
lead, set the pace on the inside of a foe through blistering fractions, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up inside the three-sixteenths
and capitulated. VALMONT settled well off the pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond then was reported to have bled.

rear footing at the start getting away awkwardly under coaxing, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths under
threat to the outside, spun three wide for home and was displaced from command straightened away, then ran on to secure the place honors safely in front
of the rest. KEPT WAITING chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs from home, continued along the inside into upper stretch and kept on
to secure the show honors. SECRET LOVE chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish missing for the show honors. SNICKET six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. TIME LIMIT coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and weakened. MISS JIMMY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, darted to the two
path with nine-sixteenths to go and chased just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped out four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. LETMETAKETHISCALL hustled from the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went seven

VINDATUDE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when set down into upper stretch
and held under steady urging. OUR JESSICA was rated while rated under vigorous restraint just off the pace, raced in the two path early on the turn,
