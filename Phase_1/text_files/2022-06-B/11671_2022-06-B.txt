Footnotes
SOARING BIRD trailed in the two path, tracked the leading quartet turning for home before tipping outside of them entering the lane, took aim outside of a
leading HONORARY DEGREE approaching midstretch, bid at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. HONORARY DEGREE tracked four wide and outside
of rivals, ranged up to bid approaching the lane, gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole as an outer SOARING BIRD pursued, met that foe's bid at
the furlong grounds, but failed to match strides soon after, and proved second best. FIRERY TALE laid forwardly placed three wide and between horses,
stalked before inching closer to bid nearing the lane, vied among foes in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the three sixteenths pole, chased the outer
leading pair through the final furlong while battling with his inner stable-mate for show, and prevailed. RANDELLO pressed the pace two wide, vied among
foes turning for home, but was outkicked by outer rivals in upper stretch, vied inside of FIERY TALE for show in the late stages, but was bested. BULL
HOLLOW lost his footing slightly at the start while still breaking on top, showed the way into the turn, was confronted by a trio of bidders approaching the
quarter pole, got headed in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
DIVEMASTER laid off of the hot pace in the three to four path around the turn, commenced a rally in the five path in midstretch, quickened to take aim on
the clear leader in the final sixteenth, and reeled in that rival late with elongated strides. JEREMY'S JET pressed the pace setter in earnest through a fast
pace while opening up on the rest of the field around the turn, vied entering the lane, wrestled an advantage leaving the furlong pole, drew clear in the final
sixteenth, but was overhauled approaching the wire, and just lasted for place. MUSICAL MAESTRO shifted a bit inwardly at the start, stalked the dueling
pair from the two path while many lengths off around the turn, chased them from the three to four path through midstretch, progressed in the final furlong as
an outer DIVEMASTER picked up stride, then was outkicked by that rival in the final sixteenth, kept on in hopes of reaching place at the wire, but just
missed. MATARO set a fast fast pace while feeling stern pressure from an outer JEREMY'S JET around the turn, sparred with that foe entering the lane,
clung to a minor advantage in the battle through upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, and yielded entering the final sixteenth. RUNGIUS
tracked along the inside, but failed to bid before tiring. ACCIDENT broke slowly and avoided being put to tight quarters between horses, lagged well behind
the field around the turn, then narrowed the gap through the lane.

PROVE RIGHT stalked three wide early on, engaged the leader into the turn, forged an advantage at the three furlong pole, showed the way entering the
lane, then kicked away at the furlong grounds. RUN POPPY tracked in midpack in the four path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch
while in pursuit of the top trio as SMART PRIZE ranged up alongside, then rallied in midstretch to bid for place at the sixteenth pole along with that foe,
gained that position shortly after, and fended off his outer counterpart for it. SMART PRIZE broke slowly before being bumped by an inner rival at the start,
trailed the field into the turn, gained between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, swung out the six path in upper stretch, sustained his rally outside of RUN
POPPY in midstretch while hanging on his left lead, bid for place entering the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. JOHN GREY set the pace, met the
eventual winner's bid into the turn, got headed at the three furlong pole, fought on through upper stretch, but yielded leaving the furlong grounds, and
faltered late. CINCH UP chased from midpack along the inside, but tired. TREPAT broke slowly, recovered to stalk the pace three wide, laid in striking range
turning for home, but faded while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch. UPTOWN SOCIAL hopped slightly at the start, then shifted inwardly while
recovering balance, laid close up behind the pace setter while in the two path into the turn, but was roused at the five sixteenths pole, lacked a kick, and
tired between horses in midstretch. MORIARTY took the turn at the rear in the three path, and was outrun. BOOK OF KELLS broke a bit outwardly at the
start, then saved ground far off of the pace, and was outrun. LOUDMOUTHSOUP broke slowly before being bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at
the start, then was eased passing the five furlong pole, guided out and pulled up into the turn, then was dismounted and untacked nearing the three furlong
pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
PERFECT FLIGHT broke in and bumped a rival at the start, pressed the pace two wide while in the three path around the first turn, stalked three wide into
the far turn, bid turning for home, gained an advantage from an inner OLD HICKORY at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off through the final furlong.
OLD HICKORY set the pace, sparred inside of MISTICAL CURLIN into the far turn, repelled that foe while PERFECT FLIGHT loomed a danger entering the
lane, but was headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, yielded in the final furlong, and lasted for place late. STRONG LIGHT was bumped between
horses and squeezed back at the start, trailed along the inside, launched a rally while improving inside of foes into the far turn, tracked from the two path
around that bend before swinging five wide entering the lane, and stayed on well through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reach place.
BEYBLADER was jostled between horses at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, inched closer to a stalking position approaching the far turn,
tipped outside of the leading trio at the three furlong pole, ranged up turning for home, but tired in upper stretch. ENOUGH ALREADY settled far back in the
three path, trailed at the half mile pole, tucked turning for home, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, and stayed on thereafter, but failed to menace.
MISTICAL CURLIN stalked along the inside, pulled keenly in the bit around the first turn causing him to check behind the leader nearing the backstretch,
tugged between the top pair to vie two wide approaching the half mile pole, sustained position between horses turning for home, but weakened at the three
sixteenths pole. FAITH RUNNER laid off of the pace while hung out in the five path around both turns, and made little impact. MUCHO MOJO stalked three
wide while in the four path, but faded around the far turn. UNIFIED DREAMS bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide, tipped five
wide down the backstretch, then tired in the three path around the far turn.
