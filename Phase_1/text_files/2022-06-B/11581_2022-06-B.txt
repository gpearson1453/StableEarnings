OPEN LENGTHS stalked the pace, took over before the half then drew away eagerly under urging. MISSION OBERON angled near the inside early then
closed well to be easily second best. IMPACTFUL trailed in the opening quarter then moved three wide to gain the show. SIGHT LINE dropped far behind
then came again passing fading rivals. AMERICAN ROMA was urged close up three wide, made a brief move on the final turn then gave way. TAINO
hustled to the front inside then was finished after half a mile.

NURTURING set a measured pace inside, repelled a challenge then edged away through the stretch driving. RAINBOW TROUT pressed the winner to the
stretch and continued gamely. HOLLYWOOD GINA saved ground close up, angled out on the turn then flattened. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased wide
throughout and was never in contention. LADY MISTRESS saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily. WRITE THE CHECK broke very slowly,
steadied in the opening quarter and faded.

Footnotes
BRODY SLAM settled off the pace, angled out in the stretch and pulled away under steady encouragement. CAPE COD SALLY earned a narrow lead
inside, was collared into the stretch, tired and just lasted for the place. FASTLIFE lacked speed, commenced her rally on the turn and closed well too late.
MISS ALEX chased wide off the leaders throughout with no response. WITHOUT A VIEW prompted the pace three then two wide and proved empty in the
stretch. MISBEHAVING LADY forced the pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS lagged far behind and was never in
contention. SWEET BALLERINA broke slowly and ducked in at the start then gave way.

the start, raced far behind, advanced inside on the turn then weakened in the stretch. LT. COLUMBO chased the dueling pacesetters for half a mile and
gave way. PRINCE CHAMP dropped back early and was always outrun. GOGEES forced the pace outside, remained alongside the leader when he ducked
out nearing the quarter pole unseating his rider.

early, bid very wide into the stretch, surged and just missed. BLOWING BIG SMOKE stalked the pacesetters inside then flattened out in the stretch. TIDDLY
WINK was firmly rated just off the leader, angled inside in the lane and faded. FACTUM LOVE STYLE dropped far behind then picked off rivals through the
stretch. WARN chased in midpack and was never in contention. HE'SSOSUBTLE raced close up three wide down the backstretch and faltered. MERKABA
raced inside and weakened steadily. KANE lacked speed and gave way readily. GO SKIPPY GO trailed throughout losing contact with his field.
