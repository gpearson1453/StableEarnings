Footnotes
JANET IS READY broke alertly, dueled up front into the turn closest to the inside and in hand, shook off the other speed late in the bend, well clear,
maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while rider looked back several times, won with something left. LA VIE EN ROUGE dueled up front in the
two path and outside the winner, proved no match for that one through the stretch, remained clear for the place. TAP IRON FIST lacked early foot, saved
ground through the turn, continued along the inside stretch and was slowly getting to the runner up late. STHEPANIE PRINCESS last to leave, between
foes early in the turn, three wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire. DORGENOIS lacked speed, failed to menace. TROSKA in the second flight early,
steadily faded.

Footnotes
BETISON broke sharp, was clear out of the chute, dueled midway on the backstretch into the turn in the two path, remained off the inside entering the
stretch when clear again, not threatened through the stretch to win ridden out. CITIZENS REWARD moved up to duel inside the winner before a quarter,
continued on equal terms with that one early turn then could not keep pace, remained clear for second spot. BOSTON LUCILLE settled in mid pack along
the inside, continued to save ground turn, roused for the drive, drifted out when clear of the others midstretch, fully extended to hold the show. LA JAZZ last
away, trailed early, continued to lack speed through the turn, improved up the rail stretch, made a late bid for the show spot, outkicked. SLIDE went one
paced in the two path for a half, came out a bit to be three wide into the lane, continued evenly through the stretch. ALLSTAR MAGIC chased the dueling
leaders off the inside, three wide into the lane, faltered in the drive. CORBIN'S WILD ACES finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
CATALINA LATRINA broke back, lacked speed while a bit rank up the backstretch, moved out, came three wide for the drive, roused, finished with a late
push while drifting in to be up at the wire. T D Z HI COURT broke on top, dueled inside, disposed of that rival into the straight, turned back a mild bid from
the outside inside the furlong grounds, continued to lead late, nipped in the final strides. ETBAUER'S SECRET in the second flight off the inside, moved
closer then was four wide to lose that real estate to the ground saving runner up into the lane, briefly got back closer to that rival past the furlong marker
then could not keep up. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI in the second flight while in the two path, behind some traffic and one of the tiring leaders into the lane, went
evenly to the wire when clear. LANE fractious while loading, hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued back turn, improved up the
inside in the drive while not a serious threat. MY PAL GREELEY back off the pace while along the inside, steered out three wide turning for home in some
traffic, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late punch. ISLE CALL U LATER away in good order, dueled outside the runner up, yielded to that turning into the
straight, continued to weaken to the wire. GRUMPY MONK balked at loading, was finished early, well beaten. FRACTIONAL SPLITS AND FINAL WERE
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
STORIED TRIP close from the start, closest to the leader backstretch, pressed that one from between horses in to the far turn, hooked up with the runner up
entering the stretch for a spirited duel inside that one, found more to pull away late. A WISH FOR MADELYN five wide into the first turn when forwardly
placed, four wide onto the backstretch, pressed three wide through the second bend, dueled outside the winner past the furlong marker, could not keep
pace with that one late, well clear of the others. IZEONPOINT lacked early foot, moved closer off the inside before a half, came three wide into the lane,
proved no match for the top two, clear of the rest. CAJUN SHOTS settled off the pace while three wide, continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a
closing response. PRETTY PRODUCTION in mid pack, moved off the inside, also found lacking when called on for run in the drive. PODCAST broke with
the leaders, tucked inside to save ground first turn, continued inside and lacked a rally as well. FOR REAL ALICE lost footing at the start, quickly recovered
to vied early then clear onto the backstretch, continued to set the pace into the far turn, briefly responded when confronted by the top two then began to
falter. SAND DRIFT last away, was never close to be always outrun.

Footnotes
MY AVANI away in good order, allowed the leader to go into the first turn, stalked that one up the backstretch, took over in the two path turning for home,
shook clear under a left handed crop into the lane, stayed clear. TRACK QUEEN very rank in the first turn to check up repeatedly, settled in the run up the
backstretch while outside, continued three wide through the second turn, slowly getting to the winner late while not a serious threat to that one, far clear of
the rest. LA LOLA broke in but alertly, clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn along the inside, began to weaken
when the winner took over exiting the final turn. JUST ANOTHER WIN settled off the early pace, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing response.
RENE'S NEW BOW bore out badly into the first turn, remained extremely wide onto the backstretch, stayed back. SAKURA ALEXA bothered slightly at the
stat, fell well back after a half, distanced through the stretch after losing contact with the field, vanned off. FRACTIONAL SPLITS AND FINAL WERE HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FAHAN reluctant to load, broke alertly, narrowly showed way out of chute, dueled into and through the turn in the two path, disposed of the other speed
when straightened for home, shook off a second foe a furlong out and drew clear late under steady handling. KING DOODLE in the main body while well out
in the strip up the backstretch, advanced four wide through the turn, briefly tried the winner from the outside with a furlong to run, could not match strides
with that one, fully extended to hold the place late. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY broke back, lacked speed after moving out a bit, steered out further to be five
wide into the stretch, rallied down the middle of the strip and was getting to the runner up late. HYPERBOLIST within striking distance off the inside, raced
three wide when still forward through the turn, lacked a closing punch. LONG ARROW in tight quarter and steadied to lose position out of the chute, moved
closer by the turn, had little for the drive while picking off a single tiring rival. HILLCREST DRIVE away well, dueled up inside the winner for five furlongs,
gave way for the drive. OLDER AND WISER lacked speed outside, came five wide into the lane, remained back to the wire. FOREVER PEACE last away,
remained sluggish in trailing throughout.

LADY VALENTINE bothered slightly when ABSOLUTELY bobbled and broke out, floated that foe in a bit soon after after making the front, continued to set
the pace onto and up the backstretch when clear, headed by that same rival turning for home, found more to retake the advantage and then drew clear
under steady handling. ABSOLUTELY bobbled and broke out, was righted then was floated in a bit into the gap afterward, moved out and stalked the winner
the middle half, ranged up to gain the advantage entering the stretch, was in turn headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and could not match that
one to the wire while holding sway for the place. MS. CAJUN QUEEN last to leave, lacked speed in trailing for a half, ranged up closer four wide in the final
turn, lost ground to the top two as a result, slowly getting back to the runner up late. HERE COMES LOVIE settled off the pace toward the inside, moved a
bit closer in some traffic late in the final bend, dropped to the inside for the drive, went evenly to the wire when clear. DIAMOND INDY SKIES within striking
distance while three wide through the first turn, remained forward into the second bend, moved briefly closer while remaining three wide and between
horses, gave way readily soon after.

Footnotes
TAPIT TO THE LINE forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, angled out a bit and quickly challenged between the two leaders
turning for home, soon clear, extended that advantage past the furlong marker then held the runner up safe under steady handling. RUSSET MOON in the
second flight early well wide, raced four out to five wide late in the turn when advancing, set down for the drive, getting to the runner up down the middle of
the strip. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS hopped at the start, second flight inside the runner up, four wide while remaining inside that foe entering the stretch,
could not stay with that one, finished up best of the rest. BUBBA SMACK void of speed, shifted out a bit to be four wide for the drive, displayed some late
interest to improve position. TIZNOW WIND broke back, raced back and failed to menace. KINGS WAGER chased early, dueled turn, gave way in the drive
while three wide. COUNT ON RAIN clear early, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, also backed up through the lane.
