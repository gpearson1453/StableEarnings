Footnotes
GIANT CRITIC stalked behind the leaders on the rail, waited for a path to open up entering the stretch and then split horses quickly to draw away
comfortably. TRINITY GOLD rated at the back early on, followed the winner up the rail through the final turn and finished on end to be a clear second. STOP
THE HUMBUG stalked mid pack on the outside, circled four wide on the turn to make a bid entering the stretch and evened out the final eighth. BOKERMIN
set the fractions early, was collared turning for home on the rail and gave way the final sixteenth. UNDEFILED chased the leader through the half, was
roused at the three eights pole and emptied out down the lane. CRYPTIC CREED trailed at the back and never reached contention.

Footnotes
BETTABE SWIFT broke just a bit awkwardly then settled off the leaders racing inside on or just off the rail into the turn, came out three wide approaching
the quarter pole advancing between rivals at that juncture, drifted out several more paths in upper stretch under left-handed use of the crop, came back in
again after switching to right-handed correction, took aim and drove to the fore under strong hand-urging seventy yards from home and kicked clear. WANT
TO GO DANCING was bumped lightly at the start, coaxed forward to dictate the pace racing inside a pressing rival but just off the fence, edged clear turning
into upper stretch, drifted nearer the rail then back out in mid- to late-stretch and was outkicked. REMEMBEROLDTYMES settled outside in the back half of
the field, went mostly four wide on the turn drifting out a bit late on that bend, lugged in a couple paths in upper stretch, kept on willingly to secure show
honors by a narrow margin. PICTUREDAY JESSICA tracked mid-pack along the inside on or just off the rail, came out near the furlong marker to pass a
tiring rival three wide, was urged along but missed show honors. LEGAL STEPS bobbled into a rival at the start, pressed the leader three wide to the turn,
was given some rein to chase that one, lugged in to the rail in upper- to mid-stretch while weakening. BETTY'S PASSION was bumped into a rival at the
start and steadied just slightly, was under hold when in a bit tight between rivals two to three wide heading into the turn, came out four deep past the quarter
pole, failed to produce a bid. BIRD SAVVY was a bit reluctant to load, chased the leading pair going three wide into the turn, began to weaken late on that
bend and steadied slightly near the quarter pole when in tight quarters, was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEYOND BORDERS stalked the pacesetters while three wide on the turn, quickly collared the leader entering the final eighth and drew away handily.
PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ was between horses entering the five eighths pole where he was squeezed by the outside foe causing him to bump another
horse to his inside, ,kept position entering the turn and was roused while angling out widest in the stretch to run down the pacesetter late to get second.
DOCTOR WU engaged for the lead through the turn, put away that inside rival entering the stretch, then quickly was collared by the winner before the eighth
pole and tired late just missing second. I'M A CHI TOO came in while steadying at the five eighths pole, squeezing that inside foe who was between horses,
was asked while outside of horses on the turn and offered little through the lane. EXCEED was bumped and hit the rail around the five eighths pole causing
him to be steadied sharply, trailed after that incident and passed a tiring foe late. CINNAMONJAWBREAKER pressed for the early lead while inside of that
rival on the turn, gave way entering the stretch and faltered the final eighth. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, I'M A CHI TOO WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH BEHIND EXCEED FOR INTERFERENCE UP THE BACKSTRETCH.

Footnotes
SHES THE NORTH shifted in and tracked in behind the pacesetter going two then three wide on the turn, struck the lead at the quarter pole, kicked clear
and was kept to the task. ALPHA MIA was reluctant to load, in tight early and switched off the inside racing at the back of the pack and going two to three
wide into the turn, swung six wide turning for home advancing outside rivals, drifted in through upper stretch, was second best. LADY MAEVE (IRE) moved
to the rail soon after the start, tracked just off the leaders saving ground on the turn, lacked room in upper- to mid-stretch then altered out coming to the
furlong marker, was carried out a bit and continued to drift out late while fighting on to get up for show. ARRA GO WAN set the pace racing on or very near
the inside, drifted out a bit leaving the turn then back to the rail in upper stretch, could not kick on with the top ones and drifted out several paths late under
left-handed urging. CLEOMENES settled mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, came out for room in the stretch and brushed a rival while running on
evenly. PRACTICAL GIZMO settled well off the leaders, saved ground early on the turn, came out a path late on that bend, was guided further out to be five
wide by late stretch seeking room and ran on. LETS RUN TWO brushed with a rival and was in a bit tight at the start, encouraged forward between foes to
pursue mid-pack, went two wide on the turn, ran on evenly. VESPOLINA was taken back and angled in early content to settled off the leaders and outside,
was three wide on the turn, moved out five wide in upper stretch, was brushed later in the stretch and failed to threaten. BLONDEONAMISSION broke
inwardly and brushed with a rival, raced well back between foes and was in a bit tight on heels two to three wide on the turn, angled six wide turning for
home and failed to produce a bid. ICE FLOE stalked three to four wide on the turn, began to weaken and lugged in once in upper stretch then dropped back
while tired.

Footnotes
PENETANGUISHENE tracked the leader through the first half, took command at the three sixteenth pole and easy drew away in the late stages. NICE
COMPANY rated back in the beginning, rallied while saving ground through the turn and finished well to get up late for the place award. SOMEONE ELSE
set the fractions early, was headed entering the stretch and ran on willingly just missing second. MORE SAVVY was ridden through the turn on the rail and
finshed up evenly for a minor share. FINDING PERFECTION was widest throughout and never factored. LIME loomed up while five wide entering the
stretch only to stall the final eighth. COCOTARA was roused while four wide on the turn and offered nothing through the stretch.

RACING IN THE RAIN was in tight in behind a rival early while forced in a bit, advanced three to four wide on the turn, took a narrow lead just at the furlong
marker, was clear at the sixteenth and just lasted. MT LOGAN broke in and bumped with a rival at the start and spotted the field a length, recovered to move
up inside but was forced in at the gap, tracked on or just off the rail in behind, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out five wide past the furlong marker,
rallied strongly at that point but just missed. BEAU GUEST exchanged a bump at the break then was coaxed forward inside to set the pace, raced on or just
off the rail, was challenged in upper stretch, kept on to preserve show honors. CEREBRO was loaded riderless, guided nearer the inside early to stalk two to
three wide, made a mild bid at the five-sixteenths but could not sustain the effort once in late stretch. RED MERCURY switched outside foes early content to
trail racing off the inside, went three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five to six wide and failed to rally. FLAWLESS RULER was forced in a
bit clearing the gap, raced between foes two wide, was asked for more three furlongs out but had no response and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME KNIGHT tracked between horses early, was shuffled back mid turn and had to wait for room entering the stretch, found the rail path opening and
gamely rallied to get up for the win late. ROCKSTAR RO stalked the speed outside early, loomed up while three wide to contend for the lead entering the
stretch , took command at the eighth pole but could not hold off a rallying winner up the rail. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH was checked briefly at the seven
sixteenth pole while on the rail, roused and angled out for the stretch run and ran willingly to get up for third. JIBARO showed good early speed, was
collared on both sides at the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. HEAT MERCHANT was checked while between horses at the seven sixteenth
pole, shuffled back through the turn and showed some interest late. FEELTHEBEAT tracked the leader on the turn and faded through the field down the
lane.

Footnotes
GENDRAGON rated in behind the leaders early, moved out from three to five wide on the turn commencing a bid, took over outside the three-sixteenths,
drifted in through the stretch while clear. BEYOND MY DREAMS exchanged a bump at the start, was forced out wide in the early going, went five to six
deep and outside rivals on the turn, fought to secure the place. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON moved out early while forwardly-positioned, dropped back a bit
heading to the turn stalking between rivals, went four wide on the turn cutting inside the drifting leader coming out of that bend, was outfinished for place.
SIR GRAYVENSCROFT exchanged a bump at the start, settled at the rear, advanced some two wide on the turn, found room between rivals at the top of
the stretch, evened out late to settle for the minor award. BLUE SNOW set the pace racing well off the inside, was joined by a pressuring outside rival up the
backstretch, shifted in on the turn, gave way. HEY MICKEY moved out off the inside early racing last but one then back nearer the rail into the turn, came
out again in upper stretch and failed to rally. WHEN WE CONNECT made an early advance between rivals to press the pace under some mild
encouragement, moved in from four to three wide on the turn, faltered and was eased nearing the wire.
