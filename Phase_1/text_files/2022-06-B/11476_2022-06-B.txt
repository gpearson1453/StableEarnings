Footnotes
CARMEN O'ELECTRA quick to the lead, collard eighth pole, dug in gamely and came back in the final furlong under stout handling. EIDA'S STORM just off
top pair to far turn, angled out to lead, outkicked late. SEQUAYA raced off rail throughout with no late gain in the stretch run. MISS HATTIE broke awkwardly
from the gate, never a menace with a wide trip. RUBYINTHESTARS chased winner to the half, could not keep up and faded stretch.

AUTHORITARIAN unhurried to far turn, rallied strongly, clear stretch held sway. PERFECT PAINTING no speed to far turn, late run from quarter pole,
coming on too late. AGENT COOPER speed from outside, led to deep stretch, gave way grudgingly. BAD BOY E. J. raced evenly throughout with no late
response in the drive. TRADEOFF chased leader to far turn, could not keep up, faltered late. MONKEY ZONE no speed to far turn, passed tired ones late.
SONIC BURN failed to menace. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE close up inside to quarter pole, backed up in the stretch run. FARZIN good position to far turn,
nothing left, faded. BLACKSMITH STRONG had a steady fade. SAVING MAMA never a factor. OSMI SLEW through after half, stopped. Number 5 Perfect
Timing ran for purse money only, no wagering was taken on this entry. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
