SOMEKINDAFUHRY never far back, closed willingly four wide on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead at the furlong marker and proved best
under brisk handling. KINGDOM DIAMOND trailed for a half, swung wide, rallied determinedly and got up for second. DEXQUIRE broke in front, set the
pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. RACIN' JACIN settled within striking distance, loomed boldly along the inside nearing the quarter pole then
came up empty. SCORZA vied for the lead three wide into the far turn then was used up. LITTLE BITA SMOKE pressed the pace along the inside for four
furlongs then gave way. EL MEZCALITO was through after a half.

Footnotes
TWO EAGLES battled for the lead three wide into the stretch and shook clear late under mild urging. KOLE MAN CAN allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied
determinedly in the six path through the stretch and finished well clear for second. DYNAMITE CLOUD hopped at the start, and passed tiring rivals in the
three path through deep stretch. BLUE MONARCH failed to menace. BUCKITITLEWAVE dueled for the lead between horses two wide into the stretch and
weakened late. CRAFTY CHIEF stalked the early pace and was through after a half. PRECIOUS JULES was outrun. FIREUPTHEJET matched strides for
the lead along the rail for a half then stopped. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2024-TDN-40, DATED 07/29/2024, TWO EAGLES
WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
