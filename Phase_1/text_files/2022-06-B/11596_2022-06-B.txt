Footnotes
NOBLE BEHAVIOR stalked the early pace, battled two wide through the far turn, took charge and drew off in the five path under strong handling.
GUCCISSIMO never far back, had a mild rally in the six path into the stretch and finished clear for second. SUPER VISION was shut off entering the first
turn causing his rider to check, angled out, surged to the lead two wide, alternated in setting and pressing the pace into the stretch and weakened late.
LUCKY ANDY close up for six furlongs, faltered in the stretch. ISTILLGOTIT lacked room along the rail into the first turn, checked, suffered a broken left
reign midway on the clubhouse turn, surged to the lead, drifted out to the outside rail before a half and lost contact with his field on the far turn.
TAMANRASSETT broke in front and angled inward into the first turn, stopped on the backstretch, pulled up in upper stretch and was walked off. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

then was no match for the winner. TIZ INDEPENDENCE pressed the pace three wide and finished with good courage. GOLDEN TEMPLE had a mild late
rally. BAD KARMA pressed the early pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set the pace past the quarter pole then weakened slightly. LITTLE BIRD
FLASH was outrun. QUARANTINA away alertly, set the early pace along the rail then was through after a half. LUCKY TO HAVE ME was never involved.

Footnotes
COMPANYS COMING pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, gained a narrow advantage, battled the balance of the trip and proved best in a game
effort. ULTRA RAYS allowed to settle, closed fast late five wide and just missed. NANCY'S LESLIE never far back, had a mild late rally along the rail for a
minor part. GONNABEGOOD sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. MAOILIN unhurried
early, swung wide and closed ground late six wide. SAMMY'S SISTER slow early, found her best stride late two wide. ONE GLAMOROUS GAL vied for the
lead four wide and went evenly. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE close up inside, faded in the stretch. SHEZ SHACKED UP pressed the pace along the inside through
the turn then weakened. MOTHERWELL was outrun.
