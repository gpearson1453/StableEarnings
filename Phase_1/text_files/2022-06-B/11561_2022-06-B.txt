VALID DECISION won the nod for the victory after dueling side by side from outset for command and trekking the two path through the bend. REACH THE
CIRCLE was outdueled in the final sixteenth after sharing the lead from outset as the inner rival of two abreast. BAPTISM established an inside stance
behind the pacesetting duo, led the second flight along the backstretch and through the turn while saving ground, and held the show but was no match for
top pair in the end. KID SLIPPER was unhurried along the backstretch, responded to urging nearing the turn, travelled wide around the bend, and finished
willingly to be gaining on leaders at the finish. R T C DERBY GIRL settled into the second flight, chased from between rivals, trekked the three path around
the bend and weakened in the final furlong. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
SWIFTY DAWN forced the early pace as the widest rival of all through the opening bend, was close up two wide along the backstretch, gained command
inside the quarter pole, saved ground at upper stretch and drew off in final furlong for a clear score. DA COACH'S WIFE stumbled at the start then rushed
up for first command, established a ground saving pose and maintained that line throughout but proved to be no match for runaway winner in the end.
SCORNED LOVER was unhurried from outset and established an inside position through the opening bend, was given the queue nearing the quarter pole
and rallied mildly in the closing stages to ear the show. RIVER BISCUIT pressed the early pace while travelling the two path, lost ground to pacesetter along
the backstretch, and faded in crucial stages. SING ONE FOR MAMA showed reserve and settled into the second flight through the opening turn, angled out
to a wide stance near the mid way point, rated widest of all at upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CONCRETE FINISHER showed reserve in the opening stages, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, angled out to three wide nearing the
quarter pole, locked into a three way duel at upper stretch and finished under a stiff drive to get the victory. CANDY BARON pressed the early pace from a
ground saving stance, angled out to the two path midway, closed th gap on the leader along the backstretch and briefly gained command before being
nipped at wire for the score. NOMOREMRNICEGUY rushed from outset and led the field by slightest advantage as the outer most of three abreast through
the opening bend, established a comfortable lead along the backstretch, tucked to the inside at upper stretch, locked into a three way duel and was
outdueled in final sixteenth. THE UNION FOREVER flashed early speed between rivals, trekked the three path all the way and tired in the crucial portion of
contest. WOODS OF CONGAREE lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a two path pose early and saving ground in late stages.

furlong, all while travelling wide. ACERTIVE MISS pressed the early pace from a two path stance, lost ground to front runners in final turn, and finished
evenly to hold the show. MARIA ELENA Y. G saved ground to no avail. HARPERS VISION was unhurried and trailed the field from outset.

Footnotes
TROY OUNCE stalked the early pace from a two path pose, was roused along the backstretch, gained command nearing the quarter pole then openend up
on the field in closing stages for a runaway score. TOWN DRUNK rushed from outset to lead the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance,
relished command along the backstretch then angled out and rallied back to secure the place. POP CULTURE travelled wide in the opening turn then
advanced on the front runner along the backstretch, led the second flight around the final bend and was nipped for the place by rallying rival. GOT MOJO
lacked a closing bid after settling in the three path in the early stages and travelling wide at upper stretch.

Footnotes
PERFECTOMUNDO hustled from outset to share early command while trekking three wide through the first turn, gained sole command along the
backstretch and kicked well clear in final furlong. SECRET PICASSO pressed the early pace as the widest of four rivals around the opening bend, tucked to
rail along the backstretch and closed the gap on leader, but proved to be no match for runaway winner in the end. FROGGY was squeezed back at the start,
trailed the field through the opening half, then earned the show with a strong rally along the rail in closing strides. FAMILIAR DREAM hustled from outset
and shared the early pace as the inside rival, gave way to a pair of foes near the quarter pole, trekked the three path at upper stretch and faded in the end.
CAPTAIN COMEBACK lacked a needed rally after settling in behind the early front runners and travelling widest at upper stretch. MAJOR GRIFFIN pressed
the early pace from between rivals, angled out entering the final bend but came up empty in closing stages.

Footnotes
J LOVE was unhurried from outset and trailed the field around the opening bend, travelled widest of all at the halfway point and circled all rivals for a last to
first victory. DOWNONDIXIEBEACH rushed from outset and gained first command while saving ground throughout but was unable to fend off the rally of
eventual winner in final furlong. VALENTINA LIL pressed the early pace from a two path stance, maintained that track along the backstretch, rated close up
between rivals at upper stretch and was outfinished in closing strides. SEXY RAGS showed reserve through the opening half while travelling wide then
finished willingly and improved placing with mild gain at the finish. ON A SHOESTRING saved ground to no avail. PURE SILK lacked a serious bid while
giving chase from an inside pose. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT settled into mid pack, trekked a wide path in the early stages, and weakened in the closing
strides. GOSPEL JOSY JAN trekked the three path and gave chase from third flight before stopping just inside the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TOAH pressed the early pace while tracking the two path through the opening half, gained command inside the quarter pole, and proved best in duel in final
furlong. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL rallied mid track to improve placing with a strong late kick after rating back early and trailing the field through the opening
half. STEELS ALL IN rushed from outset and led the field through the opening half while saving ground, locked into a duel at upper stretch, but was unable
to sustain the bid in final sixteenth. OKIE UNION settled into the second flight as the outermost rival of three abreast, maintained that track along the
backstretch, and lacked a closing kick to improve placing. OUR CORNERSTONE settled into mid pack, gave chase from a two path pose, and finished
evenly. YOU SEXY BOY lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a three wide pose in the early going and trekking four wide at upper stretch.
TRISTANS JOURNEY faded rapidly to end a ground saving trip.

Footnotes
OUTCASHED rushed from outset and never relished command while steadily widening the margin and zooming off from all rivals. GRANITO DE ORO
established a ground saving stance near the first call pole, chased the front runner from that pose, and finished a clear second behind tough winner. OLE
SOFTY travelled widest of all throughout and earned the show with a late rally. MAHOMEITE improved placing with late interest after being unhurried in the
opening half. ZIONITE lacked a rally to end a three path journey. HERE'S YOUR DRINK showed reserve and trailed the field through the first two calls
before passing tiring foes in the latter portion of contest. IDENTIFY rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance, led the second flight through the
first bend , then retreated in the closing stages. BORN TOUGH settled behind the front runners, trekked the two path and tired in final furlong.
