Footnotes
STOSH was bumped shortly after the break, stalked the early speed in hand from outside, took over three wide when allowed on the turn, angled in some
as he drew clear leaving the bend, widened command inside the last furlong and kept CACHACO at bay under steady handling. CACHACO drifted out
some just after the start, bumped STOSH, vied for the early lead from inside, was caught in tight quarters with three furlongs to go, steadied slightly near the
five-sixteenths marker, altered to the outside, gained second upper stretch then could only pull away for the place late. BEE HAPPY ATTACK broke on top,
was hustled to stay at the fore, soon challenged from inside, challenged from outside as well into the turn and began to yield after four furlongs.

Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY was hustled from the gate then allowed to relax from along the rail on the backstretch, roused again leaving the second turn and
maintained full control under steady urging in the stretch. DRAW THE LINE gradually progressed from outside to move clear for second two wide on the
second bend, angled in some midstretch and could only hold his position late. TOCCETIVE JAC rated at the back through the early going, was put to urging
three wide on the second turn, gained third and a striking position upper stretch then pulled away for the show the last eighth without closing the gap much
on the leader. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced in contention from inside for six furlongs, began to yield after that, angled out for a clear path midstretch and
continued to fade. CHERNYAHOVSKIY helped prompt the pace from between horses but began to fade two wide before finishing six furlongs. Due to a
timing malfunction, the mile fraction is not available.

Footnotes
CRAPS SHOOTER broke on top, was rated between rivals, took the lead two wide into the bend, moved clear when asked entering the lane then steadily
opened up on the rest while kept to urging until the last seventy yards. FUTURE VISION prominent between horses, was blocked two wide with two furlongs
to go, altered outside WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE for the stretch run and caught that one for second near the seventy yard marker. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE
was inattentive in the gate and had his head turned when the gate opened, advanced from outside to vie for the lead three wide on the turn, proved no
match for CRAPS SHOOTER in the stretch and began to wear down inside the last furlong. EVIDENCE raced in contention from inside on the backstretch
but began to yield with three furlongs left. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing four furlongs.
ROUGH JUSTICE soon trailed, stayed off the inside and was never a factor.

DANG IT CASSIE rated off the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the second turn, edged ahead entering the lane then held on under steady urging.
READY REDDING raced in contention from inside for more than a half mile, did not keep up on the second bend, swung out on that turn, came four wide
into the stretch, made a strong move the final furlong, came up short but caught SHOBIZ STAR for second near the wire. SHOBIZ STAR sent to get a clear
early lead and the inside, was challenged on the second bend, never relented in the lane but did not have enough left deep stretch. JOEY B forwardly
placed from outside, was three wide on the second turn then gradually wore down for the drive. MR. LUV MAKER failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly and sprinted clear of the rest, was challenged from outside on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, responded to
hand urging to move clear again upper stretch and held sway. IMAGINE GOLD settled early, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, was crowded and
bumped a time or two leaving the bend, rallied the final furlong, took over second inside the final sixteenth but was too late to catch BOBBIE TOO TOO.
SENORITA AURORA in midpack on the backstretch, also started her bid into the turn, was boxed in with two furlongs left, bumped with IMAGINE GOLD
trying to gain a clear path leaving the quarter pole, altered inside entering the lane, threatened with a furlong to go but leveled off in the waning yards.
SIMPLY FAST settled from outside, picked up her pace widest on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late.
RONAN soon trailed and moved to the inside, began to close the gap on the bend, swung out behind AH LEAH entering the lane, angled in for a clear path
inside the final furlong and also showed late interest. PRINCESS CONSUELA hesitated at the start, gained a striking position along the rail on the turn but
gave way the last two furlongs. AH LEAH was also tardy leaving the gate, rushed up between horses to race closest to BOBBIE TOO TOO, threatened
outside that one on the bend but gave way in the lane.

TETSU bumped a furlong from the gate, was kept in hand on the backstretch, roused four wide on the turn, took the lead upper stretch, drew clear under
hand urging inside the final eighth and was being wrapped up nearing the wire. FULL MAGAZINE prominent just off the inside, did not keep up between
rivals leaving the bend, altered outside TETSU upper stretch, rallied belatedly inside the last furlong but caught D'FEVER for second. D'FEVER soon
sprinted clear, floated out slightly entering the stretch and slowly wore down. TWO WORLDS void of speed, though hustled along, saved ground taking the
bend, rallied in the stretch, altered out some for a clear path just after entering the last eighth, closed well but was too late. TALIS PARK GRAD bumped
TETSU as he advanced in tight quarters near the five furlong pole, was three wide on the turn then flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
G CITY WARRIOR hesitated at the start, gradually progressed in hand from outside, was roused four wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane,
was under a drive the last furlong and began to draw clear in the waning yards. TOUCH BY FELICTY prominent from outside, vied for the lead three wide
on the bend, floated out some into the stretch, battled for the lead between rivals but did not have enough left in the late going. MISS LEARJET pressed the
early pace from between horses, gained a narrow advantage two wide nearing the end of a half mile then gradually wore down inside the last furlong.
HIDDEN FIGURE appeared to bobble at the break, chased from between foes, came into the lane from path four, angled out some for a clear path upper
stretch, weaved in and back out as she rallied midstretch and was lugging in late as she improved her position. LA GUERRERITA disputed the pace from
between horses, gained the rail early in the turn, fought in the stretch but began to wear down the final eighth. VIVA VIOLENCE well placed from inside,
came off the rail some on the turn and began to flatten out the last two furlongs. RUBY ROUND HERE broke outward, was quickly corrected by her rider,
chased from inside, angled out through the bend, came widest into the stretch and had no late bid. MEETMEINSTLOUIE broke on top and soon had the
inside, quit before finishing three furlongs and was allowed to coast through the lane.
